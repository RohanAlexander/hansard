Mr BOWEN,BILLS," Australia needs budget repair, and it needs budget repair which is fair. That is what this bill will deliver after government amendments are moved which reflect the agreement between the Labor Party and the government. This bill will deliver $6.3 billion of savings to the budget bottom line over the next four years. Of course, originally the government said that it would deliver $6.5 billion, then it became $6.1 billion, then the member for Rankin found a little $107 million problem in the bill, which brought it below $6 billion; but the arrangements entered into by the government and the opposition, thanks to some stipulations put on this by the opposition, now see the savings delivered rise back to $6.3 billion. These savings reflect policies which have been aired in the recent federal election. I will not go through all the details, but I will just take one example: the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The Labor Party took a very comprehensive renewable energy policy to the election. It was a very comprehensive and robust policy in relation to renewable energy targets and proper investments in renewable energy. We had the change to ARENA funding as part of that overall picture. The government has brought in the cut but not the good parts of the policy-not the renewable energy targets, not the investments. So it has been necessary for the opposition to work with the government to deliver the same savings but in a way which reflects the reality that this government is in office and will not be engaging in good renewable energy policies. This is the context for this debate. As I said, I understand that the government will move amendments which reflect the arrangements entered into by the government and us. They will reflect primarily changes to ARENA funding. The government was proposing a $1.3 billion  cut. We are very pleased that it has been agreed that $800 million will be put back into ARENA. ARENA is a very important organisation for our nation's future and for our investment in renewable energy. Australia can and should be a leader in renewable energy, and ARENA has a very important part to play in that. We know that the government has previously tried to abolish ARENA. This is a significant change, which sees $800 million put back into ARENA. Of course that is a reduction in funding, but, as ARENA has made clear, it enables it to continue with its job. It is the investment that it needs to continue with its job. In addition, a process has been agreed by which the Minister for the Environment and Energy will meet with the shadow minister for climate change, the member for Port Adelaide, to discuss the profile of remaining funds over the forward estimates and a forward work program, and also, importantly, to establish whether there are opportunities for bipartisan agreement surrounding policies to accelerate the transition to modern and clean energy systems. There are other points. Of course, the government and the opposition disagree about dental care in Australia. The previous Labor government put in place a very good scheme. We want to protect that scheme. It is a scheme which works. The government has a different approach. I am pleased that the government has withdrawn, through its amendments, the changes to the dental scheme. We have agreed that there will be discussions between the minister and the shadow minister to assess other ways of finding savings. The government reserves the right to pursue its scheme under separate legislation and we, of course, reserve the right to oppose that. We, of course, reserve the right to defend the existing scheme, although we have indicated we do think there are savings which might be possible. The psychiatric confinement measure, which the Labor Party had actually opposed previously, we will continue to oppose. I am glad the government has withdrawn that from the bill. Then there is the change to the clean energy supplement. This is in relation to the government's plan to remove the clean energy supplement for all new recipients of a whole range of payments. We have made a very sensible proposal to the government that the clean energy supplement be withdrawn for new recipients of income which is additional income, not primary income-family tax benefit recipients and holders of the senior health card-but that we protect and defend the clean energy supplement for recipients of Newstart, the age pension, the disability support pension and other payments. This is appropriate. This is budget repair which is fair. This is not saying to Australia's unemployed people and Australia's age pensioners, 'All the burden is on you;' this is saying, however, 'We recognise that budget repair requires difficult decisions.' That is why, in order to ensure that we get a saving better than the one proposed by the government, we have agreed to remove the family tax benefit A supplements for families with income more than $80,000. Importantly, I am very pleased that the government accepted and agreed to Labor's insistence that the baby bonus not come back. The baby bonus is unsustainable in modern Australia, where we are talking about budget repair. The previous Labor government took the difficult decision to deal with it. Remember, when we first said that the baby bonus would only apply to firstborn children, that the then shadow Treasurer, the holder of my office, said it was akin to the one-child policy. That was their constructive approach to budget repair. It was akin to China; he said, 'It's just like the one-child policy.' He compared us to the Chinese communist party. Well, we take a more constructive approach. We are happy to say to the  Australian people, 'There are difficult decisions which are necessary for budget repair, and the baby bonus is one of them.' The Prime Minister can put it into his deal with the National Party all he likes, but this deal takes it out, because Australia should not have a baby bonus-it cannot be afforded. Whereas we have made our agreement with the government public, the agreement between the Liberal and National parties remains secret. That is a matter for them, but we have made public our agreement in a very transparent way which says the baby bonus will not come back. I am going to be brief today in the interests of the expeditious passage of this legislation through the House so it can get to the other place in an expeditious fashion and allow them the time to pass it, but I do want to say that the Labor Party has led the debate on budget repair and today we lead the way as well. We led the debate when it comes to superannuation. We announced our superannuation policy last April. The government and the now Treasurer railed around the country saying it was an unfair attack on the retirement incomes of Australians. The now Treasurer said he would never tax superannuation; he would never touch superannuation. Of course, on budget night, up he hopped to that dispatch box and launched an attack on superannuation. We have been consistent on superannuation, and a couple of weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition outlined our plans on superannuation, which avoid retrospectivity and raise another $1Â½ billion for the budget, a more fiscally responsible plan than the one the Treasurer in office has. So we are prepared to help the government out of its mess on superannuation. And there is more that can be done. If the government deals with the VET FEE-HELP rorts, we will help it with that. The Leader of the Opposition announced our policy in his budget reply-a very good policy; a fiscally responsible policy which cracks down on the rorts. The government should take it up and the government should talk to us about expeditious passage through the parliament. Private health insurance rebates can be fixed as well. We announced our policy in the election. It can be done. If the government chooses to do what it did on this omnibus legislation, there is more that can be done. We can fix VET FEE-HELP; we can fix the private health insurance rebate-and we can fix superannuation, as well, and the mess that this government has created. So, just as we have led the debate, we have led the way. I do, in all seriousness, want to thank the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance for their engagement in this debate. I want to thank all my colleagues on this side, particularly the member for Rankin, the shadow minister for finance, who has been a very good contributor and a very good source of advice and counsel to me during this process, and the members for Ballarat, Jagajaga and Port Adelaide, who have also made very important contributions to a good result-here comes the member for Jagajaga to receive the accolades that are her due. I want to thank my colleagues for what has been a good process. I commend the legislation to the House and I commend its expeditious process through the House.",19
Ms PLIBERSEK,BILLS," I also rise to make some comments on the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. This is a piece of proposed legislation in our parliament, worked on across the government and the opposition, that has, indeed, led to a much better outcome than if we had accepted the government's original proposals in this omnibus bill. The fact that we have taken some time-some weeks-and worked constructively to find not just the savings that the government initially  proposed but larger savings than the savings that the government proposed shows that, with cooperation and constructive engagement, we can not only find measures to repair the budget but do it in a fairer way that is in line with Labor values. We know that it is important to find savings over time and to reduce spending. This government have added $100 billion to net debt. They have tripled the deficit. We are at risk of losing our AAA credit rating, which affects our ability to invest in the things that we care about in the future-in health, in education, in infrastructure and in all of the things that make our society and our economy stronger. I want to pay tribute to our shadow Treasurer, our current shadow finance spokesperson and our former shadow spokesperson-Chris Bowen, Jim Chalmers and Tony Burke-for the very disciplined and methodical way they have gone about finding savings here. But I want to spend a minute also talking about our spokesperson for family and community services, the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, who, during her time in government and in opposition, has had probably the biggest impact on social policy in this country of any person in the last century or this century, with the new programs she has constructed like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the funding that she has found to support those programs and, most particularly, in recent weeks, the fact that she has managed to find savings that protect the poorest and most vulnerable people-those going onto Newstart, pensions, age pensions, disability payments and other allowances-to protect them from the cuts that this government proposed. These are people who are just making it now. The idea that we would actually cut support for these people in the future is a sign of how heartless this government is. I am proud to be a colleague of the member for Jagajaga and proud of the work that she has done methodically over many months to find a better, fairer package of savings. I also want to pay particular tribute to our health shadow, Catherine King, who has managed to fight off the attack on the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. This is an appalling policy from the government. The Minister for Health and Aged Care says that this is an under-utilised scheme. I would like to ask her: what advertising and promotion of this scheme has she ever done? It is like the secret scheme that the government does not want your children to find out about. The shadow health minister has done a fantastic job of ensuring that this is not included in our program. I just want to make a few very brief comments about the higher education measures in this omnibus bill. We did take some difficult decisions before the last election as part of our budget repair strategy. We did that in the context of Labor investing an extra $13 billion in higher education. We will always oppose $100,000 university degrees, we will always oppose deregulation of the university sector and we will continue to oppose the more than $3 billion of zombie measures that are still there from the 2014 budget because we believe a stronger and better-funded higher education sector is not just critical for our individual students but is absolutely critical for the wealth, the productivity, the economic strength and the growth of our nation. So we will continue to fight $100,000 degrees and we will continue to fight the cuts that are still there-the 20 per cent cuts that the government continues to propose which are left over from the 2014 budget. That is an important thing to remember. I want to finish by saying that as well as protecting the most vulnerable people in this omnibus bill, we have also protected something else that is fundamental to our values set, and  that is our commitment to reducing carbon pollution and reducing carbon emissions. Mark Butler, our shadow environment and energy spokesperson, should be proud of the fact that he is the man who saved ARENA.",21
Ms MACKLIN,BILLS," I am very pleased to be able to speak on the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill. I think it is true to say that our cautious and careful approach in looking at this bill has been justified. We have looked at all of the measures through the lens of our Labor values. I will not talk on all of the issues that are in the bill; I will just concentrate on those that have been most significant to me, particularly in making sure that we protect the most vulnerable Australians. We do have some very serious reservations with some of the measures that were proposed in the original bill. Most significantly, Labor does not support the abolition of the clean energy supplement that goes to pensioners, people with disability, carers, job seekers and many others. Labor also does not support cuts to people in psychiatric confinement. Others will talk about the scale of cuts to ARENA. After negotiations with the government-I want to particularly thank Chris Bowen and Jim Chalmers-we have reached an agreement to have these measures amended or in some cases removed from the bill that is currently before the parliament. My primary objective has been to protect the most vulnerable Australians, and I am very pleased to say that we have done so. We on the Labor side do believe in budget repair that is fair. We believe that the budget bottom line can be fixed without making cuts to the most vulnerable Australians. The task of fiscal repair must not fall on those who have the least to give. We support sensible reforms when they do align with Labor values, and cutting the energy supplement to pensioners, carers, people with disability and the unemployed does not align with Labor values. We certainly do not accept that these people-pensioners, people with disability and the unemployed-should be forced to accept cuts in the budget while the government gives $50 billion away in tax cuts to big business. Given the time, I will not go through the detailed history of the clean energy supplement. I will just emphasise the impact of this cut if it is ever to go through this parliament. It certainly will not go through with our support. The analysis shows that a single mother on Newstart would be $4.40 a week or $220 a year worse off. A pensioner couple would be around $8 a week or $550 a year worse off. It cannot be argued that it is fair to take $220 a year from someone who is unemployed, and it cannot be argued that it is fair to take $550 a year from an old age pensioner couple. The government has suggested that they may bring back the cuts to the energy supplement in a new bill. If they do, Labor will oppose it. We will protect these vulnerable people. I want to really emphasise that there is no more vulnerable group in Australia than those living on Newstart. We already indicated before the election that we believe the Newstart allowance is already too low. It is equivalent to just 28 per cent of the average wage, and as a consequence of the low rate of Newstart many recipients of unemployment benefits are living in poverty. That is nearly 800,000 Australians. So it is a large number of people living on a very low incomes and, of course, that very much goes to our decision to oppose any further cuts as proposed by the abolition of the clean energy supplement. We even have the Business Council of Australia saying that the rate of Newstart allowance for jobseekers no longer meets  a reasonable community standard of adequacy, and of course there are many others in the community who take the same view. Newstart is clearly not the safety net that it is supposed to be; it is neither keeping people out of poverty nor providing them with the financial resources they need to look for and find work, so cutting the energy supplement from Newstart would have made an already bad situation even worse. It is bad public policy, it threatens to entrench disadvantage and inequality in this country and it is something that the Australian Labor Party cannot support. We cannot accept that it is fair to cut a payment that is widely recognised as already being below the poverty line. Labor took a policy to the last election to review the adequacy of the Newstart allowance. We think that is the place the government should start, not to cut this already very low payment. The original omnibus bill also included a measure that Labor has opposed in the past and will continue to oppose. The government wants to take income support payments away from people in psychiatric confinement who are charged with a serious offence and who are undergoing a course of rehabilitation. This would apply to people who have been found to be suffering with very serious mental health issues like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, intellectual disabilities, acquired brain injuries and so on. We do not believe the government's proposal is good policy and we are concerned that this cut would jeopardise the mental health support that people currently receive from state governments. We have opposed this in the past. I am pleased that it is going to be removed from this legislation, but the government should actually take this proposal out of the parliament altogether. Just to summarise, I do want to emphasise again that the difficult decisions that we have had to make to get to where we are today have really been led by Bill Shorten. He really has shown that Labor is taking an approach to fairness that is serious-that he is going to make sure that the most disadvantaged people in our country are protected. I want to thank him for his leadership. It is not easy to find the savings that we have. We understand that many families are doing it tough, but I do appreciate the way in which he, Chris Bowen and Jim Chalmers",23
The SPEAKER,BILLS,I would just ask the member for Jagajaga to refer to members by their correct titles.,24
Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,Sorry-all of those colleagues of mine,24
The SPEAKER,BILLS,"I know she is not trying to be difficult, but I am going to be pulling members up on this.",24
Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,That is fair enough. I am,24
The SPEAKER,BILLS,Bad habits are going to be eradicated!,24
Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,"It is not a bad habit, Mr Speaker; I was trying to be a bit more personal.",24
The SPEAKER,BILLS,But operate within the standing orders. I am sorry you find them impersonal!,24
Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will do it. I think that the Leader of the Opposition has really shown just how important it is to stand up for those who need it most. That is why so many of us were elected to this place-particularly to stand up for those who are the most vulnerable-and he has done that.  We are, of course, also concerned about the Turnbull government's continuing determination to further cut family payments. That will hurt around 1.1 million families in this country and in some cases take thousands of dollars out of the pockets of lowand middle-income families. Labor have made it clear that for those families earning under $80,000 a year in family income we will not agree to any cuts to their family tax benefit A or B end-of-year supplements. It is not fair and, as the Leader of the Opposition has indicated in the past, we will continue to stand up for those families. I think that is the most important message that I have for the government. We will continue to stand up for vulnerable Australians. That is why we are here. We have done so by securing very important amendments to this bill. Should the government reintroduce legislation to cut family payments further, especially to low-income families, Labor will oppose it and we will oppose any further effort by the government to remove the energy supplement from pensioners, people with disability, carers or the unemployed. We will do everything we can to support the needs of those we have come here to support.",24
Mr BUTLER,BILLS," Three years ago, Australia was riding high in the transition to a cleaner energy system. Over the period of the last Labor government, wind power tripled in this country. The number of jobs in the renewable energy industry tripled during a period that included the global financial crisis. The number of households with rooftop solar soared from just 7,400 when we came to government to over 1.2 million when we left government in 2013. In our last year of government, we approved the largest wind farm in the Southern Hemisphere and the largest PV solar farm in the Southern Hemisphere. Unsurprisingly, the leading global business index in renewables, the Ernst & Young renewable energy country attractiveness index, rated Australia in 2013 as the fourth most attractive destination for renewables investment in the world, up there with China, the United States and Germany. Over the past three years, though, this industry has endured attack after attack, and each of those attacks has been seen off by the Labor Party. In 2014 and 2015, the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, went after the renewable energy target, in spite of promising at the 2010 and 2013 elections to keep the RET in place. The Labor Party saw off that attack. The then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, tried to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation on a number of occasions, and again the Labor Party saw off those attacks. In the latest attack, we have seen this government seek to abolish the entire budget of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, a move that would see it remain as nothing more than a shell, and with this bill, the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016, Labor has seen off that attack as well. This bill saves ARENA; thank you to the strong advocacy of the Labor Party and many other stakeholders and other members in this place as well. As the shadow minister for social services has done, I want to acknowledge particularly the leadership of the Labor leader and the Labor deputy leader but also the sheer hard work of the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister, who is new to his role but is a person who has a strong commitment to climate change and energy policy. This work reflects our unshakeable commitment to ensure that, through this period of a government which, it would appear, does not support a transition to clean energy, the renewable energy industry is able to survive and do whatever it can so  that, when a government returns that does have strong clean energy policies, it can get back to the position it was in in 2013. This bill secures an additional $800 million over five years in grants. This is additional to the more than 200 existing projects that ARENA is already auspicing and additional to the 12 large PV solar projects that were announced by ARENA last week but are not yet contracted. ARENA has stated that this sum, $800 million over five years, will provide it with a budget that allows it to continue a strong work program into the future. As part of the agreement underlying this bill, the government has agreed to sit down with the opposition to ensure that our priorities are satisfied-those priorities being, first of all, to ensure that the ARENA budget preserves Australia's world-class, leading research and innovation capability, particularly seen in our universities and CSIRO, and also to ensure that there is a budget for demonstrational proof-of-concept stage developments in the industry. The protection of our research budget in this industry is Labor's first priority and I want to particularly mark out a couple of major contributions by members of the Labor caucus. The member for Kingsford Smith is lucky enough to represent an electorate which includes the University of New South Wales. At that university the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics for years now has been the world-leading research institution in solar PV. This bill secures ACAP's ability to continue their world-leading work. The member for Fenner has strongly advocated for the interests of the Australian National University, which partners with UNSW and a number of other universities around Australia, making sure that Australia leads the transition around the world to solar PV. The member for Newcastle has been strongly advocating for the work that CSIRO's Energy Centre in Newcastle does as a leading institution in the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative, an initiative that includes universities and a number of other institutions not just here in Australia but in the US as well. In addition to securing our research capability, this agreement between the opposition and the government will also allow ARENA to support demonstration and proof-of-concept stage developments in this industry that ensure that the findings by those universities and by CSIRO scientists are able to be shown to be commercially viable and are then able to be presented to lending and equity investors and become a reality across the Australian landscape. It is also important to point out that there is no change-no reduction at all-to the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation Fund that is overseen by that very expert board at the CEFC. The final matter I quickly want to allude to is that there was also a commitment made by this government as part of this agreement to sit down with the opposition and explore opportunities for bipartisan agreement around policies that would accelerate the transition for Australia to a modern clean energy system and to ensure that that transition is, to use the words of the Paris agreement, 'a just transition for workers and impacted communities'. We know through experience that there really is no democracy across the world that has a serious, enduring climate policy framework that is not underpinned by a strong level of bipartisan agreement. For three parliaments now, we have not been able to find that bipartisan agreement in this policy area. I point out that the Australian Climate Roundtable has been strongly advocating for this approach that we have achieved through this agreement. The round-table includes organisations as diverse as the Australian Aluminium Council, the Australian Industry Group, the Climate Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Business Council of Australia, WWF Australia, ACOSS, the Energy Supply Association, the  ACTU and the Investor Group on Climate Change. It will not be an easy discussion between the government and the opposition, but the opposition will come to the table on those discussions with constructive goodwill. I commend the bill to the House. Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (10:02): I too rise to join my colleagues in supporting the now amended Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. At the outset, I particularly want to acknowledge the strong leadership on our side of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister and my colleagues in the areas of family payments and environment, who have all worked very hard to ensure that we do support budget repair that is necessary and that we do so in a way that is fair. We have always said that this exercise should not come at the expense of cutting payments for some of the most vulnerable families in this country. I am particularly pleased that Labor was able to fight so hard to have the axing of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and the National Partnership Agreement on Adult Public Dental Services removed. The government will have a significant fight on its hands if it attempts to abolish the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. It is a schedule that has assisted one million children already and it is providing dental services every two years, with a very strong focus on prevention. The government's own Department of Health has said that this is a very successful program, with the only failing being the government's failure to actually promote it to parents. We also very strongly believe that the National Partnership Agreement on Adult Public Dental Services-the initiative that Labor in fact put in place-has also been important in treating an extra 400,000 adults through the public dental scheme. The government's proposal to scrap both of these schemes and replace it with a scheme which, frankly, would see five million children added to the already long public dental waiting list is an absolute farce and not something that anyone in the sector supports. The National Oral Health Alliance has basically said that, if the government has its way with its scheme, people will be getting one treatment every 17 years, or it would be $40 per patient, according to the government's own rhetoric about how many people are now to be eligible under the scheme-$40 per year for their care-which is an absolute joke. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association have, arguably, also said that it will add significantly to public dental waiting lists. I am very proud that Labor have fought hard to protect a scheme that we established-a scheme that was put in place to ensure that we would have good oral health into the future. We already have over 42 per cent of children under the age of five experiencing decay in their baby teeth and some 62 per cent of nine-year-olds experiencing decay in their baby teeth. We know that 20,000 children are hospitalised each year because of tooth decay that is avoidable. This scheme is working. It is a scheme that is important, and it is one that Labor is very proud to have stood up to this government on in this bill.",25
Dr CHALMERS,BILLS," I am very pleased and very proud to support what will be a far superior version of the omnibus bill than the one that it will replace. The Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016 is superior because it is bigger, in terms of savings, and infinitely fairer, and it also ensures that we are investing in the future, as it relates to renewable energy.  We have been saying for some time that the bill that we support in this place will reflect the quantum of savings we took to the election, be consistent with our values, as it relates to things like protecting the vulnerable-people on Newstart and the like-and also invest in renewable energy, particularly with what we have been able to achieve through the ARENA part of the bill. This bill is also infinitely superior because of the leadership provided by the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, who has done an outstanding job in leading a team which has made this bill fairer than it otherwise would have been. It is a superior bill because of the consultation that has taken place with good people in the community and with peak groups like ACOSS and LEAN-the Labor Environmental Action Network-an organisation I am proud to be a patron of in Queensland. This bill is infinitely superior because of the consideration of the colleagues in our broader caucus-the people that the member for Port Adelaide ran through. There are many people on this side of the House with a view on this bill who have encouraged and allowed us to get to this far superior outcome. It is a better bill because of the work done by the member for MCMahon, the member for Sydney, the member for Jagajaga, the member for Port Adelaide, the member for Ballaratall of the colleagues in the shadow cabinet. The member for Port Adelaide mentioned I am new to the shadow cabinet-I have only been there five minutes or so-but I am very pleased to see the way that the team worked together so effectively under the member for Maribyrnong's leadership. He and all of his colleagues here did such an extraordinary job making this bill infinitely superior to the one that it will replace. What we have shown on this side of the House is that budget repair can be fair. It can be in the finest traditions of the Labor Party. It can stand up for the vulnerable people in our community and not ask them to carry the can when it comes to budget repair in this country. What we did on this side of the House was seize the initiative, because something needed to be done about the mess that the budget is in. Debt has blown out by more than $100 billion under the watch of those opposite. The deficit has tripled since that disastrous 2014 budget-and, perhaps most importantly, our coveted, hard-won AAA credit rating is in serious jeopardy. We on this side of the House will do what we can to defend that AAA credit rating. If we lose it, it will be on the heads of those opposite, because we are playing such a constructive role, helping them out of the mess that they have created in the budget. In the absence of the economic leadership that was promised a year ago by the member for Wentworth but which never eventuated, we will continue to take that initiative. There are fairer savings in this bill-that is true-but there are more where they come from. There are more savings of this nature that add up to budget repair that is fair. There is more to be done in private health insurance. There is more to be done in capping the VET FEE-HELP arrangements. We have offered a constructive way out of this humiliating impasse that those opposite have come to on superannuation. We invite them to pick up these fair savings and to run with them. They can have the credit for them. They should build them into the budget. We call on  them to do that so that we can continue to fix their budget mess in a fair way-a way that does not ask the most vulnerable people to carry the can. If they are serious about defending the AAA credit rating and they are serious about improving the budget bottom line, they should abandon the $50 billion tax giveaway to big, multinational corporations in this country. That is the biggest piece of fiscal vandalism on the table at the moment-$50 billion out of our schools and hospitals and into the pockets, onto the bottom lines and into the profits of the biggest companies in Australia at a time when the country cannot afford it. There is a right way and a wrong way to fix the budget. The wrong way is to lecture people about moral responsibility while you give $50 billion away when the country cannot afford it. The wrong way is to ask the most vulnerable people to do the heaviest lifting. But there is a right way. We are proud of what has been achieved here in this omnibus bill because it is the right way. It is a bigger savings package than the one contemplated in the original bill. It is infinitely fairer than the one it replaced and it invests in renewables. This side of the House has shown again that we can make concessions, we can consult and we can negotiate with the government. I again want to pay special tribute to the member for MCMahon for doing the negotiations from our point of view, as he carried that duty from our side of the House. But we have shown that, while we can make the concessions and do the consultations, we will not compromise our values. That is why what we are supporting here, when the bill is amended, is in the finest traditions of the Labor Party. It is a product of our shadow cabinet and our broader caucus that we can be proud of.",27
Mr ALBANESE,BILLS," I rise to support the amended Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. There is no doubt that the issue of budget repair needs to be dealt with. The government has tripled the deficit since it came into office. The fact is that the debt has increased since this government came into office, at a time when spending has not increased in terms of productivity-boosting expenditure such as investment in infrastructure. If, to boost future economic growth, that had occurred, then there might be some justification; but we know that in the first two years of this government public sector investment in infrastructure fell by some 20 per cent. We know that during the recent election campaign the government refused to commit to important congestion-busting investments like the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane, Metronet in Perth, the AdeLINK light rail project or Western Sydney rail. The fact is that issues around recurrent expenditure do have to be dealt with. They require tough decisions. I have been saying for some time that those tough decisions and Labor's position on them need to be determined on the basis of Labor values, on the basis of how these changes meet the fairness test. It is very clear that the government's earlier proposal to abolish the energy supplement for pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, recipients of Newstart and single parents was unfair. It was unfair on a range of measures. A range of compensation measures were put in place when the carbon price was implemented by the former Labor government. We dealt with the issue of the impact on the working poor by tripling the income-tax-free threshold. Middle-class people received income tax cuts. Companies received direct support for the transition to a carbon-constrained economy. As proposed by this government, all of those measures would stay in place. All of the middle-income and high-income earners would keep the tax cuts that were part of the compensation measures. The only people who would be  hit by the wind-back of those compensation measures were the poorest people in the community. What made it even worse was the fact that, as a result of the then Labor government not wanting double compensation, we discounted the next normal CPI increase for recipients of income security payments by the next CPI increase, which, of course, would have been impacted by the flow-on from the carbon price. So, in fact, these low-income earners would have been worse off in real terms than had the carbon price not been implemented, and that is why it was unfair to cut these payments by between $4 and $8 a week. That is bad macro-economic policy because, at a time where the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates in order to stimulate demand and to use monetary policy as a stimulus, it makes no sense for fiscal policy to work in the opposite direction. That is precisely what a cut to real incomes for the poorest people in our society would have done because these people spend all of their income, every dollar, on getting by from week to week. We know that Newstart is already too low. It is not just that people in this parliament suggest that; even the Business Council of Australia suggests that. That is why this clawback of compensation was unfair, and Chris Bowen, the Shadow Treasurer, and others-Jenny Macklin in particular, who always has looking after the most vulnerable in our community at the forefront of everything that she does-deserve credit for negotiating a proposition that can now receive the support of both sides of the parliament. To give the government due credit, the fact that they were prepared to be flexible deserves acknowledgement as well. We need to give people appropriate respect and not just regard people who are on low incomes and who are vulnerable as people who are expendable. If we do not give them a voice who will? It is the Labor Party that historically has stood up for those people and stood up for Labor values-and, once again, we have done this with this package today. I will also mention briefly the change to ARENA funding. As a result of the measures negotiated, ARENA will have an $800 million budget over the next five years to continue its important work. This is critical work. The promotion of renewables is consistent with Labor's position of 50 per cent renewables by 2030. We do not think this goes far enough, and it is important that there will be negotiations between the shadow minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energy in order to see if we can get further agreement in the shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewables that is so necessary. It is important to acknowledge that climate change is real. It is happening. The quicker we transition to a clean energy economy the cheaper that transition will be. Importantly, this will also support jobs, and the renewable energy sector has seen jobs triple in recent years. The work of ARENA is aimed particularly at early stage developments, and it is important that, as a result of this negotiated outcome, support for clean energy and the renewable sector has been ensured.",29
Mr BANDT,BILLS," Without amendments, the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016 is a bad bill because it attacks low-income earners and kids dental, and it is a bad bill with amendments because it attacks clean energy. At a time when we should be putting more money into clean energy, we are being asked to quickly pass through parliament a dirty deal done between Labor and Liberal that takes the axe to renewable energy. It is no excuse to say, 'Oh, well, somehow these cuts aren't as bad as they might have been.' Labor found it in its heart to say no to some of the measures but apparently not to all, because apparently it is okay to cut half a billion dollars out of renewable energy-which is what  Labor has just done. Apparently it is okay not to say no to the cuts to research and development, which is what Labor has just done. And apparently it is okay to give the green light to cuts to student support, to aged care, to newly-arrived migrants and to student scholarships, because that is what Labor has just done. We have been saying for some time, as the Greens, that we need to secure this country's revenue base. If we want to fund the services that Australians rightly expect and to invest more in clean energy then, yes, we need to find the money from somewhere. The question is: where do you find it from? At the moment we spend several billion dollars a year just so that the likes of Gina Rinehart can put cheap diesel into trucks on their mining sites. We give a tax break to the very wealthy in sectors that, frankly, do not need it. By removing one simple measure, by saying to the likes of Gina Rinehart, 'You should pay the same tax on your diesel as everyone else in this country pays on their petrol,' we could have raised three times as much as the saving in this package. That is the kind of spine that Labor could have shown to the government, because that is what the Greens have said to the government. This package is not the right way to balance the budget, because in 2016 there are fairer and better ways of balancing the budget than taking the money from clean energy, or taking the money from students or taking the money from newly arrived migrants. But no: Labor has said, 'We are happy to rip half a billion dollars out of world-leading renewable energy research in this country.' Let us talk about ARENA. What is ARENA? The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is something that was set up by the Greens and Labor in the power-sharing parliament back in 2010. Its job is to take new and innovative projects in the renewable energy space. One might be the printable solar cells that they are developing, where you can print solar cells onto surfaces as diverse as banknotes or fabric. You can print them straight onto corrugated iron so that your roof becomes a solar panel-you do not need to put a solar panel on your roof; the roof is the solar panel. That is the kind of thing that ARENA funds. ARENA looks at battery technology and says, 'How can we make sure that instead of building new coal fired power stations we can put batteries into businesses and households and make those affordable so that we can store the power that our solar panels generate during the day and save it overnight?' That is the kind of thing that ARENA does. ARENA also says, 'Let's look at some of these large-scale solar projects that can now, and will be able to in the future, replace coal fired power stations.' That is what ARENA does. It gives money to projects that are in an early stage so that they can prove themselves and then become commercial and viable in their own right. That is exactly the kind of thing we should be doing, and it is exactly what Australians want government money to be spent on. The government says, 'Well, we don't like that. We want to rip over a billion dollars out of it.' And Labor says, 'Well, we kind of like it. Let's just only rip half a billion dollars out of it and call it a victory.' It is not a victory when you take half a billion dollars out of renewable energy. That is not a victory; that is handing a blank cheque to the government to gut renewable energy in this country. And the more that we find out about this dirty deal that Labor and the Liberals did yesterday the more we understand why they did not want to have a public inquiry into this bill-one of the very few instances that I can remember where Labor and Liberal have got together and said, 'There will be no public hearings into this bill. We don't want any sunlight  shone on it.' Well now we see why, because not only is half a billion dollars ripped out but it seems that almost all of that half a billion comes in the next three years. So on our analysis, of the $517 million that Labor has said they are going to give the government a blank cheque to cut, $514 million comes in the next three years. At the very time when this agency is saying, 'We need the money now to give confidence to the industry so that we can grow renewable energy projects and grow renewable energy jobs'-things like solar thermal in Port Augusta or large-scale wind farms just outside of Canberra-Labor signs up to a deal to gut half a billion dollars, almost all of the savings, in the next three years. That is the dirty deal that has been done, but it gets even worse-we have not even spoken about the con. No sooner had Labor signed up to this deal from the government than two government ministers go out yesterday afternoon and say, 'Actually it's all right because, yes, we've left $800 million in the ARENA bucket, but we're going to find that $800 million from another clean energy project.' Labor says, 'No, that wasn't the deal,' and the government says, 'Well, we're the government and that's what we're going to do.' Finance minister Cormann and energy minister Frydenberg said yesterday, 'We're going to offset this money that Labor has supposedly saved for ARENA by not spending it on another project over here in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.' So this amazing deal that has been done has allowed, in the government's mind, no net change. You have not saved renewable energy, Labor; you have helped kill it. If you had the courage to stand up and say, 'No cuts to some of the low-income earners'-not all, mind you; you are happy in this bill to take the axe to students and newly arrived migrants-why did you not have the courage to stand with the Greens and say, 'No cuts to renewable energy'? It is very, very easy, as Labor and Liberal are wont to do, to talk about bipartisanship and the benefit of it, but the only bipartisanship we are seeing is cuts. When it came to the question of renewable energy, Labor and Liberal agreed in the last parliament to cut the Renewable Energy Target. In most countries if you set yourself a target for renewable energy and you are on track to exceed it, you would see it as a sign of success. The government said, 'Oh, we've got too much renewable energy-it's doing more than we expected; we need to cut the target,' and Labor went and agreed with them. That was the first outbreak of bipartisanship: a cut to Australia's Renewable Energy Target. Now we are seeing another outbreak of bipartisanship where they are cutting the amount of money going to renewable energy in this country. When the climate groups and the country call out for bipartisanship on climate change they want more action to be taken, not less. It is very easy for Labor and Liberal to agree on cutting renewable energy; what is harder is getting Labor and Liberal to agree to put more money into renewable energy or to have higher targets and to get more renewable energy. So then we have these crawling words coming from Labor afterwards, suggesting, 'Oh, it's all right, we're going to have discussions with the minster and at some point in the future we might be able to get more money back into renewable energy.' The first thing the minister did after you signed this deal was go out with his finance minister and say, 'We're taking $800 million from somewhere else,' sending a strong message to their backbench: 'It's okay; we've conned Labor.' Labor has been conned. They have fallen for a pea-and-thimble trick, and you need look no further than the boasting of the finance minister and the energy minister to see that.  So what would it mean to have budget savings that come from the top end of town? We can start by saying: 'Maybe in our superannuation system, where it costs us $30 billion a year in tax breaks, most of which go to very wealthy top income earners, we do not need to be giving people on over $100,000 a tax break to save for their retirement at quite the same level as we have so far; let's wind that back a bit.' There is a few billion dollars a year. We have talked a bit about fuel tax credits before, but maybe we can say to wealthy mining companies, 'You do not need to get a tax break for accelerated depreciation of your property; you're doing all right, we think.' There is another couple of billion dollars. Maybe we could say to the big banks, 'You make world-leading record profits off the back of implicit subsidies that the IMF has valued at a couple of billion dollars a year.' The IMF-not the most left-wing organisation that I know of-has said: 'Australia gives the big four banks effectively a couple of billion dollars in subsidies every year. Maybe you should look at winding back some of it or charging them for it.' If you did that-if we stood up to the big banks-there is a couple of billion dollars a year. There are plenty of ways of finding money without hitting everyday Australians, but it requires the courage to stand up to the top end of town. It requires courage. That is what is remarkably lacking from this government, but you would expect that from this government because they do nothing more than the bidding of big business. But you would expect a bit more courage from Labor. You would expect Labor to say, 'Instead of taking money from students by taking the axe to student start-up scholarships or other forms of student support, maybe we will go after Gina Rinehart.' But, no, quite happily, despite all the bluff and bluster during the election campaign about Malcolm Turnbull being unfair, they have just agreed to Malcolm Turnbull's measures. And it is worse than that because many of those are Tony Abbott's measures.",30
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I remind the member to use correct titles please, as the Speaker said this morning.",33
Mr BANDT,BILLS,"Many of these measures are from the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott. These were the zombie measures that he could not get through the last parliament, because in the last parliament people had the courage to stand up to the former Prime Minister and say: 'No, the way that you are raising money is unfair. You should be taking it from those who can afford to pay, not those who can't.' We fended him off for a couple of years but, as soon as the election is out of the way, in the second week of parliament, what does the opposition do? They crawl over to the government benches and say: 'How can we sign up to some of those measures? We opposed them for a couple of years, but that was just for the election. Now that the election is out of the way, let's get on with it and sign up.' That is why they are trying to push this bill through with very short speeches from them, because they know in their hearts that they are signing up to measures that they fought for a very long time and for good reason. They know that they have taken the easy way out by cutting funds for renewable energy instead of winding back the subsidies that the likes of Gina Rinehart gets. We are calling them out. The Greens will not be supporting this bill. There are too many measures in this bill that attack those who cannot afford it. There are too many measures in this bill that attack clean energy and attack research and development at a time when we should be putting money into those areas. We will not be supporting this bill. I heard some talk from the opposition benches about having saved ARENA and I have explained why that  is not the case. In the detail stage of this bill, we will give the opposition a chance to actually do that. I will be moving an amendment to remove the cuts to ARENA, full stop. We can find the money from other places. So I urge the opposition to rethink their willingness to cut half a billion dollars out of renewable energy, because it is not too late. The money can be found from elsewhere. When I move the amendments, I hope that all those words about saving ARENA are put into practice, because we can do it right here, right now. It is a bad bill with or without amendments.",33
Mr WILKIE,BILLS," The Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016 is a blackhearted bill, and Labor are a pack of quislings for supporting it. Just when the opposition should act like an opposition and stand up for the community and the environment, it has rolled over to have its tummy tickled. It is terribly disappointing and it betrays a great many people who voted Labor. This is a black-hearted bill. Well may people come in here and talk about what a good bill it is. Well may the ALP come in here and say how they have amended it to ensure that it is a fair bill, but it is not. Indeed, it contains 20 of the 24 original measures. I will say that again: this bill contains 20 of the 24 original measures. It still cuts over half a billion dollars from ARENA. It abolishes the family tax benefit part A for some people. It cuts the supplement for new mothers. It cuts the energy supplement for some Centrelink recipients. It fails to clarify the future of dental care for the children of low-income families. Every way you look at this bill, it is not supportable, and I will not support it. I associate myself with the comments from the member for Melbourne, particularly on the environment and the effect of ARENA-I will come back to that in a moment. I will dwell on another issue that the member for Melbourne spoke about-that is, the other ways to repair the budget. I am the first to agree that we need to re-engineer the budget. We are spending more than we are earning. Our debt is increasing. It needs to be re-engineered and it needs to be put on a pathway to balance over the economic cycle. The question is how you balance the budget over the economic cycle. Do you go after the most disadvantaged people in the community? Do you attack the disadvantaged, those on low incomes and the people who cannot stick up for themselves, or do you go after the money where the money is to be had in a fair economy and in a fair community? What about a superprofits tax? The big four banks, in the first six months of this year, have posted combined profits of some $16,000 million, an enormous sum of money in simple terms and an enormous return on investment. Rather than going after low-income people or their families in the community who are doing it hard, why don't we go after the big four banks and say: 'You are doing all right. You get a lot of support from the government and from this parliament. So when you are doing all right, pay a bit more tax.' That would be the action of a fair government. That would be something for a decent opposition to support. What about high-wage earners, people like politicians? The sort of money we earn is an almost unfathomable amount of money for most people in the community. Why can't people like us pay a little more income tax? That would be another way to help repair the budget. That would be another fair act of a fair government. That would be something that a decent opposition could support. What about this bizarre capital gains tax discount? There is a lot of talk about negative gearing but next to no talk about this bizarre arrangement where, after a very short period, people get an inexplicable discount on their capital gains tax. Yes, I do acknowledge that the  Labor Party has had something to say on this, and that is good, but what has the government done about it? Nothing; absolutely nothing. These are all the sorts of areas where we can gain additional revenue. Then we can turn our minds to expenditure. It is very timely that in recent days a report has been released by a number of organisations who have found that the cost of mandatory detention, offshore processing, turn-backs and the failed Cambodia resettlement plan has been almost $10,000 million just in the last three years. Yes, that is right, Mr Deputy Speaker: $9.6 billion to pay for our response to asylum seekers just in three years. It is forecast to be another $5.7 billion-that is, $5,700 million-over the next four years. In other words, it has cost almost $16 billion just to respond to people who are fleeing for their lives and coming to our shores seeking protection. A good government-a government with a heart, a government with a sense of fairness and respect for international law-would not be busting $16,000 million to deal with asylum seekers. That is one area of expenditure which could be reined in immediately, starting with the closure of the Nauru immigration detention centre. What about our defence build-up? I do not think I could be called a dove. I served this country in uniform for 20 years and I served in the intelligence community for some years after that. I have a realistic understanding of national security and of the need to have a defence force and equip our soldiers properly. But what on earth are we doing talking about spending $30 billion over the next 10 years on top of our existing Defence budget? There is no way that can be defended. When we are trying to get the budget back into order, when we are taking money off some of the poorest and most disadvantaged members of our community, there is no way we can turn around and say, 'By the way, we are going to spend $30,000 million extra over the next 10 years on a defence build-up.' We are not keeping the budget at existing levels and replacing platforms as they reach their use-by date but building it up. Then we will look at our neighbours and criticise them for joining in our arms race. What is this about doubling our submarine fleet? At a time when we need to get the budget back into good shape, at a time when this government, supported by the quisling opposition, is going after some of the most disadvantaged members of the community, we are going to double our submarine fleet-when we can't even crew the fleet we have now! It does not make any sense. Yes, let's re-engineer the budget, let's rein in unnecessary and wasteful expenditure, let's look for efficiencies and other ways in which we can raise additional revenue to fund the needs of this country, but let's do it in a fair way. Let's not go after disadvantaged people and people on low incomes. Let's not go after the children with crook teeth in low-income families. Yes, I note that the ALP, to their credit, have sought to address this in some way in their negotiations with the government, but no-one knows what the answer is yet. No-one can have any confidence that there will be a good outcome from this or, indeed, that there will be an effective dental scheme for the kids in low-income families. Now let me turn my attention to the environment. I am very pleased that the member for Melbourne spent quite some time on this, because when you look at all the challenges facing this country there can be no doubt that the greatest single challenge, the one thing that jeopardises our future and the future of our kids and their kids, is climate change. Kevin Rudd was quite right to call it the greatest moral challenge. I do not think people in this place have their minds around that. I think too many people in this place still think that climate change is  'crap', or they believe in it but they do not understand the enormity of the problem and the challenge that faces us, or they understand it a bit but they like to say the right thing now and then just to keep the community happy. I do not think that, as a parliament, we get it. I do not think we understand the changes that are coming our way in our lifetime, the changes that are coming the way of people right around the world, in particular in many countries in our region, and the need to do everything in our power to deal with climate change. Yes, let's set ambitious goals. When I talked at the recent election about the sorts of targets I personally want, I was always greeted with approval and applause-or approval at least; sometimes applause. I would say to my community back home in Hobart, in my electorate of Denison, 'We should be aiming for 100 per cent net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy by 2030.' Some people would say to me: 'Don't be silly! That's beyond what all the parties say. It's just not possible.' I would say to them: 'It is possible. It is possible for a country with ambition. It is possible for a country led by inspiring leaders.' For heaven's sake, the United States, 50 years ago, put someone on the moon from scratch in about half a decade, all because a president and a government said: 'Let's go for it! Let's do it!' And they did it. If we had that sort of mindset in this country, if we went for it, we could do it. We would be the global leader. Not only would we be doing the right thing for our community and our environment; we would be leading the rest of the world and showing them what can be done in a rich and lucky country with inspiring leadership. Instead, what are we talking about today? We are talking about the government, with this black-hearted bill supported by the quisling opposition, cutting $550 million from ARENA. That is a remarkable betrayal of the Australian community and the public interest and the environment. But then, why would I be surprised? Because it was the Labor opposition that voted with the Liberal-National government to reduce the mandatory renewable energy target from 41,000 gigawatt hours to 33,000 gigawatt hours. So it turns out a lot of people like to come in here and give all the grand speeches and say all the right things, but when the big decisions are to be had, when the votes are to be put, everyone just turns to water and worries about money and the budget. That is why they are cutting $550 million from ARENA. That is why the government during the election campaign basically wanted to gut the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to turn it into a slush fund for its election promises, because at the end of the day neither the government nor the opposition are really fair dinkum about the environment. If they were fair dinkum about the environment, if they were fair dinkum about our very existence as we know it is threatened by climate change, they would not be putting this in the bill and the opposition would not be supporting it. This is a terrible betrayal. Let us just think about climate change for a minute. We are already seeing it. We are already seeing in Australia more extreme weather events more often, and that will become more and more commonplace. There will be more droughts. There will be more bushfires. There will be more cyclones. There will be more flooding. We will start to see more and more diseases appear in parts of the country where they have never been seen before. In our region we will see increasing instability as sea-level rise results in mass dislocation of communities, particularly in the low-lying microstates in the Pacific and the low-lying river deltas in places like Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. We will see wars over water supply. We will see all this because of climate change. When my two little daughters are older and they ask me: 'Dad, what did you achieve in your life? What did you fight for? What you have to say when it  really mattered?' I will have to say that far too often I walked into a room and worked with men and women and debated issues about which that group failed our nation and our community. If I seem to be spending a lot of awful time on climate change in a debate about the omnibus bill, it is because I, like the member for Melbourne, want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it is vitally important to look after community, to provide the essential services and income for disadvantaged and low-income people. To do all of those things is a vital role for government, as is keeping them safe. But the biggest threat coming down the highway at us is climate change, and when I look at the omnibus bill I see the cut of $550 million from ARENA as being biggest single betrayal in the bill. For that reason alone, I will not support this bill. I would hope that I am joined by others-I suspect the member for Melbourne and I hope others will join me. I started by describing this as a black-hearted bill. I think it gives us an insight into a government that also is black hearted. It gives us an insight into the approach of the opposition in this parliament. I called them quislings and I mean that. This was a time to take a stand; to stand and fight for the people who voted for you, like I am trying to do right now. Your coming in here and supporting a bill which you spent so long criticising and which still contains 20 of its original 24 measures makes you a pack of quislings.",34
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Just before I have the pleasure of calling the new member for Mayo, I will just ask members to reflect on the language being used. It will not be tolerated again.",37
Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I wish to speak briefly about the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. Whilst a deal has been reached between the government and the opposition, it is important that those who did not vote for a major party in the electionalmost a quarter of all Australians-have a chance to have their voices heard on this important bill. I am encouraged by the news that the proposed $1.3 billion cut to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency will not go ahead as planned but I am disheartened that the compromise between the major parties will still see $500 million worth of funding cuts from the agency. Australia, as a leading developed nation, has a responsibility, not only to those of us who live here but as a global citizen, to face the challenges of climate change. ARENA, since its establishment in 2012, has funded a number of worthy renewable energy projects and feasibility studies. One proposal that has been funded for a feasibility study is that of the Repower Port Augusta alliance in South Australia. Replacing the outdated and polluting coal plant dinosaurs with modern solar thermal plants would create 1,800 jobs for my state, and my state needs those jobs. It would save five million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of the local community and ensure energy security and stable electricity prices. South Australia has been a leader in embracing renewable energy, and I am proud of how my state has faced the demands of a changing world. It could not do so without the support of bodies such as ARENA. There is scope to change the way ARENA currently operates. I believe that there should be change in the funding mechanism to ensure that if renewable energy technology has commercial success the grant ought to be repaid, and there ought to be the ability for ARENA  to take equity in the project so it can reap the benefit. If the government is fair dinkum about innovation and agility, it would ensure that ARENA remains fully funded into the future. I would like to talk about the student start-up scholarships. The purpose of the student startup scholarships is, and was, to help higher education students in need to meet the up-front costs of study. We should not fool ourselves; the students who are receiving this are students on Abstudy, on Austudy and on youth allowance. Many of those students who received the student start-up scholarships were from disadvantaged rural and regional backgrounds and thus faced significant additional costs in commencing study. These included but were not limited to the significant costs of relocating to a major capital or regional city, where they could not rely on local support from family or friends. And that is many people in my community of Mayo. Many of the 80,000 recipients of the scholarship will have made major and important financial and life decisions based on the knowledge that they were in receipt of such a scholarship. As it currently stands the bill provides students on start-up scholarships less than one year to make the necessary significant adjustments to their financial and life circumstances to compensate for the removal of the scholarship payments. It is unreasonable to provide the proposed short time frame for these students to make such major financial adjustments to their life. The simple solution to this problem is to delay the repeal of the student start-up scholarships by at least 18 months to 1 January 2019. I would like to briefly talk about the carbon tax compensation. The Nick Xenophon Team recognises that the budget needs to be set on a solid trajectory towards repair; however, repairing the budget should not be achieved off the backs of the poorest in our society. It was encouraging to learn that the deal struck between the government and the opposition allowed compensation for the carbon tax to continue for those on payments like Newstart, youth allowance, the disability support pension and the age pension. It was, on the other hand, so disappointing that it was those doing it the toughest who were so clearly targeted in the first place. Admittedly, according to simple logic, if there is no longer a carbon tax then the carbon tax compensation-the energy supplement and single income family supplement-should eventually be phased out. However, this simple logic ignores the effect that the removal of these supplement payments would have on our most disadvantaged communities. In addition to the basic social compassion there are also good economic arguments for ensuring that income supplement payments keep Australians out of poverty. Income and wealth inequality is rising in Australia, which is putting pressure on the demand side of the economy. The poorest in our society must by necessity spend a greater proportion of their incomes on goods and services than the richer end of the income distribution. Businesses also require consumers to purchase their products in order to prosper. Given the continued uncertainty and weakness of global demand, it would seem a highly inauspicious time to be placing more pressure upon Australian businesses by deliberately cutting social security to the poorest and thus domestic demand. This is of particular concern to small businesses which do not enjoy the same economies of scale as large businesses and thus cannot weather adverse conditions for as long. So, whilst I support this bill and acknowledge that the government has a job to do in repairing the budget, I am concerned about how such savings are being achieved. ",37
Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I thank members for their contribution to this debate on the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. I think it has been a good opportunity this morning to be able to move with some haste to ensure that this matter is dealt with in the parliament this week. So I thank members for their contribution. The challenge before this parliament is to arrest the debt that risks the living standards of not just future generations of Australians but also the current generations of Australians. This is the government's task. This is the task that the Turnbull government are focused on. The Turnbull government are interested in getting outcomes. We will leave the politicking and the commentary about the politics to others. There were a few grandstanding speeches here earlier in the debate and a few laps of honour made by those opposite. We will leave the politicking there. We are interested in outcomes. We were elected to get outcomes in this 45th Parliament and this bill is getting those outcomes. So the Turnbull government are getting on with governing. The agreement reached on this bill demonstrates the ability of the Turnbull government to get the things done that we were elected to do in this parliament. As a government we inherited accumulated deficits in 2013 of some $240 billion and a debt curse from the previous government of some $317 billion. In the last term Labor did engage in budget sabotage for three years, not only opposing urgent budget repair measures but promising to reverse measures passed and to engage in even higher spending. Over the past year Labor proposed and then walked away from some $50 billion or thereabouts in expenditure measures. This bill though I hope brings that process to an end. This bill I think provides a new way forward from what was going on in the past. This bill brings to book that process. Labor are now supporting things that they previously opposed, and what they called zombie measures are being included in this budget. We welcome that. We welcome the change of heart, but we in this place, particularly we on this side of the House, know it will not be enough. Some $40 billion in budget improvement measures are before this parliament. The $11 billion of those measures included in what is agreed in this omnibus bill and what will pass in terms of tobacco excise means we are making significant progress on those issues, working in this parliament with the agreement of the opposition. But the balance and focus of these savings measures must be on savings on outlays, and $25 billion of our $40 billion in budget improvement measures are on savings. So, where there are measures that have not been picked up and supported in this bill, the government will continue to pursue those measures because they are necessary for the job of budget repair, and we will seek to do that in partnership with other parties and individuals in both this place and the other place to ensure that we can achieve that job of arresting the debt. I will be moving a series of amendments in the third reading, which summarises the agreement that has been reached with the opposition. I want to particularly put on record my thanks to the shadow Treasurer for his engagement in this process, as well as my team member Mathias Cormann, Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance, and for the strong work that has been done between the two parties. That has been done in good faith. I do acknowledge the strong work that has been done by the shadow Treasurer on behalf of the opposition. We look forward to continuing to work on issues moving forward, wherever that is possible to be done. I would commend that process to the  House. And I commend this bill in the form that we will get to. I am confident, as we move through the third reading stage, for an outcome that will deliver $6.3 billion in budget savings and arrest the debt by some $30 billion over the medium term. That is an outcome that the Turnbull government can be rightly very proud of, and we will continue to govern.",39
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I thank the Treasurer. The question is that the bill be now read a second time. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,40
The SPEAKER,BILLS,"As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes in this division, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. The second reading is therefore carried. Question agreed to, Mr Bandt, Mr Katter, Ms MCGowan and Mr Wilkie voting no. Bill read a second time.",40
The SPEAKER,BILLS,"I have received a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending, in accordance with section 56 of the Constitution, an appropriation for the purpose of this bill. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",40
Mr BANDT,BILLS," I move the amendment circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 5, page 18 (lines 1 to 7), omit the Schedule. The amendment does a very simple thing. It removes from this bill the cuts to ARENA, full stop. As we know, there are over a billion dollars of cuts to ARENA proposed in this bill. We anticipate that there are going to be some subsequent amendments moved to confirm that there will be over half a billion dollars in cuts to ARENA in this bill. If we are talking about half a billion dollars then the question is: can this chamber and this parliament find a better place to raise half a billion dollars than by cutting renewable energy? We know that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency has the support of the renewable energy industry, but even more importantly it has the support of companies that run coal-fired power stations, like AGL, and it has the support of multinational companies like GE. They have all said and pleaded with this government and with the Labor Party, 'Please don't kill ARENA.' We now have the opportunity to say, 'Let's work together to find a better place to raise half a billion dollars.' I think it is not beyond the wit of Labor, Liberal and the Greens to find, for example, a way of winding back superannuation tax concessions to raise half a billion dollars. All sides of this parliament have said that superannuation tax concessions are too generous and need to be wound back. We know that it costs around $30 billion a year-this is what Treasury tells usto prop up the super system. Everyone has said there is a need for some reform. Okay. So let's give ARENA a stay of execution and instead work together to find half a billion dollars from superannuation. I bet we could do it. There are plenty of other places that we could find half a billion dollars from as well. We could wind back some of the tax breaks that we give to large mining companies. We could wind back some of the tax breaks that we give to the banks. These measures might have the  agreement across the parliament; they might not. But there has to be-I am convinced of it-a better way of finding half a billion dollars than by taking it from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. We heard some statements during the second reading debate that ARENA had been saved. Well, now is the chance to do it. No-one is holding a gun to Labor's head and saying they have to cut ARENA's funding by half a billion dollars. No-one is holding a gun to Labor's head and saying they have to cut clean energy to help balance the budget. No-one is forcing them to do this. I say to the opposition: please support us on this amendment and we can find other ways when it gets to the Senate of making up the difference. Please support us on this amendment because this is a chance to save the Renewable Energy Agency. I say to the opposition: you found other areas on which you were prepared to stand up to the government and say, 'No go.' And I am glad that you did that, because some of those areas were things that we had previously worked on together, like dental-although, as the member for Denison says, we still do not know what is going to come out of that; it might still be on the chopping block if this deal is any indication of what is in store for us. But if you could say no on some things then say no on this. Say 'No', Labor, to cutting half a billion dollars out of renewable energy. Find that spine that you found on the other measures for renewable energy, because this is critically important. I say to Labor: please support us on this amendment. And I say to the government: please support this amendment and give ARENA its full funding back and let's work together to find other ways to raise that half a billion dollars, because in the context of the overall budget that is a very doable ask. If Labor and Liberal are really saying that the only way we can repair the budget is by taking money out of renewable energy then they are not looking hard enough, because we can point to billions and billions of dollars in tax concessions going to the top end of town. It would be much better to take the money off those who can afford it rather than taking it out of renewable energy. I commend this amendment to the House.",40

I commend them to the House.",43
Mr BOWEN,NOES, The amendments reflect the agreement between the opposition and the government. I commend them to House.,44
Mr BANDT,NOES," I have a number of questions for the Treasurer. There is confirmation from the shadow Treasurer that this reflects the agreement that was reached. In the explanatory memorandum there is a reference on page 6. I am looking at the point about Australian Renewable Energy Agency's finances where it says the government has agreed to restore funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, of $800 million over the five years to 2021-22 and to reduce by a commensurate amount the capital allocated to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Earlier today The Guardian reported that the spokesperson for the shadow environment minister said: The discussion was progressed on the basis that any save that fell short of what we needed would be made up for by some other area, and that's exactly what happened. So no cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund is needed. I am seeking clarification from the Treasurer, given that we have just heard from the shadow Treasurer that this reflects the agreement that was reached. Labor is saying publicly that the agreement did not include any cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, but the explanatory memorandum says there will be a reduction of $800 million in the capital allocated to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Who is right, and what is the agreement?",44
Mr MORRISON,NOES," The agreement with the opposition on the bill has no impact on the overall capital allocation for the CEFC, which remains unchanged at $10 billion.",44
Mr BANDT,NOES," I was just asked by the Leader of the Opposition how long this will go on for. I say to the House: part of the problem we have got is that Labor and the coalition refused to have an open hearing into this bill. We now have the opportunity here, for the first time, to ask questions about the amendment. My question-and maybe the Treasurer did not hear it correctly-was not about the CEFC. I understand the point that is made in the explanatory memorandum that there is no overall reduction to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. My question is about the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Labor says the deal did not include any reduction to the clean energy fund. The explanatory memorandum says there will be a reduction to the clean energy fund by the amount of $800 million that  Labor says it saved for ARENA. So I ask again: what is the deal? Can the Treasurer confirm that there will be a reduction to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, and was that part of the agreement reached with Labor?",44
Mr MORRISON,NOES," The Clean Energy Innovation Fund provides debt and equity, not grants, to target clean energy technologies and businesses that have passed beyond the R&D stage but are not yet commercially ready to attract private sector capital. This type of government financial support will continue to support clean energy, but, unlike grants, will provide a return to the taxpayer. I think that covers the member's question.",45
Mr BANDT,NOES," I will give the Treasurer one last opportunity to advise the House whether or not part of the agreement with Labor included a reduction of $800 million for the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. The explanatory memorandum says it did. And so unless the Treasurer disavows the explanatory memorandum, it appears to be that the government is saying to the House, in writing, part of the deal was $800 million coming out of the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. That has been contradicted publicly by Labor this morning, and I am seeking clarification about who is right. We are being asked to vote on this right now, when there has been no public hearing into the effects of these cuts and we have been given an explanatory memorandum and all of five minutes to examine this deal that has been done. It seems I cannot get a straight answer from the government about what is included in the deal, because the Treasurer seems to be unwilling to confirm what is in the explanatory memorandum or tell us whether what is being said publicly about it is right or wrong. So maybe it is the case that the opposition has been played off a break on this: they think they agreed to something, but in fact they have agreed to something else-in which case the government has got one over on the opposition. Or maybe it is the case that what is in the explanatory memorandum is right, that it is part of an agreement-the word 'agreement' is there-and that the Labor Party agreed to take $800 million from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, in which case it is Labor who is saying one thing in parliament and saying another thing to the public and the media. This is crucially important because we are being asked to vote on this right now, with all of 10 or 20 minutes to examine this so-called deal that has been done, and there is an absolute lack of clarity about where the money is going to come from to supposedly save ARENA. I ask again: can the Treasurer confirm that what was in the explanatory memorandum is right? If so, how does that square with public statements being made that there was no agreement to cut the Clean Energy Innovation Fund?",45
Mr MORRISON,NOES," Once again I point out to the member, and I refer him to the new explanatory memorandum that I tabled a few minutes ago, that I refer to the fact that there is the difference between debt and equity. This is debt and grants, and that is an onand off-balance sheet issue. I commend the explanatory memorandum to the member.",45
Mr KATTER,NOES," I would seek clarification from the Labor Party. Have they got an agreement that there are going to be no cutbacks, or haven't they? We want to know what the agreements are. It is quite a reasonable question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne.  While I am on my feet and while the ALP decide how they are going to answer the question, which will be rather curious for we crossbenchers, could I add this: I do not feel particularly comfortable in acting like, 'No, we don't agree to any cutbacks in anything.' What people like myself are saying is: for heaven's sake, everyone else on earth has a charge on goods coming into their country. Whether you call it an excise duty or a customs duty or whatever the hell you want to call it-a 'primage charge', as Billy Wentworth used to advocate in this place-even five per cent will bring in $16 billion a year. Surely some benefit for the Australian community would follow if, in fact, we put that charge on. Our manufacturing industries are collapsing because of overseas competition. All of our competitors have protective mechanisms-tariffs and various other mechanisms-that protect them. We cannot send our sugar into Europe; we cannot send our sugar into the United States. All of these other countries have protective mechanisms; we have no protective mechanisms whatsoever. Surely a five per cent or a 10 per cent charge for people who want to buy an item from overseas, instead of buying an Australian made item, is not an unreasonable proposition. In my opinion, that is one of the places where the money should come from-not cutting back on areas that are extremely important. For the areas I represent in North Queensland, we are at the end of a 2,000-kilometre electricity line. The line losses of 20 per cent and 25 per cent and the cost of servicing the debt on those transmission lines is horrific; it is costing the Queensland government something like $500 million a year. So these ARENA projects are extremely important to us. Right at the end of the line is Karumba, and they are now getting into solar, which is absolutely ridiculous in any normal situation. But when you are trying to carry electricity nearly 3,000 kilometres, then it is very, very intelligent to have solar panels in. We commend Doug Scouller and the people doing it at that end. But they are doing this on ARENA grants. Let us be intelligent about this. Persons like me would normally be anti the Greens agenda, but in this case we are notbecause we are at the end of the line and we need these alternative energy sources, which are highly suitable and cheaper when you are dealing with the end of the line. I speak as a one time minister for electricity in Queensland. But we would like an answer from the ALP. I do not think it is unreasonable for the honourable member to ask for clarification on this matter.",45
Mr BOWEN,NOES," The government and the opposition reached agreement that ARENA would receive funding of $800 million over the next five years. That is what is necessary and agreed for ARENA to continue to operate. The government has separate arrangements off-budget, but the government has reassured us and reassured the public that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is unaffected, with capital of $10 billion. That is a result; that is the case. The government has also agreed to a process for the shadow minister for climate change to work with the Minister for the Environment and Energy on the funding profile for ARENA. That is what we intend to ensure occurs, and I am sure it will occur.",46
Mr BANDT,NOES," Neither of them has answered the question, and it is clear why: they have been caught out. What the shadow Treasurer just spoke about was the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. That is not what my question was about. What I asked about was in the supplementary explanatory memorandum about the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. If there is confusion about this, let me clarify it. Speaking about the Clean Energy  Innovation Fund-and I am reading from a transcript-the Prime Minister, on 23 March 2016, said: â¦ we are establishing a new $1 billion Clean Energy Innovation Fund and what that is going to do is every year invest $100 million in the smartest, most cutting edge Australian clean-energy technologies and businesses to ensure that we not only drive jobs and innovation in Australia but also play our part in cracking the very hard problems, the challenging technical difficulties that we face in terms of reducing emissions. So it was a key announcement that there was going to be $1 billion for this. As we know, the outcome of the negotiations that took place about ARENA is that half a billion dollars is coming out but $800 million is staying. The question is: where is that $800 million coming from? No sooner was the ink dry on that deal than the finance minister and the minister for energy went out and said the $800 million is going to come from elsewhere in the clean energy bucket. Labor then went out and said: 'No, that's not our understanding of the negotiations.' Again, so that there can be no confusion, let's be clear what Labor is saying. In The Guardian today, Labor is reported as saying: 'The government's Clean Energy Innovation Fund was never the subject of negotiations. The discussion was progressed on the basis that any save that fell short of what we needed would be made up by some other area'-not clean energy, some other area-'and that is exactly what happened.' So no cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund is needed-that is what Labor is saying. So Labor and the government have been caught out, because there will be a cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund to make up for the so-called saving of ARENA. The money that is being left in the ARENA bucket is, according to the government's explanatory memorandum, coming from somewhere else. The government said in the explanatory memorandum: 'The government has agreed to restore funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, of $800 million over the five years to 2021-22 and reduce by a commensurate amount the capital allocated to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund.'",46
Mr Morrison,NOES,That's not the EM. It doesn't say that in the EM.,47
Mr BANDT,NOES,I am reading from the explanatory memorandum. If that has been changed then it can be clarified. ,47
Mr BANDT,NOES,I am seeking clarification. This is the government's bill and the government's amendments.,47
Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,47
Mr BANDT,NOES,"If we have misunderstood it then it can be clarified. Where is the $800 million coming from? It can be very, very easily clarified. So there is a lack of clarity on that.",47
Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,47
Mr BANDT,NOES,"There has been absolutely no clarification. I want to move to another series of questions about the funding scheduled that was referred to in the amendments. I refer to item 4 of the amendments to schedule 5 which sets out a new funding schedule. Can the Treasurer confirm the total amount of the reduction in funding to ARENA under that funding schedule and which years it will be coming out of? I am interested in the profile between years 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. What cuts are being made in which particular years? Can the Treasurer enlighten the House? ",47
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, The question is that the amendments be agreed to.,48
Mr BANDT,NOES,I have asked,48
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Member for Melbourne, I am putting the question.",48
Mr BANDT,NOES,And I seek to speak to that question.,48
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I have got to put the question. I can keep going? All right. Member for Melbourne.,48
Mr BANDT,NOES,"We have been given a schedule that sets out numbers next to a number of years, and those are the budget allocations for those particular years. Those numbers are obviously less than what ARENA currently gets. I am seeking clarification about where the cuts fall. The cuts are in the order of half a billion dollars, and I am seeking clarification as to which years they fall in. On my quick reading of it-given that we have not had a lot of time to pursue this-$241 million will come out in 2017-18 and $213 million comes out in 201920. The overwhelming bulk of the cuts-more than $514 million of the $517 million-odd in cuts-will come out in the first three years. Is that how we should understand the amendments we are being asked to vote on?",48
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The question is that the motion be agreed to. Are there any further speakers? The Member for Melbourne.,48
Mr BANDT,NOES,"I will just make this final comment. I would just note how outrageous it is that we are being asked to sign off on a half a billion dollar cut and the Treasurer will not even do us the dignity of explaining where the cuts fall. The Treasurer is asking us to accept amendments to cut a government agency. He is giving us the schedule that lists what the funding for the agency is going to be. When he is asked the reasonable question, 'In what years are those cuts going to fall, given that you have given us a schedule?' he will not answer. I cannot recall any other instance in which a Treasurer has come into this House and said, 'I want you to pass a budget cut but I won't tell you when the cuts fall. Just accept the numbers I put in front of you.' This is treating this House with contempt-an unwillingness to simply say when these cuts are going to fall. 'I want you to vote on it right now, but I won't tell you when the cuts are going to fall.' I cannot recall a single instance in which this House has been treated with such contempt. When the more questions you ask the less information you are given, it is crystal clear that there is something wrong with this dodgy deal. When our Treasurer, who is in charge of the finances of the nation, cannot even tell you when the cuts are going to fall, something is wrong. That is why his bill should be opposed.",48
Mr WILKIE,NOES," Deputy Speaker Broadbent, I defer to your wisdom about the functioning of this place. But before we go to the third reading and possibly a division, I think we need to just clear this up. I am not doubting the Treasurer that there is a more recent explanatory memorandum but-despite my best efforts just then-I was not able to get a copy to see the latest version. The version I have says quite clearly: The government has agreed to restore funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) of $800 million over five years to 2021-22, and reduce by a commensurate amount the capital allocated to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund â¦  And it goes on. I understand from talking to the Treasurer just then that there is a more recent version of this explanatory memorandum which-I understand from the Treasurer-does not include that statement. I think it is very important that before we finalise this matter we at least get to see the latest paperwork on what is a very, very important piece of parliamentary business. At the moment, despite our very best efforts, this is what we understand to be the facts of the matter, because we have not got a more up-to-date explanatory memorandum-I see the Clerk racing in and hopefully this will clear the matter up. Through you, Deputy Speaker, I would ask the Treasurer: if the latest version of the explanatory memorandum does not have that paragraph, that would make almost make me even more nervous-because then it will be completely unknown where that $800 million is coming from. I suppose it would probably be a reasonable assumption by honourable members, including by the member for Melbourne and me, that it is still going to come from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund; it is just that the government does not want to broadcast it in the explanatory memorandum. I will keep talking while-hopefully-the latest version makes its way to the crossbench. If that cannot happen quickly enough, Treasurer, I would ask you to explain whether or not that paragraph has indeed been removed from the latest version of the explanatory memorandum and, if indeed it has been removed, what the source of that $800 million funding to ARENA will be. Will it indeed be by commensurate reduction in the Clean Energy Innovation Fund.  reference to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. So, after that very longwinded preambleand I am very grateful for your patience, Deputy Speaker-my question for the Treasurer is: where will that $800 million come from? It is very simple: will it be from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund? A simple yes or no would do the job.",48
Mr MORRISON,NOES," As both the shadow Treasurer and I have made clear, the CSC's total balance of funds of $10 billion is unchanged by these measures. This is a package of measures which includes $6.3 billion of savings in some 25 different measures. So this bill pays for itself in the entirety of the savings that have been pursued through these measures.",49
Mr BANDT,NOES," Perhaps I can assist the House. Earlier this morning we asked the Treasurer's office for a copy of the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The document that we got from the Treasurer's office had at the end of the sentence: 'and reduce by a commensurate amount the capital allocated to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund'. And that is what the finance minister said yesterday. And that is what the energy minister said yesterday as well. That is the document that we got. Then, during the course of this debate-because we caught them out-they come in here with a revised supplementary explanatory memorandum which takes that sentence out. In the course of the last two hours this morning, because they have been caught out-in that they are robbing Peter to pay Paul: they are taking $800 million from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund-they have taken it out of the explanatory memorandum. This is why this dirty deal must not be rushed through. If we can find that out in the space of a couple of hours-if the Treasurer can go from telling us, 'I am raiding $800 million from this clean energy fund to give it over here,' to 'No, I am not willing to tell the House that'-then what else are we going to find, the more we look into this deal?  This is what happens when you do dirty deals-to cut renewable energy, and to cut support to low-income earners-and then front up to parliament, without a public hearing, and say, 'push them through'. Then, when you ask the simple question, 'Where is the money going to come from?' they will not tell you. And then when you ask another simple question, 'Tell us over what years the money is going to come,' they won't tell you that either. This is a shameful process, and I am astounded that the Labor Party is signing up to it. This Labor Party is prepared to sign up to half a billion dollars of cuts to renewable energy, while the government is out there publicly telling people it is going to come from another renewable energy pot-and the government cannot even tell us over what years the cut is going to come. They are saying, 'Yes; let's push it through without the proper scrutiny that a bill like this deserves'. The Treasurer treats this place with contempt and will not even get up and say when the cuts are going to fall-a very, very simple question-or where the money is going to come from. The last couple of hours should give everyone in this place and everyone who is watching what is going on here very great cause for concern-because if this is how we are going to work over the next couple of years; if we are going to try and secure this country's revenue base by doing afternoon deals that the parliament does not have an opportunity to scrutinise, where stories change during the course of a morning about where money is going to come from or where the cuts are going to fall, then this country is in a very dire place indeed. What else is in this bill? What, if we had more than 20 minutes to examine it, would we find? If the last couple of hours tell you anything, it is that this government is intent on trying to balance the budget off the back of renewable energy, and off the back of people who have got fewer means and less money than others. The job of an opposition should be to oppose and scrutinise. It should not be to wave through-in a dodgy process that can be unpicked and unstitched within an hour or two-a bill that cuts half a billion dollars from a signature renewable energy agency, and possibly does a lot more as well. The Treasurer is not even willing to get his story straight. The shadow Treasurer gets up and talks about the CEFC. I am not talking about the CEFC. I am talking about the Prime Minister's signature project, the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Is it going to be cut by $800 million? The Treasurer told us yes this morning in an explanatory memorandum. They revised it on the run when they were caught out. Who knows what the real story is! What we do know is that dirty deals are being done that will have an impact on clean energy, that will have an impact on people in this country, that will cut money for students and that will cut money for research and development. I, for one, am not willing to wave it through and give it a blank cheque, and I wish the opposition would oppose. You know the clue to your job title is in the word 'oppose'. Scrutinise. Do not let this mob get away with cutting half billion dollars from renewables when you do not know where it is going to come from. Do not let this mob get away with cutting money from research and development. Do not let this mob get away with cutting money from students and aged care. You railed against it for a couple of years when it was done under Tony Abbott. Continue to stand up to it now and we can find a better way to secure the revenue that this country needs. What is happening this morning shames everyone in this place and should shame every Australian who is concerned about good budget management, because good budget management would be done transparently, and you would  take the money off those who could afford it instead of taking the axe to clean energy. (Time expired)  forcefully and he has had a fair run talking about these matters. The explanatory memorandum has now clarified the question that he was asking. We do have three hours of maiden speeches today and many people have travelled from interstate to be here for those maiden speeches. Therefore, I move: That the question be now put. Question agreed to, Mr Bandt and Mr Wilkie dissenting.",49

Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Turnbull. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",51
Mr TURNBULL,NOES," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I present to the House today the commitment that we made in the election campaign to put the question of whether same-sex couples will be allowed to marry under Australian law to the Australia people in a plebiscite. We believe that that commitment is one that all members of this parliament should support and respect. It is thoroughly democratic. It is thoroughly democratic. Every Australian will have their say and, if the opposition support the plebiscite in the Senate, the plebiscite can be held on 11 February, which is the soonest practicable date. There has been over the years, relatively recent years, a very rapid change in attitudes to same-sex marriage-to same-sex couples, indeed. All of us have seen the way in which discrimination or disadvantage for same-sex couples was removed, whether initially in respect of social welfare legislation or pensions legislation. I remember very well the debate within the Howard government in its last year about whether same-sex couples should have equal rights in respect of Commonwealth and Defence superannuation. To John Howard's great credit, he supported that change and took it to the 2007 election. So there have been a series of changes over time, and the one issue that has not been addressed is the issue of marriage. Indeed, I remember discussing this point with President  Bush many years ago, at the time of APEC in 2007, when we were discussing what were the big moral issues in Australian politics. We talked about this issue of equal access to superannuation, and I remember the president said: 'Well, those are all issues of financial fairness. The big moral issue is the one about marriage.' And we have to respect that it is a very big moral issue. It is an issue of conscience. It is an issue of conscience for millions of Australians who have different views on it-and sincerely held views. It is vital that we respect all of those views in this debate. I would say to all honourable members: it is utterly wrong, and it shows dreadful leadership on the part of parliamentarians, to characterise those people who do not believe the parliament should change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to be married as being homophobic, as hating homosexuals. This is so often being injected into the narrative at the moment. It is profoundly disrespectful. Some of the remarks the Leader of the Opposition has made. I will not repeat them-to which great exception has been taken, he should not repeat. We have to respect there are sincerely held views on this issue. They are views very often informed by deeply felt conscience; informed by religious commitment, very often; informed by faith. We have to respect, we must respect-and I can say the government respects-the diversity of views on this issue. As it happens, as honourable members are aware, my view and that of my wife, Lucy, is that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. We have been married for over 36 years and we do not believe that if same-sex couples are allowed to have their union recognised as marriage that will undermine our relationship of long standing. I believe there are great threats to marriage in our society and I say from the bottom of my heart that our society would be stronger if more people were married and there were fewer divorces. If there was something we could do to make families happier it would be a wonderful thing. We know that the breakdown of the family unit is one of the great causes of hardship, of poverty, of so many of our social ills. So we are a government-and I am sure the opposition joins with us on this-we are a parliament committed to marriage, and we are committed to people supporting each other and sticking together, working hard, supporting their children and their families and enabling their dreams. And that is why I support same-sex marriage. David Cameron summed it up very well some years ago when he said, 'I support same-sex marriage not despite being a conservative but because I am a conservative, because we value commitment.' So, that is where I stand; that is where Lucy stands. When the plebiscite is held, we will be voting yes. But there are many other Australians who are equally filled with love, equally respectful of gay couples, equally respectful of the families of gay couples, of same-sex couples, who will in thoroughly good conscience vote no, and they will do so not because they disrespect gay couples, not because they disrespect the couple who were in the House yesterday with their little boy; they will do so because of a deeply felt conscience. It is a matter of conscience and we should respect it. The passage of change in our society has been one where-and this is where it has differed from the progress in some other jurisdictions; it is an important point to make-one after another of, if you like, the discriminations or the disadvantages affecting same-sex couples were removed. Some were removed during the Howard government and previous governments; more were removed under the Rudd government. That process has been  ongoing and it has reflected a very strong social change. As I noted in the lecture I gave, the Michael Kirby Lecture, in 2012, I had always regarded-and I think I can speak for a number of my colleagues here today in saying this-the marriage issue as, if anything, an obstacle to removing these disadvantages. In other jurisdictions-for example, in the United States-the motivation to recognise same-sex marriage was driven, as much as anything else, to remove certain disadvantages, whether it was in social welfare, or tax, or superannuation and all of those areas that had hitherto been addressed in Australia. So we have progressed in Australia, I would say, in a characteristically Australian pragmatic way. We dealt with the issues. The HREOC issues that were addressed in the early years of the Rudd government were a good example of that-a long list of matters that were dealt with and were supported in a bipartisan way. We come now to this issue of marriage. It is a very, very heartfelt one, it is a matter of conscience, it is a matter of faith for many people, and it is one we must respect. Let me deal with the arguments that have been addressed against the plebiscite-and there have been different views held on the plebiscite by many people. The Leader of the Opposition expressed support of one some years ago. He has got a different view now. Fair enough. We do not criticise him unduly for that. He is entitled to change his mind. But the fact is this: the two arguments that I think have weight against a plebiscite are, firstly, that it is not part of our traditional parliamentary process. That is certainly true, and that is why many conservatives would say it is too much of a novelty-it is too much of an innovation, if you like. Of course, we are in the age of innovation, as I have said before, so that should not be a disqualification. The other one is the cost-and that is substantial-but then you have to ask yourself: what price democracy? So those are two arguments that are valid. We have dealt with them, we have considered them and we have decided to proceed to the plebiscite. The arguments that are addressed most vocally today by the opponents of the plebiscite are ones that we must reject, because basically the argument against the plebiscite that we hear today is that Australians cannot be trusted to have a civil conversation, that the Australian public are so immature, so unbridled, so reckless that they cannot be trusted to have a debate and make a decision on this issue. That insults the Australian people. It disrespects the Australian people. If ever there was an issue to be put to a plebiscite, this is one that can be and should be, because it is a very straightforward question. It does not have the same kind of implications-far-reaching, often unknowable implications-of, for example, voting on Brexit, as the British did recently. It is a very straightforward question-in many respects more straightforward than a number of the questions that we have addressed in constitutional referenda-so it is perfectly suited for that. The real reason, I think, many people oppose the plebiscite is because they believe that if there were to be a free vote in the parliament same-sex marriage would be supported, and so they do not want to run the risk of the Australian people giving them the wrong answer. For our part, we put our faith in the Australian people and we know that their answer, whether it is yes or no, will be the right answer, because it is theirs. This is an institution, thousands of years old, that we are talking now about making a fundamental change to. I believe the time has come to do that. Many others in utterly good faith and good conscience do not. And they want to have their say. I would ask the members of the opposition this: cast your mind back to the Gillard government. Remember when Julia Gillard said, 'I believe in our society with our traditions, marriage has a special place and special definition, marriage will be defined as  between a man and a woman. The Marriage Act will stay the way it is so that marriage is defined as a man and a woman.' These were her many statements on that subject; that was the position of the Labor Party then. Was she denounced by her colleagues as homophobic? What would have happened if the Labor Party had said, 'Let's have a plebiscite'? Of course, the supporters of same-sex marriage would have welcomed it. Mr Dreyfus interjecting",51
The SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Isaacs will cease interjecting.,54
Mr TURNBULL,NOES,"They would have welcomed it because at that time there certainly were not the numbers in the parliament for it to be passed. So what we have to recognise is that this is a commitment we took to the election. It is a commitment we will honour and we are honouring now. It is a commitment that respects the will of the Australian people. It respects their intelligence, their civility, their capacity to make a decision and, above all, it respects the fact that each and every one of them can have a say. Our side, our government, our side of politics, among whom we have different views on this, nonetheless say, 'We respect the Australian people. We want to let them have their say.' We have offered the opposition a role in the process. We are happy to work with them. We have offered them places on the committees that will supervise the spending of the public funding, which is thoroughly fair and thoroughly based on precedent. We have offered them every opportunity to be involved, and they should take it up. They should absolutely take it up and be part of this process, because the best way to ensure same-sex couples can marry is to support the plebiscite. It will be held on 11 February, and if the Australian people support same-sex marriage, as I believe they will-and certainly I will be voting for it-then this parliament will swiftly, when it returns in 2017, legislate to change the Marriage Act. We put our faith in the people. I turn now to the specific details of the bill. This bill sets out the framework for a national plebiscite to ask the Australian people whether the Marriage Act 1961 should be amended to allow same-sex couples to marry. It has been designed to be as fair and transparent as possible-scrupulously fair, just as we would expect of our elections and referenda. The legislation specifies the exact wording of the plebiscite question to be put to the Australian people: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?' This is a simple question. It does not presuppose any particular view. The bill prescribes the date for the vote, Saturday, 11 February 2017. The date fulfils the government's commitment to hold a plebiscite as soon as practicable. The bill authorises and provides funding for the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct the plebiscite. This will be in the amount of $170 million. That funding will include $15 million to be divided equally between official yes and no campaigns. These will be run by committees composed of parliamentarians and citizens, appointed by the Attorney-General and the Special Minister of State. Each committee will include up to five Commonwealth parliamentarians and up to five members of the public. The committees will each prepare material for the respective sides of the debate. As I noted earlier, the opposition will be invited to nominate two of the five members. In addition, organisations will have reasonable opportunities to pay to broadcast material about the plebiscite. Broadcasting rules and the Broadcasting Services Act and the Special Broadcasting Service Act will be extended to apply to conduct relating to the plebiscite.  These rules will also stipulate a blackout period in which broadcasters will be prohibited from broadcasting advertisements about the plebiscite. This, too, is utterly consistent with the framework for federal elections. As for federal elections, voting will be compulsory and in person, with the usual absentee, postal, declaration and pre-polling opportunities. The bill applies provisions for a number of acts, including the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, to ensure this. Voters will be able to cast a valid vote by writing 'Yes' or 'No' in the space provided on the ballot paper. The bill provides that the outcome of the plebiscite will be determined by a simple national majority. The simple majority will be achieved when either the yes or no vote receives more than 50 per cent of the votes cast, disregarding informal ballot papers. This plebiscite gives all Australians a say. Advocates on either side of the debate will have the opportunity to put their views fully and freely to the public, to make their case to the Australian people. It is thoroughly democratic. Now, I recognise that there are a range of views in the community on this issue, as I have discussed. And as Prime Minister, I will be encouraging a considered and respectful discussion from all sides. The plebiscite will allow our nation to make a decision on this fundamental important issue of same-sex marriage. Then, as a nation, we will respect the outcome. If the plebiscite passes, the parliament will legislate to amend the Marriage Act to enable same-sex couples to marry. In closing, I remind the House, the parliament, that Australians expect this issue to be resolved in the manner they endorsed at the election. We took this to the election and we won the election. There was no doubt about our policy. There was no doubt about our platform. This was prominently debated every day of the election campaign. Every Australian who took any interest in the election knew that that was our policy. We have a mandate for it, and the opposition should respect it. I ask the opposition today, I ask the Leader of the Opposition today, to support this plebiscite. This plebiscite will give the Australian people the say on this. I ask Labor to respect the people they represent, to respect the Australian people they claim to support and defend. Respect their intelligence. Respect their civility. Respect their ability to have a discussion about this important matter and resolve it in a manner that is fair and that is democratic. At the end of the day, whoever wins, it will be regarded as a just determination of this important issue. I commend the bill to the House.",54

NA Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,56
Mr KEENAN,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. We live in an information age and the challenges associated with managing that information are clearly something that law enforcement agencies in particular are grappling with. You appreciate in Australia that we have the Commonwealth police and every state and territory has its own police force. The cooperation between those police forces is very good, but of course different police forces keep different information sources, they keep it on different systems. There is the enormous challenge of making sure that a policeman on the beat anywhere in Australia-in Adelaide, in Brisbane or in a regional area-has the information that they need, the criminal intelligence that they need, in a timely manner when they require it. That is very important. It is a big challenge for our law enforcement community to make sure that that is the case. This can be lifesaving information. As a policeman goes about their business we need to make sure that, if they are talking to somebody or apprehending somebody, they can get the background on that person. It is very important. There are legions of examples where police going about their business have not been able to access information in a timely way and have not been able to access accurate information about the job they are about to do. It is dangerous for those law enforcement personnel.  We need to find ways to bridge this gap. We need to find ways so that police officers doing their job can get the information that they need. To do that we have created the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. This brings our intelligence analyst capabilities together with our datasets when we merged the Australian Crime Commission with CrimTrac. We are also merging into that new entity the Australian Institute of Criminology to give the ACIC all of the resources that it needs to be able to do this job of providing timely criminal intelligence to Australia's law enforcement community. This bill brings together the national criminal intelligence, analysis and research capabilities and specifically it merges what used to be the Australian Institute of Criminology into the new entity. We see great opportunity in combining the resources of the Australian Institute of Criminology and the ACIC to provide Australian law enforcement agencies with central access to a consolidated and comprehensive criminal research and intelligence resource. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission has actually commenced operations-it did so on 1 July this year-as a result of the merger of CrimTrac and the Australian Crime Commission. Bringing three of our nation's justice, law enforcement and intelligence agencies together does significantly enhance support for law enforcement around the country and bolster Australia's response to serious and organised crime and national security issues. The new agency allows police, justice agencies and policymakers at all levels of government to adopt a more effective, efficient and evidence based response to crime. Implementation model Following the merger, the AIC will form a new research branch of the ACIC-the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre-which is headed up by a senior criminologist. With increased access to classified information, research conducted by the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre is expected to have increased value and relevance for Australian policy decision-making. It will provide an enhanced evidence base to support a proactive and targeted response to crime by all of Australia's law enforcement community. The research centre's activities will continue to be subject to peer review to maintain the ACIC's capability to produce independent research in order to inform evidence based policy. While some of the criminological research may be aligned with law enforcement's highlevel priorities, the remit of the ACIC's criminological function will continue to be widely defined as crime and justice issues of national significance, extending beyond purely law enforcement. The Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will also continue to carry out some of the AIC's national monitoring programs, including the national deaths in custody program, and will continue to carry out commissioned research on a fee-for-service basis. Key measures The bill contains a number of measures that would give effect to these proposed arrangements for the merged agency. Primarily, this bill amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (ACC Act) to enable the ACIC to carry out the AIC's research work. This includes conducting criminology research, sharing that research and other resources, such as the JV Barry library, with the  private sector and the public, and holding seminars and conferences on important research issues. Recognising the importance of making research available to the research community and the Australian public, the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will continue to have access to the datasets currently available to the AIC, and will continue to make that data and research available in the same way that the AIC did. The bill also amends the ACC Act to ensure that the ACIC is able to charge for commissioned research, as the AIC did, with charges paid into the Criminology Research Special Account. This will enable states, territories, universities and other interested organisations to continue to commission specific work from the merged agency, as they have from the AIC. The bill also repeals the Criminology Research Act 1971 to abolish the AIC as an independent statutory agency. As the position of the AIC director will not be required postmerger, the provisions dealing with this position are not replicated in the ACC Act. Criminology Research Advisory Council Subsequent to the merger, the ACIC board will become responsible for determining the ACIC's high-level research priorities. However, in setting these priorities the ACIC board will take advice from a non-legislated advisory body, comprising of existing Criminology Research Advisory Council members (being state and territory justice agencies and the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department), two law enforcement representatives, two members from the ACIC and a representative from the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology. This will ensure that state and territory justice agencies continue to play an important role in shaping the future direction of the merged agency's criminological research program. Conclusion The bill implements an important consolidation of Australia's criminal research and intelligence capabilities. The merger will enable the ACIC to better fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around the country. Similarly, the new Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre held within the ACIC will continue to prepare and disseminate world-leading criminological research, which informs our understanding of the trends and developments in crime and justice. I therefore commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",56
Ms LEY,BILLS," I move:  That this bill be now read a second time. Today we introduce legislation that signals another significant step towards Australians accessing a safe, legal and reliable supply of medicinal cannabis product for the management of painful and chronic conditions. Australia is now on track to have a nationally-consistent licensing scheme regulating the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal or scientific processes. It is another example of the Turnbull government taking on challenging reform and delivering what we promised. It is also another example of the Turnbull government working with the parliament to deliver sensible changes benefiting Australians in need. But we must also ensure, in undertaking this important reform, time and consideration is taken to protect the wider community against the possibility of unintended consequences. As mentioned at the start of this speech, the Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill is the next step in this process and contains amendments to protect the integrity of the medicinal cannabis scheme. Cannabis is a crop of significant interest to criminal elements and preventing infiltration of organised crime into the legitimate medicinal cannabis industry must be a priority for the Commonwealth. As members will well remember, the Narcotic Drugs Act was amended earlier this year to create a regime to allow for the first time the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for the purposes of providing access by Australians to medicinal cannabis. As I said at the time, it is important that we have an effective national licensing system to enable a sustainable supply of safe medicinal cannabis product to Australian patients in the future. An important element of such a system is ensuring that only those who are 'fit and proper' can be granted a licence. The Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill contains additional amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act to protect sensitive law enforcement information used in making licensing decisions so that infiltration by criminal elements into the medicinal cannabis scheme can be prevented. It is critical to ensure that participants in the medicinal cannabis scheme are of good character and repute. This is an important part of the antidiversion controls for the scheme and allows the Commonwealth to comply with our obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. The Commonwealth is working with law enforcement agencies from all jurisdictions to put in place arrangements for the sharing of information around the suitability of licence applicants. The Commonwealth accepts that there are limitations to what types of information can be shared through such arrangements, but remains committed to protecting the integrity of the scheme. The primary purpose of the Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Bill is to put in place protection for information provided by law enforcement agencies used in decision making under the act. These protections prevent the disclosure of 'sensitive law enforcement information', the improper release of which could have the effect of disrupting criminal investigations, revealing law enforcement intelligence gathering and investigative techniques or exposing the lives of people involved in criminal investigations to risk. Leaks of this type  of information can have serious implications for the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies and so it is in the public interest to prevent this from occurring. The provisions in the bill prevent the release of sensitive law enforcement information to the applicant, their lawyers and to the public at large when decisions are being made on whether to grant or revoke licences. The bill also carries protections against release of this information during related tribunal and court proceedings. The bill creates offences with harsh penalties for revealing sensitive law enforcement information, except within some very narrow confines including, for instance, where it is necessary to allow its use for the proper administration of the Narcotic Drugs Act licensing provisions. The bill also includes provisions to allow the secretary to refuse to grant a licence where the applicant has provided false or misleading information; to provide for the making of standards and guidelines to support the detailed elements of the scheme; to allow for the revocation of licences and permits where applicable standards are not met; and to allow for the supply of cannabis seeds grown in the course of medicinal cannabis research to be supplied to other cultivator licence holders for further propagation purposes. In February this year, this parliament supported the introduction of the legislation to enable the legal cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purpose, in order to supply Australian patients and to comply with our international obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. These amendments are necessary so that licences are only issued to persons who will work to meet these objectives. The risk of criminal elements diverting precious medicine to illicit uses is too great-this would be detrimental to the patients who would benefit from the availability of medicinal cannabis and would mean that the government sanctioned system would be creating another public health risk. Without this bill, law enforcement agencies around the country will be reluctant to engage with the Commonwealth in providing the necessary information to manage these risks. These agencies understand and support the need for this cultivation scheme; but they rightly can only participate fully if doing so will not compromise their own activities. The cultivation licensing scheme commences on 30 October 2016. It is intended that these amendments commence at the same time to ensure that scheme endorsed by the parliament in February can operate effectively. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",58
Ms LEY,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time.  There is no existing medicinal cannabis industry as cannabis is currently an illegal narcotic drug. Allowing for the creation and existence of a legitimate industry provides a benefit to that industry by opening a new market for commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of medicinal cannabis products. It is appropriate to seek to recover the direct costs that government incurs in regulating the medicinal cannabis industry through both direct fee recovery and through the imposition of levies. Direct fee recovery for services specific to a holder of a licence for cultivation, production or manufacture will be implemented by way of regulations made under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. The imposition of charges, typically on an annual basis, to capture the indirect costs associated with regulating this industry do, however, require separate legislation, thus the Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Bill. Charges (or levies) under this bill include those where costs cannot otherwise reasonably be assigned directly to a particular licence holder. For example, the annual charges will fund risk based inspections across industry. While direct fees will be applied for standard and regular inspections of cannabis cultivation and production facilities (such as those required to provide an initial licence), risk based inspections are typically unannounced and will vary in frequency. They are designed to target licence holders where there are concerns over their compliance with licence conditions, regulations or the legislation. Through this, all licensees participating in the new cannabis cultivation industry will benefit, as the Department of Health is able to ensure that none gain an advantage that might otherwise eventuate if a company were about to breach the strict conditions placed on its licence; conditions designed to ensure that Australia prevents the diversion of cannabis to illicit purposes and fulfils its obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. This bill establishes the legal authority to develop regulations that will contain the actual proposed charges. The scheme for the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes commences on 30 October 2016. It is important that the government is able to communicate on the full regulatory costs of this scheme as soon as possible in order to allow potential applicants to plan their businesses and complete their applications. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Social Services Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Student Payments) Bill 2016 First Reading  Bill read a first time. Second Reading  That this bill be now read a second time.  This bill will introduce a package of measures announced in the 2016-17 budget that will simplify student payments by: ï· aligning means testing rules for student payments with other welfare payments; ï· automatically issuing healthcare cards to recipients of student payments, by removing the requirement for a separate application; and ï· automatically updating the geographical classification which is used to assess qualification for youth allowance and qualification for, and the rate of payment of, the Relocation Scholarship. Youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy living allowances are income support payments that provide financial assistance to full-time students and apprentices. The payments are designed to encourage people to undertake further education and training to enhance their employment and career prospects. In the 2015-16 budget, the government committed over $60 million to commence the replacement of the ageing Centrelink IT system to support future welfare reform. The measures in this bill support payment simplification and future welfare reform by aligning payments settings, simplifying the administration of payments and making eligibility for student payments and concessions fairer and easier to understand. The government will continue to provide assistance for students and those most in need. The changes will not affect the overall value of student payments. Aligning means testing rules The first measure, aligning means testing rules, aims to simplify means testing and remove anomalies between student payments and other welfare payments. This measure is set to commence from 1 January 2017 and will be achieved through a number of means. Firstly, the family tax benefit income test and the youth parental income test will be harmonised, so that family tax benefit income details can be automatically reused for the youth parental income test. Parents will no longer be required to resubmit their income information to support a youth payment claim by one of their children. Secondly, the integrity of the student payments means test will be improved by removing an anomaly that allows some partnered youth allowance and Austudy recipients to be subject to a more generous assets test than applies to all other youth allowance and Austudy recipients. Integrity will also be improved by extending the trust and company rules that already apply to all other income support payments, to student payments. As a result, all of the income or assets held by students through a trust or company will be taken into account when establishing their entitlement to a payment. Lastly, the pension income test exemption for regular gifts from immediate family members will be aligned across the social security system so that it also applies for student payments and other social security benefits. Extending this exemption will remove a disincentive for families to provide support to family members. For dependent students, the parental means test already reduces a dependent child's youth payment where a parent has the ability to provide support, and it is simply not  logical or equitable to further reduce the youth payment when the parent provides the expected support. This measure will result in savings of $778,000 over the forward estimates. Simplifying eligibility for the healthcare card issued to students The second measure in this bill will ensure that from 1 January 2019 all students receiving income support will receive a concession card. This change will allow all students receiving youth allowance (student), Austudy and Abstudy living allowances to automatically receive a healthcare card. This will guarantee that around 240,000 students will receive Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions at the concessional rate and access to the lower threshold of the extended Medicare safety net when they receive a student payment. It will also provide greater access to bulk billing allowing students to focus on their studies without worrying about their medical costs. This measure will improve consistency by aligning access to concession cards for students with other income support recipients. Under the current rules, students are the only income support recipients not to qualify for an automatic issue healthcare card. Instead, students can make a claim for a low income healthcare card if their income is below a certain limit. This process is burdensome for students and costly for the Department of Human Services to administer. The automatic issue healthcare card and the low income healthcare card provide the same Australian government benefits to cardholders. In 2016, holders of the healthcare card and low income healthcare card pay only $6.20 for each Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription. Without a concession card these prescriptions could cost students up to $38.30 each. Access to a concession card means that once these students and their families' total out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions reach the concessional Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net of $372 or 60 prescriptions, they may receive Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription items free of charge for the rest of the calendar year. These free Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions are not available to people without a concession card. In 2016, the annual threshold for both healthcare card and low income healthcare card holders for the extended Medicare safety net is $647.90, instead of $2,030 for noncardholders. Once the threshold has been met, Medicare will pay for 80 per cent of any further out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the calendar year for services including general practitioner and specialist attendances, as well as many pathology and diagnostic imaging services. Currently, the application for the low income healthcare card requires students to meet a more stringent income test, with the student needing to earn slightly less than the income limit for youth allowance over an eight-week period. This measure will also extend these benefits to around 4,000 students who previously were not eligible for a concession card. Currently, in most circumstances, student payment recipients must wait eight weeks to become eligible for a low income healthcare card. This measure will ensure concessions are available to all students as soon as they start receiving an income support payment.  In order to avoid waiting eight weeks to become eligible for a low income healthcare card, currently an applicant of a student payment can provide proof that their income was below the relevant limit in the previous eight weeks. Following introduction of this measure, students will no longer be required to produce this proof to be eligible for a concession card. Not only does this measure guarantee that student payment recipients will receive health-related concessions, it will cut red tape and reduce reporting requirements for these students. The financial impact of this measure over the forward estimates will be a cost of $726,000. Automatically updating the geographical classification The third measure in this bill will, from 1 January 2017, simplify the process for adopting the latest version of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard remoteness structure published by the Australian Statistician which is used in the assessment of eligibility for student payments under the Social Security Act 1991. Currently, youth allowance recipients whose family home is in a location geographically categorised under the remoteness structure as inner regional Australia, outer regional Australia, remote Australia or very remote Australia can access additional benefits or concessional qualification requirements under the Social Security Act that are not available to students from major city areas. These additional benefits are: ï· qualification for youth allowance on the basis of being independent under the concessional workforce participation arrangements, provided their parental income is below $150,000 and they are required to live away from home to study; and ï· qualification for the relocation scholarship at the rate at which it is paid for dependent youth allowance recipients and some independent recipients. The relocation scholarship is paid to eligible youth allowance recipients undertaking higher education to assist with the costs of moving away from home to study. These additional benefits are in recognition that students from regional and remote areas are more likely to have to relocate to study and therefore have significantly lower participation rates in higher education than students from major city areas. The geographical remoteness structure currently used in the Social Security Act to determine eligibility for these additional benefits is the 2006 Australian Standard Geographic Classification published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The 2006 remoteness structure has been used to determine eligibility for student payments since 2011. However, the 2006 remoteness structure is out of date and was subsequently superseded, in January 2013, by the 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard remoteness structure. The remoteness structure is updated every five years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, following each census. The next update, which will be to the 2016 remoteness structure, is due in January 2018. This measure will introduce amendments to the Social Security Act so that qualification for student payments will automatically draw upon the updated remoteness structure without the need for future legislative amendment when a new Australian Statistical Geography Standard remoteness structure or any replacement remoteness structure is published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard remoteness structure will apply from 1 January 2017, with the 2016 version having effect from the first 1 January or 1 July to occur after the day of its publication. This will ensure that the assessment of  qualification for youth allowance and the relocation scholarship is based on the latest available information on geographical classification. This measure will result in some students, who were previously ineligible for payment, being able to qualify for youth allowance under the concessional workforce participation arrangements and the relocation scholarship, and they may qualify for a higher rate of the relocation scholarship. It is expected that the numbers of students who are found ineligible for youth allowance under the concessional workforce participation independence criteria due to a change in the remoteness structure will be very small, and they may still qualify for youth allowance as a dependent or under one of the other independence criteria. Students who are no longer eligible for the relocation scholarship due to their family home being reclassified as located in a major city area rather than a regional location will still retain access to youth allowance provided they continue to meet the qualification criteria. Students who had previously qualified for youth allowance under the concessional workforce participation independence criteria using an earlier remoteness structure will not have their qualification for youth allowance reassessed if their family home is classified as in a major city location of Australia under an updated remoteness structure. These students will retain their independent status. The reclassification of areas is unlikely to have lasting or recurrent effects on students' payment eligibility given the cycle of five-yearly updates of the geographical classification document and that on average tertiary courses are completed in three to four years. This measure is expected to have a cost-neutral effect on the budget over the forward estimates. Conclusion Together these measures will assist in simplifying the payment system and support future welfare reform. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2016 Measures No. 2) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms O'Dwyer. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",60
Ms ODWYER,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill reintroduces measures that were introduced by the government earlier this year but lapsed when the last parliament was prorogued. The bill, which contains four schedules, amends various taxation laws to improve their flexibility and effectiveness while reducing red tape on individuals, businesses and community organisations.  Schedule 1 to this bill establishes a remedial power for the Commissioner of Taxation, to allow for a more timely resolution of certain unforeseen or unintended outcomes in the taxation and superannuation laws. Schedule 2 improves the flexibility of the income tax averaging rules for farmers, allowing income averaging to reapply 10 years after a farmer has chosen to opt out, rather than permanently excluding them from the benefits of averaging as is currently the case. Schedule 3 will amend the luxury car tax to provide tax relief to certain public institutions that import or acquire cars for the sole purpose of public display. Schedule 4 makes a number of minor amendments across the tax and superannuation laws to provide certainty for taxpayers. Schedule 1 of this bill will establish a remedial power for the Commissioner of Taxation to allow for a more timely resolution of certain unforeseen or unintended outcomes in the laws under the commissioner's administration. The government announced on 1 May 2015 that it would provide more certainty and better outcomes for taxpayers and reduce the regulatory burden on them by providing the commissioner with a remedial power. Taxation laws are very complex. The nature and volume of taxation law can produce unforeseen and unintended outcomes in its application. These outcomes can result in taxpayers generating tax liabilities where this was not intended, or taxpayers being subject to record keeping or other compliance requirements that were not intended or are no longer necessary. These outcomes can create significant uncertainty and compliance costs. The commissioner endeavours to interpret the law to give effect to its purpose or object, but instances remain where this is not possible. For example, this can occur when dealing with new scenarios or scenarios which were not contemplated when the provisions were originally drafted. Unintended outcomes may be addressed through changes to the primary law. However, law change is resource intensive and is undertaken to give effect to the full range of government priorities. It can therefore be ill suited to resolving smaller unintended outcomes. The challenge of effecting primary law change is illustrated by the 92 announced changes to the tax and superannuation law that had not been enacted at the time the government was elected in September 2013. Had the remedial power existed, it may have been able to address some of the smaller unintended outcomes and could have allowed constrained legislative resources to deal with more significant primary law change. The remedial power allows the commissioner to make a disallowable legislative instrument to modify the operation of a taxation law to ensure the law can be administered to achieve its intended purpose or object. This will help to create flexibility, allowing the commissioner to resolve smaller unintended outcomes. The delegation of this power to the commissioner must be subject to the necessary checks and balances.  Importantly, parliament has oversight of all instruments made under this power. Instruments would not take effect until after the expiry of the parliamentary disallowance period. Safeguards are built into the remedial power itself. The power can only be used where: ï· the modification is not inconsistent with the purpose or object of the provision; ï· the commissioner considers the modification to be reasonable, having regard to both the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision and whether the costs of complying with the provision are disproportionate to achieving the intended purpose or object; and ï· any impact on the Commonwealth budget would be negligible. Any modification to the law will not apply to a taxpayer if the taxpayer would be adversely affected. The proposed power is to be used as a power of last resort, when unintended consequences cannot be ameliorated by the commissioner in any other way. In the past, there have been instances where there has been a misalignment between the stated purpose of a particular provision and the technical language adopted in the legislation. In these instances the commissioner has not been able to address these issues or administer the legislation in a way that gives effect to its intended object or purpose. This measure provides an avenue for efficient resolution of these issues, as and when they arise, and fits well with the existing commitment by the commissioner to administer taxation legislation in accordance with the stated policy intent. The measure will allow a smooth administration of the taxation and superannuation laws, in particular, when dealing with smaller unintended or unforeseen outcomes. This measure will assist in cutting red tape and provide greater support for taxpayers across Australia. Similarly, schedule 2 amends the law so that farmers can re-access the benefits of tax averaging 10 income years after they decided to opt out of the system for year-to-year smoothing of primary production income taxation. This change is necessary to ensure the rules do not continue to permanently and unnecessarily exclude eligible farmers from the benefits of income averaging. Currently, a farmer who chooses to opt out of income averaging can never re-access the scheme. Farmers' income is often volatile due to factors outside of their control, such as drought and fluctuating commodity prices. The averaging rules even out a farmer's income tax liability from year to year, so that they pay fairer amounts of tax in relation to taxpayers on comparable but steadier incomes. The government heard from stakeholders in consultation that the current averaging rules are inflexible and do not make sufficient allowance for changing business circumstances. A farmer choosing to opt out of income averaging may later realise that this choice was no longer appropriate for their circumstances-for example, they may not have anticipated future income volatility, acted on the basis of poor advice, or assumed they would experience many years of declining income. Currently, these farmers can never re-access the concession, even where they remain in primary production and face volatilities from market conditions and natural disasters.  While it makes sense to have rules that prevent farmers from opting in and out of income averaging simply to gain tax benefits, a permanent exclusion is longer than necessary to prevent possible abuse of the concession. Over the past four decades, the value of agricultural output has been 2Â½ times more volatile than the average for all the major sectors of the Australian economy. Australian farmers also experience greater volatility in yield and price than most other farmers in the world. The government recognises the need for Australia's tax system to account for the agriculture sector's operating environment. This schedule will benefit farmers as averaging will only recommence when they are eligible for a tax offset. A farmer may always choose to opt out again if it does not suit their circumstances to remain in income averaging. Their choice will be effective for another 10 income years. This change was announced in the Agricultural competitiveness white paper on 4 July 2015 and is the product of extensive stakeholder feedback and consultation. Schedule 3 amends the luxury car tax to provide tax relief to certain public institutions that import or acquire cars for the sole purpose of public display. Currently, if a public museum or art gallery imports a car for display and it is over the $64,132 threshold, the museum or gallery will have to pay the luxury car tax. This bill implements the 2015-16 budget measure allowing public museums and public art galleries that have been endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as a deductible gift recipient to acquire cars free of the luxury car tax. Relief from the luxury car tax will only be available for cars acquired solely for the purpose of public display. The cars must be exhibited or shown in an environment that is accessible to the general community-for example, display in a museum that is open to the general public. Finally, schedule 4 makes a number of amendments to tax and superannuation laws to provide certainty for taxpayers. These amendments make sure that the law operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects, removing anomalies, and addressing unintended outcomes. This furthers the government's commitment to restore simplicity and fairness to the Australian tax system, and to the care and maintenance of the law. By clarifying the law and repealing unnecessary provisions, these amendments also reduce the regulatory burden and make it easier for Australians to access current law. These amendments include: ï· updating the specific listings of deductible gift recipients to reflect name changes as advised by the listed organisations, which ensures these entities continue to attract public financial support for their activities; and ï· repealing 45 inoperative amending acts relating to excise, reducing regulatory burdens for Australians. This bill is aimed at better targeting and strengthening our tax system to ensure that it is fair and sustainable. Further details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.  Debate adjourned. Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016 Statute Update Bill 2016 Corporations Amendment (Auditor Registration) Bill 2016 Reference to Federation Chamber",65
Ms MARINO,BILLS," I declare that, at the adjournment of the debate on each of the following bills, the bills stand referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration: Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016, Statute Update Bill 2016 and the Corporations Amendment (Auditor Registration) Bill 2016. Statute Law Revision Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",69
Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," This bill is called the Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016, but it did not appear in the parliament this spring. No, a bill that was almost identical to this was introduced into the last parliament, on 17 March this year-so, not actually spring 2016; rather, autumn 2016. The bill has reappeared as part of the Prime Minister's so-called 25-point battle plan, 25 reforms which we have been told would have to be rushed through this parliament as a matter of priority. It is consistent with the dithering and general incompetence of this government that here we are now looking at a bill-an entirely routine bill that it would be impossible to describe as a matter or priority-first introduced into the last parliament, on 17 March this year. Labor is happy to support this bill, which does no more than implement a range of drafting amendments across this Commonwealth statute book. Happily, on this occasion the government-other than calling it part of the Prime Minister's 25-point battle plan-has not seen it necessary to dress this bill up as part of some huge war on regulation or bonfire of regulation. I say this because, back in March 2014, the government was desperate to be seen as an anti-red-tape government, when it has been nothing of the kind; it is increasing the size of the Commonwealth regulation book and increasing the size of the Commonwealth statute book. But so keen was the former incarnation of this government, the Abbott government, to claim that it was an anti-regulatory government that it dressed up entirely routine legislation like this, a statute law revision bill, as part of some huge attack on regulation. Bills of this kind are of course part of the routine work of any parliament. The first statute law revision bill appeared in this parliament in 1931, introduced by the then Attorney General, Sir John Latham, and statute law revision bills have been part of the work of the House of Commons since the late 19th century. No government should attempt to pretend, as the former, Abbott government did, that this is somehow a work of miraculous importance. It is simply part of the routine work of any parliament. This particular statute law revision bill, the relabelled Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill, makes a number of technical changes to existing acts of the Australian parliament. It  corrects drafting, clerical and typographical errors. An example would be correcting the numbering in the Excise Act and replacing the words 'a item' with 'an item' in the Customs Act. It amends the Public Lending Right Act by replacing references to 'the Attorney-General' with the more flexible 'minister administering the Copyright Act', and it repeals a number of spent and obsolete provisions. All of these are worthwhile measures; all of them are aimed at improving the ease of understanding of Commonwealth law. I commend the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the diligent and thorough work that they do which produces bills like the Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill. The Prime Minister should be embarrassed that his stocks have sunk so low, that his government is so adrift, that he has to dress up routine legislative work like this as some kind of policy masterstroke. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned.",69
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," As per the declaration of the Chief Government Whip, the bill is referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration at a later date. Statute Update Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",70
Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," This bill, the Statute Update Bill 2016, is really in a similar category to the bill to which I have just spoken. Like the previous bill, it has been dressed up by this government as part of the 25-point battle plan that, as we were told in late August, the Prime Minister 'will challenge the parliament to fast-track'. He described it as a challenge to 'fast-track 25 priority reforms in a policy onslaught'. This particular bill was one in the 25-point battle plan. One has to say that for this bill to be described as urgent is pretty much as laughable as describing the previous bill that was before the House as urgent. This bill, like the last bill, was first introduced on 17 March and unfortunately lapsed on the proroguing of parliament for the election. Far from being urgent, it was simply not given any debating time in the last parliament. It is not part of some tremendous policy reform. It is not part of a policy reform at all. This bill implements a range of drafting amendments across the Commonwealth statute book. The amendments, I think it is fair to say, would properly be described as having little if any legal effect. They are matters that are largely of drafting style. That said, it is very important that the Commonwealth's statute book is tweaked and reviewed and examined, and amended if necessary, to make sure that at all times the law is as clear and coherent and comprehensible as possible. Of course it is the case that courts, officials, lawyers and the general public should be able to understand the effect of the law as easily as possible. The Statute Update Bill makes some changes that assist with that task and, for that reason, Labor is happy to support it.  But let us be very clear about this: this is not part of some vast attack by the Liberal government on regulation. It is not part of the anti-red tape push-nothing of the kind. It is certainly not something that could be described in any sense as a priority reform or as part of a policy onslaught. The idea that it would form part of a 25-point battle plan introduced by this Prime Minister is laughable. It is not groundbreaking reform. It is not bold policy action. The Prime Minister, again, should be embarrassed. On the anniversary of his accession to the job, the Prime Minister should be embarrassed that his stocks have sunk so low, that his government is so adrift and that he has to dress up routine legislative work like this as some kind of policy masterstroke-let alone that it should be part of a 25-point battle plan. Heaven help Australia if the battle plan of our government needs to consist of bills like the two that have just been before the House: the Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016 and this bill, the Statute Update Bill 2016. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Corporations Amendment (Auditor Registration) Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",70
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The question is that the bill be read a second time and I call the member for Fenner.,71
Dr LEIGH,BILLS," Thank you, Deputy Speaker Kelly. I commend you on remembering the changed name of my seat! I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Auditor Registration) Bill 2016. I am delighted to have the opportunity to outline Labor's position with respect to this bill. The bill, as presented, is worthy of the support this House and, indeed, enjoyed Labor's support when introduced to the House in the last parliament. But, like so much of the legislation that was before the House, it was trampled in the rush to the polls the Prime Minister engaged in for his own political benefit. When will that joint sitting take place? Australians are thinking to themselves, 'Well, we had a double dissolution. Doesn't a double dissolution normally get followed by a joint sitting?' Mr Stephen Jones: He prorogued it!",71
Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"As the member for Whitlam said, the parliament was prorogued for a very specific purpose and yet, now, surprisingly little is heard of that joint sitting. This bill could have been passed in the 44th Parliament, as it enjoyed bipartisan support. That is not the first bill this week that I have said that of-I spoke on another bill, just yesterday, that enjoyed bipartisan support but whose reforms were delayed. Indeed, the income tax cut for Australians earning over $80,000 a year was deferred. Australians will miss out on the first three months of benefit from that income tax cut as a result of this government trampling bills in its wake as it raced to the polls. In this case, the bill's contents are fairly technical, but they go to the heart of ensuring we have a robust and stable financial system. As is appropriate, the federal government imposes regulatory requirements on the conduct of registered company auditors, whether individuals  or firms, in an effort to safeguard investors and to improve the integrity and stability of our financial system and the broader economy. This bill seeks to assist in those efforts by addressing the legal consequences of not registering, in contravention of the Legislation Act 2003, the approval by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in November 2004 of one these auditing competency standards. ASIC approved an auditing competency standard in 2004, produced by Chartered Practicing Accountants Australia-what is now known as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. But the Legislation Act 2003 required that legislative instruments made in 2004 were registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments and in the case of the aforementioned CPA/ICAA standard, this did not occur. The failure to lodge the instrument has had the effect that the CPA/ICAA standard is taken to have been repealed. The practical effect of that is that from 2 December 2005 the legal validity of auditors registered in reliance on the standard has been uncertain. This bill remedies that by amending the Corporations Act to retrospectively ensure that the Legislation Act has always had effect, as if approval of the CPA/ICAA competency standard had been lodged and registered immediately after it was given, and that all other requirements of the Legislation Act are taken to have been met. Retrospective legislation is rarely acceptable to this side of the House, but, in an instance in which we are clarifying widely understood practice, it is indeed appropriate. That is what this bill before the House does, and I am pleased to say that it enjoys bipartisan support in the 45th Parliament, as it did in the 44th Parliament. Debate adjourned. NA Rearrangement",71
Mr HAWKE,BUSINESS," I move: That business intervening before order of the day No. 8, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Consideration resumed of the motion: That the following Address in Reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament",72
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," Before I call the honourable member for Calare, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend him the usual courtesies.",72
Mr GEE,BUSINESS," I was born in the country, I was raised in the country, I am of the country and I believe in the future of country Australia. That is the reason I stand before you today. For the past five years, country communities of central-western New South Wales  have put their faith and trust in me as their representative in our state parliament, and I am deeply honoured that those communities, and more still, have put their faith and trust in me to represent them in this place, our national parliament. When we are young, we all have dreams and goals, but I never once thought that I would be standing here today in this House delivering this address. It is a responsibility as heavy as it is humbling. In my time in state politics, I saw constituents in their worse hours of need and I was privileged to be there with them in their moments of triumph. In the same way, I saw politicians soaring to their best, and I have also seen some at their worse. After five years of serving the communities of the west and being entrusted as their representative, there is one thing about politics that I know to be true: life is short, and we are all just here in a blink of history's eye-and political careers are even shorter than that. So, while we are occupying these positions, we need to get things done. Politics is not about the offices we hold or the titles we have; it is about delivering lasting benefits that make life better for the people that we represent. That is the very essence of politics. There is also something I know to be true about country politics: country people want and expect their representatives to stand up and fight for them. They do not mind if you do not always carry the day or if you get knocked down trying, but they expect you to fight the fight, to stand up and fight for them. And country Australia certainly needs its champions. The seat of Calare lies in central-western New South Wales. It is one of the most vibrant places in Australia. It is a wine region, an education hub, a mining electorate, a tourist destination and the food basket of the nation. The gateway to the Golden West is the city of Lithgow, and a warmer welcome to the country you will not find anywhere. Then there is the beautiful high-country town of Oberon, famous for its trout fishing and the nearby Jenolan Caves. At the heart of the electorate are two bustling regional centres. There is Bathurst, the spiritual home of motor racing in Australia, and also Orange, which, like Mudgee, is famed for its wineries and restaurants. To the west of Mudgee is Gulgong, the keeper of the memory and spirit of Henry Lawson, a town with a big heart. Then comes the beautiful Wellington Valley and historic Wellington itself. In between Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and Mudgee are many towns and villages, such as Portland, Wallerawang, Blayney, Cargo, Canowindra, Cudal, Cumnock, Manildra, Molong, Geurie, Mumbil-home of the famous 'ChuckAkubra' championship-Sofala, Stuart Town and Hill End. Some are full of history; others are full of industry. But each is unique in its own way. Our electorate is blessed with natural beauty, from its rugged high country to its fertile fields of plenty that help feed our state and our nation. The lamb and beef on your dinner table, or the wine that you enjoy with it, may well have come from the Calare electorate. The apples, cherries, flour or canola oil that you buy in the supermarket were probably also grown or made in the central west. We aim to please in the central west, and if it is Tic Tacs or Nutella that you enjoy-and I have to confess I am partial to both-they were definitely made in Lithgow. Or, if Australia's iconic Chiko roll is more to your liking-I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister and, dare I say it, the Prime Minister himself, would all be fans of the Chiko roll-it is made in Bathurst. The produce and products of our region find their way all over the world. Our electorate is as big as it is diverse. It is the heartland of Australia, and those of us who live there could not be prouder to call it home. All of it-every city, every town, every village  and place in between-is Wiradjuri country, part of the great Wiradjuri nation, with its rich and vibrant culture and a bond with Calare and the wider region which spans tens of thousands of years, and it is as old as it is resilient. Our electorate lies on the western side of the Great Dividing Range-the 'sandstone curtain', as we call it. It is not only a physical divide between the city and the country but, for many in the regions, it represents a divide of opportunity, of representation, of development and of population between those east of it and those west of it. Nowhere is that divide greater than in education. Our country kids have fallen behind their city cousins on almost every measure. This imbalance, this unfairness, this inequity of opportunity, cannot be allowed to continue. I believe that a funding model specifically targeted at country schools in Australia needs to be part of any future discussion about raising education standards. The great divide exists in access to medical services. People in the country have shorter lives than those in the cities. We have worse outcomes for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental health and obesity. We die younger, and that is the cold hard truth. The divide exists, all right. People in the cities take going to the doctor for granted, but in some of our country communities it can still take weeks just to see a general practitioner. One way we can bridge that particular divide is by training more doctors for the country, in the country, and the university that wants to do just that is the regionally based Charles Sturt University, through the Murray Darling Medical School to be based at Orange, Wagga and Bendigo. The dream of a country medical school hosted by a country university has been years in the making, and I am here to tell you that the dream is still alive. I will be doing everything I can to make that happen. The great divide exists in social disadvantage. The central west and Calare are dynamic and prosperous, but the reality is that country electorates host some of the most socially disadvantaged communities in Australia. Many in those places feel forgotten and overlooked by their wider communities and many have continually put their faith and trust in not only me but the National Party to have their voices heard. Over the past five years, I like to think I worked hard to make sure those people and those communities did have a voice and that their voices were heard, and I recommit to that today. They will not be forgotten on my watch. There is no better way to literally bridge the great divide than to build a new expressway over the top of it or, indeed, tunnel underneath it-or both! A Bells Line of Road expressway from Sydney's north-west into Lithgow would open up the communities of the west. Let us not dither for another generation. If the money for an expressway cannot be found at present, the federal government needs to follow the lead of the New South Wales government in putting some serious funding down to help upgrade that road now. It is not impossible. We have had some success in recent times in finding scarce funding for projects the doomsayers and naysayers said would never happen. And I will also be aiming for funding for another Holy Grail of unfinished road projects in the central west: the famed crossing at Dixons Long Point between Orange and Mudgee, a project 80 years in the making. If the great divide is truly to be bridged, policies of decentralisation need to be actively pursued. The National Party has blazed the trail for decentralisation. One policy both state and federal governments should consider is zonal taxation-meaning income tax, company tax and payroll tax concessions or rebates to encourage people to move to the country. The National Party was born of the vision that we should right the imbalances  between the city and the country, that we should be bridging that great divide. That is why I joined the Nationals. All Nationals are trustees of that vision and of that hope. Our electorate is no stranger to adversity. Our farmers and orchardists have battled crippling drought, scorching fires, crop-destroying rains, exchange rates, fruit bats and, yes, even meddling bureaucrats. Our vignerons in recent times have been battling dwindling returns for their fruit. We have had mining job losses and manufacturing job losses. But through it all our communities carry on, because the one characteristic of the people of the central west that shines more brightly than any other is their generosity of spirit. Whether it be passing the hat around or rolling up their sleeves for their neighbours, our communities care about each other and we look after each other. While we have taken our fair share of knocks, our communities have never let misfortune or adversity define us. Instead, we look to the future with optimism, with energy and with initiative. The economy of Australia is changing. The economy of the world is changing and we have to change with it. Innovation is important. The services sector is important. But the reality is we are not all going to be providing financial services to our northern neighbours or serving skinny mochaccinos and flaming mojitos to city folk and tourists-certainly not where I come from! Call me old fashioned, but I believe in production and the idea that the wealth of this nation is built on what we make, on what we grow and on what we sell. Certainly, the wealth of Australia can never be built on the back of real estate booms. On a per capita basis, no area has been hit harder by manufacturing job losses than ours. Orange recently lost Australia's last fridge making plant, Electrolux, which departed to Thailand. Bathurst recently lost rail engineering firm Downer EDI. However, I am not one of those who believe we should give up on manufacturing. What we, as a country, need to do is identify what we are good at and then hone our efforts and our taxation regime accordingly. We need a targeted, national manufacturing strategy. Other countries with high labour costs have been able to do it and we can too. In central western New South Wales one thing we do lead the world in is primary production. We are the food basket of the nation, yet the vast majority of agricultural commodities produced in the central west leave the region without any value adding. Food processing is one potential growth area for both Australia and Calare. In Calare we look to the future of primary production and agriculture in our region, which we need to be building and supporting. These days it is fashionable to talk about food security and the ability of our country to feed itself, but words about the importance of food security need to be backed up by deeds. Our region once boasted hundreds of orchards. In Orange we are down to just 30, and some of those were sold to foreign interests recently. One thing we could be doing right now, to show our farmers a future, is negotiate better export protocols to get our products into the vast Asian markets. We have seen many trade agreements struck in recent years that promise to benefit our nation. Trade agreements are all well and good but they mean nothing to our farmers unless export protocols can be negotiated that actually allow access to foreign markets for their products. First, we have the backpacker tax to deal with. Then, for me and our local orchardists, export protocols are the next frontier. One of the biggest impediments to future growth in the west is a lack of water security. We are going to need some federal help to get some of our ambitious water security projects out  of the feasibility stage and into the building phase. We also look to a future of continuing development of our local infrastructure-Wellington's new streetscape; Lithgow needs more aged-care beds, plus support for its CBD revitalisation project; Bathurst needs its second race track, a bike park and a rail museum; Mudgee needs its sporting complex expanded; and every community needs help to battle the scourge of ice. There are also some items of unfinished business that I am keen to pursue in my new capacity. They are a Wiradjuri cultural centre for Wellington-we got close a couple of years ago and we are not giving up-and a purpose built domestic violence refuge for Orange. In such a prosperous city, in such a prosperous state, such a refuge should not be too much to ask. The futures of our country communities depend on an energetic and engaged federal government. We need governments that actively work with country communities but do not intrude into every aspect of our lives or engage in the wholesale banning of things. That is not the country way. We need governments that support our small business people. Out in Calare it is they who personify a word which is richly laden with overtones of hard work, initiative and optimism. That word is 'enterprise'-a word that the people of my electorate know very well. Governments play a very important role in setting the environment for businesses and enterprise to thrive. And then, once that environment has been created, they can support business by getting out of the way rather than strangling it with ever increasing red and, more recently, green tape. While I am talking about the future, there is a lesson from our state colleagues that, I think, would benefit the future of this nation, and that is fixed four-year terms.",72
Mr Zimmerman,BUSINESS,"Hear, hear!",76
Mr GEE,BUSINESS,"Thank you, member for North Sydney. In this age where political cycles seem permanently set to fast-forward, I believe that the fixed four-year term can bring some needed stability to federal politics. I was born in Wagga WaggaMr MCCormack interjecting",76
Mr GEE,BUSINESS,"Was that the member for Riverina? It was, thank you. Whilst I was young, my family lived for a time in Nairobi, Kenya and also San Francisco. We eventually settled in Maitland, in the Hunter Valley. My parents by then operated a small business: a wholesale and retail nursery. It was my parents who taught me the value of hard work, initiative, perseverance and resilience. I was fortunate enough to attend Newcastle Grammar School. My modern history teacher was someone well-known to this side of politics in New South Wales, Patricia Forsythe. It was she who steered me towards Sydney University, St. Paul's College and politics, and she is with us here today. After I finished law school and commenced life as a solicitor, my brothers, David and Matthew, and I decided we would move to Asia and start our own business licensing consumer products and promotions for international entertainment companies. My brothers went to Singapore and I headed to Hong Kong. It was a long way from Largs in the Hunter  Valley. Building a business from scratch across multiple countries was hard work, but I look back on those years with pride, not least because my brothers and I did it together. When I returned to Australia, my first job as a solicitor was at the illustrious firm of Colin Biggers & Paisley, or 'the fighting CBP' as it is known to its many friends. There I was lucky enough to be schooled in the art of litigation by two outstanding solicitors, Antony Riordan and Alex Ostermayer, who are also in the gallery today. After completing my bar reading, I moved around the corner to Queen's Square Chambers in Macquarie Street. But the call of the country was strong. We wanted a better quality of life and a true sense of community, so my family, like so many before us, crossed the Great Divide to find a new life in the magnificent electorate of Calare. I practised as a barrister both there and in Sydney until the New South Wales election of 2011. The poet Banjo Paterson was born in Orange, just a short distance from our house. He then spent his early years at Buckinbah Station near Yeoval, also in the Calare electorate. Banjo was also a lawyer, and his poem Clancy of the Overflow is about escaping the city for life in the country. His words about swapping his 'dingy little office' for 'the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended' certainly resonate with me. National Party members are famed for their common sense and straight talking. They are the heart and soul of our party, and I am deeply grateful and humbled by all that our members across the branches of the Central West have done for me. When there have been times when I have been disappointed, or sometimes even exasperated, I have constantly drawn both inspiration and strength from our members, who have supported me and urged me to carry on. During the recent campaign I was particularly grateful for the help of our hardy band of 'cold warriors', who turned out to man prepoll in freezing conditions day in and day out. We even had snow one afternoon in Orange. I simply cannot name all of our wonderful members here. However, I would like to make special mention of campaign director extraordinaire and all-around good bloke Peter Pilbeam, who is chair of the Lithgow branch; National Party legend Kay Martin; campaign treasurer Janet O'Brien; Joy Brown; Wellington branch members, including chair of the Wellington branch John 'Dutch' Holland and his wife, Penny, Allison Conn, Gary Francis and Michael White; the mighty Mudgee branch, including chair Sandy Walker, Thelma Beechey, Margaret Reid, Lloyd Coleman, Terry and Marie Croom, Barbara Searle and Barbara Duff; chair of the Orange branch Warwick Baines and former chair Duncan Brakell; Orange SEC chair Chris Messenger; Wade Mahlo; Ron Gander; and, of course, local television star Guy Gaeta and his wife, Sim; the Hayes family; Peter Carmen; Ralph Crystall; Barry and Robyn Moore; Paula and Wayne Townsend; Cheryl Newsom from Canowindra; from the Bathurst branch, member for Bathurst Paul Toole and his family, chair Sam Farraway, David and Cheryl Veness, Anne Bowe, Paul Rasmussen, Martin and Judy King, Vicki Wilson, Robert Bowman, Dorothy and Clyde Colley, and Robbie Marshall, the original Rylstone cowboy; from the Forbes branch, chair Mark Pietsch, Jeff Herdegen, Vanessa Crompton, Graeme Miller and Yvonne Glasson; and also chair of the Parkes branch Gavin Tom. I would also like to acknowledge the Calare federal electorate council chair, Brett Kenworthy, plus the federal and state National Party offices, headed by Scott Mitchell and Nathan Quigley. I am also very grateful for the wonderful support of the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce; the Deputy Leader of the  Nationals, Fiona Nash; and the entire federal Nationals team. They were of great assistance to our campaign for Calare and have made me feel very welcome. My state colleagues-including the member for Ku-ring-gai, Alister Henskens, and the member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, and others who are watching these proceedings-also need to be acknowledged. I also have to give a special acknowledgement to the Hunter Valley's self-styled Team Gee of family friends, who are now veterans of three campaigns and show no sign of slowing down. Thank you also to Ron Camplin and Ardin Beech from Radio 2BS, Neil Gill from 2GZ, and David Beadle and Tony Healy from 2EL, who consistently let me have a lot of fun on their radio stations. The town of Parkes was recently moved out of the electorate of Calare by way of a boundary change. This has sadly meant that my gold-sequined Elvis jacket that made its debut at this year's Parkes Elvis Festival and had two appearances on the floor of the New South Wales parliament will not be making the trip to Canberra, despite the member for Riverina, whose electorate now takes in Parkes, trying to get his clutches on said jacket.",76
Mr Zimmerman,BUSINESS,Can I borrow it?,78
Mr GEE,BUSINESS,"No, Member for North Sydney, you may not. You may not borrow it, Member for North Sydney, because the Elvis jacket is being reserved for Scott Barrett, who will do an excellent job as the next Nationals member for Orange. I have been lucky enough to have some very loyal and talented staff working for me through the years. They have constantly gone above and beyond the call of duty, working long hours, and have achieved many amazing results for constituents. They have seen and done it all with courtesy, professionalism, humour and a desire to help people from all walks of life. I am very grateful for their hard work and support. In fact, I would not have been able to serve as an MP without them. They are Kimbalee Morris, Rosie Pritchard, Paula Elbourne, Sarah Hayes, Anna Derham and Judith Patton, and also Georga Nonnemacher, plus international dog judge and man of mystery Don Mahoney JP. I would also like to mention the support of the great Bec Mackay and acknowledge the work of Bev Glover, Travis Russell and Rachel Hayes. In my time as a state MP, it was the community campaigns that marked the time in the electorate: the fight for Gulgong hospital and ensuring that promises made were promises kept; saving the Drip near Mudgee and having it declared a national park; the fight for a 24hour rescue helicopter service; the fights for better radiotherapy at Orange and also better roads; and saving the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health. In Sydney, the last five years or so were marked by regular scans and check-ups at the Sydney melanoma unit after being diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma during a state election campaign of 2010. Professor John Thompson is not here today, but he and the cancer researchers like him are the unsung heroes in Australia, and I am very grateful to him for patching me up and getting me back on the paddock. In fact, when after my operation I asked him whether he thought I would be right to contest the 2011 state election, he replied that, if it was a political career I was contemplating, perhaps he should book me in for a brain scan. That is medical humour for you, but I appreciate all that Prof. Thompson has done for me. All family members of politicians have to make some big sacrifices, and mine have been no exception. I am extremely lucky to have a close-knit family and could not have served  effectively as a local member without them. My children, who are in the gallery today, are notoriously picky when it comes to how they are mentioned in any speech that I make. When I asked them about this speech, Jonathan, who is in year 2, said he wished to be referred to as a future Australian cricket player. Sam, in year 6, said he wished to be referred to as a son of unlimited potential who predicted I would be here. That is what he said. Ali is in year nine and she simply said she wanted two mentions in this speech. Thanks, Ali. Tick! Amanda, who is in year 11, has traditionally been a conscientious objector to what she always saw as a frivolous and inherently uncool exercise, but she now wishes to be referred to as 'campaign trooper'. Of course, I need to thank my wife, Tina, for her love and support; my parents, Melva and Bob; my brother David and my sister-in-law Vanessa Gee; Alison and Andrew Blattman; Matthew and Joanna Gee; my aunt, Jan Lintot; my in-laws Scott and Ross Harbison; and the entire Harbison family. I would also like to express my appreciation for the flying squad of nephews and nieces who made many an appearance at polling booths around Orange in the freezing cold. A special mention must also be made of my old school friend and Novocastrian Warrick Boyd whose determination and strength I am in awe of. His daughter, Madison, and brother, Peter, are with us today. Today I also thank the people of Calare. When I entered politics in 2011, I committed to representing the people of our communities with the same qualities that they themselves possess: courage, passion and energy. I reaffirm that commitment today. But to communities of the west I further commit to this: I will fight for you, Calare. Every day I occupy this office I will fight. When I am out in our communities I will fight. When I am here in this place I will stand up and I will fight for you, Calare. I will fight and we, all of us, will fight with an unshakable faith in the future of the west and together we will make this time count for something. We will make these years Calare's years, and together we will make this Calare's time.",78
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," I thank the member for Calare. I would like to welcome my eastern neighbour and ask that he take special care of the communities of Mudgee, Gulgong and Wellington-who I can see residents for in the chamber here todayformerly part of the Parkes electorate. I know you will be in good hands with the member for Calare. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43 and the debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Haq, Dr Abdul",79
Mr HUSIC,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I extend my congratulations to the member for Calare. It is with sadness that I speak after the passing of Dr Abdul Haq of Hassall Grove. Dr Haq, a Bangladeshi, was one of the great community builders in Western Sydney. He left us suddenly in late August at age 68. His passing came as a great shock to the AustralianBangladeshi community. Dr Haq was a great fundraiser for charity and people in need. He was described as a shining example of a community worker tirelessly advancing voluntary works. Through his involvement in the local community organisation Good Morning Bangladesh he joined with others to raise $150,000 for the Cancer Council of New South Wales over 15 years. Recent  events at Blacktown, Lakemba, Mascot and Campbelltown raised $22,000. In the last four years Dr Haq helped raise $150,000 for a cancer hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh with Rotary Australia World Community Service. He ran an educational coaching school for selective and HSC students and he was involved in the establishment of the Quakers Hill Mosque. Being a kidney organ donor recipient 32 years ago, he did not let that stop him from making an enormous and lasting contribution here and overseas. He leaves an enormous legacy of community service and vital charity work that his family and friends will continue to expand upon. He leaves behind his supporting wife, Laila; his son, Ashfaqul Haq; and his daughter, Rubaiyat Haq. Thank you for your service, Dr Haq. May you rest in peace. Davies, Mrs Pat Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (13:49): I rise to acknowledge one of Goldstein's constituents for the significant contribution that she has made to our country: Pat Davies. In 1939 the great Sir Robert Menzies made a faithful speech advising that it was his melancholy duty to inform Australians that this nation was at war. As a result, Pat-then just 18-was soon to see her partner at the time leave for war. Being a nurse, she was soon sent overseas to serve our country as well. Pat went to nurse at hospitals in North Africa and then, as the war neared its conclusion, she crossed the Mediterranean and tended the casualties resulting from the Allied progress into Italy. Following the war, Pat married her soldier, raise a family and became a proud grandmother. At the age of 95 she is an inspiration to our community. She has given so much to her country, and her story is one that needs to be shared. Too often these stories go on untold. It is positive to look back so we can grow and learn from these inspiring people as we continue forward. I would like to thank Pat and many others in our community for serving our great country in times of war and in peace. My hope is that her story can inspire our current and future generations. Women in Sport",79
Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to mark a landmark agreement, an industrial relations breakthrough, for Netball Australia and the players' association. They set a new benchmark for women's sport. They have doubled the minimum salary for netballers in a semiprofessional sport. I want to congratulate Bianca Chatfield, who heads the players' association and who said today: The athletes are excited that netball has committed to invest a greater proportion of its revenue than any other sport, male or female, into its athletesThis is really something to celebrate. On this side of the House we love to promote sport but we love to promote fairness even more. I hail those involved in these negotiations. That includes Marne Fechner, a girl from the west of Melbourne who was also involved in negotiating this fantastic outcome for netballers across the country. This means that, when our players in our national league-and I carry today my Vixens scarf-when I pay my membership to the Vixens this year I will be making a contribution to those players' salaries to see women in sport. They are leading the way. The Diamonds had a great weekend last weekend. The Vixens will have a great season starting next week. They will beat that Collingwood team coming in. But, most importantly, these players will have their livelihoods protected.  Prostate Cancer",80
Mr WOOD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," A number of colleagues here today had a great barbecue lunch at the Big Aussie Barbie. I thank the Prime Minister for his attendance and I congratulate the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness Group, the member for Blaxland and the member for Leichhardt. It is a chilling fact that prostate cancer is now Australia's No. 1 diagnosed cancer in Australia for men. Each year 20,000 men in all corners of the country are diagnosed with this condition, and, tragically, 3,300 do not make it. However, with early detection there is a survival rate of 92 per cent five years after diagnosis-so men, go and get your tests done. Last weekend I was very pleased to support the efforts of the Prostate Cancer Foundation by hosting a Big Aussie Barbie in the electorate of La Trobe. I thank the various participants, including: John Strachan, the foundation's Victorian manager; Lindsay Harding, president of Akoonah Park Men's Shed; and the Commonwealth Bank. On a personal note, my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer 15 years ago. He is still with us. But to all the wives out there, make sure hubby has his tests-and, daughters, tell your fathers to get tested-because it is also very tough on the carers who look after people who have prostate cancer. Peris, Ms Nova OAM",81
Ms BURNEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I speak today to note for this House the achievements of former senator Nova Peris. In my first speech I spoke about standing on the shoulders and following in the footsteps of those before me; Nova Peris is one such set of shoulders. Her achievements and her status as the first Aboriginal woman in this parliament made history in a very profound way. Towards the conclusion of my first speech I listed all first peoples. A drafting mistake in the final version of my speech saw Nova's name not there-and it should have been. Nova Peris's achievements, inside and outside this building, are to be celebrated. The wonderfully named Nova: a gold medal-winning Olympian and a representative of Australia's first peoples for well over 25 years; Young Australian of the Year in 1997. Being a part of the winning Australian hockey team at the 1996 summer Olympics saw Nova become the first Aboriginal person to win gold in the Olympics; she then won gold medals in the women's 200-metre and the 4 x 100-metre sprints at the1998 Commonwealth Games. As if she had not done us all proud in the sporting arena, in 2013 Nova became a member of the other place for the Northern Territory. She advocated for the North and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. She rightly earned a place in history for this role. I want to place on record my gratitude for her friendship and pay respect to the enormous contribution she has made to this country. That image of a young Nova Peris holding that gold medal(Time expired) Cruickshank, Superintendent Doreen APM",81
Mr ZIMMERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to honour the career of Superintendent Doreen Cruickshank, Australia's longest-serving female police officer, who recently retired after 45 years of service to the people of New South Wales.  Superintendent Cruickshank was born at a time when 'female police officer' was not part of the Australian vernacular. In a Gilgandra primary school she discovered her future career in a vocational guide that listed 'police' as a potential occupation. Intrigued, she spoke to a local sergeant, who was not exactly encouraging about a woman joining the police force. Undeterred, she pushed on to become one of only 100 women officers in the state when she joined the force in 1971. She rose through the ranks, becoming a detective and receiving the Australian Police Medal in 2003 for her exemplary career. Serving in many locations, she eventually became commander of the North Shore Local Area Command in my electorate. She joined at a time when women in the force were described as 'air hostesses', tending primarily to matters involving women and children. Today, they are officers serving in a force that is one of the most gender diverse in Australia. She not only dedicated her life to protecting her fellow citizens but also to forging a way for all women to follow their desires and to fight for a better Australia. Congratulations, Superintendent Cruickshank, on a defining career, and thank you for all that you have done for North Sydney and Australia. You have been an incredible role model to so many who have followed in your footsteps, and I wish you well in your retirement. Domestic and Family Violence",81
Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last month I had the privilege of attending the Fearless Comedy Gala. It was organised by Juliet Moody to unite some of Australia's funniest people to help address one of our most serious problems. On an average day here in Canberra, eight family violence incidents will be reported to police. We do not know how many will go unreported. What we do know is that there are far too many families living under the shadow of family violence-and all the fears that come with it. Juliet knows what it feels like to live in fear. She also knows what it feels like to live without it, and she is doing everything she can to help others feel the same. She is an inspiring woman. The Fearless Comedy Gala raised tens of thousands of dollars-$30,000 in fact-for the Domestic Violence Crisis Service, which provides support and advice for Canberra families fleeing dangerous or even life-threatening situations in the ACT. People's lives will be changed thanks to Juliet and those who helped put on this fantastic event. Thank you to all involved for a great night in support of a great cause, particularly the fabulous Sparrow-Folk girls, who are here today in the gallery, and Lark and Fox, better known as Juliet and Cathy. Hats off to you all, and thank you so much for the work you have done for Canberra. Glycosylation",82
Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I would like to talk about a local resident who is living with a severe disability, and the wonderful community that has sprung up to help her and her family. West Ryde residents Ray and Samira Chebat have a 12-year-old daughter, Samantha, with a rare condition called glycosylation type 2N. Only 10 people in the world have this disease, which is both incurable and terminal. She cannot eat, talk, walk or hold herself up. Keeping Samantha mobile is essential for treatment, and keeping her active is important for her mental health. However, as she grows it is harder for her family to move her and her wheelchair. She now needs a wheelchair accessible car.  On hearing of her family's needs, an enterprising group of local residents have set out to raise funds to make the necessary adjustments to her car. They have been led by David Tompkins, of West Ryde Toyota-a great man, and chair of the West Ryde Chamber of Commerce. He has also brought on board Ryde Business Forum and local stalwarts Nora Etmekdjian and Andrew Hill, with Rosanna Gallo and Macquarie Park Rotary Club assisting with fund-raising logistics. So far the campaign has raised over $13,000. I would like to congratulate the community for the speed and spirit with which they have rallied around this family. And of course I am sure the whole House will join with me in passing on our best to the brave Chebat family. Welfare Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (13:59): The people of Australia have returned us to this parliament to deal with the nation's problems. They expect us to attack the issues, but we are not a rubber stamp for every bad idea that was put forward in the election campaign. If you are a well-paid parliamentarian it may be very difficult to understand what it is like to live on $263 a week. But we on this side of the House understand. That is why we oppose the proposition to cut the Newstart allowance for a single mum by up to $4.40 a week, pensioner couples by $10 a week and somebody on the disability allowance by $8 a week. And we oppose the proposition to shut down the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. We are willing to meet with the government and come up with sensible, sustainable savings. But, when we do it, we will not be putting the most wealthy people in Australia ahead of the queue. We think it is a bad idea to give the wealthiest people in this country an $80 billion tax cut while hacking into the benefits of the lowest",82
The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members statements has concluded. NA Health",83
Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The Haymarket Clinic, in Darlinghurst, has provided free medical, nursing and welfare services to homeless and vulnerable people for more than 40 years but has been forced to close its doors because of the Prime Minister's cuts. Why is it that the Prime Minister can find over $170 million to spend on an unnecessary, damaging and divisive plebiscite but cannot find $900,000 to keep the Haymarket Clinic open?",83
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for her question. I remind the honourable member that my government is spending more money on health than ever before. This financial year, we will invest $71.4 billion in health, including $18 billion to help fund the public hospitals run by the states and territories. And that includes an additional $2.9 billion for public hospital services from 2017-18 to 2019-20. We are committed to a strong public health system generously funded, well administered, working with the states and territories always to ensure that we get the maximum outcome in terms of health for Australians from the investment of the public funds for which we are responsible.  The honourable members opposite, as we know, disgracefully, dishonestly, exploited the concerns of older Australians in particular about Medicare with their shocking Medicare lie. Mr Albanese interjecting",83
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I heard the member for Grayndler say, 'Here they come!' You see, for them, truth does not matter. That is the side that sent out a text message to millions of Australians, saying it was from Medicare-and they did not think there was anything wrong with that! What dishonesty! Imagine if that had been done by a bank or a corporationSenator Dastyari would be right after them, he would be on fire. Ms Plibersek: Mr SPEAKER ",84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Prime Minister concluded his answer?,84
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes, I think that is fine.",84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney is seeking leave to table a document? Ms Plibersek: I seek leave to table the report of this clinic actually closing. It is no scare campaign. It is closed.,84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can see from here that that is a newspaper report. We have ruled on that previously, so I will not even ask if leave is available. Ms Macklin interjecting",84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. There is also no law against listening to the rulings and abiding by the history and the practice, and that is that we do not table documents that are freely available-like newspaper reports or, for that matter, Hansard. Mr Albanese interjecting",84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They have been, but I do not think you will find that there will be many tabled in the months ahead.  Mr Albanese interjecting",84
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Leader of the House and the member for Grayndler are ready, the other 148 members of the House would like to resume question time. I think. The member for Calare. Economy",84
Mr GEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on action being taken by the coalition government to secure Australia's long-term economic prosperity?,84
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. I have said before that this the 45th Parliament will be a parliament that delivers, it is going to be a parliament that works. It is our obligation to address the big challenges Australia faces, and there is none more significant than ensuring our continued prosperity. We are enjoying strong economic growth-3.3 per cent. We are enjoying strong jobs growth-this at a time when we have seen an unprecedented drop in the terms of trade, an unprecedented transition from a mining construction boom. Far from having the hard, catastrophic economic landing that so many economists predicted, our economy is  transitioning well. But it is not happening by accident. It needs clear leadership-and that is what we have provided. The options available to the parliament today are as clear as they are stark: we have to make this 45th Parliament work for all this. We cannot continue to leave behind a legacy of debt that burdens our children and grandchildren with the obligations",84
Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear members opposite groaning. They think it is funny; they think it is tedious. That is the modern Labor Party. Well, I would say to members opposite: not every Australian is like your Senator Dastyari-able to ring someone up and get him to pay their bills. Not everybody is a privileged politician that can earn $200,000 a year and then, when he does not want to pay a bill, pick up the phone and get it picked up by some friend. Let's face it: we know Australians are facing tough challenges in managing their household budgets. They need a strong economy to ensure that they keep their jobs, that their jobs are well paid and that their businesses do well. So there is nothing to do with fairness about leaving that legacy of debt. We take it seriously; Labor plainly does not. The constructive arrangement agreement that was reached between the Treasurer and the finance minister",85
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and their counterparts in the omnibus savings bill is a very important step. It secures $6.3 billion in savings. It shows that the parliament can work. We need it to work more and more effectively in the future. We have to continue to prosecute the case for living within our means.,85
Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Others may scoff, but we know we owe a solemn duty to our children and grandchildren not to burden them with that mountain of debt which profligacy by Labor governments has left them with. We are building the case for a strong future for our children and grandchildren, and we call on all parties and on the opposition in particular to join with us in that solemn responsibility.

The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just before I call the member for SydneyMr Bowen interjecting,85
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for MCMahon will cease interjecting! The member for Moreton continues to interject. He interjected right through that answer. I had to eject him under 94(a) yesterday; I do not want to have to keep asking the member for Moreton to cease interjecting. He knows what the rules are. Whilst there will always be a level of interjection, can I say it is disrespectful to the other members around him and other members in this chamber. I am not going to keep saying the same thing to the member for Moreton each day-and have you nod to me each time. I do it, Member for Moreton! Every time you do it, it places you closer to being in an ejector seat, I have to say. It really does. Marriage",85
Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. A group of Catholic nuns and their supporters, working to combat slavery and support victims of human trafficking, are in Canberra today. They have been told that government cuts will mean they will lose their funding from July next year. Why is that? Why  is it that the Prime Minister can find over $170 million to spend on an unnecessary, damaging and divisive plebiscite but he cannot find the money to help victims of human trafficking?",85
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I will ask the Treasurer in a moment to address the particular cuts that the honourable member has referred to. But let me just deal with this question of the plebiscite. The honourable member's focus on the same-sex marriage plebiscite is addressed to the cost of it: yes, it will cost $170 million. But what price democracy? What price democracy? Do we have enough respect for the Australian people to ask them their view? That is the question. We have to recognise that this is a fundamental moral issue, a fundamental issue of conscience, on which Australians' views differ. There was a time when the Labor Party respected them. There was a time when the Labor Party did not accuse people who disagreed with them of being homophobes. The extraordinary, hateful expressions used by prominent figures in the Labor Party against people who do not support same-sex marriage is a disgrace. The way in which the Leader of the Opposition talked about 'haters crawling out from under rocks' if there was a plebiscite-what sort of language is that to talk about Australians? There was a time when many members opposite voted against same-sex marriage. There was a time when it was the Labor Party's policy. I just ask honourable membersMr Stephen Jones interjecting",86
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just ask that honourable member in particular: was Julia Gillard a homophobe when she opposed same-sex marriage? Was Penny Wong a homophobe when she opposed same-sex marriage? Of course not. The reality is, if people who opposed same-sex marriage then were not homophobes, then they are not homophobes today. The Labor Party has got to stop preaching this hatred. You talk about ensuring a civil debate-that is what we want; we respect every side-with respect. We respect each side, and the Labor Party should do the same. Many of their constituents sincerely, honourably, conscientiously believe that same-sex marriage should not be made the law of the land. They are entitled to do that. We will give them a choice. But they have no choice with respect to their member of parliament, because they have all been whipped in and obliged to vote in the same way, regardless of what their constituents believe. I have concluded my answer.",86
Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members will cease interjecting! The member for Blaxland and the member for Adelaide will cease interjecting. I also warn the member for Whitlam. I would ask the member for Sydney not to interject when I am addressing the House. The member for Bruce will cease interjecting. Economy,86
Mr LEESER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on how the government is managing the successful transition of the economy? How does a strong budget help our economy to grow and create jobs?,86
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Berowra for his question. I note, in relation to the previous question asked by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, those opposite supported all the cuts to foreign aid that we put to the last election. They supported them all. And here they come, hypocritically in this House, making  criticisms, the same thing they did about the pension asset test changes: opposed them before the election, and then had to agree to them at the election-hypocrisy writ large. I am asked about the transitioning economy and how we are managing that. Well, at 3.3 per cent through-the-year growth-that is how this side of the House is managing the transition of our economy from the mining investment boom. Not only is there a 3.3 per cent through-the year growth, which is the envy of the advanced world when it comes to economic growth today; in addition to that, 200,000 jobs have been created over the course of the last year. So it is not surprising that today the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index confirmed once again that there are more optimists about the Australian economy than there are pessimists. A government member: Not on the other side!",86
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The optimists are on this side. And the pessimists, who do not believe in growth, only believe in growth when and if-and there is a qualification-it is on their terms. On this side of the House, we believe in stronger growth. We believe in more jobs. We took to the election a plan to achieve that, and over the last 12 months that is exactly what we have been delivering. Confidence in the economy is up eight per cent on a year ago. We also saw yesterday the increase in business confidence, because Australians know that this government, the Turnbull government, has a plan to drive the economy forward. I am asked about debt and what to do about the deficit. We need to arrest the debt and we need to break the curse of Labor's debt that was inflicted on this side of the House as we came to government. The way we do that is by bringing the budget back to balance and by getting expenditure under control. There are $40 billion worth of budget improvement measures before this parliament now and in the months ahead. That is what we are doing to improve the budget. I welcome the fact that the opposition have agreed with $6.3 billion of those and I welcome the fact that on tobacco excise more than one quarter of this government's-the Turnbull government's-budget improvement measures have been passed and will be passed this week in the parliament. What that shows is that the Turnbull government is getting the job done in the 45th Parliament. We are getting the job done, we are improving the budget, we are restoring the budget to surplus, we are arresting the debt and we are breaking the curse of Labor's debt that they imposed on the Australian people. Ms Burney interjecting",87
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Barton is now warned. Budget,87
Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Given that it is more than four months since the budget, can the Treasurer confirm that the nonconcessional contribution cap for superannuation will continue to have a $500,000 limit and a 2007 start date?",87
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for her question. What the government introduced in the budget was a plan to make superannuation fairer, to make it more flexible and to make it sustainable. That is what we introduced. The measures that we introduced in the budget will improve the budget repair task by some $3 billion, so we continue to pursue those measures because those measures are essential. It is not just the equity of the system as it stands but also the intergenerational equity as we have a growing and ageing population and a growing set of balances in the superannuation system which  attract very high concessional rates of taxation. There are very, very big concessions on those taxation rates. We need to ensure that that system is sustainable both now and into the future. This parallels what this government has also done over the last few years on dealing with retirement incomes in the area of pensions. I note those opposite railed against the pension assets test changes for years. They even ran campaigns against it, getting signatures and doing all those sorts of things, and they had to reverse their position by the time they got to the election. They sought to play the Australian people for mugs. We are pursuing our superannuation changes, and they will be coming into this House. They will be delivering on the savings, they will be delivering on the equity, they will be delivering on the flexibility and they will be delivering on the fairness. They will deliver on the job that we outlined in the budget. Mr Dreyfus interjecting",87
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Isaacs will cease interjecting. I have asked him a number of times, even before question time, to cease interjecting. He is now on the same track as the member for Moreton. I am giving fair warning. Aged Care",88
Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Minister, I have received many complaints from older Australians and their families about the ridiculous cost of home care packages. One example is a client who was effectively being charged $165.00 an hour for assistance with house cleaning and showering when all of the administrative expenses were included. The problem is that there is a cap on fees but no floor on services. This allows overcharging by many service providers on a scale that a reasonable person would characterise as systemic rorting. This is obviously unacceptable both for the consumers who cannot afford the fees and for the taxpayers who are subsidising the packages. What will you do about it?",88
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Denison for his question and for introducing a very important topic to the House today which is the care of our older Australians in their own homes. It is, I agree, very disappointing to hear about providers who charge such extravagant administration fees and effectively bring a bad name and reputation to so many who do the right thing. It is true that, at the moment, providers of home care packages can charge an administration fee, and we expect them to charge a reasonable fee. I would like to receive detailed information about these circumstances. I would like to make another few important points to the members and to the Labor Party because the care of our older Australians is largely a bipartisan effort. The Living Longer Living Better package that we are implementing was actually supported by Labor, and this is our agenda as a parliament. What I would like to emphasise is two things: I would like to hear about the case and I would like the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner to hear about the case; and I would encourage the person receiving the care to contact the advocacy network in Tasmania-we can provide the details-if they feel reluctant to make that case themselves. Importantly, from February next year, as part of the reforms being led by this government, we will attach care packages to the consumer, so this situation will not therefore happen. We will give the consumer the power of spending on their own care on their own package in their own  home. This will allow them to live exactly the life that they choose, not being dictated to by providers with excessive administration fees but actually recognising that choice in aged care is vital. I visited Tasmania last week and I was interested to hear about the needs of your community, member for Denison, and I am interested for your continuing contact with my office, particularly with examples such as this. I do encourage you and your constituents to check out the agenda on aged care, which, as I said, under this government is bringing the control and the spend back to the consumer, where it needs to be. Budget",88
Mr EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Social Services. Will the minister update the House on savings achieved in the Social Services portfolio over the past 12 months? Are there any alternative approaches?  question. It has been a very busy 12 months with respect to savings that we have managed to both identify and deliver in the portfolio. In the last 12 months we have already delivered $4 billion worth of savings: $2 billion in legislation, $2 billion administratively. We are on the cusp-and I do thank the Treasurer and the shadow Treasurer for their cooperation on the omnibus savings bill-of delivering an additional $3.9 billion, and there is a further $5 billion that we have identified and are pursuing. Under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, in one portfolio we have either achieved or are in pursuit of $12.9 billion worth of savings in 12 months-$12.9 billion that will not have to be paid back by the next generation to fund our spending today, and that is a very significant achievement. I was asked whether there was an alternative approach and, whilst I note the cooperation on the omnibus bill, the alternative approach might be generously defined as 'inconsistent'. As you stroll around the parliament today, still in the windows of members opposite is the poster complaining about the measures that they agreed to today in the omnibus bill. It is on the Facebook page. The same poster that complains about the FTB supplement being cut is in the windows of the members opposite today. In fact, the same poster complains about the ending of the schoolkids bonus they agreed to 16 weeks ago. I hate to be the one to break it to members opposite, but it is bad enough complaining about something you agreed to yesterday, let alone complaining about something you agreed to 16 weeks ago. In fact, while I think of it, the member for Jagajaga on 26 May, when they agreed to the pension asset changes and agreed to ending the schoolkids bonus, was still collecting signatures opposing the thing they had agreed to, which raises the question: who do you provide the petition to? Do you give it to yourself in a little mini ceremony? And, if so, who takes the selfie to maintain the rage on Facebook? Who does that? I mean, come on! The member for Greenway described a measure they have now agreed to in the omnibus bill as 'a cruel ripping of support', but today it is a fair and reasonable savings measure. How does that work, members opposite? The reality is that for three years we have made savings that we have said are reasonable and fair. The Labor definition of fairness is whatever they agree to on the particular day that they are considering the question. It is all very Lord of the Rings: 'We hates the ending of the  schoolkids bonus, don't we, precious? No, we loves the ending of the schoolkids bonus, don't we, precious? It is our budget repair friend, isn't it, precious?' (Time expired) Budget",89
Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's previous answer, in which the Treasurer said the government was committed to the revenue from its superannuation policy but failed to confirm the government is committed to the policy itself. We ask again: can the Treasurer confirm the non-concessional contribution cap for superannuation will continue to have a $500,000 limit and a 2007 start date?",90
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. Once again, I can confirm the package of measures that we took forward to the last election and we took forward in this year's budget, which was designed to make sure that our superannuation system was fairer and more flexible, recognising changing working patterns and the things people work for over the course of their lives so that it can reflect their circumstances-for example, if you are a contractor or running a home based business, you are not denied your access to superannuation concessions-which those opposite opposed. Several weeks ago those opposite said they opposed the measure in the budget, in our superannuation package, which was designed to ensure people running home based businesses-those working for small businesses who could not access salary deductions for superannuation contributionscould access those concessions. They said they would not allow and support those measures. Our package of measures is designed to deliver all of these things, to deliver that $3 billion in net savings to the budget and to ensure that we are making the system flexible and fairer. And we are committed to those measures achieving that goal. We are absolutely committed to those measures achieving that goal. There is no doubt about what members on this side of the House are committed to. We are committed to fairer, more flexible superannuation that achieves the goal of making sure it is sustainable, and we are committed to ensuring jobs and growth in our economy. But particularly on the issue of growth I want to raise this. The member opposite has asked this question and I think it goes, really, to what he stands for. I notice his statement today, which says, 'Economic growth is only worthwhile if â¦' 'If'! In what circumstances do you come into this House and say that economic growth is only there if you are interested in it in particular circumstances? What he is saying is that support for economic growth on that side of the House is conditional.",90
Mr Bowen,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Read it all!,90
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have said it is conditional. 'Economic growth is only worthwhile if'-if, if, if. Well, there are no qualifications on economic growth on this side of the House. We know, on this side of the House, that this economy has to fight for every inch of growth it can get, because only by growth can you get the jobs- (Extension of time granted) I thank the member for that opportunity, because the statement is entitled 'Referring to the achievements'-achievements, Mr Speaker! Let me list some of the achievements of those opposite over the last 12 months. No. 1, they lost the election because they did not have an economic plan. No. 2, they took a budget black hole to the last election and said you need to increase the deficit by $16Â½ billion. Their other achievement was to backflip on $47 billion of  spending promises they made that they backflipped on at the last election. Whether it was on foreign aid or the schoolkids bonus or pension assets tests or whatever it was, it was $47 billion worth of backflips. The other thing they have backed is the lazy Susan of Australian politics, Senator Dastyari. That is what they have backed. That is one of their achievements. They voted against multinational tax legislation.",90

Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In addition to opposing our laws to get multinationals to pay their fair share of tax-that was one of their other achievements-they tried to smash the property market with their proposal to attack hard working Australians just trying to get ahead by investing in a rental property. In addition to that, they sought to block critical infrastructure such as WestConnex in Sydney and Freight Link in Perth. Of course, the great achievement they were following on from was their seeking to scuttle the East West Link, where the taxpayers of Victoria had to pay more than $1 billion for the privilege of not building a road.",91

Mr DRUM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on the benefits for renewable energy in the government's Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill? ,91
Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Murray for his question. Everyone in this place is familiar with his success on the football field before he came into this place, but even he would admit that paying back Labor's debt is harder than winning a premiership. But we, on this side of the House, have a great ruckman in the Treasurer. We have a great full-forward in the finance minister. We have a great captain coach in the Prime Minister and we have the Eddie Betts of the Australian parliament, that nippy forward, the member for Sturt. The omnibus bill is good news for the renewable energy sector because we have been able to restore $800 million in grants for the renewable energy sector through ARENA while keeping the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation intact. ARENA has already committed more than $1 billion worth of funding in grants, or more than 250 projects. This includes turning biomass into biofuel at Curtin University. This includes a solar thermal project through the ANU. In fact, as the Prime Minister knows, by 2018 more than 60 per cent of solar cell technology around the world will be able to be traced back to research done in Australia. Just last week the Turnbull government oversaw a $92 million solar thermal round by ARENA which funded 12 different projects: six in Queensland, five in New South Wales and one in Western Australia. These 12 projects will generate more than $1 billion of private sector investment, create more than 2,000 jobs and create enough energy to fuel 150,000 homes. When it went out to tender last September, ARENA was only expecting 200 megawatts of power for its $90 million to $100 million. In fact it got 480 megawatts of power, which shows the changes that are taking place in the renewable energy sector. This government have a 23.5 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020, and we are on track with 15 per cent currently. We have got the right balance between affordable and accessible and reliable energy while we transition to a lower emissions future. We have done all that while paying back Labor's debt-without the cash for the clunkers, without the disastrous carbon tax, without the green loans, without the pink batts and without that Athenian model of democracy, the citizens' assembly. Turnbull Government",92
Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Last night the member for Warringah said Joe Hockey was 'the last Treasurer who was serious about a structural reform budget.' Does the Treasurer agree with the member for Warringah's assessment of his first year in the job, that 'the more time passes, the better Joe Hockey looks.'",92
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question because it gives me the opportunity to reflect on achievements over the course of the last 12 months. Those achievements over the last 12 months include the fact that our economy has grown at 3.3 per cent and that 200,000 jobs have been created in the Australian economy as we have made the difficult transition from the mining investment boom to this more diversified economy. Over the last 12 months we have been able to pass the multinational tax legislation, which those opposite opposed. Those opposite get on their stump-they get on their stump on the schoolkids bonus, they get on their stump on the pension assets tests, they get on their stump on foreign aid and they get on their stump on multinational tax-but when it comes to actually doing something about it they roll over and they roll away. But not on this side. On this side of the House we have continued to go down our path of putting in place the plan for jobs and growth that is delivering jobs and growth. Under the  Turnbull government confidence in our economy today is eight per cent up on what it was a year ago. Last year at this time there were more pessimists than optimists in the economy, and today that has flipped. Over the last 12 months our economy has continued to grow-up from two per cent last year to 3.3 per cent this year. There are 200,000 more jobs. We have proceeded with things like the response to the financial systems inquiry. We have proceeded with the response to the Harper review, which will see misuse of market power laws coming into this parliament shortly. These are important issues which help drive growth in our economy, but also the budget measures that we have brought in and have succeeded in having passed through this parliament this week mean that more than one-quarter of the $40 billion worth of budget improvement measures rolling out of the budget that are before this parliament have been passed already in just these first few sitting weeks of the 45th Parliament. That is a record we are pleased to stand behind. It builds on the record that was begun under Treasurer Hockey, who I acknowledge. I acknowledge him for bringing a budget into this place in the 2014-15 year which put forward savings which only this week-three years later-we are now passing through this parliament. Why could those savings not be passed through this parliament? Because of the budget sabotage by those who sit opposite. Those who sit opposite do not have a plan to arrest the debt and deal with the Labor curse of debt on this parliament. They just have a plan to arrest economic growth. Their commitment to growth is conditional. On this side of the House we pursue jobs and growth, and are delivering. (Time expired) Global Security",92
Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to recent ISIL inspired terrorist attacks in Europe. Will the minister advise the House on how the government is working with partner countries to ensure Australians who travel overseas are as safe as possible? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:40): I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I acknowledge his experience in law enforcement, including work in counterterrorism. I can inform the House that in Germany yesterday police arrested three men, with forged Syrian passports, suspected of being part of an ISIL sleeper cell. According to the German interior minister, these men are believed to have used the same migrant-trafficking networks as the terrorists who carried out the deadly attacks in Paris last November that killed 130 people and injured hundreds more, including a young Australian. These arrests came as French authorities charged three women with terror offences following a foiled attack on a Paris train station last week. The women, aged 39, 23 and 19, are suspected of belonging to an extremist female commando unit that has been inspired by ISIL. Over the last year we have witnessed a wave of terror attacks across Europe directed and inspired by ISIL. Terror threat warnings in France, Germany and Belgium are at an all-time high. With terrorists using established people-smuggling routes into Europe to plan and commit attacks and with around 50,000 Australians in Europe at any one time we have an enormous stake in the success of European efforts to counter terrorism and violent extremism. Last week I met with my counterpart foreign ministers in Germany, Belgium, the European Union and the UK. At each meeting it was agreed to enhance existing counterterrorism cooperation with a particular focus on border protection, law enforcement collaboration and  intelligence sharing. I provided our European partners with details of Australia's experiences and the coalition government's responses, including legislative reforms, to the rising terror threat from ISIL and other extremist groups. The Australian government is sending a representative to work in the London based counter-ISIL communications cell, which was set up to counter the threat posed by ISIL's online presence. We are also supporting the establishment of a new countering violent extremism unit with the Commonwealth nations. This cooperation complements our work in South-East Asia. In fact, we are setting up a joint initiative with the United Kingdom in Jakarta to strengthen regional counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies. The coalition government, supported by the opposition, is committed to working with partners around the world to counter the threat posed by terrorism and to keep Australians safe, both at home and abroad, to ensure that Australians can not only travel but also remain in Australia as safely as possible. Superannuation",93
Dr CHALMERS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. The Australian Financial Review reports that the government has not released draft legislation for its $500,000 lifetime non-concessional super contribution cap because it is 'difficult to draft'. Why hasn't the government released a draft of this retrospective measure? Is 'difficult to draft' now government code for problems with the member for Warringah?",94
Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I very much thank the member for his question. I am very pleased with his interest in superannuation policy because one of the great concerns we on this side of the House had during the election period was that those opposite did not actually have a superannuation policy.,94

The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The members for Canberra and Rankin!,94
Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and then they said to the Australian people, 'It's going to be a big surprise.' We have been very clear. We have been exceptionally clear with our policy. We want a superannuation system that is affordable, that is flexible and that will be sustainable. We know that our population is ageing. The number of people aged 65 and above is growing and the number of people of working age is diminishing, and we need to have a sustainable retirement income system that will support them in their retirement. The government is consulting on the implementation of the budget measures that were announced. We are consulting with stakeholders on that, which is exactly what you would expect a prudent government to do. That is exactly what you would expect a prudent government to doMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",94
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gorton will cease interjecting.,94
Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"because, unlike those opposite, we are not making it up on the spot; we are going through a methodical process that ensures that we can deliver on our objectives.  Those opposite would actually punish people through the superannuation policy settings that they would deliver. They would say to those people who have time out of the workforce-for instance, young mothers who might take time out of the workforce, who will not be able to take full advantage of their concessional contribution-'You know what, we don't care about you being able to catch up on your contributions.' On this side of the House, we say, 'You should be able to take full advantage of your concessional contributions and we will allow you to do that on a rolling five-year basis.' Those opposite would stand in the way. We believe on our side of the House that it is important to have a level playing field for all of those people who would like to contribute into their super, no matter what their employment circumstances are-those people who, for instance, might be employed by a small business, who do not have access to salary sacrificing. We think they should have the ability to contribute concessionally to their superannuation. Those opposite would block them from being able to do that. They would block self-employed people from being able to take full advantage of their concessional contribution. On this side of the House, we believe in a sustainable superannuation system, and that is what we are delivering. Water",94
Mr BROAD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. Lots of rainfall across the Wimmera Mallee over the last 48 hours. Will the minister update the House on the investment that the government is making into water infrastructure in the Murray-Darling Basin and around the country?,95
Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (14:47): I thank the honourable member for his question and do note the massive rain that has been happening and also note the flood warnings that are happening for the Glenelg. It is great to be able to announce the water infrastructure that is being delivered. I know that in Sunraysia, and around, well in excess of $100 million has been invested in the Sunraysia Modernisation Project. This is part of the program of making sure that we put real delivery back into the irrigation precincts that are seen around the seat of Mallee. But it is not just the seat of Mallee where this investment is now happening. We are also seeing it in Tasmania, and the recently completed Chaffey Dam is about 67 per cent full, which is actually beyond the former volume that it had, and we will continue on with that work. It is a shame that the member for Kennedy is not here, because in the next week we will be heading up into Queensland to look at Hells Gate, because it is vitally important that we reflect on what the Australian people want. The Australian people want us to build dams. They see times such as these where there is an excess of water and they say, 'Why don't you store it for when there will be none?' and that is exactly what we are intending to do. That is why we the coalition have $2Â½ billion put aside for water infrastructure-half a billion in grants and $2 billion in concessional loans. That sits on top of the other investment that we are doing. It is always right and proper that you take your opportunities when they arise. Mr Albanese interjecting",95
Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was noting the interjection from the member for Grayndler there and I just note that currently the member for Maribyrnong is away, and say, 'Now is your time to shine.' They are not actually giving the member for Grayndler any questions. There is a form of concern, but that is understandable because you are a talent. The member for Grayndler is a talent. I can see that a lot of people in the Labor Party are starting to ask serious questions whether the member for Grayndler should not actually be sitting where the member for Sydney is. I can see the member for Sydney is religiously looking down, pretending that this is not happening, but it is-your neighbour going for the job, going for the big job. It is incredibly important that the opportunities arise. So we look forward to a question from the member for Grayndler. We look forward",95

The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hunter will cease interjecting. As members. I hope now know, I try to be practical in these circumstances. I allow a brief detour, but we need to get back on the highway straight away, onto the substance of the question.",96
Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only way we are going to hear from the member for Grayndler is via interjections, because they are just not going to give him a question. But it is very important that we continue on, and in the coming week we will be going back up into Queensland to make sure that we build on the water infrastructure projects, to make sure that the member for Kennedy and the interests that he has in Hells Gate dam are further enunciated, further planned, because it is this side of the parliament which is actually going to build the water infrastructure. (Time expired) Superannuation",96
Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister Mr Joyce interjecting,96
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. The member for Fenner will just take a seat somewhere there for a second. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the House are preventing me hearing the question. The member for Fenner can begin again.,96
Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. Why won't the government join with the opposition to produce a package of superannuation concession reforms that will add $4.4 billion to the budget bottom line over the medium term?",96
Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am delighted to take a question from the member for Fenner. I really do hope that in his personal circumstances, now that Sam Dastyari is off the front bench, he might get a pay rise",96
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will refer to members and senators by their correct titles. Ms O'Dwyer: Certainly. You should have a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Let me address this issue. It is critically important that superannuation policy is right, and it is critically important that we work together on a bipartisan basis to ensure that it is right. The coalition government has put forward a very detailed policy as outlined in the budget. Those opposite do not believe in some of the flexibility measures that would actually deliver for individuals the ability to contribute more into their superannuation to provide more in their retirement. We on this side think it is important to protect those flexibility measures, which is  why we have argued so strongly for them. I welcome that the member for Fenner would like to join with the government and actually reach a bipartisan agreement, and I look forward to meeting with him and discussing his views on the superannuation policy that the government has announced. Cancer",96
Mr COLEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Will the minister outline to the House the government's commitment to fighting the scourge of cancer in our society, including funding for preventative measures?",97
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for his question. I enjoyed visiting him in his electorate and meeting with CCAS, the Chinese community model of positive ageing. It was most impressive. Everyone is touched by cancer. The Institute of Health and Welfare's report released yesterday indicates that, while we are doing better in prevention and treatment, we are actually seeing more and more diagnosis, which means it is all the more important that this government take a sensible, positive, investment approach to health across the board, with a focus on cancer, which we are. It is important that we build a healthier Medicare. We acknowledge that budget repair in the omnibus bill, as passed yesterday, is critical in doing that. Ms Plibersek interjecting",97
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as a previous health minister, joined with the Leader of the Opposition during the campaign in the fraudulent misrepresentation of Medicare. Interestingly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition probably does not take quite the same approach to budget repair as some of the economic hardheads in her party, because she desperately hung onto a measure that makes absolutely no sense in the context of public health. And she has highlightedMs Plibersek interjecting",97
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you-the kids dental measure. Under the child dental benefits scheme that the member for Sydney,97
Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,97
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, it was her scheme. She really wanted to hang onto it. She did not want to make any changes and she could not be persuadedMs Plibersek interjecting",97
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and she says she is proud of it. The problem is that it is not a public dental scheme. It is a scheme where if you have an income of $178,000 and two children you could access this public dental scheme. The people that we care about, the people who should be the targets of a truly public dental scheme, are the eight in nine children who do not see a dentist, the children whose parents unfortunately won't take them to a private dentist to be treated under the member for Sydney's scheme, the children who have never seen a toothbrush, let alone a dentist, the children who would benefit from sound, solid public infrastructure in dental. That is what this government has provided and will continue to promote-a real public scheme that reaches those who would not make it to a private dentist. Shame on the member for Sydney, but also shame-unfortunately, I have to mention it again-on the member for  Ballarat in the context of cancer screening, because we are still waiting for the cancer screening registry to come back to the parliament. Ms Catherine King interjecting",97
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ballarat.,98
Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was for pure political purposes sent to a committee. When it comes back, Member for Ballarat, I am very hopeful that the approach that Labor will take will be to admit the error of their ways. (Time expired)",98

The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Ballarat, you are interjecting while I am asking you to cease interjecting. Will you pleaseMs Catherine King: I apologise. Superannuation",98
Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. In her last answer, the minister for revenue announced that the government wants a bipartisan agreement on the government's superannuation policies. Treasurer, is that in fact the government's position and does that mean the government is no longer committed to the half a million dollar retrospective cap?",98
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," No, Mr Speaker; in short, no. What I note, though, is that this government has demonstratedMr Bowen interjecting",98
Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You get to ask the questions; you do not get to say what the answers are. What happens in this parliament, under this government, is we do what we need to do to get measures passed through this parliament, because the Australian people elected every single member of this House and every single member of the other chamber. This government understands that we will pursue our agenda through the 45th Parliament and get the results that the Australian people expect from this government. In this week alone, more than $10 billion in budget improvement measures are passing through this parliament. That is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the Turnbull government in getting things done in this parliament. It is true that we had to drag those opposite kicking and screaming over the course of a year as they backflipped on $47 billion worth of spending commitments, when they went to an election and said the best thing we can do for the economy is increase the deficit by $16Â½ billion. That was their plan. That is a plan to arrest growth, not to arrest debt. What we will do is pursue our agenda, we will pursue our budget, we will pursue the measures that are necessary to drive the economy forward to support the jobs that are necessary so Australians can improve their living standards. That is what we will do and we will get the results in this parliament, as we have demonstrated this week. I thank, as I did earlier today, the shadow Treasurer for coming to the table in support of those measures, and I commend him for doing so. I thank the Minister for Finance my colleague Senator Cormann and his counterpart here in the chamber. But there is so much  more work to do. We have $40 billion of measures, including $25 billion of expenditure savings. Those opposite are pretty much tapped out on their commitment to increasing savings through the budget. They have some other measures, and we will look at those and we will work together, whether it is on the health debt or the dental scheme or these other measures. But their big plan is to increase taxes. What they said at the last election was that they wanted to increase taxes on the Australian economy by $100 billion. That is what they said at the last election. That is not a plan for jobs and growth; that is a plan for staying in opposition where they are. Defence Industry",98
Mr HASTIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister update the House on the success of the Land Forces conference last week and the government's efforts to create a sovereign defence capability in Australia? How will this create jobs, drive growth in our economy and preserve our national security?  thank the member for Canning for his question. I know about his deep interest in defence and defence industry. I was at the Land Forces conference last week in Adelaide, as was the member for Fadden, who was representing his state, which is a significant source of defence industry. The Land Forces conference last week in Adelaide was by far the biggest they have ever held-13Â½ thousand participants, over 500 exhibitors and 23 different countries were represented. There were 11 different seminars and conventions held within the overall conference, including the Chief of Army's exercise, which attracted 22 different armies from around the world, who had come to see what we are doing here in defence and defence industry. Right now there is a tremendous interest around the world in the government's program around defence industry, because we are committing $195 billion over the next 10 years to improve and increase our defence capability. That is $90 billion in naval shipbuilding alonebuilding 54 vessels. The record on this side of the House is: in three years we have committed to $90 billion of new spending on naval shipbuilding to build 54 vessels. On the other side of the House, not one decision in six years to build any vessels at all, and a reduction of spending on defence to the lowest levels since the period of appeasement by our government in 1938. There is a great deal of interest in what we are doing here in defence industry. Another good example is the LAND 400 project, which is 225 combat reconnaissance vehicles. It is worth $4 billion to $5 billion. I am told by people in the industry it is the largest contract of its kind going in the world right now. The scale of what this government is trying to achieve is absolutely immense. What it will do is build in this country a defence industry capability that we have never had to this extent. It will drive jobs and drive growth. In high-tech advanced manufacturing jobs-intellectual property here in Australiabusinesses from all over the world are coming to Australia to try and be part of that absolute transformation of our defence industry and our defence capability. In the end, it will mean that we have stronger national security, that we can defend our national and our international  interests and that we can be a proper ally and partner to our allies and partners around the world. Superannuation",99
Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Revenue. Given the Treasurer has just rejected meeting with the opposition to negotiate a bipartisan agreement on superannuation policy, does the Minister for Revenue stand by her answer a few minutes ago when she said she was looking forward to having a meeting with the member for Fenner to reach a bipartisan agreement on exactly that?",100
Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. I think if he reviews the Hansard, he will see I welcomed the opportunity to sit down with the member for Fenner to discuss, on a bipartisan basis, the government's announcement as announced in the budget. There is hardly anything controversial in that. I would say to the member that our superannuation package has been welcomed by so many stakeholders. Let me quote just a couple of them. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees said of our superannuation package: Key superannuation measures announced in tonight's federal budget are a necessary step toward a fairer and more sustainable super system. Industry Super Australia said: The budget papers show the government has rightly wound back $4.5 billion in overly generous super tax concessions benefitting high income earners with large super balances needing no help to save for retirement. It goes on. In a letter to the Prime Minister, ACOSS and COTA said of our changes: â¦ the Budget Superannuation Reform package takes important and significant steps in the right direction; creates a fairer and more sustainable superannuation system; and is not retrospective in nature. The tax treatment of superannuation will remain highly concessional once these measures are fully implemented. Our superannuation package is vastly superior to the one of those opposite. We announced it in the budget. We believe in our superannuation package. We welcome the opportunity to sit with those opposite to discuss our package. Infrastructure",100
Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister update the House on how the government is creating jobs in Northern Australia, particularly in the delivery of the Northern Australia Roads Program, the Beef Roads Program and the Cape York Regional Package?",100
Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The member for Leichhardt knows that delivering infrastructure in his electorate is essential for the future prosperity of the north. I was very pleased to join the member for Leichhardt in May, with the Prime Minister, when he announced $24 million for the infrastructure upgrade of the Cairns Marine Precinct. He understands that now is the time to get on with the job of delivering for Northern Australia. This government has a strong economic plan, and has a strong economic plan for  rural and regional communities, particularly Northern Australia. We understand that Northern Australia already makes an enormous contribution to the wealth of our nation, but with the right infrastructure that contribution will only grow into the future. The member asked me about roads. We understand that roads are the arteries of life in community areas. They are the arteries for commerce and for social interaction. We also understand the need to improve connectivity between our rural communities, our remote communities and our regional communities. The Northern Australia Roads Program, which the Turnbull-Joyce government has committed $600 million for, will deliver roads across northern Australia. This funding will improve safety and transport reliability in northern Australia and support economic growth in our North. Members on this side of the House understand the importance of investing in northern Australia and the potential that we can unlock in this region: the member for Capricornia, the member for Dawson, the member for Flynn and the member for Durack-all tireless advocates for road upgrades in their electorates. It is good news for northern Australia. I know those opposite do not like to hear all this good news. They would rather whinge and complain. They would rather talk Australia down. Mr Snowdon interjecting",100
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lingiari will cease interjecting.,101
Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They have such a negative view of Australia. They are the wreckers. On this side of the House we are the builders. On this side of the House we are building for the future. The contrast is very clear: we are building for the future and they are complaining about it. We have a $50 billion Infrastructure Investment Program. We are out there. We are building roads. We are building rail. We are building airports. They are building a complaints box. That is all they are building. In more good news, there is $100 million for the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program to improve the resilience of cattle supply chains in northern Australia. Mr Snowdon interjecting",101
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lingiari is warned.,101
Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is more good news in the Cape York Region Package, with $208 million, an investment by the Turnbull-Joyce government in the cape. Importantly, the Cape York region project has actually employed around 20 Indigenous trainees in 2015. So I thank the member for Leichhardt. I thank him for being such a strong advocate on behalf of northern Australia. He has supported local businesses in his community, and I know he will continue to do so. So I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The government does have a strong economic plan. We do have a strong plan for investing in infrastructure and for building for the future, and we commend the northern Australia package, the northern Australian investment and development which is occurring under the Turnbull-Joyce government. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS Health",101
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I seek leave to add to an answer here. The honourable acting Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the  Haymarket Foundation, and I have requested some further information, and it has been provided to me. The Haymarket Foundation's representatives met with my office in 2015 to request ongoing funding, which",101
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister. It is normal to add to an answer at the conclusion of question time. If the Prime Minister is seeking to conclude",102
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying a moment ago",102
Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,102
The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on both sides will cease interjecting.,102
Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the representatives of the Haymarket Foundation, which ran a clinic, met with my office in Sydney in 2015 to request ongoing funding, which had been ceased consequent on the Williams High Court case and the consequent 'Strengthening the constitutional basis for Commonwealth spending' provisions of the 2014 MYEFO. I made representations to the health minister, who provided transitional funding through to April 2016, which had been requested. It was to allow the foundation to move to a more sustainable model of operations and find alternative funding arrangements. The health minister's office and my own sought to find alternative funding opportunities from the Primary Health Networks, state local health districts, local government and private operators, notably St Vincent's Health Network. The initial conversations with the St Vincent's Health Network in 2015 were abandoned and not pursued by the foundation, I am instructed, despite the encouragement of the electorate office and the health minister's office. As far as can be determined, St Vincent's Health Network, while initially interested in an arrangement, were not amenable when discussions occurred again between the Haymarket Foundation and the St Vincent's Health Network in April 2016. So additional funding to give them a year to transition was sought and was provided, but a transition to other sources of funds, whether from the state government or from other sources, was unable to be obtained. NA Presentation  Documents are tabled in accordance with the list circulated to honourable members earlier today. Full details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. NA Prime Minister The SPEAKER (15:11): I have received a letter from the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister's failure of leadership. I call upon all those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",102
Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," That addition to an answer shows you exactly what this year of achievement is about, doesn't it-a year of achievement where the Prime Minister comes in here and says: 'Oh, I've got the answer. I've got a cracker of an answer for you. You're right. I cut the funding. I asked for a little bit of help for a year. I kept them on life support for a year, but wouldn't it be great if someone powerful would step in and save them? Wouldn't it be great if someone who really had some authority, the ability to do something, took this on as a project of their own?' This is a service in his backyard. I know the Prime Minister knows this service, a service in his backyard that serves the most vulnerable Australians: people who are homeless, people who are drug and alcohol affected, people who have severe mental health issues. They are living on the streets, and they have one place to go where they feel safe, where their health is looked after-a place that stops them ending up in emergency or ending up in psychiatric institutions, because of the primary health care it offers. I say to the Prime Minister, 'Do you really think spending $170 million on a plebiscite is more important than protecting the health of the most vulnerable Australians?' He says: 'Yeah, actually it is. Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if someone somewhere could fix this-not me, never me.' He is happy to take credit but never happy to take responsibility. Wouldn't it be great if we had someone in the highest office of the land who, instead of saying, 'I wish someone would fix it,' would step up to the dispatch box and say: 'I will fix it. I can do this. I can fix it'? I want to take a moment to reflect on something else in my electorate. I represent an area with a lot of artists, a lot of creative types, and one of the best of them is a fellow called Michael Agzarian. He put together an image that captured the spirit of a nation and the spirit of our time. It is a poster that started popping up here and there a few months ago, almost a year ago. I thought, 'Wow, what is it that is so great about that poster?' I think you all know the one I mean.",103
Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,103
Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a picture of the Prime Minister with just one word: 'fizza'. That one word has actually captured the spirit of our time. A great Australian word has captured and put into one image the feeling that we all have: our high hopes that surely the member for Wentworth would have to be better than the previous Prime Minister. So many Australians thought so, didn't they? You all know in your own electorates-high hopes. But, instead we got what Paul Keating predicted: a bit like a big red bunger on cracker night, 'You light him up, there's a bit of a fizz, but then nothing, nothing.' This Prime Minister is trying to convince you that he has had a year of achievements, but, you know, it has been a year of disappointments. It has been a year of underperformance, from the NBN to the UN, from the census to the royal commission. He cannot do a single thing without stuffing it up. You really only need to look at my own portfolio of education: the great vision for schools from this Prime Minister is him just saying: 'Well the Commonwealth shouldn't fund public schools at all. We'll just let the states do that.' This Prime Minister is trying to prove that he has got an interest in the Gonski school education funding reforms by continuing to say that he went to Sydney Grammar with David Gonski. It takes a bit more than that to prove an interest in properly funding our schools.  A lot of people in this parliament were very lucky to go to university. Many on this side were the first in their families to be able to do it. We did it because we have a system where we do not have $100,000 American-style university degrees. We have a system where, if you are clever, you work hard at high school and you have got a dream, you can pursue it. What we have got on the other side is more than $3 billion of zombie cuts. We have got $100,000 university degrees just waiting for the opportunity for them to bring them in. Deregulation on a grand scale with 20 per cent cuts will make it impossible for universities to function as they do now. In vocational education, what have we seen since this government has come in? A drop of 128,000 apprentices and more than $2 billion cut from vocational education. Bizarrely, we have the Treasurer banging on about the need for more savings and asking, 'What is Labor prepared to do?' I can tell you what we are prepared to do. We are prepared to help to the tune of about $8 billion over the next 10 years by cleaning up the dodgy operators. We know the 10 biggest colleges have graduation rates of less than five per cent. That is what we are prepared to do: clean up the shonky operators and give you billions of dollars of extra revenue while we do it. But I think nothing really captures the spirit of this year of capitulation better than the plebiscite. We have got a Prime Minister who says he is in favour of marriage equality, but, I tell you what, he was in favour of the republic too, and what did we do? We gave him some responsibility to put into action the dreams of the majority of Australians to become a republic. You remember how popular the republic was before Malcolm got his hands on it. We gave him the opportunity to deliver for Australia this historic change with so much popular support, and he blew it. Now we are supposed to feel comfortable about it. He keeps saying: 'Look, nothing to see here. Don't worry about it. It's going to be just like 1999.' That is exactly what he has got us worried about. And we have got the Attorney-General, who is probably the only person who can match the Prime Minister for indifferent arrogance, saying, 'Never mind, we don't need to worry about the tenor of this debate or the tone of this debate.' Well, I am not really reassured, given the Attorney-General is the guy who is saying people have a right to be a bigot. For decades from the establishment of this nation, we did what we could in our legal power to determine who Aboriginal Australians could marry. We tried to prevent them marrying non-Aboriginal Australians. After the Second World War, Australians were not allowed to bring their Japanese wives back to Australia if they had married. In fact, in 1952 we passed legislation to allow Australian service personnel to bring their Japanese wives and children to Australia. Fifty years ago, if you had asked people, they would have said a mother's place was in the home. If they were a working mother like me, away from home a lot, they might have made a judgement that they were not fit to be mothers. Thirty years ago we were still forcibly removing children from their single mothers whether they loved them or not. We did not ask whether they could look after them; we assumed that they could not. I have to say this because I have to remind this chamber that we offered an apology to those women and children who had been separated. Have we not learnt that we should give up judging people's relationships? Haven't we learnt that what matters in a relationship is that two people love each other? Haven't we learnt  that families come in all different shapes and sizes and that what matters is the love and care in that family? We have finally worked that out, and I do not see why we should be offering an opportunity for people whose relationships might be a bit out of the ordinary to have those relationships judged. This parliament is a mess. The year of achievement-you have all seen it-they want to go home and pull the doona up over their heads. They are changing the standing orders so they can leave earlier. They are running out of business. The place is a mess, but it is not the theatre that bothers me. It is the lack of achievement and the lack of ambition for our nation. After one year of this Prime Minister, instead of a leather jacket we are left with an empty suit. Every day we hear people waiting for the real Malcolm to show himself. When will we see him? When is he going to stand up to the right wing of his party and deliver on the things that he always said he cared about? But the bad news for Australians is that this failure, this fizzer, is the real Malcolm Turnbull. This is the Prime Minister they have voted for. The best indication of future behaviour is past behaviour. Be worried.",103
Dr GILLESPIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It is my great pleasure to be here today talking about leadership. We have had the usual emotional argument and philosophical, aspirational policies trotted out as a reason for criticising the leadership of the coalition. You only have to see what was delivered today, the omnibus savings bill with $6.3 billion worth of savings-this was due to negotiation skills and the cutting of a deal; it will deliver the savings that this nation's finances need. As a famous President of the USA said many years ago: 'It's the economy, stupid.' Look at what is happening in the economy now. We are the envy of all the countries in the G7. The growth in our economy, at 3.3 per cent, is outstanding compared to Europe, Japan, America and Canada. They are all envious. We are actually delivering great economic improvements in really tough international times. We have been at the forefront of cracking down on tax avoidance measures. The biggest game in the world economy is moving money away from nation states that rely on taxes. We have led the way on that crackdown. We have been helping our small businesses. Members on this side of the House are very familiar with how hard life is for small businesses because most of them have been in small business. We understand it, as opposed to those on the other side. Earlier today, or yesterday, those on the other side were asked who had been in small business. No-one put their hand up. That gives you an indication of why this coalition government, led by Prime Minister Turnbull and the member for New England, are getting on with delivering results. We have 220,000 jobs that have been created in the last year. The recent ANZ consumer confidence survey is at its highest level all year. We have got tax cuts on the board for small business, and they will go down to 27Â½ per cent. Small businesses, like most Australian industries, rely on the transport industry. The other side had policies in place, such as the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, to send 30,000 small business men and women running transport companies to the wall. It was this coalition government that got rid of that. We are delivering our prepare-trial-hire program that will deliver 120,000 opportunities over the next three years for young unemployed people to get an internship that can lead on to a full-time job. The defence industry plan that we have rolled out is going to deliver a ship-building plan for the next 10 years, which will not only deliver the security for our naval defence that we need, with surface vessels and submarines, but it will also spur many more defence industry  jobs. These are really important initiatives that the Turnbull-Joyce coalition government has delivered. All that money will go into construction and raw product that is sourced out of Australia. The steel that will go into all of these boats will come from Australia. You only have to look at what has happened in the communications sector with the coalition government. We have a $230 million cybersecurity plan that we have rolled out. The NBN was a basket case when the coalition took over the responsibility of government in 2013. There were only 51,000 customers after $6 billion had been spent over six years-that amount of customers is being signed up each month at the moment. We have 2.9 million premises that have now been passed in the last three-and-a-bit years, as opposed to 51,000. We have 1.2 million customers. We have the Sky Muster satellite that is now delivering out to regional Australia, where many of my colleagues are the local members. That is 22,000 people getting an upgraded satellite internet service, let alone the 430,000 people who can now access fixed wireless-as opposed to, after six years, only 51,000 people. That was an absolute joke. We have also delivered a mobile phone black spot program, and that is delivering 499 new or upgraded mobile telephone towers. In the health portfolio we are delivering in spades. We get criticised for attacking bulkbilling, but there were 17 million more bulk-billing services in the past year. It is at record levels. Spending in 2012-13 on health was $61.9 billion; this year it is going to be $71.4 billion. We have increased spending on mental health: a $192 million package, and innovative ways of delivering suicide prevention around 12 sites. We are delivering 10 more headspace sites around the country. The National Innovation and Science Agenda is making it easier to attract capital and get talented people and researchers into the country. We have an accent on science, technology, engineering and maths, with a 26 per cent increase in funding to schools. We are trying to promote the take-up of science and technology in schools across the nation, and trying to make accessible celebrated female scientists and technology leaders in particular as role models for our children. You have only to see what we have delivered for inland rail to see this is nation-building infrastructure. We committed just under $600 million in the last budget to secure land for the route, for the further preplanning and delivery of it. That will take 200,000 trucks off the road every year. It will link Melbourne to Brisbane with one continuous rail line, straight to the Port of Brisbane. It will also open up the corridor, and there will be at least 800 jobs in the actual construction of it. But that is just one initial benefit; there will be 600 extra jobs per year, year after year, due to the growth in the economy along the corridor. That is the absolute long-term benefit. You only have to see what water can do to the inland of Australia. We have one of the driest continents on earth but, for decades, there has been no dam construction. What has the Turnbull-Joyce government done? The coalition, in the last term, delivered the first dam built in Australia for decades-the Chaffey Dam was extended. We have also got another $500 million in a fund to go into dams-the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund-as well as a $2 billion loan facility. That is going into the Rookwood Weir in Queensland, the Dungowan Dam in New South Wales, the Macalister Irrigation District and Loddon pipeline in Victoria and the second Tasmanian irrigation tranche, which will provide four new dams and make reliable water a feature in the Apple Isle. You can have all the land you like but you  cannot grow anything without secure water. That is the important thing. That is what dams do. They deliver secure water. That water delivers money into the economy. So, with inland rail and dams, we are getting the heartland of Australia developed-which has been put on ice for way too long. This government is also delivering security to our nation. We have kept our borders secure. It is more than 800 days since a boat arrived, and we have closed down 17 detention centres. The previous government opened up 17 detention centres. In the previous administration, there was a peak of 2,000 children in detention-now there are none. Because we have controlled our borders, we have been able to initiate taking up to 12,000 Syrian, Turkish and Jordanian refugees in a special program-as well as our existing, very generous and compassionate refugee intake system. We have a $50 billion land infrastructure package. We have our Smart Cities plan, which is delivering $4 billion. We have delivered three Smart Cities packages already- (Time expired)",105
Mr GOSLING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I am amazed by some of the commentary we have heard today about leadership. Leadership is the ability to influence a group of people. But what seems pretty clear is that the influencing is coming the other way and, unfortunately, our Prime Minister, who is supposed to be leading our country, cannot lead his own party. He is being led down the garden path and being told what to do by the member for Warringah and another bunch of people over in the other place who are setting the agenda. When it comes to the same sex plebiscite, or marriage equality, in this parliament, I came down to this place to listen to what the Prime Minister had to say about his reasons for having this plebiscite when he clearly does not believe in it himself-or used to not believe in it himself. He spoke about being respectful of gay couples. Well, if you are respectful then you will tell the people in your team to pull their head in when they are saying the tenor of this debate is not important. Of course the tenor of this debate is important. Of course the people who are going to be damaged in this debate are important-they are Australians. And we are going to put a whole heap of money into something that is unnecessary. What the Prime Minister should be doing is his job, like John Howard did-he legislated to change the act. Why can't that happen again? On my side, the previous member for Solomon did a survey about this issue and there was overwhelming support for marriage equality. If you think we need to waste this money on a plebiscite that has a real possibility of hurting people, of damaging people, it shows that you are out of touch. The conversation has been had around our country-around barbecues, at sporting venues and in pubs. If you are not sure what the Australian people have been saying in those conversations, maybe you should talk to someone over on this side-because it is pretty clear. We take representing people seriously, and it has been really disappointing. I have only been in this place for 15 seconds but what I have clearly seen already in that short period of time is that morale is not strong over on the other side because the leader of that side is not in command of this national project. So morale is low. My advice is: do your job and lead, influence people. There is going to be a huge price to pay. That $170 million could be used on so many things to help the people of our country. I want to be constructive. I am obviously not happy. Like a lot of Australians, I am disappointed. But I do want to be constructive. I think it is great that we have shown  cooperation on this side of the House with some measures around the omnibus bill. I think that is good, I think that is positive. There are a lot of things where we could work together. It is just unfortunate that there is a lack of leadership, which is not allowing us to do what is right for the progressive future of our country, to advance Australia fairly for all Australians. I would like to say a lot more, but time is short. I would like to work constructively with the Prime Minister, but he might not have that opportunity if he does not start to lead. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (15:37): I rise to speak on this questionable and spurious MPI. It is reprehensible that such drivel from those opposite is debated today when there are more important issues at play. But it is unsurprising that Labor has chosen another farcical stunt like this one. We as members all have our own opinions about who is a good leader and who is not. The very fact that each of the members is here today demonstrates the opinions of their constituents. They may even think you are a good leader in their area. However, like my colleagues, I base my opinion of a good leader on actions and on merit. As Rudyard Kipling said, 'Let each man be judged by his deeds.' Merit is at the very core of this MPI, mainly because it establishes what our Prime Minister has achieved so far. Today represents one year of leadership by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. In that time, this government-under his leadership-has indeed achieved. A few examples that I would like to share convey only a brief taste of just some of the achievements the Turnbull-led government has delivered. Under Prime Minister Turnbull, our economy and budget are strengthening. Economic growth has strengthened to 3.3 per cent, and Australia's 870,000 incorporated small businesses-the engine room of our economy supported by this government-will be further boosted as a result of our changes, giving them a fair go at competing. We have also delivered a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, something the other side never delivered. Under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, 220,000 new jobs have been created in the past year alone. Sixty per cent of those jobs have gone to women. The Turnbull government has delivered a Defence industry plan-not talked about it, not written papers, not had committees; they have delivered a Defence industry plan: a $195 billion spend on defence capability over the next 10 years. They have not ripped the heart out of Defence, which is what the Labor government did when they were in power. Our naval shipbuilding plan involves the construction of 54 new naval vessels-not one was ever delivered by the other side; not one single dinghy was delivered by the other side. We will be using Australian steel for our new submarines and creating, yet again, more Australian jobs. The Turnbull government is investing in critical telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia. Through the new NBN Sky Muster satellite and our $230 million Mobile Black Spot Program, we are already delivering 449 new or improved mobile phone towers, covering 3,000 black spots left by Labor, with more to come. The Turnbull government has grown more export markets, which have opened up. This means Australian small businesses have access to some of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world. Beef and wine exports, just to mention two, have seen record growth. The Turnbull government is delivering health care. In the last year, there were 17 million more GP services bulk-billed, compared to Labor's last year in office. We have made many medicines cheaper and added life-saving drugs to the PBS, including drugs for breast cancer and melanoma. The Turnbull government is investing in more localised mental health care and support. This includes trialling innovative IT solutions, and it also includes 24/7 support,  12 suicide prevention sites around Australia and 10 more headspace facilities. The Turnbull government has implemented stronger laws to give our security agencies the tools they need, and to give our troops the powers they need. The Turnbull government is building stronger communities. On 1 July this year, the coalition government began the full rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. And let us not forget that it was the Turnbull government that delivered Senate voting reforms which have ended the days of backroom deals and preference whisperers determining election results, rather than Australian voters",107

The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Order! Mrs PRENTICE: But, of course, the Labor Party do not want the Australian people to have a voice. That is why they are against a plebiscite. This demonstrates the Prime Minister's strong leadership, in stark contrast to those opposite. The coalition is a broad church, with a congregation often containing differing views-views that, on this side, we are allowed to discuss. We are not controlled by their faceless leaders, the union bosses to which those opposite are all slaves. Unlike those opposite, the parties forming the coalition believe in democracy-which appointed the Prime Minister and has delivered his strong, determined leadership.",109
Mr HART,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," There is a problem with this Prime Minister's leadership, and the problem is that there is none. There is a complete absence of leadership by this Prime Minister. Leadership, when you look at this Prime Minister, is very hard to define. Leadership can mean many different things to different people. It can mean leading a group of people, like the government, or it can mean occupying a particular position. I suggest that the current Prime Minister simply occupies the position of leader but demonstrates none of the attributes which deliver leadership. He occupies the office but he has none of the authority. Who is in control? There is a difference between the rhetoric that this government delivers and what it actually delivers. He speaks of his achievements, but there is nothing actually delivered. What is actually delivered is disappointment, dithering and division. Let us talk about disappointment. Who has the Prime Minister disappointed? For a start, he has not listened to my community, and I would suggest that he has not listened to the Australian community. He has not listened to my community regarding the important issues of health and education. He was able to deliver for Tasmania-he delivered three new Labor members! On same-sex marriage, he wants an expensive, $170 million opinion poll, forced to heel by the right of the Liberal party. He has disappointed everybody in Australia who wants a first-class NBN. What do we get instead? We have a bastardisation of an NBN plan with a second-class NBN that will be delivered across Australia. He has no tax plan-or, if he has a tax plan, it varies from day to day. First, he floats an increase in the GST, but that only lasts for a few days or a few weeks. Then he floats for a matter of hours a proposal regarding double taxation. That was a good one. It lasted longer than Paris Hilton's marriage-no, that was another marriage. He did not settle on the question of tax cuts; instead he delivered $50 billion worth of tax cuts to the big end of town. He prefers the big end of town instead of ordinary working Australians.  He has disappointed women on his own side of parliament. He has called himself a feminist but he is the worse performing minister in appointing females to boards. He has five fewer females as members of parliament compared to the previous Prime Minister. He has disappointed Australians. Laurie Oakes commented on his speech on election night that it was the most disappointing, pathetic speech given by a Prime Minister. He is a ditherer. He has no authority to make decisions. He has to wait on what the Right of his party says he can do before he makes a decision. He knows that our vote in this place on same-sex marriage will deliver same-sex marriage almost immediately. Instead, he wants an expensive, non-binding opinion poll to resolve the matter. He is not able to resist the Right of his party. He floats ideas that last for less than hours. He is a master of division. He has no leadership. He is unable to advocate for positions he has held previously. Again, on the issue of same-sex marriage, he is somebody who advocated for a free vote in this parliament but now prefers an expensive plebiscite. He facilitates language like the Treasurer's 'taxed or taxed-nots'. He prefers to raise solutions but not advocate for change. He talks about being flexible but offers no flexibility when it comes to delivering policy in this House. He talks about housing affordability but does not strike at the heart of the issue, instead preferring the big end of town and preferring people to have outrageous tax breaks instead of making practical solutions in this place. (Time expired)",109
Mr HASTIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The audacity to pose this question. You have attacked the PM over his leadership while the opposition leader has tuck tailed a run to Canada just when the going gets tough over the plebiscite. Today, it is very clear that the PM's leadership is both substantive and compelling. And a few facts-I will start right at the top: on 2 January there was an election. We won and you lost. We have a mandate, we formed government and we sit on the Treasury benches. The Prime Minister is our leader and he is doing an exceptional job. The PM is committed-doggedly committed-to delivering for the Australian people. The twin responsibilities of federal government are economic and national security. Firstly, economic security: today we learned economic growth has strengthened to 3.3 per cent, which is faster than any G7 nation. We have created 220,000 jobs this past year, with 60 per cent of those jobs for women. We have also made legislative changes to section 46, making Australian businesses more competitive. We abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was a union pox on owner-operator truckies in this country and Glen Morris of Serpentine in Canning, an owner-operator truckie, is very, very glad that we did. Going forward, we are introducing the PaTH program, which will create 120,000 jobs for young people in the private sector, changing lives and creating opportunity. We also have the enterprise tax plan, which will provide 870,000 incorporated small businesses with a tax cut this year, driving both growth and jobs. When it comes to infrastructure investment, the Prime Minister again has shown leadership in delivering a $50 billion land infrastructure package, a 15-year rolling plan which will provide confidence and continuity to industry and investment. We have rolled out the NBN to three million premises in this country, and 1.2 million homes and businesses are now active customers, providing economic, social and educational opportunities to Australians across this country both in our cities and in regional areas.  When it comes to national security-the other pillar-the Prime Minister is delivering. We are going to provide a $195 billion spend on defence capability over the next 10 years. We are going to build 54 new naval vessels. Under Labor, under your previous government, not even a piece of driftwood came out of your efforts in this space. When it comes to border protection, it has been 800 days since a boat arrival. You opened 17 detention centres and we have closed 17Dr Aly interjecting",110
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Cowan is out of place and will be silent.,111
Mr HASTIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Under Labor, you put 8,000 children into detention and we have no children in detention under this current government. When it comes to mental health, you have gone to lengths to suggest that somehow we are indifferent to mental health, particularly when it comes to LGBT young people. I can tell you from personal experience that the Prime Minister is very responsive to this issue. I lobbied him for the last nine months and he has provided $2 million to Canning for a new purely youth medical service health club which will provide a range of services, particularly health care, to young people. While we are on the topic of leadership, let's reflect upon Bill Shorten. As the Prime Minister said today in question time, 'truth matters.' I think it is impossible to sound the depth of Bill Shorten's mendacity",111
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member will refer to members by their titles.,111
Mr HASTIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"the opposition leader's mendacity when it comes to the Mediscare campaign preying on the fears of vulnerable Australians. He also sits atop a bland, faceless monoculture which is the modern Labor Party, where virtue signalling is everything. You do not even have a conscience vote on same-sex marriage. In fact, you are so arrogant that you assume that every single Australian agrees with your position, which is why you deny them democracy and you deny them the plebiscite. It is nothing but scare tactics and slippery-slope arguments. It is a craven approach that you are taking. You are draining the life out of this Australian democracy. I would use the word 'vampiric'. In fact, I might even start walking the halls with a necklace of garlic to ward off these vampires who are killing this country.",111
Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting Mr Stephen Jones: It went better in the shower.,111
Mr HASTIE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Maybe it did, but the point remains: the PM is leading and the opposition leader is failing, and that is it.",111
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the next speaker, I remind members that if they are out of their designated places it is grossly disorderly to interject. The debate will continue in silence.",111
Ms KEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I do not want my first speech on matters of public importance to be negative, but what positives could I possibly tell the Australian people that would make them feel proud of their Prime Minister and their government? Along with so many other Australians, I was genuinely heartened that when the member for Wentworth became Prime Minister we would see something different. But when government MPs and the Prime Minister were given the opportunity yesterday to outline to the Australian people his achievements of the last 12 months, there was only one: the Prime Minister's defence of the  behaviour of the big banks, which are ripping the heart out of vulnerable Australians. On that side of the House they are divided. There is no unity and there is no leadership. I know from my electorate of Braddon and home state of Tasmania that for the nation it has been a year full of disappointment. As at April this year there were at least 17 backflips that this Prime Minister had committed in seven months. I have lost count, from that point on, of how many more there have been. On issues that the Prime Minister once passionately believed in either he now has no time for them or he is simply far too consumed with appeasing the far right wing in order to maintain his leadership. On marriage equality, the Prime Minister is on record as supporting a free vote in the party room, but he is unable to stand up to the right wing and show leadership. Instead, the Prime Minister wants to subject our nation to a divisive plebiscite. On the republic, the Prime Minister was a cheerleader but now he says it is not time. And on climate change, where he previously supported carbon emissions trading schemes, the Prime Minister has again spectacularly backflipped. The Prime Minister's backflips do not just stay with social policy. On economic policy the backflips are equally spectacular. At one stage the Prime Minister's economic plan consisted of an idea to raise the GST to 15 per cent, but then he ditched it. A plan for double taxation; a 48-hour backflip: I guess the achievement here is that it took the Prime Minister two days to realise it was a dumb idea. It would have resulted in higher taxes paid by Tasmanians to be able to afford health and education-funding that he wanted to walk away from-which would have resulted in negative economic growth and negative population growth, leaving Tasmania a basket case. Was that his plan for Tasmania? It is little wonder that the community has no idea what he stands for. It has been clear since day one of the Prime Minister assuming the leadership of the Liberal Party that he is being led by his own far right wing fringe. Which tail is wagging the dog? In my home state of Tasmania and my electorate of Braddon, the sense of disappointment is at its strongest. This is borne out of the result of the recent election, when Tasmania overwhelmingly rejected the Prime Minister and the policies he stood for. In Tasmania the Liberal Party recorded the lowest two-party preferred vote in any state in the nation. Despite the Prime Minister saying he has learnt the lessons from the election, nothing has changed. I cannot even get one of the four Liberal senators to come to my electorate. They do not want to. They are giving up on regional Tasmania. He is still cutting Medicare. He is still cutting millions of dollars in bulk-billing incentives for pathology services. He does not want to invest in Gonski. And then there is the NBN. There have been three iterations of the NBN for the west coast of Tasmania and still no-one knows what is going on. For Tasmania the Prime Minister's priorities just do not cut it. Since the member for Wentworth became Prime Minister, 5,200 jobs have been lost in Tasmania. The participation rate in Tasmania has plummeted to just 59.3 per cent. The government's claims of jobs and growth do not stack up in Tasmania. Fourteen jobs a day are being lost in Tasmania under the Prime Minister's watch. At a time Tasmania desperately needs leadership when it comes to tackling the jobs crisis, the Prime Minister has not shown any. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (15:58): I was very interested to read that the subject of today's MPI was the failure of leadership. As the Speaker has said many times, these debates give us the opportunity to compare and contrast, so I wondered who had put up this opportunity for us to compare and contrast the result for the Prime Minister with that for the  opposition leader. Then I worked it out: the opposition leader is away; it was the member for Sydney. It is the most Machiavellian MPI, I think, that we have ever seen. It reminds me of that old quote: 'When the cat's away, the mice will play.' There were some very serious comments made today by the outgoing US ambassador, John Berry. These are unprecedented comments following the affair of the junior senator for New South Wales. The ambassador said: We have been surprised, quite frankly, at the extent of the involvement of the Chinese government in Australian politics. Paul Kelly said the implication in this: â¦ points to US concerns about China's ability to deploy finances to build influence and even manipulate outcomes â¦ This brings us to leadership. What we saw was the junior senator for New South Wales making comments on the South China Sea that were contrary to our national interests and so dangerous, so irresponsible and so reckless that a true leader would have stood up and removed that person from the shadow cabinet. What did we have? Absolutely nothing. And when it was found that cash had been paid from those associated with the Chinese communist party to that same senator, it should have been a clear-cut, black-and-white decision that that man had to be removed from the shadow cabinet. But what leadership did we see? We saw a Leader of the Opposition who is simply controlled by the factions of the Labor Party-a complete and utter failure. On the same-sex marriage debate, a true Leader of the Opposition would admit that they lost the election and would say: 'Let's have the plebiscite, and I'm going to lead the case for yes. I'm going to stand up and I'm going to debate in every corner of the nation and stand-up for the yes case.' That is what a true leader would do, but what did we see yesterday? The most disgraceful and shameful comments-I will not even repeat them because they are beyond contempt. When it comes to tackling the debt problem of this nation, a true opposition leader would stand up and admit that we have a big problem in this nation, that we have to do everything that we possibly can to get the budget back into balance, but we hear none of this from the opposition. We just hear whingeing and whining about cuts that do not exist. What would have happened earlier this year if we had had a true opposition leader when the Road Service Remuneration Tribunal handed down its decision that put small independent truck driversguys that are the salt of the earth-at a competitive disadvantage that is going to drive them out of business. What did we see from the opposition leader? He sat down and rolled over and took instructions from the bosses of the TWU. That is lack of leadership. What do we have on this side? Let us compare and contrast. We have business confidence up eight per cent from last year. We have GDP at 3.3 per cent. Now let us look at how that compares. The USA is currently 1.2 per cent, the whole Euro area is 1.6 per cent, Japan is 0.8 per cent and even the UK, the standout performer of Europe is just at 2.2 per cent. We in this nation are leading the world in GDP growth, and what does that mean? That means an extra 200,000 jobs have been created in this economy in the last 12 months. That GDP growth of 3.3 per cent equates to an extra $34 billion worth of wealth created in this economy in the last 12 months than if it had been somewhere around the 1.2 per cent growth that the USA had.  That $34 billion worth of extra wealth means more is paid in taxes, more revenue flows into the Treasury and we get to do more of the things that count for this country. True leadership is understanding. It is understanding about delegating, it is understanding that jobs in this economy are created by the private sector and it is giving them the opportunity to create wealth. (Time expired)",111
Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I mentioned in my first speech, on Monday, that often the public is very cynical about politics and politicians. Their expectations are low, but when they are high they are seldom met. I think the public often believe that there is on this stage too much sound and fury without much substance at all. When they look at leadership in this place, the public should probably see at least some potential in our political leaders, because political leaders, through their vision, shape the fate of a nation. We have in the office of Prime Minister a person who has had a tremendous opportunity, a privilege that is given to so few, to make a mark on our country, to change our society for the better, yet in 12 months in the job he has utterly failed in his leadership. The member for Wentworth has been a comprehensive disappointment to millions of Australians. His promise has been unfulfilled. His vision-if there was one to begin with-is nowhere to be seen. He presides over a bare policy cupboard. He spent the last year frantically attempting to fill it with thought bubbles that popped almost immediately after they came out of his mouth. For instance, we can all recall when the Prime Minister, with his puffed-up chest, lectured the nation about what he called 'once-in-a-generation reform'. We all remember that. He put forward the idea, if I could call it that, of returning income tax powers to state governments. Two days later-only two days later-the greatest reforms to federalism for a generation, according to the Prime Minister, had ignominiously slithered down the COAG drain. The member for Wentworth scraped the bottom of the 20th century tax-policy barrel with that ill thought-out idea. It was a horrible idea. Interestingly enough, in stark contrast, he authored an article in 1976 where he criticised Malcolm Fraser for suggesting the very same policy idea. The PM and his brains trust, in what must have been a mad scramble to put together something, anything, then sought to replace it-and this is quite remarkable-with a $50 billion tax cut for corporate Australia. This policy was so well developed that the Prime Minister was quoted no less than 18 times as saying he did not even know what it cost. The PM's former employer, Goldman Sachs, however, certainly did do its due diligence. Goldman Sachs stated that the tax cuts would mostly benefit foreign domiciled companies. Perhaps he should consult his own cabinet a little more often. We all remember the cringeworthy debacle of the Prime Minister failing to consult the Treasurer on the date of the budget, leaving government members chaotically uninformed. Now, even though the member for Wentworth may believe in some progressive policies-I am sure he does deep down, maybe some of them-the sadness, the tragedy, of his predicament is that he cannot deliver these policies, because his own party will not let him. It is rumoured that the Prime Minister strongly backed reforms to negative gearing but was rolled by the right wingers in his party room. It is rumoured the Prime Minister was again overridden by the right wing of his party on climate change. He is now peddling a policy that he himself once described, as a fig leaf and a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. But, it actually could be worse. I may be being too kind.  The most damning indictment of his failed leadership would be-and I think it is-that he has actually traded away his own values for the top job. I am just a new member in this place, a new backbencher, yet in my first week I was confronted by the Prime Minister. On the first day of this parliament in the hallway he proceeded to lecture me about the notion of bipartisan support for a marriage equality plebiscite. I was a bit shocked. I did not know what to say. Then he turned his attack on the NBN and insisted that they were building it, that he was building it. He assured me that they were building it. Such a great statesman was roaming the halls of parliament seeking anyone who may throw a lifeline to his withering legacy. He is in danger of sinking even further into the depths of obscurity than the man he has usurped. The simple fact is that Australia deserves better than this Prime Minister.",114
Mr COLEMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Leadership is about getting things done, and this Prime Minister is getting things done. There are so many things on the list of achievements. The biggest number in the Australian economy is GDP growth. GDP growth is about how well our economy is growing. Is it increasing in size? Are there more opportunities being created? Our GDP growth is one of the highest rates anywhere in the developed world and higher than any country in the G7-so, higher than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the UK. All of those countries have lower GDP rates than Australia. Ours is 3.3 per cent, which is a fantastic outcome. It is an outcome that is leading to job creation. When those opposite left power it was forecasted that by around now the unemployment rate would be up to about 6.5 per cent. It is not; it is 5.7 per cent. It is lower because of the strong economic growth under this government, with more than 200,000 jobs created in the last 12 months. Those are incredibly important statistics because ultimately so much of what we do in this place manifests itself into GDP and GDP growth. We have a stronger rate of GDP growth than any country in the G7-the world's most sophisticated economies. That is an exceptionally strong achievement. We are also very serious about budget repair. When those opposite came into power there was $50 billion of cash in the bank. They left with $200 billion of net debt. That was very bad. It means that we now have a significant interest bill that we are required to pay. We are required to pay about $16 billion every year because of the negligence of those opposite. Happily, those opposite have cooperated with the government this week in passing $6 billion of important measures in the omnibus savings bill. That was an important achievement-and due credit goes to the opposition for supporting that-but there is a lot more to be done because the debt and deficit legacy of those opposite is so immense. We are going to be talking about it for many years to come and we will be confronting its challenges for many years to come. So there has been good progress this week. The government will continue to focus on this area. We are also investing in the national security of the country and creating a strong national defence industry. There is $195 billion of investment, particularly in naval capability. Those opposite did not build a single ship during their six years in office. We will invest almost $200 billion in this space over the next 10 years and we will ensure that defence spending as a proportion of GDP rises from the woeful levels we saw under those opposite. We also believe unapologetically in business tax cuts because business tax cuts mean more investment and more investment by business means more jobs. Ideologically, those opposite do not like that, but it happens to be true. Those opposite think that, if a business has a  turnover of more than $2 million, it is a big business and it is not entitled to any tax relief. But if a business has a turnover of $2 million it does not mean that it makes $2 million of profit. It might make three per cent or four per cent of $2 million. With $2 million of turnover it might be making about the equivalent of a wage. They think that is a big business. That demonstrates their complete lack of understanding of these economic matters. There are huge problems for those opposite in economic policy. In the election campaign they said: 'This is how much our super policy is going to affect the budget but we can't tell you what it is. We can't tell you what our policy is. We can tell you what the financial impact of it will be but we can't actually tell you what it is.' That is true; I am not making that up. It is worth reviewing the famous press conference where it was said, 'We will tell you how much we are going to save on our superannuation policy but we won't tell you what it is, because we do not know.' That is just kindergarten stuff. They also knowingly signed up to increasing budget deficits by $16 billion over the forward estimates. So not content with the budget vandalism from 2010 to 2013 they said, 'Let's whack another $16 billion on top of it over the next four years just for good measure,' just to make things a bit worse. That was really quite extraordinary. The other good one is that they wanted to increase tax on business investment through negative gearing and capital gains tax. When you increase tax on investment, what happens? Less investment. If you increase tax on investment you get less investment. They again owned up to wanting to do that. So there is a lot of leadership on this side and none from those opposite.",115
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The time for the discussion has expired. NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Intelligence and Security Committee Membership,116
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," The Speaker has received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Whish-Wilson has been appointed a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and Senators Bushby, Fawcett, Gallagher, MCKenzie and Wong have been appointed members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Consideration resumed of the motion: That the following Address in Reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament",116
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Before I call the honourable member for Lyons, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (16:14): I acknowledge the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, and pay my respect to elders past and present. I also acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands that comprise my electorate of Lyons and pay my respect to Tasmania's elders past and present. It had been my intention to deliver my first speech around noon yesterday, but the rambunctious nature of this chamber can foil even the best laid plans, as the members for Stirling and Pearce discovered a week ago. I thank the people of Lyons for extending to me the great privilege of representing them in this national parliament. The weighty significance of that trust is not lost upon me. I take this opportunity to thank Eric Hutchinson, the former member for Lyons, for his service to the electorate, the parliament and the nation. We are on different sides of the political fence, but our contest was a civil one. Eric and his family have my very best wishes. One of my first tasks will be ensuring the government keeps the election promises it made to my electorate, but I am also prosecuting the case for Labor's agenda in Tasmania-one that is centred on delivering economic growth with fairness. Tasmanians turned overwhelmingly to Labor in July, returning four members in that state, so it is entirely appropriate that government gives more serious consideration to implementing Labor's plan for our state-the plan that Tasmanians voted for. Indeed, a commitment from the Prime Minister to implement Labor's plan would provide for him something more elusive than a Tasmanian tiger-an achievement-and it would be marvellous to announce it on this, the anniversary of the day the Prime Minister employed agility and innovation to give the member for Warringah the boot. Government senators would no longer have to wax lyrical about the history of flags and favourite television shows. They could instead be talking about the government investing in Cradle Mountain, delivering the ex-HMAS Tobruk as a dive wreck of St Helens and completing the Three Capes Track on the Tasman Peninsula. They could be crowing about delivering Gonski; providing Tasmanian schoolchildren with the opportunities they need to advance in the 21st century; providing a sports centre to Longford and a football hub to the Derwent Valley. They could be telling my constituents that they had encouraged Launceston Airport, a big multinational, to cough up the $1 million that it owes Northern Midlands residents in unpaid rates. All these and more were Labor promises for Lyons that the government failed to match, and all of them would provide the jobs and growth that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are so fond of talking about. Importantly, they would deliver confidence to the regional communities in my electorate that need it most. If the government were to get behind Labor's plan, I would be more than happy to sing its praises. The offer is there and I do hope it is taken up. Tasmania is a bountiful state and I am pleased to say much of the bounty is produced in Lyons. People in Lyons produce glorious food-whiskey, gin, beer and wine-and I regard it as a solemn duty, as the local MP, to sample as much as I can as often as possible. It is a heavy, heavy burden! Indeed, as I pile into my ute to criss-cross my visually stunning electorate, with its mountains, forests, plateaus and rocky coastlines, I often thank my good  fortune. With Springsteen up loud and the window wound down, I know I have the best job in the world. I get to meet incredible people who are resilient, warm, welcoming and tough: a dairy farming family, their livelihood devastated by floods, who still manage to volunteer for their community and lobby for netball courts; a maritime worker passionate about Australian jobs on Australian ships, who despite losing his own job campaigns for others to keep theirs; migrants from Greece who opened a kebab shop in Bridgewater and work morning till night to provide for their family. A woman suffering leukaemia attended a public meeting in Campbell Town to support rights at work. She has nothing to gain personally-she expects to be dead within a year-but she cares so deeply about her country and its future that she ventures out on a cold evening to make the case. And when I compare her courage and selflessness to the self-interested whining of billionaires who demand lower wages for Australian workers, I know whose side I am on. Nine in 10 of my constituents are Australian-born and 46 per cent of my workforce are tradies, technicians, labourers or machine operators. It is an electorate at work. They do not suffer spin, and God help any politician who tries to deliver a line cooked up by a Canberra spin doctor hipster. I am in awe always of the volunteers throughout my electorate . Whether ambos or firies, quilt stitchers or cooks and kitchen hands, volunteers are the heroines and heroes of Lyons. Their dedication to their fellow citizens humbles me every day. Across my electorate some really interesting stuff is going on across a range of sectors, especially agriculture. Millions of people are joining Asia's emerging middle class and are prepared to pay for top-quality food. That is the market Tasmanian agriculture is increasingly targeting, and key to growing our $1.44 billion agriculture sector is protecting our precious status for GM-free produce and value-adding wherever possible. For example, Peter in Beauty Point makes bacon better. I know-how is it even possible? He smokes it in all sorts of interesting ways, while Kate and Ian raise biodynamic goats in Bream Creek. They are amongst hundreds of small to medium producers and business people finding new markets. Aquaculture is rocketing ahead with necessary environmental safeguards, and I am excited about the prospect of trials for seaweed farming. Rod at Boyer has big ideas for the manufacture of eco-friendly solvents and I am keen to progress the possibilities for woodwaste biomass energy and electricity production. I acknowledge there are political hurdles to this, including on my side of the House, but I believe the economic potential for Tasmania is too great to ignore. If Europe can accept biomass as an environmentally acceptable alternative to coal-not as a replacement for solar, wind and wave but as an adjunct to it-I fail to see why Tasmania should not benefit. Just as an agricultural aside, the anticipated $170 million cost of the government's marriage equality plebiscite is $10 million more than the annual value of Tasmania's entire crop of spuds. So we are not talking small potatoes. Here is my suggestion, for what it is worth: let's have a free vote in this parliament, where all the arguments for and against can be freely discussed. And then let's give every member in this place $1 million, which they can distribute throughout their electorate to community and sporting groups, volunteers and others. That $1 million per electorate could do a lot of good, and there would still be at least $20 million left over. It is just a suggestion. It seems a much better way to spend public money.  I am passionate about the potential for growing new industry in my state and electorate, because behind Tasmania's beauty there are challenges to be faced and overcome. Tasmanians are left behind when it comes to health, education, jobs, social mobility and income. Regional towns and outer suburbs lag behind on most indicators of economic and social well-being. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high-20 per cent in some areas-and I cannot help but feel that is aligned to historically poor educational outcomes. Fewer than half my constituents complete year 12, let alone higher education. Doing years 11 and 12 can be challenging in regional Tasmania, with students generally expected to travel long distances to specialist colleges. Public transport is absolutely woeful, and I am convinced the two are aligned. If we want better educational outcomes, we must offer better ways to access education. I wish the Tasmanian state government every success with its bid to roll out year 11 and year 12 courses to more local high schools, but I fear that, without proper resourcing and without more intensive efforts to encourage young people to stay on, it will not succeed. In July 2014, I had the honour of being preselected as the first Australian Labor Party candidate for the 2016 election. Nearly every weekend for two years I doorknocked and attended fairs and agricultural shows-not a bad way to spend a weekend. In the last eight weeks of the campaign, I doorknocked just about every day. I talked to a lot of people, but more importantly I listened. One of the first things I committed to was opposing the presence of freezer factory trawlers operating in Australia's small pelagic fishery. I continue to oppose the presence of these voracious vessels-a view I know is shared across the aisle with some government members. I look forward to working with my Tasmanian colleagues to progress this further during this parliament. It will come as no surprise to anyone here that the key concern expressed at the doors was about the future of health care in Australia: the rising costs, the lack of access, and the long waiting lists in emergency and for surgery. For the record, I want Medicare expanded to include dental coverage for all Australians, more focus on mental and preventative health, and a full rollout of medicinal cannabis treatment. I am not amongst those who regard public health care as an unaffordable cost burden, as something to be sliced and diced whenever possible. It is an essential element of Australian society. Improving health improves lives. We are a wealthy country, and the least we owe our citizens is good health. Our fellow citizens are crying out for evidence of strong, principled and authentic political leadership, and we here in this chamber have a duty to provide it. When I look at the calibre of the membership of this 45th Parliament, I am confident we are up to the challenge. We have members who have done duty in war zones, met with world leaders and overcome adversity through gender, culture or religion that I cannot even begin to fathom. As someone whose most adventurous moment to date was barely surviving the spinning teacup ride at Movie World, I am humbled to be in such exciting company. I decided to run for parliament for many reasons, but if I had to give just one it is that I do not want Australia to end up like America, where for 40 years trickle-down economics has made a wasteland of the once great American middle class, with wages flattened, jobs casualised and contracted out or sent overseas and working conditions stripped bare. The 'American Dream' has been smashed by ruthless corporations that pay little tax and low wages but post big profits. The evidence is in and it is overwhelming. Trickle-down is a dud. It does not build prosperity; it merely entrenches wealth amongst those who have it.  We live in a fantastic country, envied the world over for its standard of living, its natural beauty and its welcoming, laid-back culture. But we did not get here by accident. We got here by design, by former members of this parliament taking deliberate action to create a fairer, more inclusive society. Past parliaments, in economic times much tougher than ours, I might add, created a robust social security system and legislated for universal health and affordable education. They had the foresight to invest heavily in public infrastructure, giving us telecommunications, highways, rail, dams and ports, and they created a progressive taxation system and universal superannuation. They recognised women's suffrage, Indigenous rights and embraced multiculturalism and the rights of LGBTIQ Australians. Each of these elements was hard won, in the face of substantial, sometimes vitriolic, opposition; but woven together they now form the egalitarian tapestry that defines our national identity, which has been central to 25 years of uninterrupted economic growth. So it is inexplicable to me why some are so intent on unpicking the threads of this tapestry. They appear to have cast their gaze to America and like what they see: higher costs for health and education, with worse outcomes; the freezing of superannuation increments; cutting social security to pay for high-income tax cuts; and demolishing unions because they are too effective at winning higher pay and better conditions. They make life harder, more miserable, more desperate. It is economic and social madness, and morally indefensible. I arrived in the parliament around 6.40 this morning, and the cleaners were preparing to go home. I looked at those women-and they are mostly women-and I thought: any of them could have been my own mother, who cleaned schools and hospitals throughout my childhood. Part of the great mission we have in Labor is to ensure these women-all women-are paid fairly for their work and have the opportunity to advance through life. That means child care, education and access to services, and that their sons and daughters are able to aspire to their dreams, constrained only by the limits of their own endeavour and ability. I hesitate to say that addressing income inequality is the moral challenge of our time-that space is crowded with climate change and budget repair-but it comes close. Indeed, last year the International Monetary Fund released a paper and repeated Barack Obama's statement of 2013 that income inequality is 'the defining challenge of our time'. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has written extensively on the subject, as has Robert Reich, who was Bill Clinton's labour secretary. A message to the Treasurer after today's effort in question time: it is not enough to talk about economic growth for its own sake. We need to talk about the outcomes and objectives that growth must deliver. We live in a society, not an economy. We do not live to serve the economy; it exists to serve us. It is an important distinction. When pensioners in Bridgewater cannot afford their power bill they do not feel prosperous. When a family in Deloraine scraping by on Newstart must choose between rent and food, they are not excited by news of record corporate profits. A man in Midway Point already waiting months for bowel cancer treatment, who is told there will be more delays, wonders why $48 billion in corporate tax cuts is deemed more important than funding the surgery that can save his life. What relevance does prosperity have if it is not shared? More and more economists are abandoning trickledown economics. They can see with their own eyes the promise of the theory does not match the lived experience. We need a new conversation about how Australia's economy can be utilised to shape better lives for all Australians.  It is my great hope that this 45th Parliament becomes a champion for inclusive prosperity, achieving what Ben Chifley called 'greater happiness to the mass of the people'. I am delighted to have been seated next to the member for Lilley who, as Treasurer, was instrumental in saving Australia from the global recession that devastated so many other countries and who in the years since has been a leading voice for inclusive prosperity. I give him fair warning that he can look forward to a sore left ear in the months to come. I was born in England and grew up in Maddington, an outer suburb of Perth in WA. When we landed in Australia in 1975 our parents intended settling in Melbourne, but after some months at the migrant hostel in Maribyrnong they decided the weather was too much like England, so we piled into a Falcon 500 and spent a week crossing the dusty Nullarbor to sunny Perth. Of course, if we had stayed in Melbourne I might well have become the member for Maribyrnong. That does not bear thinking about! My political journey started, as it does for many, at the kitchen table, and was galvanised by an adolescence listening to The Jam, The Specials and The Smiths. My late mother was a Catholic Irishwoman and staunch union member. We would speak often throughout my childhood of the importance of unions, in between religiously watching Sale of the Century with Tony Barber. From a young age I learned Labor stood for working people while the Liberals, led by the then-detested Malcolm Fraser, were for the rich. Middle age has long mellowed my rage towards the fiend who deposed Gough, but a lifetime of adult experience convinces me the principal contention remains sound. Childhood in Maddington was carefree, if humble by today's standards. We visited beautiful beaches on school holidays, endured bushwalks and flies in blazing summer heat with our bush-mad dad, rode bikes without helmets and could disappear from our parents' view for hours, totally uncontactable. Looking back through adult eyes I can see how hard my parents worked to provide that oasis for my brother and me: two or sometimes three jobs at a time for dad and cleaning for mum, neither particularly well paid. They juggled bills, scrimped and saved for birthdays and Christmas, and neither ever owned a new car. Mum died 14 years ago, with heart disease and a lifetime of smoking finally catching up with her. Don't smoke, kids! Dad went just over three years ago in a car accident. They would both be proud as punch if they were here and it would have been nice to see them up in that gallery today. I enjoyed high school but largely drifted my way through, earning a reputation for being argumentative with exasperated teachers. I spent a fair bit of time in the office of deputy principal, Ted Parker, for various infractions, and for my year 12 reference he wrote: 'Brian is a determined young man, who will not be used as a doormat.' I took it as praise at the time, but I think it was a warning. At 14 I scored a part-time job at Hungry Jack's, where I stayed for seven years. I loved that job. My eldest daughter, Bronte, now 17, groans whenever I talk about it, complaining it is one of those dad stories I trot out too often. She will groan again that I mention it here, which of course is why I do so! I fell in love twice at university-first with my journalism course and next with Tania. I joined the university Labor club, got elected to the student guild and made lifelong friends. Uni opened my eyes to possibilities I could not have dreamed of in Maddington, and that is the real value of higher education. It reveals the unknown and it tears away the veil of ignorance. It is, I think, critical to social mobility, and must never again become the exclusive  preserve of those with money. I believe to the core of my soul that access to every level of education is a human right, not a commodity to be bartered, and that we should be aiming to wind back the fees that students pay, not squeeze them for even more. After uni I was offered a cadetship with The Fremantle Herald, a start-up independent weekly newspaper. I went on to become editor for more than a decade. I cannot begin to describe the enormous influence that Andrew Smith, the paper's owner, has had on me. I was barely 22 when I started, and he has been part of my life now for 27 years. He confided to me once that he had employed me over the objections of the then-editor, as he believed his fledgling paper needed someone with 'more arse than class' and he figured a working-class kid from Maddo might prove more resilient than a private school prima donna. It is with no disrespect to my late father that I say Andrew is the single most influential male figure in my life. He has been unerringly ethical, deeply principled and exceedingly generous. I consider myself very lucky to have walked into that stiflingly hot weatherboard office for a job interview in the summer of 1989. By late 2006 Tania and I decided to up stumps from Freo and move to Tasmania-we were well over WA's heat-and I landed a position with Labor MP Duncan Kerr, another man I consider myself privileged to have worked for and known. In late 2008 our second daughter, Julia, arrived-our own Tasmanian devil-so I gave up the job to put out my shingle as a media consultant. I did that for eight years and loved it. But when it came time to make a decision to grow the business or run for office, it was no contest. If you ask my old classmates from Maddo High, they will tell you I was always headed for this life, and they will probably express surprise it took this long. None of us gets elected by ourselves, and I have many people to thank. With the indulgence of the House I will continue. First, my campaign manager, Stuart Benson: an indefatigable young man who refuses to even bleed unless it is in official Labor PMS colours. Stuart times his holidays around elections overseas so he can volunteer on them. He is the truest of true believers. My core campaign team-the marvellous Senator Carol Brown, Gordon Luckman, Sue Bailey, Sharon Carnes, Jen Butler and Michael Fitzgerald. Also Robert, Kylie, and an army of door-knocking and phoning volunteers and branch members-Innes, Dee, Morris, Simon, Justine, Ken, Sandra, Geoff and so many more. I cannot name you all, but you are all deeply appreciated. Bill Shorten, who visited Lyons so often he should enrol, and Jenny Macklin for so kindly launching my campaign in Brighton-thank you for your lifetime of dedication to our cause. Tanya Plibersek, Doug Cameron and the rest of the shadow team-I always appreciated the visits, support and advice. National Secretary George Wright-missed already-and the national campaign team, Alex, Paul, Bryce, Ben and the rest, who keep the place running on caffeine and Pokemon. My many friends in the union movement-Tim Jacobson and Robbie Moore, the fantastic team at HACSU and Chris Brown at HSU National-you are simply the best, always standing up for stronger health and community services. I wear my union badge with pride. Jason, Alisha, Sean, Scott and all the men and women at the MUA and CFMEU-I know you fight every day to keep jobs in Tasmania and on Australian ships and people safe at work. It is because you are so effective that you are so targeted. Jannette and Tassie's amazing United  Voice team-Jess, Tom, Libby and Viv at the CPSU, John and team at the AMWU, Aaron at the ASU, Paul at the SDA, Rob and co at the AWU-thank you all. My now colleague in this place, Julie Collins, member for Franklin-you are a star. Senators Anne Urquhart, Catryna Bilyk, Helen Polley and Lisa Singh-thank you. State Labor leader Bryan Green and state MPs Bec White, Craig Farrell, Michelle O'Byrne and Maddy Ogilvie. State secretary Karelle Logan, and the 'Tasmanian treasure', Lauren Saunders. My Labor predecessor, Dick Adams, and partner-in-all-things, Dee Alty-thank you for your invaluable advice and assistance. Former state MP for Lyons, Michael Polley-I bow before the master. My life-long friends from the Make Uni Dynamic student guild team, Roger Fletcher and Danielle Wooltorton, who travelled to Tasmania from WA and Victoria respectively to help me out on election day-MUD wins again, so take that, Waddell! That is an in joke. To my daughters, Bronte and Julia, I apologise in advance for all the things I will undoubtedly miss over the coming years. But please know that while this job is important-I do love it and I am going to give it all I have got-you two are everything to mum and me, and while I may not be home as often, I am always with you both. You two and your mum have all my love, always. Lastly, to my wife and my life, Tania-I do not know how many more times I can say thank you for the journey that you have undertaken with me so far. We have a while to go yet. After 12 or 13 house moves across three states in 28 years together, 21 years of them married, it is fair to say that you are probably owed a shiny rock of some description. I will get onto Gumtree first thing tomorrow. Thank you.",117
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Before I call the honourable member for Macquarie, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech, and I ask the House to extend her the usual courtesies.",123
Ms TEMPLEMAN,COMMITTEES," Thirty years ago I was a young journalist, inexperienced, working for 2UE, perched in the press gallery of the Old Parliament House, in my first full-time job, looking down on the 34th Parliament. If you had said to me then, 'You'll be one of those MPs one day,' I can absolutely guarantee that I would have used very unparliamentary language and rejected the possibility outright. I had seen the pressures, the scrutiny and the challenges of being in parliament, and I could not think why you would want it. Yet here I am-not so young, with much greater life experience-and no-one could be more proud or feel more fortunate than me to be in this privileged position. What I had not seen then, and what you rarely see from that gallery, is the journey a person's life takes that leaves them with no choice other than to run for office. I acknowledge that today I stand on the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people and pay respects to elders past and present. I extend that respect to the Dharug and Gundungurra, the people who have cared for my part of the world, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, for more than 40,000 years. The 4,300 square kilometres of land I represent is geographically spectacular and dangerous: World Heritage mountains of sandstone escarpments and gum trees that can ignite with heat and wind, a sweeping river whose waters at times engulf the surrounding plains.  I represent villages from St Albans, Mount Wilson and Mount Victoria through to the towns of Glenbrook and Richmond, the rural areas of Bilpin and East Kurrajong, the wilderness of Colo Heights and the suburbs of Mount Riverview and Bligh Park. In no other so-called Western Sydney seat does it take three hours to drive from one end of the electorate to the other, with ferries required to cross rivers along the way. Historically, the early European settlers were in awe of both these mountains and this river. By the time Governor Lachlan Macquarie, after whom the seat is named, established the towns of Windsor and Wilberforce, amongst others, this was a thriving colonial settlement. The early goat track across the mountains that is now a much improved Great Western Highway-thanks largely to the efforts of one of my predecessors, Bob Debus-supports the transport of two million visitors a year to see the Three Sisters and experience the uniqueness of the Blue Mountains. The limitations that nature places on growth throughout my electorate of Macquarie mean we have to be clever. In addition to tourism, we have our Richmond campus of Western Sydney University and our TAFEs, and they need to stay strong, accessible and be able to cater to local business and student needs. We have the Glenbrook and Richmond RAAF bases. We have orchards, farms, market gardens and horse breeding. We have manufacturing and an extraordinary community services sector. Across these industries and more we have a thriving culture of small business and self-employment, from sparkies to artists, writers to builders: self-motivated people who hit the road early to get to a job, or jump on a pre-dawn train and watch the sun rise as they snake down the mountains. For that reason I am pleased that small business is in my genes. I grew up in my family's newsagency in Sydney. My country-born parents were ambitious to provide for their children. The bank teller turned accountant and the public school music teacher did what many people still have to do to get capital, given that we are one of the few OECD countries not to have some sort of government supported finance for small business: they sold our home to buy their shop. These were parents who modelled hard work-3.30 am starts seven days a week, with Good Friday and Christmas Day the only two days off a year. There is nothing quite like the experience of being a carsick 12-year-old at 6 am on a Sunday morning in a van, the smell of newsprint surrounding you, freezing cold because one door is off the side of the vehicle so your dad can throw the papers onto front lawns as you read out: 'Tele to 26, Herald to 30, Herald to 32'-sadly, an experience the current generation has been deprived of, thanks to digital media. Well, Mum and Dad, as it turned out, this newsagency life proved the perfect grounding for every stage of my professional life-working on a breakfast radio show, being a journalist, doing doorstops outside parliament, being a foreign correspondent on a different time zone to Australia, being a long-time commuter and a city-fringe politician-with 5.30 am railway starts no big shock to my system. For me, selling papers was not the calling. Journalism was my choice, but only after an amazing year as a 17-year-old Rotary exchange student to Mexico that opened my eyes to the world and to the challenges of inequality and discrimination in a way my seven public schools had not. When I first came to this place I unexpectedly found myself the youngest permanent journalist in the press gallery at the start of the second Hawke term in January 1985.  Whatever nerves I feel in speaking today were eclipsed back then by the fear of asking a stupid question of Paul Keating, Peter Walsh or Gareth Evans in front of reporters like Alan Ramsey and Laurie Oakes. What a lot I learned about policy, politics and politicians. It has been an honour to have had support over the last seven years from three key figures of that era: Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and Neal Blewett-and it is such a privilege to be Neal and his partner Robert's local member. I covered the 1987 election campaign with both party leaders-a long winter campaignand, oh, how I want to ask forgiveness from the marginal seat candidates we visited, who, in my radio reports, I barely mentioned. I know now the efforts you were putting in a long way from Canberra, and that your work did not stop when you disappeared from our sight in between sittings. Only months before this wonderful building was opened my husband and I moved from Canberra to New York and then to London as foreign correspondents. Three years later we were back in Australia. The Blue Mountains became our home. It beckoned because of the big blue skies, the clean air and the lower house prices. Alongside a motivating business partner, Jane Jordan, I started teaching people how to do media interviews. I had crossed to the dark side and become a media trainer. From Sydney to Darwin, working across a wide range of industry sectors, government agencies and not-for-profits, I had a job that was different every day, intellectually challenging and professionally rewarding. And that is where the story could have ended: a contented life raising two children, operating a growing business and enjoying the commuting lifestyle the mountains offers, with the luxury of dissecting federal politics from afar. However, John Howard's regime, while benign to many, stirred me into action. I could not sit by and see Australia becoming a backwards-looking and defensive society. Apparently, we no longer cared about being a republic or about Aboriginal reconciliation. We moved away from inclusion and we distanced ourselves from Asia. That was not the Australia. I wanted for my children. So I joined the Labor Party, with no clear ambition other than to help get rid of John Howard. Not a bad one. Then, a decade ago, our family's foundations were rocked by our daughter's first experience of mental illness. I vividly remember a distressing night, standing in my kitchen with my husband, asking: how do other families do this? And while I did not then and there declare my intention to run for parliament, that was the moment I look back on as transformative, when something in me shifted. It turned out we were not the only ones facing the same challenge. Having mental illness in a family makes you question your parenting and your values, and I have learned more from that experience than any other in my life. I am proud that my daughter, Phoebe, is here today, determined that her history is something not to be ashamed of, but standing tall, knowing she has had the resilience and the strength to battle through some really difficult times. I am equally proud of her brother, Harry, sitting right alongside her, who, like many children in families where illness or disability strikes, has had his empathy and caring genes well and truly developed. So that was how I became someone who did not just sit around solving the problems of the world at a dinner party, but an advocate and an activist. There is rarely a function I attend where people do not raise with me the issue of mental health, whether it is veterans in my  electorate or the relatives of serving Defence personnel, whether it is those caring for the elderly or whether it is mums struggling to know what is best for their anxious and selfharming child. This is something we have not yet got right. People who struggle with mental health, and the friends, families and carers who support them, need better tools and better support structures. It saddens me that we exacerbate the mental suffering of another group of people, people already fleeing from unimaginably fearful circumstances, by abandoning them to indefinite detention. We are responsible and will be held to account for the additional damage that we are doing, and this parliament must find a better way. And I worry about the mental health impacts if this government proceeds down the path of a plebiscite on same-sex marriage, which is an open invitation for harmful things to be said and done. As Amber Jacobus, an ASU member, someone who has volunteered on my campaigns and grew up in my electorate with her two mums, says: 'A plebiscite scares me. I think about the kids like me, who will be made to feel ashamed because they will be told their family is worth less.' The funny thing about standing up on an issue is that once you start it is hard to stop. Injustice is injustice, no matter what form it takes. And to see schools starved of funding made it easy for me as a P&C president to want to promote the wisdom of Gonski, and more recently to stand alongside so many of my local teachers, members of the Teachers Federation and the AEU to make it a key election issue. The result shows very clearly that Macquarie wants Gonski. It makes it easy for me to fight for a full fibre broadband service for parts of my electorate that are currently facing the prospect of a second-rate service which does not meet the needs of the home based creatives and businesses that thrive in our region and may be forced to go elsewhere. It makes it easy for me to fight to protect the World Heritage areas of the Blue Mountains and the people who choose to live there from the consequences of climate change and from the impacts of a second Sydney airport, which is planned to operate above our skies 24 hours a day-and night. And it makes it easy for me to want to fight to improve the travel times for Hawkesbury residents, by advocating for a third crossing of the river-and in doing so, to preserve the oldest surviving public square in the country, in Windsor. It is older than Port Arthur and still occupied. The buildings that make up the Georgian Thompson Square is where the Australian concept of a 'fair go' was enshrined in the naming of this square not after a king or a lord but after a reformed convict. It is so easy for me to fight for secure employment and workers' rights, for dignity for people who are aged or unemployed, for the ABC and the arts, for renewable energy, for quality early childhood education, for the full rollout of the NDIS, for women's reproduction rights and for same-sex marriage. These are fights worth having. And, as I have demonstrated, time and time again-like my Windsor Wolves footy team-I am not one to give up. My community in the Blue Mountains had a fight on its hands in October 2013. That year was not one of my favourites. I turned 50, I lost an election and my house burnt down. Nearly 200 homes were destroyed by two fires on the same day, in Mount Victoria and in Winmalee, the worse natural disasters in Blue Mountains history. As a community, though, we considered  ourselves lucky. No lives were lost. But our suburban streets were like something out of a war zone. Personally, we were lucky. As a 19-year-old, Harry was home and was able to save not just the cat, his favourite bass guitar and a couple of laptops but also precious photo albums before the home we built and lived in for 22 years went up in smoke. Others were not able to recover anything. What stunned us as a community was a government changing the rules, while fires still raged, to reduce the number of people eligible for emergency payments. What also stunned us, within 48 hours of the fire, was the realisation that most people were seriously, unintentionally underinsured and that they would not be able to rebuild the home that they had. Three years on, blocks of land still lie vacant because the gap between the insurance payout and the new rebuild cost is too wide. The codes brought in after the 2003 Canberra fires means that construction in bushfire-prone areas can be $50,000 to $200,000 higher. Insurers know that. Most of us realised it after our homes had burned down. If we do not address this situation, every town or suburb hit by bushfire will have exactly the same experience as the Blue Mountains, as we are seeing now on the Great Ocean Road. People are then forced to make the heart breaking decision not to rebuild, and the painfully slow road to recovery for a community after a bushfire will be much slower and much more painful. But, as locals put it, 'You can't scare me, I'm from Winmalee.' We are not easily dismissed, and I am pleased that this year the member for Isaacs, in his role as shadow Attorney-General, recognised that the insurance industry and government could work more closely in ensuring home owners are better informed about the actual rebuild costs they face. Insurers may try to place the responsibility at local government's feet, but they take the premiums, they send the assessors out and they are the ones who need to be part of the solution. As the member for Macquarie, I walk in the footsteps of many great Labor MPs. I am the 15th person to be the member for Macquarie. Two of my predecessors were Bob Debus and the late Maggie Deahm, and I drew inspiration from them both. Maggie Deahm was the first female member for Macquarie from 1993-96 and Bob Debus was our long-standing state MP and minister for everything, before becoming the federal member for Macquarie and a minister in 2007. He was so effective at securing funding for his electorates, and without him we would not have World Heritage listing for our remarkable Greater Blue Mountains. But Macquarie was also Ben Chifley's seat, and that feels like really big shoes to fill. I take pleasure in knowing that, like me, it took Ben Chifley several goes before he became a member of parliament; that, like me, he played the violin; and that, like me, he enjoyed a good crime novel and a cup of tea. Many of the battles I will be fighting here are variations of the issues Chifley faced. He established the organisation that has become Australian Hearing, which we know should be kept in public hands. He funded theatre, because he saw the arts as essential in a healthy society. He ensured people had access to medicines and public hospitals so that no charge was made to the patient-an early version of what we would now call Medicare. The social security system was established so that there was a level below which, according to Chifley: â¦ no one should be permitted to fall and without waiting for anyone first to fall a victim to destitution and grievous distress.  What does it say about us that the other side has already introduced legislation in this term of parliament that will take us back to a pre-Chifley mentality? Chifley's Snowy Mountains Scheme was a visionary infrastructure project, of which our NBN plan is a descendent. The banking sector was a key priority, and Chifley increased funding for the CSIRO, medical research and university research. His words are even more true today than when he spoke them in 1949: We live in a scientific age, and money spent on research is a necessity for the maintenance of our standard of living and even for our survival. It is a lovely symmetry that the night I decided to run for preselection for Macquarie was at the Light on the Hill dinner at Bathurst, honouring Chifley, surrounded by comrades from Calare, Macquarie and beyond. Perhaps the member for Lilley, who was the guest speaker at the 2009 dinner, had a role in it, as he discussed Chifley's 'light on the hill' phrase as embodying: The hope that a better society is possible, and the duty we all have to create it. I want to thank Mark Andrews for the conversation that started the ball rolling and for the seven years of quiet, unfailing support since then. And Luke Foley, who a few days later, did not laugh at the idea. And every one of my Macquarie branch members who preselected menot just once, but three times. Senator Doug Cameron, now my constituent, deserves particular mention, because, along with his staff, he has in many ways been a de facto member for Macquarie for years, and I would not be here without him and his team. Doug's support was crucial in ensuring the smooth delivery of every one of our 2010 election promises-from the construction of the Springwood Hub and Glenbrook National Park upgrades to the new Wolves grandstand and road improvements for North Richmond. Member for Blue Mountains, Trish Doyle; Hawkesbury councillor, Barry Calvert; and Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, and his Labor councillors-the part you have played over many years in fighting the Tories in our part of the world at different levels of government has made my task easier. Thank you. As has the ongoing support of the Macquarie FEC and my loyal comrades vice president Susan Elfert and secretary Peter Letts. To my campaign teams and volunteers from 2010 and 2013: I would love to name you all, but if you got fed by Ron and have a purple Susan T-shirt you know you were there from the beginning. Equally, if you have a T-shirt that says 'I'm supporting Harry's Mum', that one is a limited-edition! Those in the public galleries who have travelled to be here today and those who could not be here know that while I have loved every minute of it, my journey to this place has not been done lightly or easily. We had a grassroots campaign, with hundreds of locals, and, whether you wobbled or stood in the rain, the wind and the snow, or broke a limb-as two of my volunteers did-or sat on phones for hours on end, I thank you for being part of it. If you stuck with me through not just one campaign but two or more-like Suzie and Moz; Brian; the Kims; Helen and Mike; Maree and Ian; Denise; Pete; Margaret and Bryan; Tori; Chris and Jan; and my new staff, Madeleine and Jack-I am humbled by your support. To my 2016 team: Mitch Wilson; Sebastian Henderson and the CPSU crew; Tom HB; Hawkesbury campaign coordinator extraordinaire, Leonie Wilbow; Rose Jackson; Kaila  Murnain and John Graham in party office; my EMILY's List mentor, Helen Westwood; and members of the ASU, the AMWU, United Voice, the MUA, the RTBU, the FSU and the CFMEU, and of Sally MCManus' ACTU 'secret army', helped by the HSU, Nurses and Midwives, Blue Mountains Union Council and Penrith Valley Community Unions-thank you. When you live in an area that has big hills and long walks between driveways, you particularly appreciate the young women and men in Young Labor. Each generation has been amazing, and I hope a beer at the Macquarie Arms helped. Thank you. To my good friends Anna Grutzner, Alison Reedy, Jenny Nethercote, Mark Carnegie, Phil Davey, Greg Holland, Peter Primrose and Kris Neil, I am grateful that you never gave up hope. And to all the other friends where I have missed gatherings and you have not made me feel guilty-or you have at least forgiven me-thanks; that made it a bit easier. And, of course, Ron, who would rather I did not mention him at all, but without him I would not be standing here fed and ironed. To my wonderfully creative children, Phoebe and Harry, who did not know what they were in for. But, like my parents, Jan and Bob-who do not seem to mind if I am just popping into their place for a quick change of clothes or to use the loo-they all accept how important this is to me. I want to thank my brother David, who is here today, and sister-in-law Sarah, and their children, Stella and Henry, who hopefully will be my constituents within a few months. And a shout out to my other brother, Rob, who seems to think the fact of living in Spain excuses him from handing out on election day! Virtually every member of the Labor front-bench, both in government and in opposition, has been out to my electorate-more than once-and I am pleased that I can now invite Bill, Tanya and the team to my part of the world as a member, not just a perennial candidate. It has taken 20 years for Labor to be once again entrusted with the responsibility of representing Macquarie with the current boundaries. That in itself is a humbling achievement, and I take the responsibility seriously. When I am asked, in years to come, what I consider my greatest achievement as an MP to be, I promise there will be no hesitation. I cannot predict now what that achievement might be, but what I do know and what my electorate knows, and what this chamber will soon see, is that I will be tirelessly, resolutely, doggedly here to deliver for the people of Macquarie.",123
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Before I call the honourable member for Wide Bay, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him. Mr LLEW O'BRIEN (Wide Bay) (17:10): I am very honoured to address the people's house today as Wide Bay's choice to represent them. I thank the electors of Wide Bay and recognise the trust they have placed in me. I understand my responsibility to repay that trust with hard work, honesty and fearless advocacy on their behalf. Wide Bay is a stunning part of the world. The beauty and diversity of its geography is only matched by that of its people and culture. Its pristine beaches stretch from Peregian on the Sunshine Coast, some 200 kilometres to Sandy Cape at the northern tip of Fraser Island, the largest sand island on earth. This magnificent stretch of coast is home to a vibrant and growing tourist industry that boasts destinations such as Sunshine Beach, Noosa, Tin Can Bay, Rainbow Beach, Kingfisher Bay and many more. Wide Bay's communities of Gympie, Maryborough, the South Burnett, the Mary Valley, and the Fraser and Cooloola coasts offer  the best of regional living and are amazingly affordable. Wide Bay is a great place to raise a family, which is what my wife, Sharon, and I have done for the past 20 years. The region proudly celebrates its people and attributes each year with events and festivals such as the Gympie Music Muster, the Gold Rush Festival, the Goomeri Pumpkin Festival, the Kilkivan Great Horse Ride, the Noosa Food and Wine Festival, Maryborough's World's Greatest Pub Fest, the Reconciliation Fun Run from Murgon to Cherbourg-and the list goes on. Our early settlers knew the communities of Wide Bay for its port and goldmining towns. Later these communities were transformed into agricultural centres producing grain, beef, sugar, dairy and other crops. Wide Bay also has a proud history of sustainably drawing on its natural assets, with its timber and seafood industries being strong contributors to the economy. Whilst the Wide Bay is already a great place to live, it has the potential to be so much more. Being located close to the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane makes it perfectly positioned to take advantage of the growing south-east corner. But we need all levels of government to work cooperatively to leverage the opportunities of the future. I stood for election not because our world or our country is perfect. I came here to work, to advance the interests of my electorate, to make Wide Bay a better place. An issue that burdens Wide Bay is unemployment. Much of the Wide Bay division has historically seen high levels of unemployment, and unfortunately this is still the case. It is incumbent upon all levels of government to see this as unacceptable and to act on it. The coalition government has a comprehensive range of employment initiatives to help people into work. In addition to those, I announced with Minister Fiona Nash that the coalition government will deliver a $20 million jobs package that will be available exclusively to the Wide Bay Burnett region, enabling local businesses to expand to create local jobs, grow skills in the local workforce, pursue export opportunities and strengthen the economy. The Wide Bay Burnett Jobs Package will attract matching funding from participating businesses to deliver $40 million in new investment in the region. This specific, targeted and tailored investment pool will assist existing local businesses to grow and create new, sustainable jobs. Grants from the package will enable businesses to diversify their operations, support infrastructure projects, and invest in skills development and training programs. Local communities will be involved in developing local investment plans, assessing our region's economic opportunities and competitive advantages to create a community-driven investment partnership between the coalition government, business and local communities. While the jobs package is a good example of how government can assist business, we also need to ensure that government gets out of the way. The growth and sustainability of the rural areas of Wide Bay are very much tied to the success of its agricultural industry. This sector must not be burdened by extreme, ideologically driven, environmental policies that serve to do nothing more than hurt future generations. An example of this was the recently defeated extreme vegetation management bill brought forward by the Queensland state Labor government. Agriculture is a $1.1 billion industry in Wide Bay. The most sustainably managed enterprises I know are the agricultural small  businesses in my area. Many of them have been operating successfully for generations. The high-quality produce of our nation's agricultural sector is a key driver of our economy that will help to sustain the fortunes of Australia through uncertain times ahead. We need to help our agricultural enterprises, not hinder them. When it comes to agriculture big business needs to play fair. The Coles and Woolies milk price war has had a devastating effect on farmers who deserve to receive a fair price for their product. As the ninth member for Wide Bay since Federation, I follow some very prominent figures. Indeed, the first member for Wide Bay, Andrew Fisher, served as Prime Minister on three separate occasions. But there is no doubt for me that the most influential figure in my political life was my immediate predecessor in Wide Bay, my political mentor and friend Warren Truss. I acknowledge him and his wife, Lyn, in the gallery as I make this speech. Warren is a man who has given a great deal of service to our country. From humble beginnings Warren, in his uniquely Australian way, quietly but surely worked hard, delivered for his regional community and subsequently rose to become the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and one of the great National Party leaders. I thank Warren and Lyn for their encouragement and support of both Sharon and me over the years. In his maiden speech in 1990 Warren spoke of the need for greater funding for road construction. Even though during his 26 years in this place there proved to be no more enthusiastic or successful road builder than Warren, in 2016 roads remain a priority for me as the member for Wide Bay. Since 1990 Queensland's population has grown with Wide Bay growing faster than the national average. But more significantly, since 1990 the number of vehicles registered in Queensland has more than doubled to about 4.5 million. Whilst rail, air and sea are important forms of transport, the future economic growth of our country relies on a safer national highway with greater capacity. Where in 1990 Warren's statements were made due to a lack of road funding from the former Labor government, in 2016 I am proud to say that my call is for the great momentum created by the coalition government to be continued. My priority is to see Wide Bay continue to get its share of the $8.5 billion allocated by the coalition government to the Bruce Highway over the next 10 years. This includes securing funding for the 26-kilometre section D of the Cooroy to Curra Bruce Highway upgrade, as well as further upgrades north and south. I will also work with my classmates of 2016-friends and colleagues the member for Fairfax, Ted O'Brien, and the member for Fisher, Andrew Wallace-to ensure that the Bruce Highway south to Brisbane is upgraded, so that all our communities can enjoy the benefits of a faster, safer highway. I believe that this generation of members in this place will be judged on how well we manage the Australian economy in the face of massive amounts of debt, shrinking revenues and increasing expenses, all while operating in a very uncertain international economic environment. We have the challenge of repairing our budget so we don't leave to our kids an Australia that is burdened by debt, while properly funding aged care to address the needs of our ageing population. Over the coming decades, as the baby boomer generation requires care, we will enter uncharted territory in the aged-care sector. Already the greater emphasis on home care is  seeing those people requiring much higher levels of acute care when they come to enter residential care. In Wide Bay, which has an ageing demographic, the way we fund aged care now and into the future is a very real concern to me and my electorate. My values and beliefs fit clearly within the very broad church of the Liberal-National Party of Queensland. I believe that all families are precious and represent the cornerstone of society. I have a strong belief in personal responsibility, that initiative and hard work should be rewarded and that laws and regulations should only exist where there is a real need. I am proud to be Australian and I love the Australia that I grew up in. Our country is strengthened by its freedoms of religion, speech and association, and a degree of multiculturalism. In saying this, we also need to acknowledge that there is a significant proportion of Australians who have real concerns about the protection of our borders and the threat of terrorism. I share these concerns and want to make sure that our nation is safe and secure for all Australians. I wonder if any member has a typical journey leading to this House. I doubt it. My journey to this place has not been a high profile one, it has been one of a regular man whose family is the most important thing in his life and who also loves his community. My high school education ended shortly after completing year 9. At that time my mother was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of motor neurone disease. Mum was given a year to live. She wanted to stay at home as long as she could, so at 15 I left school and took on a role as a full-time carer. My mum, Yvonne, was a softly spoken gentle lady who loved life. She loved community. She saw the good things in life and she took time to make sure that I saw them too. Over the course of mum's final year she taught me many lessons. She taught me about courage, selflessness and honesty. Whilst the illness relentlessly broke down every physical power she had, it could not dent her love of life and people and her desire for me to understand it. While she was dying, my mum taught me the most valuable lessons on how to live and treat people. Those are the lessons that I bring to this place. I was 16 when Mum passed away at home, and life was not easy. When I was 17, I met the love of my life, Sharon, and things took a dramatic turn for the better as we went about planning our future together. For me, my late teens and early 20s were about putting a feed on the table while the country went through Labor's recession we had to have. I did everything I could to find a job. I worked on farms, in factories and anywhere else I could earn a wage. I understand what it feels like to be desperate for the most basic job and unable to find one. I also understand the power of employment, and the dignity that comes along with it. After Sharon and I were married we set about starting a family. Sharon supported me while I gained the qualifications that would enable me to take on a stable career that would support our family. Like my mum I have always been a community-minded person, and helping people is something I enjoy. With this in mind, Sharon and I decided that I would join the Queensland Police Service, which is what I did. Policing turned out to be a good fit for me. I did help many people, and I was able to be a positive role model for my own kids, which is something very important to me. Policing also gave me the opportunity to see and experience many things that shaped my view of the world and motivated me to serve in a different capacity. As a bloke whose life has  been enriched and guided by the powerful women in it, responding to incidents of violence, particularly incidents of violence against women and their children, made my blood boil. We as a society must do more to prevent all domestic and family violence. Seeing the effects of drug addiction and homelessness also made me contemplate how we can do things better. Early in my career, I became qualified as a traffic accident investigator and I found myself responding to some of the most serious accidents on the Bruce Highway between Cooroy and Curra, which at the time was known as one of the most deadly stretches of the Bruce Highway. The nature of country policing and the role I had sometimes meant that I was the first emergency service person at the scene and then the last to leave. It was a job where you'd be hit by the confronting sights, sounds and smells of absolute tragedy and trauma. As time sped by, you would furiously do what you could as a first responder: the injured would be taken care of and helicoptered out, the dead taken away, the wreckage removed and the debris swept off the road. Then I would be there with a tape measure and a clipboard, watching the traffic flow past at 100. Those drivers, going on with their lives, had no idea about what had just occurred. Yet I did, and I knew it would happen again and again and again. It is those experiences that made me contemplate how I could serve in a different way, to make the community safer. Much of that deadly stretch of the Bruce Highway has now been rerouted or will soon be bypassed, and it is in no small part due to the funding secured by Warren Truss after the 2013 federal election. That I played a supporting role by managing Warren's campaign in 2013 was very meaningful to me. In Wide Bay, both Warren and I know that so many lives will be saved by these upgrades. The 2015-16 Health needs assessment summary: Central Queensland, Wide Bay, Sunshine Coast PHN identified that rates of mental illness in the Primary Health Network area were higher than those observed elsewhere in Queensland and Australia. Across the three measures, psychological distress was highest on the Fraser Coast, and suicide rates were highest in my home area of Gympie. The leading cause of death of Australians between the age of 15 and 44 is suicide. Approximately 2,500 people die by suicide each year-double our national road toll. Whilst we are doing such great work reducing our road toll, our national suicide rate is not going the same way, and it is hitting rural and regional areas worse than anywhere else. Each year good Australians are choosing to take their own lives. These people are mums and dads, sons and daughters. This is a problem for all of us, not just the families of those who have taken their own life or those who are at risk of taking their own life. Again, we need to do better. For many years now, both as a police officer and in my personal life, I have done my best to help people experiencing mental illness. I would not be the man I like to think I am if I did not take this opportunity to speak about a cause I believe is very important. It is addressing the stigma associated with mental illness, particularly depression and anxiety. Mental illness does not discriminate. It can take effect at any time. And it affects millions of Australians every day. This stigma stops people from taking the vital steps needed to get treatment and commence their recovery. The fear of being labelled weak or facing discrimination stops people from addressing this serious problem. Over a decade ago, in my policing career and as a traffic accident investigator, I went through a very intense phase which saw me struck down by depression and anxiety. This soon led to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. I was absolutely floored. But my story of  recovery is a successful one. With a supportive employer in the Queensland Police Service, and my amazing wife, it took more than a year to get me back to the job I loved, which at times I thought I would never return to. I will more than likely need to manage my PTSD for the rest of my life. But with an understanding of my condition, and my great support network, including my good friend and Queensland Police Service human services officer Dale Donoghue, who has helped so many police, I stand here happier, more resilient and more capable than I have ever been in my life. We can all benefit greatly by ending the stigma associated with mental illness so people feel comfortable about talking about their symptoms, getting the early help they need and commencing their recovery so they can live a fulfilling and happy life. I tell my story to reduce the stigma and hopefully make it easier for others in Wide Bay and the broader community. There are many people I need to acknowledge who share my values and who have helped me in life and on my journey to this place. I am deeply committed to the values of our LNP Party. I joined the National Party and I was a member when the Liberal and National Parties in Queensland united to form the Liberal National Party. I was honoured to serve in a number of roles in Wide Bay before being elected as the party's vice president. I particularly valued the opportunity to work with my friend and LNP President Gary Spence, who with his wife Sabrina has given so much to the party. I especially acknowledge the support of my parliamentary colleagues Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash, Tony Abbott, Darren Chester, Michael MCCormack, Keith Pitt, Senators Nigel Scullion, Barry O'Sullivan, James MCGRATH, Ian Macdonald and Matt Canavan, who helped through the campaign. I also thank former president Bruce MCIver-who is in the gallery today-Bernard Ponting, Michael and Kythe O'Dwyer, and Greg and Joyce Newton, who have each encouraged me and provided sound advice to me along my political journey. I give very special thanks to my campaign team, led by Ben Ellingsen, my FDC Chairman and good mate. Ben did a wonderful job rallying the troops over the long campaign. To Wayne Plant, Dr Richard Pearson-who is also here in the gallery-Lloyd and Anne Maddern, Mel and Linda Harris, Guy Burnett, Ted Barnes, Ray Zerner, and David and Robyn Kemp: thank you for all your work. And thank you to all the helpers and workers who contributed so much throughout the very long campaign. I pay tribute to a bloke I call my adopted dad, Retired Assistant Commissioner Laurie Pointing. He has been a great source of wise advice during my policing career, and I am proud to count him as one of my closest friends and confidants. To an amazing little family from Cave Street, Kilkivan, Amy, Riley and Jacinta Olsen-we have all been through much over the past year and we know we can count on each other. To my great mate, Simon Kelly, now chief of staff, and to his partner, Kieren: thank you for your friendship, loyalty and very honest advice over the past 10 years. I also thank my electorate staff, Rae Hurley, Barbara Morris, and Rebecca Kuhn for their support and service to our electorate. I would not be where I am today without the support of my mother in law, Lyn, known as Granny-I so wanted to have that put in Hansard! Lyn has always: been there for Sharon and me through our journey, looked after the kids, and helped us tremendously. Finally, to the people I treasure most in this world, my wife, Sharon, and my children Rees, William and Yve: I would not be here without your love and support. I know that you now  have to share me with 103,328 electors in Wide Bay, but it is through the strength of our family that I am able to give my best to my electorate as the federal Member for Wide Bay.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Before I call the member for Macarthur, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask that the House extend to him the usual courtesies.",136
Dr FREELANDER,BILLS," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I congratulate you on your appointment. I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples and I thank them and acknowledge their elders past and present. I would also like to acknowledge the Dharawal people of my own electorate and the Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation and thank them for their support and such positive encouragement throughout the election campaign. I would also like to acknowledge our Aboriginal colleagues: Senator Pat Dodson, Senator Jacqui Lambie, Senator Malarndirri MCCarthy, the Hon. Ken Wyatt and the Hon. Linda Burney. It is a truly historic time that we welcome so many Indigenous members of parliament and we can all tackle the large discrepancies in Indigenous health, incarceration rates, child removal and workforce participation which have been a national shame for far too long. When it was suggested I stand for preselection for Macarthur for the Labor Party, I was very greatly honoured. Subsequently, to win the election by such a significant margin was very, very humbling, but I do feel a great weight of expectation upon my shoulders and I will do my best to fulfil those expectations. I would like to thank the previous member for Macarthur, Russell Matheson. Even though we are on opposite sides, he is a decent man and I wish him well. I thank him for his good wishes after the election. It is with great pride that I hold the seat previously held by the Hon. John Kerin during the time of the Whitlam Labor government-a time of my political awakening-and who later was the member for Werriwa and a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. I would also like to acknowledge the previous Labor members for Macarthur: Colin Hollis, Stephen Martin and Chris Haviland. They served the area well, but it has been 20 years since Macarthur has had a Labor member. The seat of Macarthur is one of the most rapidly growing areas in Australia. It was originally a farming area, the original Cowpastures. It is now named after John and Elizabeth Macarthur, the founders of the Australian merino wool industry. I am pleased to report their descendants still live in the area. Macarthur has rapidly become urbanised and its population  of 150,000 is increasing every day. Macarthur embraces many suburbs, including old areas of Campbelltown, Ingleburn and Minto and the newer areas of Harrington Park, Oran Park, Gregory Hills and Currans Hill. There is great diversity in Macarthur. There are large areas of public housing, but also significant areas with house prices well over $1 million. A baby having begun crying in the gallery",136
Dr FREELANDER,BILLS,"I like that sound. Whilst the demographics are changing, the area is predominantly one of young families looking to the future with optimism. It has been my great privilege to care for the children of Macarthur for over 30 years as a paediatrician. The story of Macarthur is the story of its people and the enormous resource they are. Macarthur, as I have mentioned, has many areas of disadvantage, but also areas of great affluence. It has many people prominent in the arts, music and academia. It has prominent business people as well as many high-profile sportspeople. It has a strong, well-educated workforce with a significant manufacturing base even now. I intend to make sure that in Macarthur we foster local jobs so that people can work locally. I have promised to try and improve our local infrastructure to make the quality of life better for our residents. This means making sure that all three levels of government and business work together to provide improvements in public transport, schools, roads, hospitals, industry and social policy so that everyone can feel included. I know that with cooperation at all levels we can make a big difference to how people feel about and look to the future. We can make substantial differences to people's lives. We are all in this together, and inclusion is the only approach that works. Everyone should be supported. As best as we can manage, I feel it is about taking luck out of the equation. But having said that, I am a very lucky man. I have had a very privileged life. I am the eldest of four children. My father, Selwyn, was a dentist and president of the West Harbour rugby union club for many years. An opposition member: Good man.",137
Dr FREELANDER,BILLS,"He was a very good man. My mother, Ruth, was a preschool teacher. My extended family is mostly professional and one of the oldest Jewish families in Australia. My siblings-Greg, Andrew and Lynn-have been very supportive, and I thank them for their support and encouragement. I am proud that my great-great-grandfather Abraham Rheuben came here as a convict at age 16 and helped build the first permanent synagogue in Australia, which still stands today in Hobart. He became an alderman and successful businessman. It was said of him that he always reached out into the darkness to help those less fortunate than himself. He believed in paying his employees a wage sufficient for them to support their families. He also supported his employees when they became unwell and he supported the families whose main breadwinner had died. My great-grandmother Jenny Scott Griffiths was a mother of 10, a prominent Labor Party leader at the turn of the century, a prominent feminist, pacifist and also the editor of the Australian Women's Weekly during the First World War. However, she was sacked from her role as editor for her anti-conscription views. She was quoted as saying, 'The world would be a better place if men stayed in the kitchen doing the cooking and cleaning and women ran the businesses.' I think it is probably still true today.  My paternal grandfather came to Australia as a cabin boy on a ship at age 13. He jumped ship in Sydney, hid from the authorities and later educated himself. He became a very successful man and he became mayor of Katoomba, the city of the Blue Mountains. Like the first settlers, yet another boat person who has done well. His wife, my grandmother Ruby Greenburg, died at the birth of my father, Selwyn, and my father, who I loved dearly, was forever regretful that he neither met nor knew his mother. My outlook on life has been shaped by my history and, I think, also by a great deal of luck. While I have lived a fortunate life, many others have not. I trained as a paediatrician at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children at Camperdown in Sydney. I am the first paediatrician to serve in this place. I have had wonderful mentors. Early in my career Dr John Davis, always known as Tubby Davis, encouraged me to be a paediatrician and supported my training. Dr Arnold Tink mentored me at the children's hospital and supported me in some very stressful times during my fellowship. Sadly, both men are no longer with us, but they were both wonderful role models for me, and I owe much of my achievements to their guidance. In my paediatric career in Macarthur, I could not have had better colleagues than Professor John Whitehall, Professor Matt Edwards, Dr Rick Dunstan, Dr Geoff Bent, Dr Caroline Cottier, Dr Katherine Allgood, Dr Sethi Ung, Dr Raymond Chin, Dr Kim Leung, Dr Bijenda Gautam and Sister Amanda Ramsay. Especially, I would like to thank my very good friends Dr Andrew MCDonald-a previous shadow minister for health in the New South Wales government-and Dr Jenny MCDonald for their constant support and very wise counsel over many years. I have always been encouraged by my patients and their families. I have seen children with many different developmental problems and illnesses. I have seen them through their serious illness and seen some who have died-and I remember every one of them. I have witnessed the illnesses and heart breaking sorrow that they have faced with bravery, candour and strength, and I marvel at the ability of children and their parents and extended families to deal with situations that would test us all. I know the joy that can come from what, to us, are little victories-the autistic boy who at the age of 12 says 'I love you, Mum' for the first time; the intellectually handicapped girl who is finally toilet trained at the age of 10 after many years of trying; the four-year-old Bangladeshi boy with cerebral palsy who is able to swallow solids for the first time. Seeing those victories means so much to me. I am part of their journey and it has been, and continues to be, a great privilege. I have cherished every child I have seen. It was a great pleasure during the election campaign to knock on doors and see some of the people I had seen as children now grown up with families of their own. Increasingly, it has become apparent to me that there are large inequalities in health care, though not necessarily at first sight related to health issues. Sir Michael Marmot, in Australia to deliver the Boyer lectures, talks about the social determinants of health and demonstrates that health inequalities arise from inequalities in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. They are related to inequities in power, money and resources. It was Martin Luther King who said that the most severe type of discrimination is discrimination in health care. These issues have become increasingly apparent to me over the 36 years I have spent caring for children and families. These I call 'access issues'-access to health care, access to work, access to housing and access to education.  I am old enough to have seen the tremendous burden healthcare costs caused families before the implementation of a universal health care system. Medibank-as it was first called-only became a reality in Australia after a double dissolution election was forced on the Whitlam government and the subsequent parliamentary joint sitting. Even then, the Fraser Liberal government sought to emasculate the core principle of universality, only for it to be restored by the Hawke Labor government in 1984. Medicare was the Australian Labor Party's great gift to the Australian people and it is a gift that we intend to see keeps on giving. It has been under siege many times in the last 40 years by reactionary forces and vested interests both inside and outside the medical profession. Labor-only Labor-has constantly fought to protect it, especially bulk-billing. We do need to adapt and refine Medicare as our world changes, but we must maintain a universal healthcare system and make sure that all Australians have access to the best health care. There have been remarkable advances in health care in the last few years, and I have been lucky enough to witness them. We will continue to advance such things as whole genome sequencing, looking at the genetic basis of disease, and pharmacogenetics, looking at individual pharmacological treatments. Robotic surgery and endoscopic surgery have caused dramatic improvements in care, and we must make sure that we maintain equality of access to these evolving technologies. I have always tried to do my best to support the children and the families I have seenemotionally and socially, as well as medically. I have tried to get them through what are sometimes traumatic and stressful periods. I have always made myself available to them. However, for some time. I have been concerned about these access difficulties, particularly for my patients with disabilities. Recently, I saw a family of five children who I have known for many years. Both parents were working. One of the younger children was born with multiple congenital abnormalities and is quite disabled. We had just managed to get some school support-including modification of the school itself-in place for this little girl at her local school when the family came to see me on an urgent basis. Unfortunately, the house they were renting was being sold and they had to move. They did not feel they would be able to afford to rent in the local area and they felt they would never be able to afford to buy a house of their own. They would have to move to another area and we would have to start all over again the whole process of organising school support, as well as medical supports. This was going to make life very difficult for the family. This was related to non-medical difficulties such as housing affordability and having access to stable housing, which makes ongoing care very difficult. A permanent place of residence is very important, particularly if your child has a disability requiring physical, educational and health supports. I have also seen an increasing number of children recently whose families feel they have been excluded from specialist care such as ear, nose and throat surgery, ophthalmic surgery, paediatric surgery and mental health support. Some families are placed in a position where the gap cost is so much they cannot afford to access specialist care, as very few specialists bulk bill. This is not the Australia that I want. The WHO tells us that our healthcare costs are not unaffordable. We spend about 9Â½ or 10 per cent of our GDP on health care. In some developed countries, such as the United States, it is up to 17 per cent of GDP-for worse care.  According to the latest census data-the latest accurate census data, I should say!-there are significant and increasing wealth discrepancies in Australia. For example, the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australian households control 60 per cent of total household net worth; the bottom 20 per cent control only one per cent of household net worth. The proportion of Australian households owning their own homes-as we know-is steadily decreasing. I believe it is only the Labor Party, with its policies of social justice, including equality in health care, equality in education and social policy, that can provide a framework of equity and equality for all Australian families, and that is what I care about. That is why I am here today. Labor's economic policies, such as the reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax, as well as changes to the superannuation system, are necessary if we are to have a fairer country and restore the capacity of the Commonwealth to provide new programs and initiatives. My overwhelming belief is that we are all in this together, and we should judge a society by how it treats its most disadvantaged and most powerless. Supporting these people is something that is the responsibility of us all. For example, a proper rollout of the NDIS will make an enormous difference to these children and to these families that I see. I am determined to see the NDIS rolled out as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. It is extremely gratifying, I must say, to know that the NDIS has bipartisan support, but the rollout has been slow and some severely handicapped people are struggling to access care. Very briefly, there are some issues that we also need to address that are long overdue. I am a 63-year-old conservative, middle-class doctor; society has changed a lot in my time. I was born and I grew up in a different era. However, there are some issues that we must act on now. My position on Australia's refugee policy is well known. We must also act on marriage equality. This, to me, is a human rights issue, and as elected representatives we must vote for marriage equality. The plebiscite is a divisive, non-binding and expensive sideshow. I have been happily married for 36 years, and I would not deny that right to anyone. I also want the children of the same-sex couples that I see to have the same uncontestable rights as my children and my grandchildren. We also must have constitutional recognition of our Indigenous people: it is long overdue and will partially redress some of the wrongs of the past. Many people in our nation remain ignorant of the entrenched disparities and mistreatment of Indigenous Australians. I can recall very well, as a teenager, thinking it both wrong and simply downright odd that Aboriginal people had only just been given full voting rights and that, as late as 1967, the federal parliament was still prohibited from making laws to advance their welfare and protect their interests. Fifty years from now, my own grandchildren may well look back and wonder how it could possibly be that, for close to 120 years, the Australian Constitution-our national compact-did not fully recognise our country's first inhabitants. History is a tough judge, particularly of those who oppose change for no good reason or-worse still-out of ignorance, fear or prejudice. We must not ignore this part of our past and present any longer. We must act for the future and recognise the original owners of this country. I also believe, in order to move forward, we must become a republic. I have come some distance over time, and I have many people to thank. My parents are no longer with us, but I loved them dearly and I think they would be proud of me-although I think my father would have probably been prouder if I had played for the Wallabies. I thank  my state colleagues, Greg Warren, the member for Campbelltown; Anoulack Chanthivong, the member for Macquarie Fields; and my federal colleagues, Chris Hayes and the now retired Laurie Ferguson, who have tirelessly encouraged, supported and pushed me all the way. I thank Kaila Murnain, General Secretary of the NSW ALP, for the support and encouragement she has given me. I also thank, and I acknowledge the support of, the affiliated unions of Unions NSW, especially Gerard Hayes from the HSU, and the TWU. I would like to thank the Campbelltown councillors who supported me, in particular Meg Oates and Rudi Kolkman, who supported me so diligently. I also thank my branch members from the Camden, Campbelltown and Ingleburn branches, and Pauline and Ray James from the veterans community. I am grateful, too, to my campaign crew, who have stuck with me: Jennifer Light, Jess Malnersic, Jason Cranson, Raymond Pham, Amy Mulcahy, Mitch Wright, Kathryn Millar, Karen Hunt, Emily Baldwin, George Brticevic, Darcy Lound and my cousin Scott Whitmont-who is here today-and all the wonderful Young Labor supporters. They all gave me great support and put up with me over a long campaign. I certainly could not have done it without them. Thanks also to my secretary, Cheryl Roberts, who has provided continual support in my practice for over 30 years and puts up with my eccentricities. I want to also acknowledge-and this is really important-my newly elected NSW colleagues: Emma Husar, Emma MCBride, Susan Templeman, Anne Stanley, Linda Burney and Meryl Swanson. They have been a wonderful support for me as well, as the only newly elected male Labor member from NSW. They certainly prove that two X chromosomes are better than one! I particularly thank Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek, and the Labor Party front bench, Chris Bowen, Ed Husic, Tony Burke, Stephen Jones, Jason Clare, Joel Fitzgibbon, Deb O'Neil, Andrew Leigh, Sharon Bird and all their colleagues, who have been tremendously supportive and encouraging of me. I am also grateful to the people of Macarthur. I am conscious of the expectations they have of me, and I promise to do my best to fulfil them. I have of course left the best till last. To my children, William, Edward, Eliza, Amelia, Rheuben and Rosetta: you cannot know how much I love you and how proud I am of you. I am so grateful for your support. I know I am not a perfect parent, but no-one could love you more. I love my grandchildren, Julian, Verity, Hamish, Archie and Jarvis, and to my daughter-in-law, Laura, and son-in-law, Greg: you are wonderful supports to me and I love you dearly. To my wife, Sharon: you are my muse. Marrying you is the best thing I ever did. You are more beautiful every day, more perceptive and more wise. I cannot imagine this journey without you. I do not know how you cope with me, our six kids, and managing all of our household crises, minor and major, almost as a single parent. I love you more than ever. We have many more exciting adventures to come. So I am here today for no other reason than to try and make life better for the children and the families that I have cared for over a long period of time. I want them all to do well. I love seeing them still and I will always be available to them. I look forward to working constructively as the 45th Parliament gets to work; there are some urgent things that we need to do, and some important changes that need to happen. As always, I look forward to the future with optimism. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the House.",137
The SPEAKER,BILLS,"Before I call the honourable member for Berowra, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. I call the member for Berowra. ",141
Mr LEESER,BILLS," As a child, the sound of my mother's footsteps coming towards my bedroom to wake me in the morning was a reassuring feature of daily life. Inevitably I was awake before she made the door but the rhythm, the sound and the intensity of her walk were unmistakable. Each morning the moment would arrive when she would fling the door open with that effervescent greeting, 'Time to rise and shine'. Twenty years ago this month, my mother approached my room to wake me but it was with a very different sound, pace and tempo. Seared on my mind from that night was the speed of her approach and her scream as she flung open the door of my bedroom, sobbing, 'Dad's gone; Dad's gone.' I got up from my bed to comfort my mum, trying to calm her. I went down the hall to my father's office, where he worked late into the night for his clients. There I found his pyjamas in a pile and on the glass-topped table in the hall was a note, like so many of the notes from my father, written in red pen on the back of a used envelope. It said simply: 'I am sorry Sylvia. I just can't cope, love, John.' I felt a great emptiness ripping at my stomach. I went to the garage and saw the car was missing. We called the police and later they came round to tell us they had found my father's body at the bottom of The Gap at Watsons Bay. There is a point in life when you are supposed to become a man. As I stood on the veranda and watched the sun come up that morning, I knew my day had come. My father loved music. He played 2CH on the radio from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. Easy listening music was the soundtrack of my childhood, but the day he died the music died with him, and it was years before I could listen to his music again without tearing up. Over the past 20 years, I have gone back over the week leading up to my father's death too many times, and I keep thinking back to the signs he was giving us. Although we had always been a family that hugged each other, my father had started giving us all these very long hugs. My father prided himself on being a great car parker, and yet the week before he died he did not seem to care how he parked. In hindsight, it was clear that something had changed. I knew it, but I did not say anything. You ask yourself: 'What could I have done? What should I have said? Could I have reached out in a way that I did not? Could I have said, as we say now, ""Are you OK?""' I reflect on my own conduct the night before my father died, when he asked if I could help him polish his shoes before he left for a dinner at my brother's school. I remember as a selfabsorbed 20-year old the petulance and rudeness with which I waived away the opportunity to help my father, a man who so often helped me, and there is not a day that I do not regret it. Suicide, they used to say, is a victimless crime, but they never count the loved ones left behind. In the past 20 years we have changed our approach to suicide, depression and mental health. And, while there has rightly been a focus on the mental health of adolescents and young people, we must remember people suffering at other stages in their lives are equally important. And, sadly, the number of older people taking their own lives is increasing. My own father was 55. In these past 20 years, we have spent millions on mental health and suicide prevention. Every government has tried but, despite all the good will, it is a fight we are losing. In my own electorate we have had more than 100 people take their own lives in the last eight years.  Across Australia eight people die by suicide every day. All this shows that government money alone will not solve this epidemic. Treating depression as a medical issue is not working. Rather, we need to rebuild caring communities where people know and notice the signs and acknowledge the people around them; where we ask, 'Are you okay?' or, more directly and importantly, 'Are you contemplating suicide?' And we need to create the conditions where those who are thinking about suicide feel comfortable enough to ask for help. Through my work in this place, I want to help empower Australians to build a greater sense of community. I have seen active engagement in community combat loneliness and enable people to see a world outside themselves. In a society where people are more pressured and more isolated than ever before, active engagement in community fosters civility, courtesy and understanding-virtues that are all too often undervalued and supplanted by anger. There is a role for government in supporting organisations and individuals that reach out to the socially isolated in our community, even in the face of continued rejection. And there is a role for government in fostering innovative solutions that address suicide prevention. I hope that those innovative solutions will enable communities to learn from what has worked and connect other efforts across our country. I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister's personal interest in suicide prevention and the leadership he and the Minister for Health and Aged Care took in devising the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. As a member of this House I want to do what I can to pierce the loneliness, the desperation and the blackness that people who suffer depression feel. During my time here I will always be an advocate for better mental health policy. When I think of my father, though, mostly I think not of the way he died but, rather, of the way he lived. My father, John, was an only child. His father was a pharmacist. His mother and her family escaped Nazi Germany in 1936 for the freedom and sanctuary of Australia. My father was an accountant. He had his own practice at Parramatta. As I child I would go with him to the office or visit clients in their homes, businesses and factories. He knew their lives, their families and their ups and downs: when they succeeded and when they struggled, when they were failing and when they were flourishing. He was a friend they saw once a year to help them comply with the law and get their affairs in order. But even more than that he was an adviser on how they could get on with and grow their businesses. To the extent that I become an effective member for Berowra, it will be because of Dad's example of professionalism, trust and care in working for his clients and the personal touch they loved him for. Dad was a man much involved in his community. He sat on the board of our local synagogue. He sat on a theatre board. He was involved in the school my brother and I attended. Dad was hard working and diligent and prided himself on doing things properly and by the book. He was quiet, unassuming, patient and slow to anger. He had a husky voice that made him sound like Louis Armstrong. He and my mother, Sylvia, gave me three great gifts: my life, my faith and my education. My father instilled in my brother Lindsay and me an important set of values: courtesy, civility and fair dealing with everyone with whom he interacted; the need to give back to the community and get involved; and a deep sense of faith and love of the joys of Judaism. He gave us a strong sense, shared by all Jews, that our story is part of a much larger story; that we  should be, in Jonathan Sacks' words, 'true to our faith while being a blessing to others regardless of their faith'. While I do not always live up to my father's ideals, his are the fundamental values which have shaped my life. There is a Jewish idea that one should bring joy, or 'naches', to one's parents. I hope that my election to this place would have brought him as much naches as it has brought my mother and the rest of my family. It is to my mother, Sylvia, that I owe the greatest thanks for being here today. Her courage and her unconditional love for my brother and me has sustained our family through celebrations and sorrows. With her unshakable belief that anything was possible for her boys, she created a home filled with love, stability and opportunity. Nothing has ever been too much for her. But of all her gifts to us, the enthusiasm for active citizenship, the patriotism she instilled in my brother and me and the fact that, hopefully, we are happy, well-rounded and grateful Australians, is her greatest contribution. My mother, Sylvia, is a fifth-generation Australian. Her grandfather was a Gallipoli ANZAC and rode in the charge of the light horse at Be'er Sheva. Her mother, Barbara, who passed away last week aged 95, served as a nurse in the Australian Army during the Second World War. Mum's father, Sam, served in the ill-fated 8th Division. He was taken prisoner in Changi and survived the horrors of the Burma Railway. The war left my grandfather with a stammer and a steely determination. What kept him alive in those dark days was a dream to come home and start his own hardware business, which he did after the war, employing many of his fellow former POWs. The prosperity that my grandfather created was due to his hard work and ingenuity in predicting the need for building supplies to meet a postwar building boom. My mother's Anglo-Jewry gave her a particular take on being an Australian. Fiercely patriotic about Australia and loyal to the Crown, she realised the historical peculiarity to be both Jewish and free, and that had such an impact on me. As I grew up towards the end of the Cold War, with its threat to freedom everywhere, my mother would constantly remind us of the responsibility that comes with the freedom we enjoy in Australia-to be thankful for it and to preserve it whenever it is threatened-because, as she would teach me, most people in most places at most times are not free. When I was a child my mother read to me about Australia's history and explained how our own family's story fitted into the broader Australian story-a story of explorers, soldiers, farmers, shopkeepers and professionals, people willing to chance their arm, who carved out a country in this physically isolated but socially tolerant land. My own contribution to this story will be influenced by the combination of my father's quiet virtues and my mother's perhaps slightly less quiet, but always deeply patriotic, civic virtues. It was that instilled sense of history and an early interest in politics that prompted me to want to serve in this place. And so around the time of my 10th birthday I asked my parents not for a BMX bike or a cricket bat but for a copy of the Australian Constitution. I think the Latin term for such behaviour is 'nerdus maximus'. Our Constitution is unique and worthy of celebration. It belongs to everyone. It was written and debated all over the country, led by that great generation of liberal and conservative barrister-parliamentarians. Americans and Canadians wrote their constitutions in secret. Modern constitutions tend to be written by legal academics. But the Australian Constitution was written in Australia, by Australians, for Australian conditions: from the School of Arts at Tenterfield to the courthouse at Corowa; from the drawing rooms of Adelaide to the libraries  of Hobart; in parliamentary chambers in Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne; and, of special significance for me, on the Hawkesbury River, in the Berowra electorate, on a paddle-steamer called the Lucinda, where our first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, and our first Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, drafted the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The Australian Constitution has provided the basis for stable government and economic prosperity for over a century. At a time when constitutional structures and political systems around the world are breaking down, Australia's constitutional achievement should be a source of enormous pride. Our Constitution establishes our unique Australian democracy. The Constitution matters as much for what it does not say as for what it does. Our Constitution contains no symbolic language and no bill of rights. Its sparse legal language is its strength. It has meant that only the most creative judges have been able to invent implied rights to frustrate the democratic will. The Constitution has figured prominently in my career and contributions to the public debate. As the youngest elected delegate at the 1998 Constitutional Convention, I remain a committed constitutional monarchist, like my friend and former employer, the member for Warringah. I see it as the best system of government of all the available alternatives. In 2009, I worked with a broad cross-section of Australians to ensure the defeat of an Australian bill of rights because I believe in the capacity of the political process to solve problems, and I am against an American-style judiciary which makes political, rather than legal, decisions because of their bill of rights. In 2013, with the members for Goldstein and Mitchell and some senators from the other place, I led a scrappy but successful insurgency against Labor's plans to have the Commonwealth intervene in local government. In important public debates, in a time of increasing polarisation of views, we need people who can build consensus and find the middle ground. And so in more recent times, I have worked with Indigenous leaders and constitutional conservatives to find a constitutional way to make better policy about, and give due recognition of, Indigenous Australians while avoiding the downsides of inserting symbolic language into a technical document which requires interpretation by judges. Today, the Constitution has an important role to play in the next chapter of Australia's unfinished economic reforms. The next item on our reform agenda must be to address the inefficiencies in our federation. The states and the Commonwealth should have more clearly delineated responsibilities and the finances to deliver them. Instead, today, we have a system of buck-passing, duplication and inefficiency; a lopsided federation that the framers would not recognise. Canberra should not have a monopoly on finance and policy. It has become fashionable to think that whenever the states fail Canberra will do a better job. But pink batts, school halls and the Mersey hospital demonstrate that service delivery is not always Canberra's forte. Canberra collects too much tax, while every year the states come begging because they do not raise enough money to finance their own services. Addressing this dissonance in our federation should deliver less red tape, less duplication, better roads, better schools and better hospitals designed and run to meet local needs. It should also lead to greater policy innovation as competition between the states drives excellence.  I have had the privilege of working for two of Australia's great federalists, High Court Justice Ian Callinan, who honours me with his presence here today, and Professor Greg Craven. I have also spent several years thinking about federalism as the vice-president of the Samuel Griffith Society. I am not the first person to seek to propose reform of the federation on a federalist model. Coalition and Labor politicians have pursued this option before, but every time such solutions have been proposed, they have been undermined by short-term politicking. Previous economic reforms had a greater chance of success when there was crossparty consensus. The same approach is needed to the reform our federation today. We know the task is to deliver the states more of their own source revenue and to lighten Canberra's footprint in areas of policy for which it has little expertise. What has been lacking is the political cooperation to make it happen. I, therefore, propose to look for reform partners in all parties in this parliament to establish a group to build consensus for reform of fiscal federalism. Reform of this scale can be daunting, and while we may not complete the task while we are in this place, nor are we free to desist from it. But by far my most important task is to serve the people of Berowra with the full measure of my devotion. The electorate of Berowra was created in 1969, and runs from the banks of the Hawkesbury River to the M2 motorway. The people of Berowra are community minded and self-reliant. That is why there is a greater number of volunteers, people of faith and small business owners than in many other communities. Despite its strengths, the Berowra community is one that faces major infrastructure challenges. Pennant Hills Road is one of the worse roads in Australia. But now, Liberal state and federal governments are working with the private sector to deliver NorthConnex, which will remove 5,000 trucks from Pennant Hills Road every day, improving air quality and reducing noise while completing the missing national transport link between the M1 and the M2. It is not the only infrastructure issue we face. Other roads, like New Line Road, need widening to take into account the growing population in the electorate and in surrounding areas. And the undulating hills and sparse population in the rural areas make mobile connectivity difficult. But the coalition's Mobile Black Spot Program is starting to address this infrastructure challenge. I wish to thank the people of Berowra for giving me the extraordinary opportunity to serve them. My first duty will always be to them. I would like to thank the members of the Liberal Party in Berowra, and my friends and supporters beyond that organisation, for all their work to see me come into this place. Many have travelled vast distances and waited many hours to be here today. The best way I can demonstrate my gratitude to them is through the quality of my service here. In that, I hope to emulate the style of my three predecessors: Philip Ruddock, who through his record term helped build an ethnically diverse country with strong secure borders; Professor Harry Edwards, who was a leading economic thinker on microfinancing; and one of Australia's most distinguished lawyers, the first member for Berowra, Tom Hughes AO QC, who is here in the gallery today. I am also honoured that my friend Heather Henderson, the daughter of Sir Robert Menzies, is here today. For 6Â½ years I had the privilege of running the centre named after her father, and I acknowledge Tom Harley, my chairman at the Menzies Research Centre, who is here. Sir Robert Menzies was a poor country boy from a one-horse town, who by dint of his own hard work and intellect rose to lead his profession, his party and his nation. Our task as  Liberals is to create the conditions so the next generation's Robert Menzies can rise and thrive. I am conscious of the huge responsibility involved in being the Liberal member for Berowra and I will seek to carry on Sir Robert Menzies's traditions of policy and principle in all I do in this place. Finally, I wish to thank my wife, Joanna. If my parents gave me the foundations for a good and worthwhile life in years past, it is Joanna who anchors me in the present and always points me forward with optimism to the future. She more than any other is the reason I am here. Joanna introduced me to Berowra. It was her home before it was mine. I could not have embarked on this journey without her. She is smart, accomplished, beautiful and challenging, and she has never lost faith in me. She is, in fact, perfect in every way, except for that occasion 11 years ago when her judgement clearly failed her and she decided to marry me. Joanna, I love you with all my heart. Every new member comes into this place with life experience from which they can draw strength. I come here with the certain knowledge that no-one lives a perfect life, that we all need help and community in good times and hard times, but I draw strength from the example of my family. I draw strength from my faith. I draw strength from Australia's traditions of service. And I draw strength from our unique Australian story of progress epitomized by the stories of the individuals who persevered and wrote our Constitution. Reform is never easy but the opportunity to participate in the public debate and advocate for the cause I believe in-a strong, free, confident and prosperous Australia-fills me with the greatest enthusiasm.",142
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Before I call the honourable member for Murray, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",147
Mr DRUM,BILLS," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, and congratulations on your ascension to that position. It is certainly an incredible honour to be able to stand in this place as a representative of the people of the electorate of Murray. There is a huge sense of humility that engulfs a member when they are elected to the House of Representatives-well, there is with this member anyway. We all know that the 100,000-plus people who make up the electorate are relying on us to be their voice in Canberra. This responsibility can never be taken lightly. The electorate of Murray can be largely described as the greater Goulburn Valley in north central Victoria as well as the large area in the west of the electorate, mainly comprising the Loddon shire. It is the electorate that I grew up in and it is the electorate that I am so proud to represent. I understand very clearly that the people who have put me in this place, just like the people who put everyone else in this place, expect us to do whatever we can to make their lives better. I have certainly taken a circuitous route to this House and I understand very clearly that the role of an MP is not about us; it is about the people we represent. There is little doubt that I am somewhat an accidental politician. I was raised on a dairy farm in Congupna, about 10 kilometres north of Shepparton. I reckon I was lucky from day one to be born into a loving family. I am the youngest of seven children, with five brothers and one beautiful sister, Kerry. I give a shout out to Kerry's husband, Francis, who had an operation just yesterday. I am sure he is doing well.  My father's father was an alcoholic who drank away the family farm in the New South Wales Riverina region, so in the 1950s my dad and his two brothers made their way to the Goulburn Valley to start a new life. I was able to witness first hand that hard work and smarts were not optional extras in one's life plans but were integral elements of any future vision. My mother was an amazing woman. I still have no idea how she was able to raise seven kids, do all the chores on the farm that she did, cook three meals a day for the old man and be Shepparton Citizen of the Year in 1978. I went to school in Shepparton. I had a couple of years at a boarding school in the mid 1970s and then returned to Congupna to finish my schooling and complete a building apprenticeship. I left the Goulburn Valley to play footy for Geelong when I was 20. When I was 26 I bought a steel fabrication and construction business in Werribee. That business was very tough going, especially when the demands of the football industry were ever increasing. I remember having last month's bills in one hand and this month's bills turning up in the other hand, and not having the money to pay either. It was at a time also where I too had to wear a Prime Minister who liked to brag about his Italian suits and expected us to thank him for 'the recession we had to have' and the 23 per cent interest rates that nearly forced us to the wall. It certainly strengthened my views about the Labor Party and business. But, by further investment in the manufacturing side of that business, over time we were able to turn things around. It is with considerable pride that I look back on that chapter, with memories of hard work, long hours and possibly more good decisions than bad ones. At the end of 1993, I went to the amazing city of Sydney to work with the great Ron Barassi and spent the next five years working with the Sydney Swans, with both Ron Barassi and Rodney Eade. Barass had a favourite saying: 'If it is to be, it is up to me.' I was very lucky to have spent my first years as an assistant coach with this living legend and I learned to revel in his brutal honesty when it came to any debate. He also had another saying, which was, 'That's just your opinion. You're not necessarily right and you're not necessarily wrong; it's just your opinion.' One of Ron's and the Swan's greatest fans is none other than the minister for transport, Darren Chester. Darren expressed a similar view in his maiden speech, which I will quote. He said: What we believe in as political party members are our opinions. Our job is to attend parliament and to argue those opinions with all the passion and enthusiasm we have, but they are still just opinions. To think that either side has a mortgage on what is right or what is wrong is absolute folly. What both sides have a mortgage on is a responsibility to respect each other's opinions. The reason why Darren's quote and Ron Barassi's sayings are so similar is that, when Darren made that maiden speech in 2008, he was actually quoting my maiden speech that I made in the Victorian parliament in 2002, and I was actually quoting Ron Barassi and the speeches that he gave all of his life. So this might be the first maiden speech where someone actually gets to quote someone else's maiden speech where that person's maiden speech was quoting their own maiden speech from another parliament. Anyway, whoever is quoting whom, it is still true that opinions are just opinions.  In 1998, I went to Fremantle as their second senior coach, and they had been in the AFL for four years. It was an amazing opportunity and the people of Fremantle were very welcoming, as were the members of the Fremantle Golf Club, where I met many lifelong friends. I had three wonderful years in Western Australia and, whilst the success of the venture west did not flow over to the on-field component, it was a life experience that very few get to realise, and once again I acknowledge how fortunate I was to be given that role. It is sort of poignant having seen Matthew Pavlich being hoisted onto his teammate's shoulders two weeks ago as he left the field for his final game after 17 seasons, because he has come a long way from the 17-year-old from West Torrens who said to me, 'If you draft me to Fremantle, it will be my worse nightmare come true.' Well, we did draft him and he has just finished what many would consider to be a fairytale career. I was unceremoniously relieved of my AFL coaching duties in 2001. It was a bit like reality TV before its time, where I was informed that I had been sacked by the media, live on Channel 7. In 2002 I moved to Bendigo to coach the VFL team, the Bendigo Diggers, and at the end of that year, following a couple of phone calls from persistent politicians, I decided to run for the Upper House position in the November state election, for the Nationals. My previous life as a builder and a footy coach has given me a healthy understanding of what the average Australian thinks of politicians. I remember very clearly the day that I announced I was going to run for the Victorian state Upper House seat of North West Province and the conversation I had with the then leader of the state National Party, Peter Ryan. He said to me, 'I want you to clearly remember what it is you think of politicians right now.' I said, 'Okay. Yeah, I've got that, but what's the point? The thoughts aren't that positive.' His answer was one I will not forget. He said, 'If you get in, you're going to meet a heap of politicians and many of them are going to be ripping people who work incredibly hard for their communities. So you're going to go in there and you're going to like them and you're going to change your mind. But the people that you represent will not get the opportunity to meet the people in the way you will, so they'll always have the opinion of politicians that you do now. So never forget it, because that's who you're actually representing.' Fourteen years in state parliament teaches you many things-namely, it is very difficult to deliver for your people, for your electorate, when you are in opposition. It teaches you to take advantage of every day that you are in government, because you do not know how long you are going to have that opportunity. There are other lessons, like it costs more to deliver services in rural and regional Australia than it does to deliver those same services in Melbourne and Sydney. We should always be cognisant of the cost of travel in the areas of delivery in health, policing and education. If we refuse to acknowledge the true cost of distance, then we run the risk of further embedding the imbalance between services and amenities enjoyed by our major cities as compared to those available in rural and regional Australia. I have always considered myself incredibly lucky to have been a part of the Nationals team. Having other members actively going out of their way to assist in your development, never having to look over your shoulder, never having to worry about your side of the team and what they are doing is a tremendous advantage. I find that we are able to concentrate solely on the job of serving our people, serving our electorate, and leaving the internal politics to others.  The National Party members in the Victorian state government have built a very strong reputation for being incredibly hard workers and extremely connected to their communities. And, in good National Party tradition, they also lead the parliament in practical jokes. I have seen cars in the car park literally disappear and turn up hundreds of meters away, with no explanation as to how that happened. I have found a disused forklift wheel in the backseat of my car, again with no explanation as to where that came from. I have learnt never to leave my iPhone or iPad sitting around when my colleagues know the security code, because those phone calls you get from the opposition the next day wanting you to explain that obscure message that you sent them late last night can sometimes be very difficult to explain, when you obviously have no recall as to what was in it. I have even seen it happen with a colleague. They were staying up late one night and when some stubbies of beer were being handed out, in amongst the beer was a bottle of balsamic vinegar and the unsuspecting member took a swig from what he thought was a stubby of beer. Everybody burst out laughing. The screwed up look on the face of that member of parliament will remain with me till the day I die. I know that the team in Melbourne, in Spring Street, are watching that big TV with the nasty scratch on the corner, and I do want to send a big shout-out to big Jeff Fenech: 'I love youse all! I love my time with you.' From watching and observing leaders and, in my case, great leaders in Peter Ryan and Peter Walsh in the Legislative Assembly and Peter Hall in the Legislative Council, I have realised the importance of being able to listen-to listen to your constituents, to listen to your colleagues and to listen to your opponents. I am staggered as to how many people feel as though they have to have a say on each and every issue, even though most of them add nothing to the general conversation. Real leaders are people of few words, but, when they speak, people listen. There is something very satisfying about being part of a group that is trustworthy and tight. It takes years to build the culture of a team that is in this place to serve others. I desperately want the Nationals in government, under the leadership of Barnaby Joyce, with its coalition partners, to be the team that truly connects with and relates to their people. I also want to acknowledge Matthew Guy and his Liberal team and thank him for his friendship. We are both truly 'coalitionists' and realise that each other's party makes our own party better. When I look at the electorate of Murray and cast a vision as to how I would like to see this region in the future, I am immediately reminded of the current dairy crisis, where for many the farmgate price of milk and milk products is currently below the cost of production. Whilst this is a worldwide problem, it is hitting incredibly hard in the Goulburn Valley, and although many farming businesses will be working incredible hours they will still lose serious amounts of money just so that they can keep their herds together for a time when the demand pushes the price of milk past the cost of production. Hopefully, it will move into a space where a profit may be made and some of these businesses in the dairy industry can enjoy some welldeserved success. The Goulburn Valley in the Murray electorate, which I proudly represent, is a great part of Australia-possibly the greatest. The river that gives the electorate its name is amazing in itself, and the communities that are built on it from Yarrawonga to Echuca are huge tourist towns, with amazing experiences waiting for people to explore. There is amazing potential  within the business sector, be it in agriculture, the professional services sector, engineering or manufacturing. Water is possibly the most critical component of the Murray electorate. It is the vital lifeblood of our region from the West Loddon pipeline, which had $20 million committed to it in the election campaign, thanks to Barnaby Joyce, to the reset of the connections project; it has cost nearly $2 billion to modernise water and irrigation practices. The state government has now pushed that project out to 2020. It is clear that we must have governments that keep supporting agriculture now and into the future to ensure that we have the water to grow the produce that our businesses are set up to grow. Private enterprise has invested heavily in onfarm infrastructure. As you can see when you drive around there right now, with solid rains, the grain crops, sheep and cattle are all looking at record yields. Transport infrastructure is also a big issue in Murray, and while improvements to the region were announced recently, like the Echuca-Moama Bridge, thanks to Darren Chester, there is a never-ending list of projects still to be completed. The Goulburn Valley is also home to a series of processor and packaging industries, which are directly related to the primary producers, and at the heart of their prosperity is access to water. It would be fair to say that over recent years, and certainly with the introduction of the Murray Darling Basin Plan, that the environment has been given priority over agriculture. This is another challenge facing all of us in this place as we try to reach a better balance between looking after our environmental assets and giving our businesses the opportunity to produce the food and fibre that they are capable of producing. It is our job in this place to help and assist our people, to make their lives easier, to reduce red tape, to build infrastructure, to create fair and flexible work environments for both our employers and our employees. I also want to thank all of the Nationals team that helped out during the campaign. It was long, it was cold and it was really long and it was really cold. You all know who you are, and I thank each and every one of you sincerely. One of my real concerns about my electorate and one that I share with all of my Nationals' colleagues-it has been mentioned today-is education. In regional Australia, certainly in regional Victoria, our educational outcomes when measured by year 12 completion rates and transitioning through to university are really struggling to compare with students in our metropolitan cities, where their measures are improving year on year. This gap in educational attainment is a real worry, because there is a very clear correlation between education and wealth. The LGAs in Victoria with the highest or best educational attainment levels are also the local government areas that produce the highest weekly incomes in the state. Those areas which have the poorest levels of education generate the lowest weekly incomes-the correlation is stark. If we want to have prosperous regions, cities, towns and people to represent then we need to improve educational outcomes in rural and regional Australia. There is also a stark correlation between wealth and health. When you compare those local government areas, those with low weekly incomes are exactly the same areas as those with poor health outcomes. Those areas, in terms of oral health, diabetes, cancer survival rates, obesity and life expectancy, all suffer poorer ratings than those areas with high weekly incomes. So the message is simple: education equals wealth, and wealth equals health. Again, if we want to represent prosperous and healthy communities then we need to improve our educational attainment levels.  During my time in the state parliament, I had the opportunity to assist the former leader, Peter Ryan, as his Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development. I am incredibly proud of the hundreds and hundreds of projects we were able to bring to fruition by using the Regional Growth Fund to invest in rural and regional Victoria. And I am very proud of the $22 million we were able to find to invest in SPC to secure 500 jobs in Shepparton. For the last nine months of the Napthine government, I was Minister for Sport and Recreation and Minister for Veterans Affairs. Sport in Victoria, like every other state and territory, creates interest and passion unlike any other pursuit. I do love all sports, and I have enormous respect for the role that sporting clubs play in the whole dynamic of Australian communities. Sports clubs, in particular team sports clubs, keep our children out of the justice system. They tutor and mentor our sons and daughters, giving these kids life lessons, without them realising they are receiving them. Involvement in sport enables us to be more active and healthier than we would otherwise be. We need to look at investment in community sporting facilities as an investment in the health of our communities and as a smart and proactive way to spend our health budget. That is why, as Minister for Sport and Recreation in Victoria, I insisted that we change the rules to ensure that if a community club was struggling to find the money it needed for its contribution to a specific project, then their in-kind contribution in the form of labour and/or donated materials could be used as their share of the co-investment in these projects. This philosophy was all about helping those clubs and those communities that were prepared to help themselves. As every other member in this House has acknowledged, it is very true that for every member of parliament there is an incredible support network that carries so much of the load, and that is their family. I have five children aged from 19 to 34. I am incredibly lucky to have loving relationships with all of them. Their support for my foray into federal politics was paramount to me actually making that decision. I couldn't have made this commitment without their support. So to Corey, Gabrielle-I have to shout out to Gabrielle because she is in Canada-Alyce and Luke: thank you. Also, to Josh, Sally, Willow, Olive and Sonny: I want to thank you all for how good you make me feel. I have admiration for how you are all living your lives. I love you unconditionally. As I said earlier, I am the youngest of seven children. I have a couple of my brothers in the gallery today. To Chris and Des: thank you very much for your unconditional love and support. Again, I fully realise how lucky I am to have been born into a strong family of community volunteers. My family has been volunteering since the word 'volunteer' became fashionable. Quite simply, when I grew up if a role needed to be filled it was filled. It was filled without expectation of thanks or kudos. These roles were always completed, the work was done and the community got on and it prospered. I must also acknowledge my fantastic partner, Ros. I met Ros almost 10 years ago. Again, I was incredibly lucky to find someone so gorgeous, so smart and with such a kind and generous heart. I would also like to thank Ros for the way her family has accepted me into their lives so readily. I would like to thank Ron and Di, Leela and Harry, Lousie and Louis, and Reena and Keith. You have all been incredibly welcoming and accepting, as have Ros's two wonderful sons, Sam and James. Ros has somewhat had her life turned upside down by  my decision to move to Murray, but I am incredibly appreciative of her unflinching love and support in the knowledge that it is totally reciprocated. I would like to finish with a quote from a speech that the former Premier of Victoria Denis Napthine gave when he was a minister in the Ted Baillieu government in 2011. He took the floor at a coalition conference and he said to all of the state MPs, 'The positions you hold in the community are really, really important. The role you play and the work you do is incredibly important. People in your community think that you are a very important person and your perception is that you are very important. What you have to understand is that you, all of you, are very important people. And if you believe this, you're in real trouble!' I think there might be a few people in this building in real trouble!",147
The SPEAKER,BILLS,"Before I call the honourable member for Brisbane, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",153
Mr EVANS,BILLS," First of all, I am honoured to be joined by so many of my colleagues here in the chamber so late in the evening. I am sure it has more to do with the events of the last sitting week than any expectations that I will be eloquent or profound! I first visited this parliament as a teenager on a family road trip. I remember my brothers running pretty much right across the roof of this place and rolling down the grassy slopes on the sides of the building in a way that security probably does not permit today. I don't remember being up there in the gallery, but my parents, who I am very proud to say are up there tonight, tell me that I was. Between that visit and now, I have had many causes to reflect deeply on the achievements of our nation and our past governments. The sacrifice and the service of the men and women in this place have steered Australia through the challenges of 115 years of Federation, two world wars and countless moral trials and economic tribulations. I am humbled, but enthusiastic about having this opportunity to contribute my service to the betterment of our nation. Australia is one of the longest continuously running democracies on earth. Our Federation was formed thoughtfully in peacetime and benefits from great foundations and traditions. We are a beacon of freedom, prosperity, diversity, justice and security in an often difficult world. I see our nation, in some ways, as our sanctuary: an economic sanctuary, an environmental sanctuary and a sanctuary affording us safety from many of the events, illnesses and other miseries in the wider world. We should take very seriously the responsibility that comes with having the custodianship of both a nation and a continent. I come to this place deeply connected to Australia's small business class. My family have been retailers and shopkeepers for generations, and also builders, farmers and sawmillers. I was born in Tweed Heads in New South Wales. I was the first of my family to attend university. Before that, I am proud to have attended government schools in Mitcham, Victoria; in Elimbah near Caboolture; and in Beerwah on the Sunshine Coast. I believe the last federal MP to be born in Tweed Heads was Neville Bonner, Australia's first Indigenous politician. He was a great Queensland politician and a constitutional conservative. I have admired his principled approach, along with how gracefully he  represented the diversity of our country, as a proud Liberal. I hope to say more about Neville Bonner in the future. In the meantime, I hope I can emulate his style. It is almost passe for me to cover some personal issues of diversity here tonight, because two fellow Liberals in this chamber have recently covered these issues so superbly. Yet I cannot help reflecting, just now, in this moment, that in about 10 other countries around the world someone like me would be defenestrated or sentenced to death, as a political or religious statement. Medieval ideals and concentrated political power both share a common lack of respect for the fundamental value of a human life. Liberal democracy will continue to prove itself, the only consistent friend of those around the world who are women, gay, or ethnic or religious minorities. To the extent our voices in this place make any difference in the wider world, let my voice say-loudly and defiantly-that my presence here is not symptomatic of a weakening Western world. Rather, I stand here speaking for the ongoing triumph of liberal democracy, with the willing support of those who understand the fundamental value of human life and the powerful potential of each individual. My heritage is a story of successful immigration and enterprise. My family-like so many others-has sent relatives to conflicts around the world, to defend freedom and democracy. I pledge my ongoing support for our defence forces, to uphold the ANZAC legacy, and I will 'never forget' that everything we have now is as a result of their sacrifice. I also want to proudly declare my passion for conservation. Following the family road trips as a kid, my love of hiking, camping and fishing has taken me all over this sunburnt nation. I feel most alive, and most at peace, when I am alone with nature. Time will tell how I come to feel in this 'house of animals'! From the wilds of Tasmania to the Red Centre, from the Daintree to the Nullarbor to the Pilbara, I have a deep love of our wilderness, our native flora and fauna. I also express my respect for the first peoples of our land. Our beautiful, dreaming continent is lucky to have the oldest continuing cultures on earth as custodians and storytellers. I pay special tribute to those who have had custodianship of the Brisbane area for thousands of generations-the Turrbal and Jagera people. I would like to express my thanks-and my dedication-to the people of Brisbane. I am so honoured you have given me this opportunity to represent you. I will repay your vote of faith by working hard. I hope to deliver a style of representation that is visible, accessible, responsive and deeply thoughtful about the challenges we face. Despite those many challenges, I will always be naturally optimistic. I have witnessed so many community groups, organisations, school communities and volunteers, all around Brisbane, doing such astonishing work. It truly is inspiring and gives me great faith and confidence in humankind. To the Brisbane researchers who found the world's first vaccines for cancers, helping save over a quarter of a million lives every year; to the innovative Brisbane art scene taking the world by storm; to the empires being built by the Brisbane coffee barons; to the Brisbane teachers and educators making international education our city's biggest export-you prove that there is so much to be optimistic about, and I will dedicate my efforts to helping you, and locals like you, to contribute to a better world.  I acknowledge my parents, Norm and Carol. Dad, you set a standard most could never meet, in terms of hard work and dedication to your family. Your sacrifices and your example fuel the fire in my belly. You taught me to grit my teeth and stay the course through tough times; to be undeterred by those who talk or criticise instead of acting; and to seek justice and be a voice for the little guy. Mum, as well as unconditional love, you gave me a love of words, books and learning. If I am ever literate and comprehensible in this place, it is because you sat us down as kids and you read to us. To my partner, Roger, my best friend and source of unconditional understanding: your smile would shine through any darkness. I love you. To my brothers, Wayne, Brendan and Daniel: thank you for your camaraderie. Your practical jokes and antics have already caused me some headlines. I almost look forward to more of those headlines, knowing how my brothers will always keep me so very grounded. And we just received the happy word this afternoon that I am to be an uncle again, for the eighth time. To the rest of my family-including my grandmothers, Elma and Carol-you have taught me that nothing matters more than family. A strong, happy family will always be the safety net of first resort. I acknowledge and thank everyone who worked so hard on the Brisbane campaign. Almost 700 of you contributed in some way, and I cannot attempt to name you all in this speech, but you should be proud that your efforts made such a difference. The preselection was relatively late and Brisbane has usually been won by our political opponents. Yet this result was a record win. I will work hard to make you proud for helping me become just the 12th member for Brisbane since Federation. At the risk of singling out just a few extraordinary contributions, I would like to put on record the efforts of my campaign manager, Pete Coulson, and campaign executive members Dan Frost-Foster and Tony Gleeson. You put your lives on hold and sacrificed more than most to achieve victory. I would also like to give my thanks to the executive and staff of the LNP. The election results in Queensland speak for themselves. Thank you to the Prime Minister, other ministers and colleagues for their support through the campaign. Thanks especially to Minister Peter Dutton and Attorney-General George Brandis for their support. Thank you to the Queensland LNP leader, Tim Nicholls; to the Brisbane lord mayor; and to all seven local councillors whose wards overlap with the division of Brisbane. I look forward to working so constructively with you for the benefit of our great area. I would like to pay tribute to the former member for Brisbane, the Hon. Teresa Gambaro. Teresa served this parliament for 18 years, first as the member for Petrie and then as the member for Brisbane. Teresa represented the strong contribution of the Italian community to the electorate of Brisbane, which is as strong now as ever. So many of our families' stories should remind us of the value of welcoming migration with open arms when migrants are attracted to the promise of this lucky country, the freedom and the opportunity and the space to work hard and make something of yourself. I would like to acknowledge Mark Brodie, the chairman of the National Retail Association, as well as the board and the staff who have worked tirelessly and loyally for the benefit of our  nation's retail and services sectors. I pledge to continue to work hard to support these industries which have sustained me and so many in my family for generations. There are roughly about 400,000 shopfronts, cafes, food outlets and stores around our country. About 10,000 of them are in my electorate of Brisbane. The majority of them are family owned small businesses. Collectively, they are the biggest source of jobs and opportunities for Australians. More than 1 in 10 Australians work in them. And if every shopfront could be encouraged to employ two more workers tomorrow, our unemployment rate would be zero. Zero. Meaning the majority of mature-aged Australians, Indigenous Australians and the disabled who are looking for work would find the dignity they want and deserve. These industries already do more than any other sector to provide jobs, opportunities and prosperity for the young, for women, for the least-skilled. And we will be relying on them more than ever as some so-called fast lanes of the economy now slow. Yet there is not and there never has been a minister for retail or a department overseeing these industries, unlike every other major industry you could name. And while I am not for a moment suggesting that these businesses want or need a bureaucracy looking over their shoulders, they do need a strong voice. If decision-makers do not properly comprehend the needs and the potential of small business, or if they think first and foremost of big business, big unions or big government when they make decisions then we fail small businesses, because, while small businesses are not usually directly regulated or licensed, they certainly do feel the cumulative burden of business red tape. Well-intentioned but ill-considered and sometimes poorly administered regulations are currently strangling these businesses-sometimes to death. The evidence is already in if you know where to look for it. When the Fair Work Ombudsman audits small businesses in retail, fast food or hair and beauty, it regularly finds non-compliance rates of about 40 per cent. A long list of other regulators actually find similar rates of non-compliance in small business-around 40 per cent-in areas like health and safety and consumer law. This non-compliance is typically minor, technical and inadvertent in nature rather than serious or deliberate, but the point is we have so many areas of regulation now with the rules changing so frequently in so many of those areas that small businesses in Australia are already overwhelmed. Speaking frankly: they survive right now in a fraught purgatory of non-compliance and non-enforcement. Our party was founded on the notion that the small-business middle class needs a strong voice. In Robert Menzies' most famous address, 'The forgotten people', he said that the rich and powerful 'are as a rule able to protect themselves.' He said he wanted to represent 'shopkeepers, skilled artisans, professional men and women, farmers and so on.' Today, the small-business class is just as likely to include professional consultants, creative industry types, tradies and independent contractors. I suggest some priorities for this government to better support small business. Firstly, wherever possible we need business regulations to be more around principles rather than based on prescriptions. Secondly, we need a change of culture within some of our regulators. They need to support principle based regulation by being more willing to give the equivalent of private rulings. Every time a government officer says, 'We don't give legal advice,' in  response to a legitimate small-business query they are sacrificing goodwill between government and industry and failing to achieve better outcomes for Australian consumers. A culture change also requires regulators to abandon their preference for seeking scalps through media releases, court rulings and penalties. Imagine a world in which a regulator goes into a business, gets free and ready access to diligently audit the processes of the business in exchange for confidentiality in helping that business to overcome any problems that they unearthed. That style of collaboration would be less adversarial, cheaper and would likely result in much faster and better outcomes for consumers and the government. Thirdly, I propose that this government works to introduce a new industrial relations award specifically to apply to start-ups and small business. In recognition of the fact that small businesses are already struggling with the cumulative burden of red tape, a new smallbusiness award should aim to be less prescriptive and more principles based than the current industry awards. It must maintain the high base wage rates Australians deserve. I have always been proud that Australia has some of the highest wage levels in the world. I will always work hard to find every means possible to sustainably grow real wages for Australians. A small-business award should also provide for penalty rates and overtime as set by the Fair Work Commission. These loadings should apply on public holidays and on any hours in a normal week outside of 40 core hours nominated by the small business. Such an award would do more than almost anything else to supercharge the small-business sector and encourage them to create the jobs we need. Some believe the topic of industrial relations is off limits these days, yet Australians deserve to know the truth: that in industries like retail the penalty rate system is a sham and a lie and on the brink of breaking down. The system is a sham because the specified penalty rates will not actually be paid to most retail workers this weekend, or any other weekend. Not in small business, most of whom will shut or bring in family members to work, and not in big business, who use agreements with big unions to water down and avoid penalty rates. The lie at the heart of this system is that the so-called strongest defenders of penalty rates in the labour movement are complicit in the specified penalty rates not being paid to many workers. And the system is at risk of breaking down as the Fair Work Commission is forced to confront the fact that big unions have signed off on agreements that make many workers worse off than they would be under the awards. Such agreements are supposed to be prohibited. If they do get struck out, this ticking time bomb threatens the shifts and hours of thousands upon thousands of our most vulnerable workers. This government must be ready to act if that occurs. On the topic of big business, there has been some recent public debate around the role that big business and their associations should play in elections and in shaping policy. The coalition went to this election with one of the strongest pro-growth platforms in living memory. Yet in the heat of the campaign, there was little third party support from certain organisations whose job it was to vigorously explain why the country so critically needs jobs and growth at this time. There are some organisations that do diligently prosecute the case for reform. Yet there are some in big business, it seems, who believe it may be possible to skirt the public contests about the tax they pay or the regulations they comply with. Those missing in action seem to  believe that the biggest potential beneficiaries of economic reforms should be able to free ride on the efforts and work of smaller, less resourced businesses and groups. They should not assume such a political paradigm might continue. We on this side of the House support enterprise and free markets. We want small businesses to grow into big businesses and create the jobs and opportunities Australians critically need. Yet, coming from small business-and as a former regulator and economistI am naturally suspicious of concentrated power, whether that is found in the clumsy power of central government, the institutional influence of trade unions or the market power of big business. I believe the more powerful you are the more responsibility you have to wield your power in a way that is true to your origins, and benefits and protects the little guys coming from the same place where you started. Those who abandon the national debate should not be surprised to see that reform is predominantly targeted elsewhere, such as towards small businesses. Finally, populism is on the march again around the world and, indeed, in Australia. Populism is shorthand for protectionism, the antithesis of trade. While our country is our sanctuary, we should never be isolationist or inward looking. Every sustainable gain in humankind's standard of living has come about from skills, specialisation and trade. Global forces that could barely be contained a century ago through protectionist policies certainly cannot be contained that way now in a digital and internet age. Dusting off the old red megaphone of populism might give some grievances a good airing, but it is not a sincere solution. The answer lies with a government that can offer a comprehensive program: optimism; applying every effort to education, training and skills; understanding how free markets require good but light-handed regulation; and how skilled and compassionate migration relies on rules that can maintain the confidence of the people. In dedicating my service to this 45th Parliament and to Brisbane, I want to quote former Prime Minister Sir George Reid. His words from 113 years ago beautifully express, my optimism and my themes here tonight: Our policy has no fear of human progress, the tides of the world's commerce may rise, the triumphal march of human discoveries may bring nations more and more closely together, but these events have no terror for us. We have a policy of national not sectional ideals. The words liberty, equality and fraternity are not to us a mere phrase; we believe in their spirit being embodied in the legislative policy of a great, intelligent democracy, and say, in the words of TennysonRing out the slowly dying cause Ring out the feuds of rich and poor Ring out the old, ring in the new Ring out the false, ring in the true.",153

The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate informing the House of a reference to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services concerning the life insurance industry. The message read as followsThat the following matters be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 30 June 2017:  (a) the need for further reform and improved oversight of the life insurance industry; (b) assessment of relative benefits and risks to consumers of the different elements of the life insurance market, being direct insurance, group insurance and retail advised insurance; (c) whether entities are engaging in unethical practices to avoid meeting claims; (d) the sales practices of life insurers and brokers, including the use of Approved Product Lists; (e) the effectiveness of internal dispute resolution in life insurance; (f) the roles of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in reform and oversight of the industry; and (g) any related matters. NA Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (19:15): I rise to speak on the so-called Fair Work Amendment (Respect for Emergency Services Volunteers) Bill 2016. This is a bill giving effect to the government's opportunistic intervention in a state issue. In the middle of an election campaign, a campaign in which the Prime Minister performed so badly, the government sought to involve itself in what was a state matter. The Labor Party has said all along that whatever differences there are between the volunteers and the CFA, the United Firefighters Union or any parties that are fighting fires in Victoria, we would like to see leadership and we would like to see an effort to reconcile differences not inflame tensions. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, said this bill will protect Australia's emergency services. But it is unclear whether this is true. The Department of Employment, who I thank for their briefing, has advised that: 'This bill only applies to emergency services in Victoria, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to intervene in respect of emergency services that currently exist in other states. However, it should be noted that, if any emergency services were deemed to be corporations, they could be captured and, in a recent court case, the Country Fire Authority was found to be a trading corporation. It is entirely unclear whether any other fire authorities or other emergency management bodies in Australia are captured by this legislation, and this will only be able to be determined through litigation.' The government almost seems to have accepted this uncertainty, giving itself power to both exclude and include bodies to be captured by the legislation. No matter how broad or narrow the application of this bill turns out to be, it is clear that it is the government's response to an industrial dispute between Victoria's Country Fire authority and the CFA employees represented by the United Firefighters Union. For members of the parliament who are not from Victoria, the country fire authority in Victoria is a community based volunteer organisation protecting communities from the outer suburbs of Melbourne to the most remote parts of the state. This is confirmed in the CFA Act, which states:  â¦ the Authority is first and foremost a volunteer-based organisation, in which volunteer officers and members are supported by employees in a fully integrated manner. This is reflected in the membership of the CFA. As at the end of June 2015, the CFA had around 57,000 volunteers, 35,000 of whom were operational, and around 1,800 permanent staff, of whom 970 were operational. Volunteer numbers have been relatively stable over the last decade, fluctuating between 55,000 and 59,000 volunteers. The number of permanent staff has increased by about 50 per cent in that period-from 1,300 to 1,900. According to the CFA, this has been because the rapid growth in Melbourne's outer suburbs and regional Victoria is putting more pressure on CFA to respond to the growing number of fires and emergency incidents. The statutory objective of the CFA in performing its functions in exercising its powers is to: (a) contribute to a whole of sector approach to emergency management; (b) promote a culture within the emergency management sector of community focus, interoperability and public value. These functions are to be exercised with regard to the commitment and principles set out in the Volunteer Charter. It is also the CFA's responsibility to develop policy and organisational arrangements that encourage, maintain and strengthen the capacity of volunteer officers and members. The interests of the volunteers are represented by Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria, and the CFA is required under the state act to recognise, value, respect and promote the contribution of volunteer officers and members to the well-being and safety of the community and to consult with Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria on behalf of volunteer officers and members on any matter that might reasonably be expected to affect them. In respect of its paid employees, the CFA may appoint, transfer, suspend or remove such officers and employees as it deems necessary and is required to pay wages consistent with any agreement or award and provide for leave. While there is statutory obligation to consult with the volunteers about matters that affect them, there is no obligation on the CFA to consult with its paid workforce. This can only be achieved through consultation requirements in the enterprise agreement between the United Firefighters Union, on behalf of its members, and the CFA. It is against this backdrop that we have seen tensions arise between Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria and the United Firefighters Union. These tensions have resulted in Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria bringing an action in the Supreme Court of Victoria. This case is to commence on 3 October and is expected to take 10 days. The listing of this matter was expedited and the opposition is hopeful that the court will determine the matter quickly as well. This case could determine whether the proposed agreement between the CFA in the paid firefighters is consistent with the CFA's obligations under the CFA Act. As the court case makes clear, this is a dispute which is not between parties to an enterprise agreement under the Fair Work Act but between Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria and the CFA. Labor's view is that this has always been, and remains, a state issue. It is our firm belief that, as this may be resolved in the Supreme Court of Victoria, this federal parliament should stay out of the way-at very least, in exercise of the precautionary principle. The government has not convinced Labor that this bill is warranted. As I said from the outset, we believe it is  an ill-motivated government that is acting in this manner, dragging this matter into the parliament in Canberra when it should be resolved between the parties within Victoria. But I think one of the most telling examples of the insincerity of the government is the recent interview between David Speers and the Minister for Employment, who, after being asked the question 14 times and in many different ways, was unable to answer why and in what way the agreement would affect volunteers. David Speers asked Minister Cash how the agreement-if approved by the Fair Work Commission-would affect the volunteers, and on 14 occasions the minister was incapable of providing any answer as to how the agreement would have an adverse impact on the volunteers. If the Minister for Employment cannot explain the impact of the proposed agreement upon volunteers, then why should this parliament seriously entertain the intentions of the government-when it cannot even prosecute its case? The fact is, the minister has been unable to explain the intention of this legislation, and she could not explain, when asked 14 times by David Speers, the impact of the agreement on volunteers. It begs the question, why are we dealing with this matter in this way when the minister is unable to explain the government's position? I want to make one other point in relation to that interview and in relation to other comments made by the minister. The minister thought it was fitting to use Ash Wednesday as a metaphor for this dispute. As a Victorian, I am affronted by one of our most fatal state tragedies being used as a metaphor for an industrial dispute. I do not believe it is fitting, nor is it in the interests of the family members of the victims of Ash Wednesday to be using that metaphor, and I would ask the minister to desist. It is not the kind of language that a cabinet minister should be using in such a matter. The opposition has grave concerns that this is just another example of the government deciding to overturn the decision of an independent tribunal it does not like. It did not like the decision of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, so it abolished the tribunal. In this case, the government does not like the Fair Work Commission's recommended resolution of a long standing dispute between the CFA and its paid firefighters, so it seeks to impose itself in this matter by legislating. Imagine if the government-or some future Labor governmentwere to legislate every time they were unhappy with an agreement reached between an employer and unions or its employees. It would create chaos within the workplace system. It would create chaos within workplaces across Australia. That is why there are grave concerns about this proposed legislation. It is also why the Police Federation of Australia have made submissions against the enactment of this legislation; why the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation are opposing this legislation as it currently stands; and why Ambulance Employees Australia Victoria have also made submissions against this proposed legislation. In justifying intervening in the decision of the independent tribunal, the government has raised a number of concerns that they have about the substance of the proposed agreement between the CFA and the United Firefighters Union. The opposition has sought a Senate legislation committee inquiry to get the bottom of the government's claims in respect of the bill. The opposition will use this inquiry to examine whether the bill is warranted at all, or desirable, having regard to the safety of the community and the opportunity to resolve the concerns of the VFBV. The opposition is concerned that this bill will only serve to extend the conflict between the volunteers and the CFA.  If the government's legislation is passed before the agreement is submitted to the Fair Work Commission for approval-having been agreed between the CFA and its employees-then the Fair Work Commission must consider whether any term of the agreement is an 'objectionable emergency management term'. In doing so, the Fair Work Commission will hear from the CFA, the United Firefighters Union, any other employee bargaining representatives, and Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria. As an aside, the Fair Work Commission already has an unlimited discretion to hear from organisations like Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria in proceedings under section 590 of the Fair Work Act. It is of grave concern to the opposition that this government is preparing to throw one of the fundamental principles of enterprise bargaining out the window, in order to provide standing to a stranger. What precedent does this set, beyond this matter, to allow non-parties to request automatic standing in every step of an agreement-making process in order to intervene between the parties? Having heard from the parties, the Fair Work Commission of course could determine that a term of the agreement was not an 'objectionable emergency management term'. For example, one of the terms the government considers would be objectionable under the legislation is a term related to cross-crewing. The Prime Minister claims that this clause requires union agreement, at integrated stations, to cross-crewing of fire trucks by volunteers and paid firefighters. However, the Fair Work Commission could conclude that this clause does not deal with volunteer and paid firefighters working together, and that it does not affect volunteers at all. The opposition is advised that this clause is part of the CFA's move to appliance-based staffing, and will prevent the problem of new appliances being introduced without the firefighters necessary to cover them. Our understanding of this clause is that it does not prevent new appliances being introduced which could be staffed by volunteers, and that it does not prevent volunteer and paid firefighters working together on existing appliances. Another term the government considers that the Fair Work Commission could determine to be objectionable is a term providing that 'paid firefighters can only report to another paid firefighter, with the exception of the incident controller'. However, the Fair Work Commission could conclude that this term is entirely consistent with current operating procedures for fighting fires, that it does not change the relationship between volunteers and paid firefighters, and that the clause is intended to ensure that paid firefighters are not directed by paid pen-pushers with no operational experience. The opposition understands that what occurs now is that the crew leader of the first appliance attending a fire is the incident controller and any subsequent crews that arrive are directed by their own crew leaders, but that the crew leaders of those crews are directed by the incident controller. The incident controller can be a paid firefighter or a volunteer. The appliance could be crewed by volunteer or paid firefighters, or a combination of the two. The opposition has been advised that these arrangements are not changed by the proposed clause. In fact, the Fair Work Commission might determine that no term of the proposed agreement is an objectionable emergency management term given that clause 7A of the proposed agreement specifically provides: The role of volunteers in fighting bush fires and maintaining community safety(Time expired) Debate interrupted.

Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," In this week, we have commemorated 15 years since the events of 11 September 2001-events that shocked our nation and the rest of the world. Like most Australians, I was overcome by the horrific imagery of the collapsing Twin Towers. These images would become iconic and would stigmatise the beginning of the 21st century. 9/11 and the ensuing war on terror has had a profound impact on all our lives and our sense of security. I want to begin by commending the tireless efforts of the men and women of emergency services and military personnel who in the wake of these atrocities risked their lives to save others. I also want to pay my respects to those who perished, their families and loved ones, who remember them and grieve for them still. In my electorate of Calwell, 9/11 had an immediate and profound effect, especially on my Muslim communities, where the perception of Australians of the Muslim faith immediately after went from ethnic migrants to religious stereotypes. In the West, 9/11 spurred a renewed interest in Islam and the Muslim world. Unfortunately, such inquisitiveness was often driven by fear, suspicion and prejudice. As a result of the ensuing decade of the war on terror, many migrants and refugees have settled into my electorate. I have had the pleasure of welcoming many Iraqis and, most recently, Syrians into our community, and I am proud that they now call Calwell home. However, it would be remiss of me not to remind this House of the role that our then government played, however small, in their plight and dispossession as Iraq descended into a quagmire of violence, instability and hate. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, the view quickly formed by what came to be known as the coalition of the willing that there could  be only one response-that of war, no other option-was genuinely countenanced. But 15 years later there is also another principle at stake here and that is uncovering the truth behind Australia's decision in 2003 to join the US-led invasion of Iraq. To not do this would be to uphold what Thucydides warned some 1,585 years ago. When referring to another protracted regional war he said: Most people, in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear. For the sake of truth, we must not do this in the case of Iraq-or any other war, for that matter. At the time, I and the Labor opposition, like many Australians, voiced our concern and objection to the then government's decision to join the invasion of Iraq. We appealed to the government to exhaust all diplomatic means, we raised our concerns about the quality of the intelligence it was relying on, we warned of the dire consequences of instability and we sought assurances of a post-conflict strategy, all to no avail. I remember, after gruelling public debates and with an imminent deadline for an invasion looming, I joined hundreds of thousands of Australians and indeed millions of people around the world in anti-war protests. We knew then that the path to peace and security was not to be served by going to war. As our concerns went unheeded, Australia joined the US and others in March of 2003 in its invasion of Iraq. We need to reassess Australia's involvement in the Iraq War, especially following the recently completed UK Iraq Inquiry, which sought to identify lessons that could be learned from the Iraq conflict. The Chilcot report confirmed the suspicions, reservations and misgivings expressed in this House by many colleagues all those years ago. In criticising both the certainty with which the evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was asserted as well as exposing the moral flaw upon which the legal justification rested, the Chilcot report affirms the merit of the decision of the then Labor opposition, led by Simon Crean, not to provide bipartisan support-a decision that was criticized severely by many at the time but one that had integrity of purpose. Another Labor leader, Arthur Calwell, in his historic speech opposing our involvement in the Vietnam War on, 4 May 1965 said, 'Our duty as representatives of the Australian people can at times outweigh the mere convenience of bipartisanship.' The decision to invade Iraq has had far reaching and dire political, humanitarian, economic, military and cultural ramifications. The subsequent displacement of more than four million Iraqis further exacerbated instability and dispossessed and dislocated millions of innocent people. The Chilcot report clearly justifies the need to have our own inquiry into the Howard government's decision to invade Iraq. (Time expired) Curtain, Sir Michael, KBE",180
Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I thank you for the call and I pose the question: how many of us here in this House ever give much thought to PNG, our former colony, our nearest neighbour, a country of now some seven million people which has an economy that is growing at about nine per cent a year? It is just a 20 minute canoe ride from our northernmost islands and, for better or for worse, history and geography means that our destiny is entwined with that of our northern neighbour. Sadly, most Australians-even Australians who regard  themselves as well informed-scarcely give PNG a second thought even though Port Moresby is probably the one capital in the world where our ambassador counts for more than the ambassador of the United States. One Australian who gave a great deal of thought and lavished a great deal of care on PNG, who changed both our country and PNG for the better, was Sir Mick Curtain, who died on Sunday in Townsville. Mick and his brothers first went to PNG back in 1966 as construction engineers. When most Australian businesses left PNG in the aftermath of independence in 1975, Mick deepened his involvement. He liked the people, he was prepared to adapt to local circumstances and he believed in PNG's future. He was the developer par excellence in a country which desperately needed development. He built roads, he built dams and he built airstrips. He did most of the work for the LNG project that has transformed PNG's economy and, most recently, he built Port Moresby's new port at Motukea. For at least two decades he has been PNG's biggest builder, and he certainly has helped to transform the country. As those of us who have been to PNG know, there are many social problems. It is one of the reasons my government redeployed Australian Federal Police to Port Moresby. It is nevertheless a vastly more sophisticated place than it was 30 years ago, and Mick Curtain was one of the people who helped to bring that about. He was not someone who sought comfort. He did not seek fame. He certainly never sought a rich man's lifestyle. He sought to make a difference in the country of his birth and in the country of his adoption, and he did that abundantly. We need more Australians with Mick Curtain's sense of adventure, with his sense of calling and in particular with his interest in the peoples and islands of the South Pacific. This is the one region of the world where Australia has unique standing and an unrivalled capacity to make a difference, and we neglect it at our peril. I noticed today that Mike Smith, the respected former boss of ANZ, was calling on Australian businesspeople not to be scared of getting involved in Asia. Forty years ago, Mick Curtain was not scared of getting involved in an even more challenging market, the market of PNG. He has stayed there for all this time and has made a magnificent difference to that country. I am pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister and I had the chance to pay our respects to Mick in Townsville a few weeks ago. I am pleased that this parliament has now paused for a few moments to acknowledge a shrewd businessman and a real pioneer who helped to build two nations and who is no longer with us. I offer my condolences and, I am sure, the condolences of this parliament to Lady Jennifer and the Curtain family. Holt Electorate: Crime",181
Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to raise an issue that I raised during the federal election campaign, one that I note the member for La Trobe, who is in the chamber, has mentioned more recently. It relates to a spate of home invasions, carjackings and gang related activity. For me, this journey started a long time ago with regular briefings, as the member for La Trobe would know, by the police about local issues of the day. I increasingly started hearing stories about carjackings, then predominantly in the Berwick area. But really the issue was driven home to me when I was door-knocking during the 2016 federal election and I  doorknocked a home in Cranbourne East. It was a Sunday morning, so when the person did not answer the door I was not surprised, given that it was the start of a federal election campaign-a very long federal election campaign, as you would know, Mr Speaker. Just as my adviser and I were about to turn away from the door, a woman came out of the house. She had recognised who I was, and she apologised profusely that she had not answered the door. The reason she did not answer the door is the key to a big issue in our region. The woman did not answer the door because she was terrified, given the spate of home invasions, that the person knocking on the door was one of those people. That is the level of fear in elements of the community as a consequence of the activity that is occurring in our region. As the member for La Trobe would know, I then became aware of story after story in our region about what is happening, and it is deeply disturbing. As an example, a family in Hampton Park who were raising funds for the Reach Foundation-apropos of nothing, right at the end of a phone conversation where we were assisting the good people of Hampton Park in a noble cause-mentioned that one of their sons, whom I had actually given a community spirit award to on Australia Day, had been attacked 12 months earlier by someone they had identified as a member of the Apex gang. As I said, I heard story after story as I searched for people who had been subjected to attack and home invasion. I am aware that Victoria Police are doing a lot of work on this issue through Operation Cosmas, which is a statewide crackdown on violent crime to keep Victorians safe. Officers have made over 130 arrests since the operation commenced. Specifically, they have carried out raids in Dandenong, Berwick, Narre Warren and Cranbourne to bring certain individuals and members of the Apex gang to account. Despite the best efforts of Victoria Police, however, I have been constantly informed of new instances of these sorts of crimes over recent months. In one instance, on 2 June, vandals went on a 12car wrecking spree, smashing windscreens and carving 'Apex' into car panels in Hallam and Narre Warren. On 3 July 2016 a Highview Avenue family were shaken by a terrifying home invasion. There are numerous accounts I could read into the Hansard but I am running short of time. On 26 June 2016 I conducted a community safety forum at the Narre Warren Bowls Club to discuss with local residents their concerns and find ways to improve community safety. I would particularly like to thank Victoria Police, members of the local Indian Malayali community and those members of the community who, despite their distress, shared their personal experiences of crime. We heard from family after family about ongoing issues following attacks, including problems with insurance and not getting their cars replaced after car thefts as well as the ongoing trauma that family members experienced. One of the difficulties we have in an outer suburban growth belt is that we do not have enough police. According to the Police Association, the desired ratio is one police officer for 981 people. The current ratio in Casey is one police officer to every 1,873 people, so there is a massive underresourcing of police officers that has to be addressed. I will continue to speak about this issue in the House but, as the member for La Trobe knows, I will continue to work with all elements of the community until we can alleviate the terrible concern in the community about home invasions, carjackings and assaults.  Cosmetics Testing on Animals",182
Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT," I would also like to congratulate the member for Holt for his passion for helping out his local residents. In La Trobe, we experience the same issues such as carjackings, police cars being rammed and home invasions. Obviously, a lot of work needs to be done. Tonight I would like to talk about the end of cosmetic testing on animals in Australia. Australians do not want to see animals hurt unnecessarily, and those who know me will understand that I have a great compassion for those creatures that cannot speak for themselves. Consistently through my years representing the electorate of La Trobe, I have heard from my constituency-from good people such as Caroline Sugden from The Bluey & Alice Bunny Refuge in Cockatoo, who are passionate about protecting animals-that they do not support the testing of cosmetics on animals. That is why during the 2016 election campaign, I am very proud to say, the coalition committed to implement a ban from 1 July 2017 on the testing of new cosmetic products on animals in Australia, the use of new cosmetic ingredients that have been tested on animals in Australia and the sale of new cosmetic products and ingredients that would rely on testing on animals outside Australia-so that would be banning the importation. In implementing the announced ban, the approach will need to ensure that it is consistent with Australia's international obligations, laws and regulatory framework, and results in a regulatory environment that continues to protect public health and the environment. At this point I would like to thank the Minister Fiona Nash, Assistant Minister Ken Wyatt, and Assistant Minister David Gillespie and their staff, for the work they have done. I thank also, Senator Anne Ruston who led the charge on this issue and Senator Michaela Cash. I would also like to acknowledge the other groups I have worked with: Be Cruelty-Free Australia, Hannah Stuart; and the Animal Justice Party's Bruce Poon, Leah Folloni, who was the AJP candidate for La Trobe, and Naree, who has been their adviser on the issue-we worked very closely together. The testing of ingredients of cosmetics, like mascara and shampoos, on living creatures is completely unnecessary and cruel, which is why I am here talking about this today. Australia's regulatory framework for cosmetic ingredients is administered by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, otherwise known as NICNAS. It does not require any cosmetic products to be tested on animals and considers animal test data only if they are provided by a company introducing a new chemical into Australia. NICNAS does not insist that such data be generated. This is why it is often claimed that animal testing of cosmetic products and ingredients is not undertaken in Australia. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant, because new ingredients used in Australia can be tested on animals elsewhere, even if not tested on animals in Australia. The only way to guarantee that such animal testing will never happen in Australia, or indeed increase in the future, is to introduce a clear and robust ban. Without a legal ban there is nothing to prevent cosmetic testing on animals taking place in Australia or overseas during the development of products sold in our shops. The coalition is working on banning the import and sale of all cosmetic products tested on animals. This means that from the point of legislation being enforced, cosmetics that are tested on animals, whether abroad or in Australia, will no longer be able to be imported and sold in Australia. This is our way of disengaging with the shrinking sector of the global cosmetics industry that still participates in testing on animals and demonstrating in a very  tangible way that we will not support the industry. This means that Australia will be joining the ranks of 30 other nations including the European Union, India, Israel and Norway. Hopefully, we will be encouraging many other nations to join us on this stand. A few years ago, I joined Humane Research Australia's Be-Cruelty Free campaign and pledged myself on social media to be cruelty free. I look forward to bringing Australia, and indeed the rest of the world, with me on this pledge. Finally, I would like to thank the Prime Minister's office, in particular, Cindy Barry, for her great work on this. It will be a great day when this legislation is introduced. Thank you. Hindmarsh Electorate: Safer Communities Fund",184
Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," I am very proud to represent a wonderful and diverse electorate-as most of us do in this place-and that is the electorate of Hindmarsh which stretches from Adelaide's beachside suburbs to the inner-city western suburbs. It is filled with fantastic community groups, businesses, organisations and a whole bunch of groups that create vibrancy and a real sense of community. I am pleased to be talking today about three such organisations in my electorate that will receive a much needed boost to make their work more effective and the people they serve to feel safer. The three groups are the South Australian Amateur Football League, the West Adelaide Football Club-one of the greatest football clubs in the world and the club that I have supported my entire life, and will do until the day I die-and the City of Holdfast Bay. The Safer Communities Fund is designed to help local governments, schools, and community organisations such as the ones I just named, address security concerns in and around their facilities. The South Australian Amateur Football League will receive $15,000 to install security sensor lighting. The South Australian Amateur Football League, now referred to as the Channel 9 Adelaide Football League, was formed on 8 March 1911 and its first match was played on 6 May that year. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the CEO, John Kernahan, and the public relations person, Dee Shephard, who do a great deal of work in the community. During the election campaign, together with the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, we pledged that if we were elected, we would invest $6.6 million to upgrade and modernise the league's facilities at Thebarton Oval, also known as Audi Arena. Thebarton Oval has been a key part of sporting and community events in the western suburbs for many years. An estimated 11,000 South Australian Amateur Football League players, representing 77 clubs around the Adelaide metro area, are involved in the league and use these facilities. They include 500 female participants and players, as well as players from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. In addition, more than 90 not-for-profit organisations currently use Thebarton Oval's facilities. My election commitment was intended to boost the stadium's capacity to cater for sporting events and community events. The upgrades would have included a fourth change room facility, a new hospitality area and a new function room. In addition, the upgrades to the facilities would help make the South Australian Amateur Football League more selfsufficient. I mentioned the West Adelaide Football Club earlier. They will also receive a grant of $15,000 from the Safer Communities Fund to upgrade lighting and CCTV facilities. I must  admit that I did serve on their board for the last three years. While I was on their board we won a premiership-I do not put that down to me-but this year, unfortunately, we have won the wooden spoon. I am hoping for better things next year for the West Adelaide Football Club and certainly a much better year than we have had this year. They are an important sporting club in the western suburbs. They are a great community club. They have served the western suburbs for many years. Their headquarters are located on Milner Road, Richmond. As I said earlier, West Adelaide has a long and proud history. It was established in 1892 with the wonderful red and black colours. Many people will see me wearing their guernsey when I go for a walk in the mornings. Five years later it joined the SANFL. It has become a very successful football club not only in the sporting arena but also in the social space. I commend the club's strong commitment to giving back to the community. It has a range of youth engagement programs and many other activities where the community fits into the football club-sporting events and a whole range of things. It will have upgraded lighting and CCTV to help the club achieve its objectives. Finally, Holdfast Bay, which is a council in my electorate that covers the beautiful suburbs of Glenelg, Somerton Park and Brighton, will receive $60,000 to implement a crime prevention project at Partridge House. Partridge House is one of the oldest buildings in Glenelg. It is a beautiful old turn-of-the-century building. The historic building is set amongst stunning gardens and grounds. It will receive this grant to implement a prevention through environmental design program around Partridge House. CPTED is a set of guidelines that can be implemented to enhance the urban environment through designs that reduce opportunities for crime. (Time expired) Vietnam",185
Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, at the outset I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your re-election, or elevation once again, to the high office of Speaker and to commend you on the way in which you have conducted this chamber. Having been here for 25 years, I am not making a partisan comment now, because I would say it about any Speaker who I thought was doing a very good job. You have been doing a very good job as Speaker of this House. I congratulate you in that role. It is great to see an electoral neighbour in the chair in this place. Australians recently observed the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. The heroic efforts of several young Australian servicemen in that engagement were recognised with the upgrade of their military honours. This is entirely appropriate. Indeed, the whole history of the way in which we have treated Vietnam veterans leaves much to be desired. They returned home to Australia to a great deal of animosity. I know many Vietnam veterans, as I am sure all members of this place do, and I suspect that that has contributed to some of the ongoing health problems that many of those Vietnam veterans have had. It is timely also to draw parliament's attention to two other engagements during the Vietnam War-actions in which young Australians again fought with great valour but whose heroism it could be argued has been undervalued. During the Tet Offensive of late January 1968 the South Vietnamese province of Phuoc Tuy, the defence of which was the responsibility of Australian troops, came under sudden attack and its capital, the town of Ba Ria, was occupied by the enemy. As part of efforts to retake Ba Ria, 2 Platoon, A Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, was tasked with locating and rescuing three  American advisers besieged in the town. With great initiative and determination and under the calm leadership of Second Lieutenant Peter Fraser, 2nd Platoon rescued the three Americans and inflicted heavy losses on a numerically superior enemy. In a subsequent action on 19 October 1968 Lieutenant Fraser again exhibited exemplary leadership and remarkable coolness under fire. During what was known as Operation Capital his platoon successfully resisted a battalion sized force, with Lieutenant Fraser directing artillery and helicopter fire and forcing the enemy to withdraw. Some of those who served with Lieutenant Fraser now reside in my electorate of Menzies. To this day many of those who served with Lieutenant Fraser consider him and his leadership during the Vietnam conflict to have been undervalued. He was twice nominated for the Military Cross, but this award was never made and he was merely mentioned in dispatches, possibly owing to the quota system that was then in place. This is a decision which disappoints many of his comrades to this day. They believe that Lieutenant Fraser should now be awarded the current equivalent of the Military Cross, the Medal for Gallantry. These men have, therefore, fought a new battle, a long and tenacious one, to see what they consider is an injustice overturned and Lieutenant Peter Fraser's military service properly acknowledged. To date they have not been successful. And while their numbers are now dwindling, given the time since the Vietnam War, those who remain with us still fight on for what they see as a very just cause. The submissions of numerous witnesses, notably those who served under Lieutenant Fraser as well as his superior officers, all attest to his exemplary leadership, extraordinary personal courage and unflagging good humour. Significantly, the Americans fully appreciate the valour of 2nd Platoon, with one member of the platoon awarded the Silver Star and some members of the platoon recently meeting with US Vice President Joe Biden when he visited us here in Australia. I think this is a just cause which should be re-examined by the appropriate authorities, but in the meantime I simply wish to assure the veterans of 2nd Platoon, A Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, that, despite their ongoing disappointment about this matter, a grateful nation, Australia, does remember their bravery and, in particular, that of Second Lieutenant Peter Fraser.

Ms CLAYDON,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I want to draw the House's attention to an important community event that took place in my electorate of Newcastle-the One Thousand People, One Voice Standing Against Domestic Violence event at Hunter Stadium. This event was organised by The Sista Code, a coalition of Novocastrians working to empower women in the community and support local groups who work tirelessly providing frontline services for women and children escaping domestic and family violence. Family violence is still tragically far too common across Australia. One in three women over the age of 15 have experienced physical violence, while one in six have experienced physical or sexual violence from a current or former partner. Staggeringly, only 20 per cent of Australian women who experience partner violence report it to the police. These statistics reflect a problem that has reached epidemic proportions-an epidemic exacerbated by the Liberal government's ongoing cuts to vital frontline services. Across Australia the provision of safe and secure housing for those fleeing family violence is particularly acute. In Newcastle, over half of the women showing up to shelters each night must be turned away due to a lack of beds-and those turned away then run the very real risk of being placed in unsuitable or unsafe 'temporary' housing. We know that it is when women and children first leave violent and destructive relationships that they are most vulnerable, so it is absolutely vital that there be safe, secure and supportive accommodation places for them to go. In Newcastle, that means we need more organisations like Jenny's Place, which plays an invaluable role supporting women with crisis accommodation and providing a range of important wrap-around services to help break the cycle of violence. Regrettably, the successful Jenny's Place model is not always replicated. Recent reports of women in Newcastle being housed in accommodation set up for newly released male prisoners and homeless men-some of whom may in fact be perpetrators of violence themselves-are especially distressing. This situation has at times been found to be so unsafe that women have chosen to return to their abusive partners, in a house that is at least familiar, rather than place themselves at increased risk in strange circumstances that fail to provide the safety, security and support they require. Unfortunately this situation is becoming all too common for vulnerable women and children in Newcastle. How is it that we could have state government departments directing women and children to emergency accommodation facilities that are completely inappropriate and in some cases unsafe? This is not a problem peculiar to Newcastle and New South Wales. Given that more than a third of people who access specialist homelessness services are seeking assistance due to domestic and family violence, it is well and truly time to start a national conversation about national standards for these services. We cannot expect women to leave abusive relationships if they do not have somewhere safe to go to. (Time expired)  Flynn Electorate: Economy Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (10:03): While the nation's economy continues to grow strongly, many in Central Queensland are doing it tough. Since the completion of many construction projects in the gas and coal industries across the Bowen Basin, we are coming off a high and moving towards a very low low. Many find themselves without work. They still owe money on homes, motor vehicles, boats et cetera bought when the good times were there. Rents have plummeted, and many houses and units are empty across Central Queensland. Businesses in the cities and towns have felt the brunt of this, as households with uncertain futures withhold discretionary spending. That has led to the current plight of many small retailers. This can have a devastating flow-on effect as businesses are unable to employ some staff or even have to close their doors for the first time in many years. These communities need jobs and training for their survival. I am proud to be part of a coalition government committed to delivering projects and economic outcomes the communities in Flynn really need-communities like Blackwater, Gladstone, Emerald, Tieri, Biloela, Springsure and Capella. They all face the same situation. We are planning to do this for a number of vital projects that promise to drive employment in these most affected areas. A $30 million Bowen Basin package was announced by Minister Nash during the last couple of months. With this we hope to modify and improve the operations in the coalfields and beyond, driving employment in this highly variable jobs market. The $10 million for CQUniversity's Gladstone Marina campus upgrade will see state of-the-art training facilities in the port, bringing trade skills and tertiary engineering students together for an exciting Australian-first project. One of the most important things government can do is fertilise the economy. Employment opportunities in CQ always improve when coal prices rise, and I was pleased to see the coal price go up in the last couple of months. Our coal prices are nudging $70 a tonne for thermal coal, and coking coal, which is used, of course, in steel manufacture has risen to $150 a tonne. This could not be the case had Labor introduced a carbon tax. By cutting small business tax we are also allowing business the freedom to employ extra people, an opportunity they simply could not achieve previously. Our water projects in the North Burnett and South Burnett will certainly aid and assist our agriculture industries. By opening new trade agreements we are giving our producers and manufacturers a fighting chance to compete on the world stage, and we must consider ourselves- (Time expired) Perth Electorate: Infrastructure",191
Mr HAMMOND,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In my home state of Western Australia it is the Labor Party that has a proven track record in relation to properly investing in road and rail infrastructure. One does not need to look any further than the Perth Gateway WA project, the Perth City Link, the Perth to Mandurah railway or the expansion of the Great Eastern Highway. The reasons why it is so important to properly invest in infrastructure are manifestly clear: to reduce congestion and to give families more time to spend at home with their loved ones instead of being stuck in traffic. Also, importantly, properly investing in infrastructure creates jobs.  Closer to home, in my electorate of Perth, we have a unique opportunity, through proper and meaningful investment in infrastructure, to achieve transformational change to my local community of Bayswater. For those who are not aware, the town of Bayswater has a railway running straight through the middle. We have a circumstance of time where the Perth to Forrestfield rail link is being constructed, involving a significant amount of tunnelling. We have a unique opportunity to use the current capital spend involved in that project to revitalise a town centre that is in urgent need of transformational change. By capitalising on our infrastructure spend and committing to a tunnelling project which would see us sink the Bayswater train station, we would have a unique opportunity to link up both sides of this city, create vibrancy in a town centre and create diversity. It is also a unique opportunity to make use of a wonderful community environment. That was a matter that I campaigned on in the course of the federal election, to the point where it was the Australian Labor Party that committed a $1 million spend to a structural plan to make sure we make the most of this opportunity and get the investment right. It was the Labor Party, by committing $1 million in the course of the federal campaign to a proper structural plan to build upon the good work that the local government of Bayswater has already invested in this project, that recognised the need for the infrastructure spend to properly assess how we can unlock and unleash the potential of this unique community environment. By improving on the work of the state Labor Party, which is investing significantly in a transformational rail change called Metronet, we can finally make use of this wonderful town centre so that all of us can get the benefit in times to come. I can ensure my constituents in the city of Perth and in Bayswater and its surrounds that I will continue to campaign on this issue until we get the job done. Marriage  change in the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act. But that is not a new position. That is what I made clear to the pre-selectors of the Barker FEC college in 2012. It is a position I took to the 2013 election, making it quite clear that if the people of Barker wanted someone to vote in favour of a change to the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act they should vote for someone else, not me. I took the same position to the recent election in July 2016. Indeed, it was our party policy. Our party policy also was for that decision to be put to the Australian people by way of a plebiscite. So my position has been clear for a very long time, and the position of our party has been clear since a marathon party room meeting some 12 months ago-that is, there will not be a change to the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act unless there is a plebiscite conducted nationally that supports a change. I am here, this morning, to say to the electors of Barker-and, indeed, the nation-that there is one person standing in the way of change, if change is what you seek. That person is the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. If you are an elector in Barker or, indeed, if you are an elector anywhere in the nation and you want to effect change-albeit my position is that no change is necessary-then you need to contact the Leader of the Opposition, because what the Leader of the Opposition wants on this is 226 politicians, here in Canberra, to decide this question. I do not want that. What I want is 24 million Australians to determine this  question. That is not a novel idea. It is an idea we took to the election. It is an idea on which we have a mandate. What the Leader of the Opposition wants us to do, effectively, as our first act of government is to break that promise, break that commitment. I am here to say to my constituency: I have been consistent on this. You know I do not support change. If you support change, if change is what you seek, the person preventing you from having your say is the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. You should contact him and make it clear that you want to have your say. Tasmania: Fish Farming",192
Mr WILKIE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Fish farming has become a divisive issue in my home state of Tasmania. In the past few months I have been contacted by a number of people concerned with the proliferation of the salmon industry and, in particular, Tassal's proposal to produce widespread salmon farming at Okehampton Bay on Tasmania's east coast. I need to be perfectly clear that I do love to eat salmon and I well understand the importance to the economy of the salmon industry. I am certainly not arguing, here, to shut it down. What I am doing, however, is calling for a moratorium on any further fish farm development anywhere in Tasmanian waters until we better understand the environmental aspects of it all much better and can have greater confidence in the regulatory regime covering it. We know that fish farming creates all sorts of marine pollution, not least because of the chemicals and feed pumped into the water as well as the effluent produced from the fish. Of course, this has a detrimental effect on water quality and it reduces oxygen levels in the surrounding waters. Even the original leaseholder at Okehampton Bay has come out in recent weeks and said that the area is, indeed, no good for salmon farming anymore. Frankly, there can be no doubt that anything less than world's best practice fish farming is unacceptably bad for the environment. That puts at risk not only our marine and bird life but also our clean waters and beaches. It jeopardises our tourism industry as well as our recreational and commercial fisheries. How crazy is that? We would, potentially, put one industry ahead of just about all else that makes Tasmania so very special. Of course, the unease with fish farming in Tasmania has all the more substance because of the history of the forestry industry in the state and the way in which that industry was fawned over by countless Labor and Liberal politicians while some of the world's most precious natural environments were literally bulldozed. No wonder so many Tasmanians are cynical about the next big thing, and all the promises that accompany it. What is needed now is really quite simple, and that is to stop any expansion of the industry until the very best minds do the research and determine the right way forward, a way that genuinely satisfies the triple-bottom-line criteria so that, yes, the fish farms are financially viable, but also that they meet the most stringent social and environmental criteria. The Tasmanian government also needs to establish the very best regulatory framework, one that can win the complete confidence of the community. That is what is needed. That is what will the industry on a genuinely sustainable footing and ensure that Tasmania continues to supply the country, and indeed the world, with the very best produce.  Gilmore Electorate: St Vincent de Paul Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (10:15): The generosity of local residents is combining with the federal government's Work for the Dole program and helping Vinnies go global. Who would have thought that such humble beginnings can make a real difference to so many, not just local residents but also people in other countries. On Thursday I visited our local St Vincent de Paul warehouse, which was opened earlier this year. They had outgrown their existing premises and, judging by this new one, they may need to expand again. I am regularly told by people, including Red Cross collection coordinators and the Salvation Army Red Shield team, how the Shoalhaven gives more per capita than any other area. As a consequence, I have always been exceptionally proud of the amazing generosity of our Gilmore residents. On this visit I had that pride further justified. Our local generosity is helping many families in and around Gilmore, as Vinnies have a number of retail stores. Not only do they sell clothing and all sorts of bric-a-brac but the incredible level of giving is benefiting people in impoverished international communities. The South Nowra collection centre, which is sorting, all the goods is full to the brim. St Vincent de Paul regional centre manager, Rod Douglas, said people in the Shoalhaven donated much more than the people in neighbouring areas. Seriously, I am not surprised by that information, but as we toured the warehouse I was very surprised at the extent of the destinations for the donated goods. Not only that, but the 360 volunteers, many of whom are Work for the Dole participants, have a life changing experience as they are putting in their time at Vinnies. Rod Douglas does not discriminate as to the different motives for the volunteers. They are all part of the Vinnies. Collectively, these volunteers are contributing more than 3,500 volunteer hours each week. Rod also told me how much he appreciates the Work for the Dole scheme, as the work would be impossible without it. He added that many people who started working with Vinnies under Work for the Dole continued volunteering after their placements ended, because they felt like they belonged. That was certainly evident on the day. The huge volume of clothing and other donated items are sorted in the warehouse, but this is where the surprise really begins. The best quality items are kept for the local stores and yet 16 to 18 tonnes of clothing is sent overseas in a 40-foot container every week during the warm months and fortnightly during winter. That clothing is sent to a range of organisations, including World Vision and Oxfam, to help people in need all over the world in refugee areas and disaster areas, they being the priority. Cutlery, crockery, cookware and other assorted bric-a-brac that is excess to needs is also sent overseas. The prepared pallet I saw that day was ready to go to Africa. One hundred and eighty brand-new computer desks were being sent to schools in Fiji to replace those lost to cyclone damage. The beauty of what is occurring at Vinnies is that those extra donations are changing lives all over the world. (Time expired) Blair Electorate: Ipswich Community Youth Service",194
Mr NEUMANN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I want to highlight the wonderful work of a not-for-profit organisation in my electorate of Blair: the Ipswich Community Youth Service. This organisation, better known as ICYS, is an organisation dedicated to supporting at-risk children and young people, and their families, in the Ipswich region. Its recent expansion into the Somerset region has been warmly welcomed.  This organisation, by 'empowering tomorrow's decisions'-that is their motto-assists young people to reach their full potential. The organisation is uniquely local and is involved in and dedicated to the local community and particularly young people in the western corridor. It is an organisation that has withstood the harsh cuts of the heartless former coalition government in Queensland led by Campbell Newman. It continues to thrive, thanks to the dedication, hard work and commitment of its board, staff and volunteers-in particular, Amanda Margerison, the ICYS Service Manager who has led this dynamic team through good times, then tough times and now good times again. Thanks to Amanda and her team, this organisation is a community fixture that has been for decades beloved by young people and their families who have benefitted from its programs, along with many local schools who host its programs and services. I was pleased last Friday to sit at the table of this organisation at the Ipswich Region Child Protection Week Awards dinner and see the support and respect for the organisation shown by other providers in the region. I had the honour of speaking at the opening of the Lowood Youth Hub, run by ICYS and made possible with federal government funding. I was pleased to support the Ipswich Community Youth Service's application for federal funding and to see it through. Although a number of programs operated at the hub are done with the support of Queensland government funding, it has the support of the Ipswich City Council and the Somerset Regional Council. Lowood is a small town in the rural parts of my electorate in the Somerset region. It is an old heritage township surrounded by rural and agricultural land. It is home to workers, battlers, old miners, meatworkers, small business operators and, of course, farmers. Like in many Australian regional towns, life can be challenging for young people, particularly in finding employment. Job opportunities are few and public transport is minimal. This organisation has made a particular point of collaborating with the council and a host of other local organisations, including the community-run Bendigo Bank. Through the hub young people can become more engaged in their community, access support and participate in training and programs, and I was pleased to see the number of young people there at the opening of the hub. Young people can improve their life skills and be provided with opportunities many city kids in urban areas take for granted. Congratulations to Ipswich Community Youth Service for their support. The hub will help not just the people of Somerset but also those in the neighbouring Lockyer Valley. Grey Electorate: Strzelecki Track",195
Mr RAMSEY,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I want to speak today about the Strzelecki Track, around 450 kilometres of outback track connecting Lyndhurst, at the northern tip of the Flinders Ranges, and near the extent of the bitumen road network leading to the Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks, both of which lead to South-East Queensland. Historically the routes were opened up to service the cattle industry, bringing stock to the railhead on the Ghan railway. In later years both tracks have become popular tourist drives, but the Strz stands alone over the last 50 years because it has been the main service route to supply the Moomba gas fields, one of South Australia's greatest economic assets. While 10 years ago it was thought that the Cooper Basin had passed its half-life, the advent of modern drilling and the ability to exploit 'tight gas' now means it is likely we have not gone much past the 15 per cent point. The best is yet to come.  However, there is one important proviso here: the Strz is as rough as guts, and the 400 km from Lyndhurst to Moomba can take more than 12 hours in a road train. The road inflicts a very heavy and expensive toll on equipment. In recent years the Queensland bitumen road network has continued to push to the west and has reached the border at the most adjacent point to Moomba, near Innamincka. The issue here for South Australia is that although the distance to Brisbane is 400 km further than Adelaide to the south, increasingly freight is taking that path simply because of the condition of the Strzelecki Track. This is an enormous risk to South Australia. Unless the Strz is bituminised, we are likely to lose many of the secondary benefits that should come to our state, not just as a right of access but because it should be the lowest cost access and thus lead to extra production, lower costs and consequently more local gas leading to more competitive electricity and industrial production. That must flow to SA; we cannot let these opportunities pass us by. The Strzelecki Track is of course a state asset and as such it is essential that the state government be heavily engaged in bringing about this outcome. I have been having ongoing discussions with Santos on this issue, as well as with a private equity group and some of the nation's largest infrastructure contractors. I have a meeting scheduled with the South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, in early October and am hoping to raise his interest in the project. I have already had a phone conversation with him. I am really looking to build a partnership between the federal and state governments on this issue. The federal government does not initially have prime responsibility; it is not one of the AusLink road network roads, but I think we need to bring all parties together and bring about the right outcome for South Australia. Whitlam Electorate Medicare Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (10:25): This is my first opportunity in this place to thank the people of Whitlam, who have generously returned me to this parliament to the third time. It is a great honour. I would like to think the reason that they have done that is in part that I stand up for the issues which are of concern to them. The people of Whitlam are concerned about the future of manufacturing in this country, particularly the future of the BlueScope Steel works. It has gone through some challenges. We have pushed hard to get the right policy settings in place to ensure that we continue to make steel there for many, many years to come. The people of Whitlam are concerned about school education and university education. I fought for Gonski school education funding. I fought against the proposition to introduce $100,000 university degrees. And of course I fought strongly to defend and protect and improve Medicare. The people of Whitlam deserve better than a government which is launching repeated attacks on our healthcare system. The coalition's Medicare rebate freeze, which is a back-door GP tax, has been extended all the way out to 2020. This means that GPs face an impossible choice: charge patients more or go bust. In my own electorate of Whitlam and in the neighbouring seat of Gilmore-and I am pleased to see the member for Gilmore is here today-general practices are being forced to end bulk-billing. The first time that many constituents hear of this is when they turn up to  their doctor's surgery and see a sign in the window or on the front counter. I was ejected from parliament the other week for holding up this sign",196
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"I remind the member about the use of props. Mr STEPHEN JONES: And you are right to remind me. I will not hold up this sign here, which is a similar message that was provided to all of the people who are patients at the Bowral Street Medical Practice in my electorate of Whitlam; or this sign here, which is a sign that was on the front door of Walker Street General Practice, again advising constituents that their practice would no longer be bulk-billing. The reason they cite is the government's changes and, in particular, the GP rebate freeze, otherwise known as a GP tax. So, when each and every government frontbencher stands up in this place and protests about Labor's campaign, in order to point out the truth about the impact of the government's GP tax on our constituents I will go to any lengths necessary to ensure that these signs and signs like them are brought to the attention of the Australian people. It is simply not right or fair- (Time expired) Western Australia: Mining",198
Ms PRICE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I have resisted speaking about Brendon Grylls's proposed additional tax of $5 per tonne on BHP and Rio Tinto, and the reason why I have resisted is that, like many other commentators, I view it as nothing more than a thought bubble or perhaps just another media stunt-more attention seeking. Of course, those who know more about these things will tell you that, even if it was possible to tax these two large iron ore companies, there is no doubt that it would get caught up in the Grants Commission model, and the fact is that WA would not receive this extra revenue in any event. I am talking about it now because I am starting to feel gravely concerned for the people who live in the Pilbara, the people who are employed by BHP and Rio. Let's face it; there have been a number of job losses in the Pilbara, and people are concerned about their jobs. They see this as just another axe hanging over their heads. It is for that reason that I now feel compelled to talk about this, given that both of those big companies are in my electorate of Durack. I commend to the House an opinion piece by Reg Howard-Smith, who is Chief Executive of the CME of Western Australia. I will take a few quotes from that article, which appeared in the Financial Review today. He talks about Brendon Grylls' new tax of $5 and says: His new tax would make WA the world's highest taxing iron ore jurisdiction-three times larger than Brazil, our biggest competitor. Like any business which faces increasing costs, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto will be forced to further reduce their overheads to offset the new cost as proposed by Grylls. It will directly result in less employment and impact on the 845 WA businesses currently supplying goods and services to these two companies. These are the same businesses that supplied $10.9 billion worth of goods and services in 2014/2015. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto also provided $3.4 billion in iron ore royalty payments, including mining lease rentals, in 2014/2015 to Western Australia. Mr HOWARD - Smith goes on further to say: If Grylls was successful, Australia would become the highest taxed country in the world, giving a distinct competitive advantage to our global competitors.  I agree. He goes on: Grylls might have you believe his way is the only way forward-clearly, he has had doubts about a mining tax before. This is a reference to the resource super profits tax, which Grylls was opposed to. He continues: The only difference now is he is looking for votes ahead of a state election in six months' time. I could not have said it better.",198
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"I understand it is the wish of members that constituency statements continue for a further 30 minutes. There being no objection, the chair will allow statements to continue. Indonesia",199
Mr WATTS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Recent research commissioned by the AustraliaIndonesia Centre highlights that Australian attitudes towards Indonesia are at best complacent and all too often ignorant. Few Australians grasp the importance of Indonesia to our nation, or the scale of economic opportunity. We do more trade with New Zealand, a country of a mere four million people, than we do with our northern neighbour Indonesia, a nation of more than 250 million. Indonesia's economy is projected to more than double by 2030, yet the number of Australian businesses with a presence in Indonesia has shrunk from 450 to a paltry 250 over the previous decade. Outdated stereotypes about Indonesia and its people abound in our nation. I quote former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, when addressing this place in 2010: â¦ the most persistent problem in our relations is the persistence of age-old stereotypes-misleading, simplistic mental caricature that depicts the other side in a bad light. Even in the age of cable television and internet, there are Australians who still see Indonesia as an authoritarian country, as a military dictatorship, as a hotbed of Islamic extremism or even as an expansionist power. On the other hand, in Indonesia there are people who remain afflicted with Australiaphobia-those who believe that the notion of White Australia still persists, that Australia harbours ill intention toward Indonesia â¦ Countering these perceptions is too important to be left to diplomats alone. Track 1.5 or track 2 diplomacy initiatives that bring non-official academics, religious activists, NGO leaders and civil society experts together are crucially important. Last week, along with 29 other delegates, I attended the Conference of Australian and Indonesian Youth in Bali. CAUSINDY, as it has become known, is a track 2 diplomacy initiative that brings together young leaders from all sectors in Australian and Indonesia. CAUSINDY was founded in 2010 by Bede Moore, Karina Akib and Chris Urbanski with the objectives of creating a platform for discussion and shaping new ideas about the AustraliaIndonesia relationship. This year's program focused on building a more sustainable and resilient bilateral relationship between our two countries, and I am pleased to report that it was supported by the Northern Territory government. I know that the member for Solomon has a strong interest in this matter. As conference delegates heard, the relative lack of person-to-person connections is a major obstacle to expanding trade and investment between our nations.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work of CAUSINDY and their executive team of Tim Graham, Edgar Myer, Alyssia Sastrosatomo and Natasha Burrows. I also acknowledge the conference team for developing such a strong conference program and for their wonderful hospitality. To Feliciana Natali Wienathan, Jarrah Sastrawan, Samantha Yap, Tim Cooke, Sekar Langit, Yohendro Kliwandono, Andrew Akib, David Scholefield, Gabriel Mukuan: thank you all for your hard work. Australia needs to learn that it needs Indonesia more than Indonesia needs us. Other countries are realising its potential, and Indonesia has no shortage of suitors for greater defence, diplomatic and trade collaboration. Australia needs to wake up and grab the opportunity in its own backyard. CAUSINDY is a great starting point for us to connect young leaders and exchange ideas and perspectives, as well as to creatively think about how we can strengthen Australia-Indonesia relations. Telecommunications",199
Mr LITTLEPROUD,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Last night I was fortunate enough to present my maiden speech to parliament. During that speech, I talked about the importance of connectivity to an electorate of my size and the regional nature of it-a lot like yours, Deputy Speaker. I want to congratulate the ACCC on their recent announcement of an inquiry into national roaming for our mobile phones. I am calling now on our telcos to show some leadership and to actually come to the party and come to the table and negotiate a commercially viable option rather than being forced by the ACCC. Telcos can now offer their customers the opportunity to go overseas and provide international roaming for only a few dollars a month, so they can surely come to the table and negotiate amongst themselves a commercial option to be able to provide national roaming for people in regional Australia. I am not asking them to actually sell the family jewels. I appreciate that they have made significant investments in infrastructure. So too has this government. We have made a $220 million commitment to the mobile phone Black Spot Program-something that would not have happened unless this coalition government put it in place. We take telecommunications in regional Australia very seriously. It will be the key infrastructure of the 21st century that will deliver the infrastructure to allow people in regional Australia to become part of a global economy. I am asking these telcos to come to the party and negotiate a number that will give them a return. I am not asking them to do it for nothing; I am asking them to do it on a commercially viable option. I understand Telstra's reluctance to do this. I understand there is a competitive disadvantage for them, but the competitive advantage to each and every customer across regional Australia far outweighs that. Couple that with the opportunity that could also exist with the introduction of the NBN in fixed wireless services. This could actually increase competition for the NBN, in the rollout of regional Australia, where we have fixed wireless services that are providing the NBN. This is a huge competitive advantage that we could give to the people of regional and rural Australia at a relatively small cost to the telcos. I ask them to show their social licence in a public way. Come together and actually put on the table a viable option for each and every person in regional Australia.  Northern Territory: Suicide Prevention",200
Mr GOSLING,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Last Saturday I participated in the Come Walk With Me suicide prevention walk in Palmerston. More than 100 people-most with a personal experience of loss-were also taking part. The walk is in its second year, and its founder, Vanessa Lowe, is a mum who is surviving the loss of her child to suicide. From her grieving heart, Vanessa addressed the crowd and said: I know many of you will totally understand when I say I am a survivor of a loved one to suicide. It is okay to say today, I am not okay. Some days are better than others. But I am always so damn sad just beneath the surface. Let us walk with pride today, showing the love that lives on for our loved ones lost. Suicide numbers are the highest ever. It is time to stop not speaking about it. Suicide needs to stop. People need to understand that the loss to a suicide leaves a ripple effect. If our loved ones understood that, they would never have left. It is time that we started to let others know the impact that suicide has on the people left behind. It is time to let them know how suicide affects others as it does in so many different ways. Things, such as the fact that my husband, Errol, and I have now been showering outside in the yard for the past two years, 24 weeks and three days. We are stuck in a house that is full of sadness-a house that my children and grandchildren don't like to visit now, because it is just too sad. For my mental health, it would probably be best that I moved, but I am trapped. It is time to make people aware that suicide only brings more sadness and much devastation. Tomorrow is another day. Things don't stay the same; things usually have a way of working out. Suicide is not the option. Also participating in last Saturday's walk were TEAMhealth, Top End NT StandBy Response Service and DRISPN, the Darwin Region Indigenous Suicide Prevention Network. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of Ngaree Ah Kit for her leadership in establishing this network-herself a survivor of a sibling lost to suicide. I also congratulate Ngaree on her recent electoral success as a new member of Karama in the NT Legislative Assembly and her new, very important position as Assistant Minister for Suicide Prevention, Mental Health and Disabilities. The new Northern Territory government has a target to have suicide by 2020, and I will be working with them to achieve that goal. Suicide has to stop and we all have a role to play. Please heed Vanessa's plea. Organ and Tissue Donation",201
Mr HAWKE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"Mitchell-Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (10:39): Early this month, on Friday 2 September was Jersey Day in Australia. The principle of Jersey Day is to raise awareness of the Organ and Tissue Authority and the DonateLife Network within Australia. Jersey Day encourages schools and workplaces across Australia to allow students and employees to wear their favourite sporting jersey to school or work to show their support for the DonateLife Network and begin the conversation with their friends and families about organ donation. I want to record that Jersey Day was founded by the Gremmo family. The Gremmo family are a well-respected and much-loved family in my electorate for their charity, community work. They own a small business of the highest ethical standard possible, and for many years they have really served our community. Tragically last year, Nathan Gremmo, 13, the son and eldest child of Michael and Kylie Gremmo from Gremmo Homes, was hit by a car crossing Glenhaven Road on his way back  from school. He of course died. In the true character of this family, Nathan's family chose to give the gift of life to others to honour the legacy of Nathan's generous personality and his warm spirit. Generous and loving to the end, Nathan Gremmo became an organ donor. His last and most amazing gift was to save the lives of six people, including five young adults and a baby. Along with state members for seats in Western Sydney Mark Taylor, Ray Williams and David Elliott, I celebrated Jersey Day this year and marked it in order to show and start that vital conversation in our communities and families to support and raise awareness of the DonateLife Network, organ donation and the Gremmo family. Many people in Australia may think that they are too old or unhealthy to be a donor, or that their religion may not support it, and that organ and tissue donation is somehow a taboo. These are common myths and misconceptions about organ donation. It is a vital conversation that we need to have in this country. At any one time of course there are about 1,500 on the organ donation recipient waiting list. In 2014, 1,117 Australians received an organ transplant as a result of the generosity of some 378 organ donors whose families agreed to a donation at the time of their loved one's death. On average, people on the transplant list are now waiting between six months and four years. Organ donation rates are unacceptably low. Complementing the significant progress that has been made in the clinical sector, Australia needs more active engagement and awareness within the community to increase Australian families' consent rate. The Australian government's national reform program includes actions to increase clinical capacity and capability, and to increase community engagement and awareness in relation to organ and tissue donation. But of course it is events like the tragic loss of life, like Nathan Gremmo's and the heroism and the capability of his family, that great unit in our society, who were so generous to have that difficult conversation on the death of their child, who then went on to save six lives. But the example that they set for so many others all around Australia to have that difficult conversation with the purpose of saving other people's lives. Turnbull Government",201
Ms COLLINS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Of course, the last elections saw the self-styled three amigos of Tasmania from the Liberal side completely wiped out in Tasmania. We have no more Liberals in Tasmania in the lower House. I can tell you that Tasmanians sent a very loud and clear message to this government and this Prime Minister that Tasmania does not want to be continually left off the map. But then again, what do we have today? We have front page headlines saying 'Tassie left off the map again'. The government's so-called Smart Cities and Suburbs program has left Tasmania off its consultations. They are going to every capital city in Australia. They are even going to Rockhampton, but they are not coming to Tasmania at all-not one single session in Tasmania. Tasmania is sick of this government and the Liberal Party leaving it off the map. You would have thought that they would have learnt from the election that Tasmanians will not continue to accept this. It is not good enough Prime Minister. It is not good enough to tell Tasmanians that: you do not care; you are not interested in them; you have no plan for Tasmania. Since he became Prime Minister, there have been 5,000 jobs lost in Tasmania under this current Prime Minister-5,000 people are no longer in work in my home state because of this government. We sent a clear message to the Prime Minister at the election; he is still not listening, and he does not want to care about Tasmania. That has become apparent.  He has not been to Tasmania since the election. He barely spent any time in Tasmania during the election or even before the election, even when he was communications minister responsible for the NBN. He came down to Tasmania, I think, for two days in the whole three years. He is just not interested in visiting my home state; he is not interested in Tasmanians; he does not appear to care what happens in Tasmania at all. His government continually makes decisions that affect Tasmania and leave Tasmanians off the map. We also had news today that the Australian Antarctic station on Macquarie Island will close. There are great concerns in the scientific community that all the funding that has been invested in Macquarie Island to remove certain rodents and animals will be wasted, because there will no longer be a presence on the island. Macquarie Island is part of my electorate. Yes, it is remote; mine is the most southern electorate in Australia. This government is continually making decisions that affect Tasmania and it just does not seem to care. It is not good enough, Prime Minister, to continually leave Tasmania off the map and to continually make decisions that affect our state without even coming down to talk to Tasmanians about it. You have no ministers at all-not one member from Tasmania on the front bench. Tasmanians are continually left off the map by this government, which appears not to be learning the lesson at all. Not to have any member or senator from Tasmania in any front-bench position, not to show any interest in Tasmania and not to have any federal government committee or organisation come down to Tasmania when they are going everywhere else-that is simply not good enough. Boothby Electorate: Surf Lifesaving",202
Ms FLINT,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," The electorate of Boothby is blessed with Adelaide's best stretch of coastline and our best three surf life saving clubs-Seacliff, Brighton and Somerton Park. The wonderful surf club members at Seacliff, Somerton and Brighton keep thousands of beach users safe each year. They teach their young club members the importance of exercise, teamwork and serving our community, and they do this in their own time, week in, week out, as volunteers. Today I am proud to congratulate the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club and President Andrew Chandler on being named the 2016 Club of the Year at the Surf Life Saving SA awards of excellence. This honour is well deserved. Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club has over 550 members, including approximately 220 juniors. More than 100 patrolling members spend many thousands of patrol hours on the beach during the season, ensuring the public enjoy a safe coastal experience. It is these patrol members who make the incredible Beach Access For All program possible. The Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club pioneered the Beach Access For All program along with my state colleague, the member for Bright David Speirs MP. Beach Access For All has enabled disability and wheelchair access on the beach. Rolling out the beach for all access mat has brought indescribable joy to individuals and families who have not been on the beach for years, if ever. I commend the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club volunteers for the effort they put into rolling out the mat each weekend throughout summer. I am proud that the Turnbull liberal government is doing everything we can to make this process easier for them and to help keep these wonderful volunteers and beach users safe. Currently the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club volunteers are operating out of a shipping  container on the beach. I worked hard to secure $150,000 to build a new surf lifesaving tower for storage to help keep our volunteers and beach users safe. It was a great honour to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs-a former South Australian of whom we are all so proud-make this announcement. I am also proud that the Seacliff, Brighton and Somerton Surf Life Saving Clubs will benefit from a grant for solar panels to help lower the skyrocketing costs of electricity in South Australia. Senator David Fawcett, a person who has dedicated his career to community service, was with me to let the clubs know this good news, which will free up their fundraising efforts for other purposes like equipment and helping those in need. Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club, for example, recently held a curry night for Coogee to raise funds for the Coogee surf club, which was badly damaged in a storm. David Speirs MP and I attended what was a great fun evening for a good cause. I congratulate President Andrew Chandler and all the members of the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club on the wonderful volunteer work they do and I look forward to working with them for the good of our community. Corio Electorate: Football",203
Mr MARLES,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," September is a fantastic time to be alive, and particularly when your football team is winning. It is fair to say that in Geelong after the events of Friday night when Geelong overcame Hawthorn, our arch nemesis, footie fever has overtaken our town and that will only be enhanced by the events of last night, as Patrick Dangerfield was announced the AFL's MVP and the winner of the Leigh Matthews award. It is a far cry from following the Geelong Football Club in the 1970s, when we would struggle along to perhaps win two or three games a year. Right now, we are undoubtedly living through our golden age. And as every day passes during this September we are watching our town being painted blue and white evermore. Other than footy, there is no other social phenomenon in Geelong, in my electorate, that so unites the community. It is a fantastic sport to watch, of course, but it absolutely is the embodiment of our community spirit. You cannot be in Geelong right now without understanding that footy deeply matters. But the Geelong Football Club is connected to a much bigger football communitycommunity football-which is played across all levels and ranks. Tom Ruggles, who is playing in the senior AFL team, was playing for the Leopold senior team just a couple of years ago. And, of course, Jimmy Bartel-a Norm Smith medallist, Brownlow medallist, 300 game player and triple premiership player-came up through the ranks playing at Bell Park. Jimmy's life is instructive because what he shows us is that footy is something that makes people better. Right now, Jimmy Bartel is engaged in a campaign against domestic violence. His full-growth beard, which is capturing attention, is his way of bringing to light this particular blight within our society and the need to do something about it. It is not just at Bell Park and it is not just great footballers like Jimmy Bartel. At North Geelong we have Jason Habib, the president of North Geelong, who has talked about a young Sudanese player called Titit Nyak. He said, 'He came to us and hadn't played a game of footy ever before-so we as a club took him under our wings.' He is now, at the age of 17, playing in the Geelong Falcons. Dale Purcell, the president of North Shore-another great club with a great pedigree-talks about the club providing father figures and guidance to kids in need.  But the footy clubs of the northern suburbs of Geelong are doing it tough. So today I want to announce that, along with John Eren, the state Minister for Sport and also the member for Lara, which covers the north of Geelong, I will be holding a forum in coming weeks with the sporting clubs of the north to work out ways in which we can encourage greater sponsorship of those clubs so that football can continue to play the role it does within our community and make people better. Groom Electorate: Infrastructure",204
Dr MCVEIGH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Earlier this week I had the great honour of delivering my maiden speech here to the House of Representatives, and I took the opportunity to talk about the many challenges and opportunities that face the people of Groom, whom I represent. These are both exciting and complex challenges. I know full well that it will require local, state and federal government levels of responsibility to work together to address these challenges and opportunities and bring them to fruition. So, as the new member for Groom, I have been particularly pleased to receive visits from a number of cabinet ministers to my electorate to discuss both these opportunities and these challenges. Josh Frydenberg, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, has visited me recently to discuss both the resources sector, which is particularly important in our part of the world, and environmental impacts of some of the proposed developments. Senator Marise Payne, as defence minister, has done me the great honour of visiting Toowoomba, and in particular Oakey, the site of the Oakey Army Aviation Centre, to discuss the challenge of water contamination from the PFAS chemicals contained in firefighting foams previously used by the Defence Force on that base. I have also entertained a number of visits now from Darren Chester, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. He and I have talked about the significant federal government investment in the Warrego Highway upgrades, particularly just west of our city; the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, a $1.6 billion project to provide greater connectivity from the western parts of Queensland and the northern parts of New South Wales through, particularly, to the Brisbane port for export opportunities; and, of course, the Wellcamp Airport, which is totally privately funded and developed but greatly assisted and facilitated by appropriate federal government support in terms of air access around the Oakey Army Aviation Centre and giving it the same status as other major airports in the country for international freight purposes. I will be discussing the necessary emergency services support facilities in line with others across the country with the minister going forward as well. The point I want to make about all those exciting opportunities is the need for ongoing consultation from scientists, bureaucrats and decision-makers. My community is excited and in some cases challenged, but we need proper consultation with everyone involved. I use the example of Nexus constructing the $1.6 billion Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. Emergency access where the road is going to be blasted has been of concern for some locals. They simply want to be consulted properly. ARTC is working on the exciting inland rail route across our region. Again, they simply want to be consulted properly about where the route will end up, given that project will happen. Resource development opportunities in the CSG and coal mining activities again require proper consultation, as does Defence's activities in attempting to address that water contamination that I talked about a few moments ago. So I say to all: Groom is excited. In some cases, like elsewhere, we have to deal with our  challenges, but we require proper consultation. Whether it is seen by others to be a majority view or a minority view, everyone has the right to have their say, and I ask everyone to respect my community in that regard. Thank you. Multinational Tax Avoidance",205
Mr ALBANESE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to recognise The hidden billions report compiled by Oxfam Australia in June of this year. In 2014 it is estimated that tax-dodging multinationals operating within this country shifted $19 billion in profits offshore, depriving the Australian public of approximately $6 billion in tax revenue. This is money that could have gone into essential public services such as schools and hospitals in this country, or could have gone towards nation-building infrastructure. Furthermore, the report commissioned a poll that revealed 90 per cent of Australians want this government to prevent all multinational corporations operating in Australia from moving their profits to tax havens overseas in order to avoid paying their fair share here. There is a real human cost to this practice, both at home and abroad. Multinational corporations based in Australia and operating overseas are responsible for depriving developing countries of tax revenue. Large developing countries such as India and Brazil, as well as neighbouring countries such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, are being starved of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and Australian-based multinationals are part of the problem. In the Philippines an estimated 1,700 new classrooms could be built per year up to 2020 with these concealed profits. Over the next five years Oxfam estimates that Indonesia will be deprived of US$360 million that could go towards education, and Papua New Guinea, one of Australia's poorest neighbours and a recipient of substantial investment from Australia, stands to lose around $17 million in expenditure that could go to providing essential services like health and basic infrastructure. If more is not done to close tax loopholes, the report estimates that tax-dodging Australian based multinationals will deprive developing countries of a further $2.1 billion in public education and $1.5 billion in health, water and sanitation services. Oxfam is calling on the Australian government to make transparent the tax affairs of large multinationals. This means modifying current legislation so that multinational companies which function in or from Australia report publicly on their incomes, employees, profits earned and taxes paid in every country in which they operate. This will make it harder for multinationals to hide their profits in offshore tax havens-in turn, providing much needed revenue to develop essential public services for both Australia and for our developing neighbours. Dunkley Electorate: Local Sporting Champions",206
Mr CREWTHER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I recently had the pleasure of awarding eight junior sporting champions grants to young locals in Dunkley under the Australian government's Local Sporting Champions program. The Local Sporting Champions program is an Australian government initiative designed to provide financial assistance for young people aged 12 to 18 towards the cost of travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment to compete, coach and officiate at official national or state championships. I was pleased to be able to recognise the outstanding achievements of local young sporting champions Lily Baker, Isabell Hill, Samantha Howe, Sophie Jackson, Natasha Moody, Harriet Ochsenbein, Lawson Power and Ella Sharman in competing in their chosen fields. It  was an absolute pleasure to host five of these recipients and their proud families in my office for a special afternoon tea. During the afternoon tea an obvious conversation was the recent Rio Olympics where I am pleased to say that Alec Potts, from Mount Eliza in my electorate, won the first Olympic medal for Australia in the 2016 Olympics. Alec was a recipient of these Local Sporting Champions grants and he won us a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics as part of the Australian men's archery team. He should also be recognised for his outstanding achievements. We are certainly proud in Dunkley. We invest in these local sporting champions because not only can these young people go on to succeed as future champions-whether it is that the Olympics or otherwise-but also sport helps engage young people in our local area and gets them involved in the community. It really helps young people, whether it be my one-year-old daughter, who is here with me today, or many others-I want to see her and other young people in my electorate grow up with opportunities. I was very pleased during the campaign to work for the needs of the Dunkley community in securing over $6 million in funding for local sporting clubs to upgrade their facilities. This will really help engagement in sport. It is about social cohesion, community engagement and supporting the future of sport in Dunkley.",206
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In accordance with standing order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Proceedings suspended from 11:01 to 16:00 NA Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.  Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016. What an exciting time to be alive-no wonder the public gallery is packed out for this piece of legislation. There are not many bills that pass through this parliament-this wonderful, 115 year old institution-that do not actually change the law at all, but this bill before us, this piece of Turnbull-Joyce legislation, does not change the law, not even slightly. I know that because the explanatory memorandum for the bills says: None of the corrections makes any change to the substance of the law. This is quite extraordinary. Today we are celebrating or commemorating or acknowledging a one-year anniversary of when the Liberal and National parties combined to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of the day, Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah. If we look at their agenda and their plans for the future we see this piece of legislation: the Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016. It is a sad reflection on the Turnbull government and what they have become so quickly. They offered hope, briefly, and then it flickered and spluttered into nothing. The Australian Parliament House website lists a couple of definitions and it defines the Australian parliament as: 'An assembly of elected representatives, usually having an upper  and lower house which, with the head of state-the Queen, represented by the Governor General or Governor-makes the laws for the country.' It makes the laws. It does not spend its time correcting spelling mistakes in the laws or adding a few bits of punctuation. But that is actually what this piece of legislation is all about. It is an attack on grammar and a war on punctuation. Good governments spend their time enacting the vision that they take to the Australian people-that is what good governments do and that is what reforming governments do. Admittedly, conservative governments often are about reacting to the plan put forward by the progressive Labor governments, and that has certainly been the case for the last 40 or 50 years. Sadly, we see this piece of legislation-the Statute Law Revision (Spring 2016) Bill 2016-and we see that it is indicative of a government that does not have a vision. These are the amendments that will be made in this Turnbull-Joyce bill: schedule 1 corrects minor drafting errors and modernising language used in offence provisions in 15 acts, schedule 2 corrects some misdescribed amendments in four amending acts, schedule 3 substitutes references of specific ministers and departments for generic terms in one act, schedule 4 repeals some spent and obsolete provisions of two primary acts, and schedule 5 repeals a spent amending act. Not surprisingly, the Labor Party is not opposed to this bill. These are minor corrections, and, as I said, they do not change the law at all. But what is the point of the Turnbull-Joyce government if they spend all their time correcting spelling mistakes? Where is the vision? Where is the plan for Australia, especially in these uncertain times? I remember, during the 44th Parliament, when we had those grand occasions called the red tape reduction days, when that was the finest hour for any backbencher when they took their liquid paper to a couple of commas and showed the people they represent who was boss. Sadly, we do not have those red tape reduction days. Why don't we, one year on, bring them back so that the visionary work of the Turnbull-Joyce government is truly celebrated! When a law actually needs changing, the government wants to have a plebiscite before it will do its job and legislate. We have put an alternative plan out here when it comes to a plebiscite. We say that the role of government is to be representative-that is what representative democracies are. A plebiscite-led government is a different model. It has some merits in terms of it being able to go to the people, but the Westminster system we have here-which, more accurately, is a 'Washminster' system-is based on representative democracy. The people of your electorate put you into parliament to do your job. To change our Constitution is something that is quite difficult, as I am sure you well know, Acting Deputy Speaker Wicks. To change the Constitution is a difficult thing. I think we have tried it 42 times, and only eight times has that occurred. If you go to chapter VIII, 'Alteration of the Constitution', section 128, 'Mode of altering the Constitution', it talks about the process but there is no mention of plebiscites. Obviously a plebiscite is an opinion poll. It is not something that is referred to in our Constitution. We have a Prime Minister who was a barrister in another life. He understands constitutional law and at one time was able to be a champion in the Spycatcher case. He understood the fabric of Australian history, yet now has rolled over and is sending a worm into the heart of representative democracy. Instead of doing his job, he is going to suddenly replace the Westminster system of government with this plebiscite process.  When it comes to gay and lesbian Australians, for some reason their rights are different to every other right: the right of women to vote, the right of Indigenous Australians to be included and referred to. All of those other rights-the Racial Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act-that have evolved over time, parliamentarians have stood up and argued their case and voted according to their party and platform. Somehow, when it comes to gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex Australians, there suddenly has to be a different set of rules. Why is that so? If the member for Wentworth wandered down Oxford Street in his electorate and spoke to the people who are going to suffer under such a plebiscite, he would understand that it would be wrong. He can stand up and wash his hands and say: 'Oh, no, the people of Australia will be fine. The people of Australia will get this right; they will be respectful.' The reality is that young people who are working through their journey in life will suffer, will endure harm and will be bullied. That is something that will be on the Prime Minister's conscience. When it comes to legislating, we see a very, very sad track record for the Abbott government, and for the Turnbull government one year in. Even legislating to have a plebiscite seems problematic for this Turnbull-Joyce government. I do not think they are going to have the numbers in the Senate; they are wasting their time. I would like to particularly commend Senator Smith from Western Australia for having the courage to say that he would not be party to any plebiscite. He will represent the people of Western Australia, but would do it according to the best interests of the people of Western Australia. I am hoping that other members of the Liberal and National parties will join suit and not visit this harm on the Australian people. How did we get to this. As I said, one year ago today, the member for Wentworth became Prime Minister. He was backed in by desperate backbenchers, most of whom are no longer here-certainly the Tasmanian contingent and others from parts of New South Wales. The member for Wentworth has become one of the greatest political disappointments of our time. Sadly, so focused on power that he has forgotten all about the qualities of fairness and equity. He keeps saying, 'These are exciting times.' This is what Prime Minister Turnbull called the initial period of his prime ministership. He is prone to say, 'So far, so good.' I think that was a line in the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I think Robert Redford used it to talk about the guy that jumped out of the building-going down saying, 'So far, so good. So far, so good.' These are certainly interesting times, and they were interesting times in the lead-up to the 2 July election-that long eight-week election campaign following which we saw the number of backbenchers on the coalition side reduced significantly. With sagging popular approval ratings, the Prime Minister led the country on a very unusual road to an election. With great fanfare, just over five months ago, Prime Minister Turnbull invoked the rarely used powers contained in section 5 of the Constitution and asked the Governor General to recall parliament for an extra three sitting weeks-an extraordinary request. Other than after a general election, section 5 has only be invoked on four occasions since 1961, and two of those occasions were so that the Queen could open the new session of parliament. On one of the other occasions it was necessary when Prime Minister John Gorton did not have his government's program fully prepared for the first sitting after the 1969 election, and in 1968 parliament was prorogued after the death of Prime Minister Harold Holt.  So, we had the member for Wentworth prorogue the parliament under section 5. The reason given by the Prime Minister in March that warranted such an unusual request was that parliament had to be recalled to give consideration to two 'important parcels of industrial legislation.' Those pieces of legislation were the ABCC bills and the registered organisations bill. I have copies of the letters where it is noted on 21 March that it was all about this industrial regulation. The letter to the Governor General, carrying the Governor General's signature where it says 'Noted': Although the grounds for a double dissolution under s.57 of the Constitution exist in respect of the Registered Organisations Bill, it is the Government's preference to have it and the ABCC Bills passed by the Parliament rather than invoke the s.57 procedure. Yet, as we well recall, the registered organisations bill was not put to the people in that parliament. Instead, people cleared off. There was a letter to the Governor General, to the Queen's representative, stating what was going to happen yet the member for Sturt was not able to organise things enough to put it to the House. Parliament was recalled on Monday, 18 April for a period of three weeks. The bills were put before the parliament and obviously were rejected by the Senate. Prime Minister Turnbull then advised the Governor General to exercise his power under section 57 of the Constitution to dissolve both houses of parliament simultaneously to enable an election of both houses-again, not a power that is often invoked, and it was only the seventh time since Federation that this power had been used. Obviously it was an attempt to regain some control over the Senate; instead, I think the Liberal-National Party lost senators in that process. We have certainly ended up with some strange individuals with some strange views, including some senators from Queensland who have a strange understanding of representative democracy-and science. During the election, we hardly heard any discussion from the coalition about either the ABCC bills or the registered organisations bill-notwithstanding that they were the very reason Prime Minister Turnbull called the election, as noted in the letter I quoted. Postelection we have Prime Minister Turnbull with a slim majority of one in the House of Representatives, and on one occasion, for the first time since the 1960s, the government lost control of the House. As I said, there is also a reduced number in the Senate and we have an increased crossbench. On this anniversary today of Mr Turnbull's seizing the prime ministership it is hard to think of a single achievement of his government. He has these threeword slogans. He keeps saying 'jobs and growth', but we know there has been a collapse in the number of full-time jobs since he came to power. Far from him being the great Messiah, we see a government in chaos, with backstabbing, sniping and undermining at a time when the nation of Australia needs great leadership. People thought this great business person, who had been connected with the HIH collapse, would be a steady hand on the economy's rudder but instead we have seen the situation reduced to slogans like 'jobs and growth'. There was all that talk about economic leadership but, as I said, the number of full-time jobs has collapsed-300 full-time jobs have been lost every single day since the beginning of the year. The Prime Minister has taken us from economic thought bubble to economic thought bubble. He has been talking about states effectively reducing state income taxes-wasn't that a visionary statement, though I think it only lasted five minutes. That is the sort of leadership we have had. At a time when we know there are revenue problems, he talks about states increasing their own taxes.  His economic leadership has been anything but. It has been a complete shambles and, as I have said, we have challenging times coming. I am particularly concerned about productivity flatlining, about wages growth flatlining so that people are effectively earning less every year, but still we have a government obsessed with unions when we have slow wages growth. We have a Prime Minister who is shackled to the policies of the member for Warringah-in fact, they are the only achievements he can trot out at a time when the Great Barrier Reef is under threat and we need to act on climate- (Time expired) Question agreed to.
