DEFENCE FORCE PAY
Notice of Motion
Mr SCHOLES (Corio)--I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That this House
(1) expresses its concern at the failure of the Government to comply with the recommendation of the Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay that the Minister refer Defence Force remuneration for review so that necessary adjustments may be made to maintain Defence Force pay and conditions at levels comparable to those in the Public Service and the community, and
(2) calls for the removal of ministerial discretion as to when the Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay may undertake reviews and make determinations on pay and conditions. and that in all respects the fixation of Defence Force pay should be comparable to that of other government employees.
AIRCRAFT COMPANIES
Notice of Motion
Mr CUNNINGHAM (McMillan)-I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That this House
(1) deplores the failure of the Treasurer to provide a reply to matters raised by the honourable member for McMillan on 19 August, 24 August, 15 September, 21 September and 22 Septemher 1982, relating to the activities of certain aircraft companies, and
(2) calls upon the Treasurer to provide a reply to information sought by the member for McMillan as a matter of urgency.

TAXATION
Mr WILLIS-I refer the Treasurer to his letter to me yesterday in reply to a letter on my behalf from my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle requesting information on tax lost under bottom-of-the-harbour schemes which the Government will not recoup under its proposed retrospective legislation. Since the initial request was made on I October, can the Treasurer explain why he took six weeks to reply to the Opposition's query? Is it merely fortuitous that his reply came after the legislation passed through this House? In view of his acknowledgment that the Government will not collect up to $500m of tax lost under these schemes because of its decision not to recoup personal income tax which should have been paid when profits were distributed to shareholders, together with the significant watering down of the legislation since it was announced, wil1 he now acknowledge that considerably less than half the total revenue lost under these schemes is likely to be recovered? Will the Treasurer now admit that this thoroughly inadequate legislation makes a mockery of his Government's claims to be taking--
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman has asked the question, which so far is in order. I will not allow him to argue the issue. I call the Treasurer.
Mr HOWARD-I do not think that anything the honourable member for Gel1ibrand said, anything the honourable member for Fremantle said in his letter to me or anything the Australian Labor Party has said at any stage during the debate on this legislation makes in any way a mockery of the Government's claims on this subject. The Government's action on this matter has widespread community support. It is a demonstration of its concern to have as much fairness as possible in our taxation system. The honourable gentleman knows full well that major elements of the original request made by his colleague while he was overseas were of a highly political character. The actual nature of the request surrounded the desire of the Opposition to amend the legislation to extend it beyond the recoupment of evaded company tax and into the area of recovery of avoided tax. I made it perfectly clear during the debate, and before the debate, why the Government was not prepared to extend the legislation in the manner requested by the honourable gentleman. My reply to the honourable gentleman's letter was very much along those lines and revealed

Questions without Notice

nothing new regarding the Government's attitude.
COMMONWEALTH FODDER SUBSIDY SCHEME
Mr EWEN CAMERON-Can the Minister for Primary Industry advise the House as to when payments to drought affected farmers under the Commonwealth Fodder Subsidy Scheme will begin?
Mr NIXON-Following royal assent being given to the Bill that went through the Senate just recently, negotiations were conducted with the States in respect of the administrative arrangements in terms of the fodder subsidy because the States, as the House will recall, will be administering the scheme for the Commonwealth even though it will be totally Commonwealth financed. Those negotiations concluded today. The States will now be making applications for funds from my colleague the Minister for Finance. Forms have been distributed and any farmers or graziers who wish to do so can lodge application forms with their local rural finance company or whatever the organisation is in each State.
MINISTERS' TRAVEL ALLOWANCES
Mr CROSS-I direct my question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Was the definition of 'home base' for the purpose of the payment of travel allowances to Ministers altered in the 1982 review of the Remuneration Tribunal? What was the reason for this change? What evidence, or other information, was advanced to the Rumuneration Tribunal in support of such a change?
Mr NEWMAN-The answer to the first part of the question is yes. I do not know the answer to the last part. That would have to be taken up with the Remuneration Tribunal. As to the centre part of the question, it was for the purpose of efficient administration.
EASTBRIDGE MIGRANT CENTRE
Mr JARMAN-Has the notice of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs been drawn to an attack made on a bus driver at the Eastbridge migrant hostel in my electorate? Is it correct that the bus was being used to transport cheap labour to market gardens in the Dandenongs? Is the Minister able to inform the House whether these people were paying for their accommodation and meals at the hostel and whether they were receiving unemployment benefits?
Mr HODGES-I am aware of the incident at the Eastbridge Migrant Centre in Victoria to

which the honourable member for Deakin referred. It was an unfortunate and unpleasant incident that resulted in a bus driver sustaining bodily harm. I just want to say in general terms that my Department and I are responsible for the successful and happy settlement in this country of people born overseas and their integration into our society. I therefore have deep concern for the welfare of migrants and refugees who come to this country. Obviously, with tens of thousands of people coming here, incidents are going to arise from time to time. We endeavour to minimise those incidents where possible through various controls at migrant centres.
Claims have been made in the Press that the buses were transporting refugees who were being exploited or that cheap labour was involved. I am unable to refute that claim. That may well be so. But these matters are actually the responsibility of the Victorian Government. I understand that the Victorian Department of Labour and Industry is following that matter up. I also understand that the Victoria Police are investigating the incident. Insofar as payment for accommodation at migrant hostels is concerned, I inform the House that all persons staying at migrant hostels are responsible for payment for accommodation. Just to give the House an idea of the charges made, I point out that single persons 18 years and over, if employed, pay a weekly tariff of $83; if they are unemployed they pay a weekly tariff of $42.95. A married couple with two children, with an employed breadwinner, would pay $125 as week, whereas if the breadwinner were unemployed the family would pay $99.20 a week.
Finally I inform the House that my Department conducts orientation programs for all migrants at all hostels. English classes are conducted for non-English speaking people, whether they be refugees or migrants. In those orientation programs migrants and refugees are advised of award rates and working conditions in this country and are also advised of the role of police in Australian society. As I said earlier, I am very concerned about incidents of this nature occurring at migrant hostels. I understand that the Victoria Police have been unable to identify any of the refugees who are supposed to have been involved in the particular bus incident.
BUILDING APPROVALS STATISTICS
Mr CHARLES-I ask whether the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been drawn to the latest building approvals statistics released today which indicate that in September this year the total number of new dwelling approvals was at its lowest level for eight years

2948 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Questions without Notice

and that there was a fall of 33.7 per cent in the number of new private sector dwellings approved in September this year compared with September last year. Is the Minister aware that there is a lag of around two years between corresponding dwelling approvals and completions? Is it true that the already substantial backlog in the provision of housing which has resulted from this Government's policies is therefore now destined to become even more massive? When will the Government formulate and implement policies to secure adequate and affordable funds for housing?
Mr PEACOCK-it is true that the number of dwelling approvals slipped further in the month of September. There is no doubt that this reflected overall consumer confidence at the time, which was affected by the bad economic news as the world recession began to have its local effect. There is no magic answer, of course, to restoring confidence in potential home buyers, but the Government in fact has moved firmly to ensure that there are adequate loan funds available. The advice to us is that the bank loans are readily available to credit-worthy borrowers.
Mr Uren-What about the deposit gap? How do they buy them?
Mr PEACOCK-If the honourable member wants to ask, 'What about this and what about that', let us remember that the Government has in fact introduced an improved home deposit assistance scheme as well as tax rebates for all home buyers and has significantly boosted welfare housing payments to the States. These programs have come into effect only in the last nine days. They are in effect. We have not even got on paper a housing policy of the Australian Labor Party explaining what it would do, but our programs are in effect. Unquestionably these policies will bite. It will take time for them to work through to industry activity. Housing industry groups have pointed out that there has been evidence of an increase in inquiries from impending home buyers since these Budget initiatives were announced. It has to be recognised throughout the community that recovery in the housing industry will be influenced heavily by our overall economic performance which in turn depends critically on selfdiscipline, particularly in industrial relations and wages and in re-establishing our international competitiveness-fairly fundamental elements that could not be overlooked surely even by the Australian Labor Party.
COASTAL SURVEILLANCE
Mr BRAITHWAITEThe Minister for Transport and Construction would be aware of

concern being expressed that coastal surveillance will be curtailed following a recent review of the situation. Can the Minister assure the House that the coastal surveillance program will be maintained and continued and that contracts will still be available to private operators for that purpose?
Mr HUNT-I am aware of the concern of some private operators who are facing the prospect of retendering for the littoral surveillance of some sections of our coastline. The Government has no intention of curtailing littoral surveillance between Western Australia and north Queensland. I should like to make that point very clear. Late last year the Government undertook a review, as had been indicated some two years previously, of the whole coastal surveillance operation. That report was considered by the Government and it decided to maintain the major part of the coastal surveillance being done by private operators.
Where contracts have expired new contracts have been let as a result of tenders. However, it has been suggested that the surveillance program in north Queensland, with particular reference to the Great Barrier Reef, will be terminated by the Government. No decision has been taken to terminate surveillance in that area. However, this contract will fall due shortly and fresh tenders will be called.
I dare say that, as in other cases, the operators are concerned that they may not be successful in winning the tender, but I assure the honourable member for Dawson that the Government is not letting up in its coastal surveillance from Western Australia to north Queensland in any way. The new contracts that have been let to date are very efficient indeed.

Mr MOUNTFORD-I refer the Minister for Administrative Services to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, 23 October, which disclosed that the Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd retrenched 130 of its 900 assembly plant workers at Enfield and Revesby. I ask: Is it a fact that the problem with Leyland was in part due to a Federal Government decision to contract Toyota in Japan to supply the Department of Defence with 215 4-wheel drive vehicles rather than Leyland, to which such contracts had previously been given? If so, will he seek a reversal of the decision by the Government to purchase foreign-made 4-wheel drive vehicles at the expense of Australian industry and Australian jobs? Will he also assure the House that the Government will reintroduce the 20 per cent preference

evaluation factor which was discontinued by the Government in October 1981 ?
Mr NEWMAN-I should like to help the honourable member but I do not have the means of providing the information. I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Defence and with the Department of Defence Support and give him an answer.
EMPLOYMENT
Mr SHACK-What evidence does the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations have that the closed shop, penalty rates, holiday and other loadings, minimum wage levels and restrictive trading hours are all factors which inhibit employment? What efforts will the Minister make to encourage a freeing up of the labour market in order to provide greater employment opportunities?
Mr MACPHEE-There is no doubt that anything that restricts the capacity of entrepreneurs to be enterprising is an inhibiting factor in the labour market. Anything that adds to the costs of entrepreneurs in the present climate worsens employment prospects and increases the prospects of disemployment. I believe that many employers have an obligation to consider their costs and to consider applying to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the variation of awards in respect of some of those costs. I find it hard to imagine that in this climate some trade union leaders can still advocate that workers must get indexed wages on top of the cuts in taxes that this year's Budget contains and that they must get increased penalty rates, increased loadings and shorter working hours.
This morning I was at a conference of the International Metal Workers Federation Executive Committee in Sydney. It is significant that all our major trading partners-all the comparable industrial economies-have, in the last couple of years, had real reductions in wages. They are more competitive now than they were then. They are infinitely more competitive than our industries because the one thing that was within their power to control-wage levels or wage costs-has been reduced relative to their consumer price index. As a result their inflation rate is now far more respectable than ours. I do not wish to make wage costs the only cause for the difficulty we are now facing, but it is one area which we, as a community, can influence. There is very little directly that the Federal Government can do in respect of those awards although I will not~-
Mr Mountford-Why did you do away with indexation?

Mr MACPHEE-That is a good question. We cannot sustain the indexation of wages at a time like this and imagine that our companies can continue to remain in business. I cannot understand how anyone who knows the faintest thing about the economy can imagine that we, who are so uncompetitive in everything that we manufacture and everything that we extract from the ground or grow at present has problems on world markets, can go on in this lotus land increasing wage costs and not worsening our unemployment situation. I want the employers of this country also to understand it. There is a role for government. In a number of respects in this Budget and in a number of other respects we have provided leadership. We have had endless matters of public importance in this House on this question. We need a response from employers as well as responsible trade union officials.
SYDNEY (KINGSFORD-SMITH) AIRPORT: AIR CRASH
Mr MAHER-When will the Minister for Aviation release the report of the board of accident inquiry set up under the Air Navigation Act to investigate the air crash at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport on 21 February 1980 in which the pilot and 12 passengers were killed?
Mr FIFE-The judge who is undertaking that inquiry has not made his report available to me. As soon as the work has been completed and the report is in my hands I will give consideration to its release.
COMMUNITY RADIO FEDERAnON
Mr COLEMAN-Is the Minister for Communications aware that Community Radio Federation Ltd in Victoria has rejected an application from the community organisation Women Who Want To Be Women to join the Federation and obtain a quota of radio time on station 3CR? Can the Minister advise the House of the grounds for the Federation's rejection of this application? Is he able to take any measures to democratise the operations of this publicly funded organisation?
Mr N. A. BROWN-I have seen a report along the general lines that the honourable member has indicated although I am not aware of the details of it. However, I think I should say to the honourable member that over many years the Australian broadcasting system has developed along the lines of increasing independence being given to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; so much so that the Tribunal and not the Government has the detailed control and responsibility for the issuing of licences and ensuring that broadcasters comply with the conditions of their licences. I would have

2950 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

thought that most honourable members would agree that that is a far more preferable system than having a Minister with power to grant licences or to dictate to broadcasters as to who should be members of their organisations or indeed what programs they should broadcast.
The only advice I can give on the matter raised by the honourable member is that licences are not granted in perpetuity. They are subject to extension and review at the time of licence renewal. It is open to people who object to the renewal of a licence to go to the Broadcasting Tribunal and to argue in effect that adequate and comprehensive programs have not been provided and that the Tribunal should look very closely at the particular broadcaster who is said not to be providing adequate and comprehensive programs.
FAt8 AIRCRAFT
Mr SCHOLESIs the Minister for Defence in a position to assure the Parliament that the FA 18 program will proceed? Can the Minister indicate whether the contract for the purchase of the FA 18 includes provisions for Australian withdrawal if the aircraft does not meet the requirements specified at the time of the contract? Does the Government intend to continue current expenditure and preparation for the manufacture of the FA 18 while the future production of the aircraft is in doubt? Does the present contract provide for compensation payments to the Australian Government and private firms involved in the Australian Industry Participation Program for accrued costs arising from production contracts should production of the aircraft not be approved by the United States Congress?
Mr SINCLAIR-There have been some Press reports about some observations made in the United States as a result of a naval operational evaluation of the FA 18 aircraft. This morning I was sent a copy of a statement released by the United States Secretary of Navy in the course of which he points out:
The operational evaluation of the carrier-based attack mission of the F/ A-18 was completed on 4 October 1982. While the aircraft met most specified requirements thresholds. its unrefuelled combat radius fell short of Navy expectations. Additionally, as is common in new aircraft, some technical problems were uncovered which will require correction.
I am advised that the Lemoore naval air station in California has had a squadron of FAI8s in training for a little while and that the pilots in that squadron have found the FA 18 to be an excellent aircraft. They commend it highly. My advice is that some 10 aircraft have been put into operational evaluation. The results are not necessarily

on the aircraft as it would be finally delivered to the Royal Australian Air Force.
In the evaluation of the type of aircraft for Australian defence requirements, honourable members will recall that perhaps the most exhaustive examination of any type of defence purchase was undertaken by the Defence Force under the ministry of my colleague the Leader of the House, when he held the Defence portfolio. When the decision was taken by the Government, it was taken after a very careful appreciation of a range of aircraft. The final selection was made on an assessment between the Fl6 and the FAI8. The actual evaluation by the United States Navy takes into account a number of requirements different from those that are applicable in our own circumstances. In particular, the unrefuelled combat radius, to which I referred, differs in the United States naval configuration when the aircraft would be operating from a carrier compared with the configuration which was envisaged for operations by the Royal Australian Air Force in the course of which the FAI8s would be land based. I am told that the difference is significantly that additional wing fuel tanks can be carried in the landbased operation of the aircraft, but there seems to be some limit on its radius in these early operational trials.
My advice is that this operational testing and evaluation in no way places in jeopardy the likely purchase of the FA 18 aircraft by the United States Navy. It certainly does not give us reason to re-assess our own Air Force's decision. Indeed, the discussions that my colleagues and I had with the United States Secretary of Defense, Casper Weinberger, last weekend reconfirmed the United States Department of Defense's determination to proceed with the purchase. His reports to me and my colleagues and the Department were that the FAl8 is a highly satisfactory aircraft. The United States and, indeed, the Royal Australian Air Force, believe it will live up to expectations.
DRAYTON COLLIERY
Mr O'KEEFE-I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he is aware of problems being experienced by Drayton Colliery in the Hunter Valley. Is it a fact that, owing to the objection of the. Northern Miners Federation to providing labour for the mine, two shipments of coal to Korea have been lost and a further one in January is in jeopardy if labour is not provided? Is it a fact that this mine could employ a labour force of 450 and begin valuable exports under contract if the Northern Miners Federation agreed to staff it? Can the Minister state what action could be taken to solve this problem?

Mr ANTHONY~I am aware of the continuing dispute at the Drayton Colliery. I think it is tragic and unfortunate that recalcitrant elements of the Northern District of the Miners Federation are banning the continuation of work at that mine.
Mr Robert Brown~Why don't you be fair dinkum about the issues involved? You don't know anything about it.
Mr SPEAKER~Order! The honourable member for Hunter will remain silent.
Mr ANTHONY~I would not have thought that the honourable member for Hunter would open his mouth on this issue because the facts of the matter are that the mine is partly
developed~-
Mr SPEAKER-Order! I indicate to the Acting Prime Minister that if I discipline the honourable member for Hunter and the right honourable gentleman then refers to his interjection, he makes it very difficult for me to stop the honourable member for Hunter from interjecting.
Mr ANTHONY-With due respect, Mr Speaker, I do not mind him interrupting. It just shows how difficult some of these people can be in the resolving of problems about matters which involve more jobs. At the moment 100 jobs cannot be filled at the Drayton Colliery because of a ban that has been put on it by one section of the Combined Mining Unions but the Combined Mining Unions want the ban lifted.
Mr Robert Brown-I take a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented.
Mr SPEAKER-I will call the honourable gentleman at an appropriate time.
Mr ANTHONY-I have mentioned that the Northern District of the Miners Federation has put a ban on the further development of this coal mine. The Federation believes that it will replace jobs at existing coal mines in the Hunter Valley. That is completely wrong. This is a new miQ,e with new contracts to fill for Europe, Japan and Korea. If those contracts are not filled, I venture to say that the customers will go to Queensland or elsewhere around the world. This means that the Hunter Valley mine-a mine on which some $200m already has been spent and which will provide 400 jobs-is being put at real risk. Time for meeting these contracts is running out. It is to the credit of the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, that he has called together the parties to this matter and has tried to resolve the problem. He has the Combined Mining Unions on side for at least a partial lifting of the ban, but the Northern Miners Federation is adamant that this

mine will not go ahead. That is about the craziest attitude one could possibly take if one had any interest at all in the coal industry of New South Wales. At the moment the coal industry is having difficulties in getting further contracts overseas and nothing could damage our reputation more than the imbecilic attitude of that section of the mining union in banning the development.
RELEASE OF KENNETH DERLY
Mr ARMITAGE--My question is directed to the Acting Attorney-General. I preface it by referring him to his letter to me of II October 1982 in reply to my letter of 22 July when he refused to give me the reason why the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, had released Kenneth Derly, the right hand man of Murray Stewart Riley, after only three years two months gaol when he had been sentenced to a term of 8+ years gaol with a non-parole period of three years ten months. I ask: Is it correct that Derly was convicted of smuggling drugs valued at $46m? Will the Minister now give the reasons behind this extraordinary decision and give the names of the people who made representations to the Attorney-General on Derly's behalf?
Mr N. A. BROWN--Over the years-I think it has been a practice of successive governments-a well established practice has developed with respect to applications for parole and leave on licence for Commonwealth prisoners---
Mr Armitage-But this was a non-parole period.
Mr N. A. BROWN-And also those applications, as I was about to say, where the parole period has not expired but where, nevertheless, an application is made. As I say, a well developed practice has been followed, certainly over recent years to my certain knowledge--
Mr Armitage-He was released during a nonparole period.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Chifley will cease interjecting.
Mr N. A. BROWN-And that was followed in this case. The decision that was made with respect to the particular prisoner was made on advice and consistently with advice. One of the very important elements of the well established practice in this matter is that there should be and will be, while I have any responsibility for the area, no public disclosure of reasons touching on individual cases.
Mr Armitage-Who are you covering up for?

2952 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Questions without Notice

Mr SPEAKER--I warn the honourable member for Chiftey that if he interjects again I will have to deal with him.
Mr N. A. BROWN-There has been and will be no disclosure of reasons or indeed of any other factors relating to the individual circumstances of any Commonwealth prisoner who is released on parole or licence. It would be contrary to all principle to do so. It would certainly be an invasion of privacy. It is not something which I would have thought most honourable members of this House would support. The honourable member does little credit to himself, or to penal reform in this country, by seeking a public exposure of individual private circumstances touching on a prisoner.
STATUTORY DECLARATION ON PRESCRIPTIONS
Mr MacKENZIE-Can the Minister for Health explain why it is necessary for pensioners to sign a statutory declaration on prescriptions effective as from 1 January next year? Will pensioners be liable for a $1,000 fine or six months gaol if they make an error in writing down their pensioner health benefit card number as has been claimed in certain media reports and by some pharmacists in New South Wales?
Mr CARLTON-The honourable member for Calare, of course, is referring to the new three-tier pharmaceutical benefits scheme which will come into effect on I January next year when there will be a new category of special benefit of a $2 charge for those with health care cards and also pensioners who do not currently have pensioner health benefit cards. With this change I am taking the opportunity to tighten up what I regard as a very loose system. We are spending some $300m a year of taxpayers' money on this concessional benefit which I think is a very wise thing to do. But it is important, whenever we look at a change of system, to try to tighten up the clerical systems to make it harder for people to commit a fraud. What happens under the current rather loose system is that the prescriber is requested, I understand he is not even bound by law, to write the number of the benefit card on the prescription. That goes through the system and the benefit is ultimately paid back to the chemist. The prescription, of course, goes through the chemist. The medicine is obtained by the customer and the benefit comes back to the chemist from my Department. Nobody is fully liable in this situation for making a declaration. I believe that those who get the benefit should make a declaration that they are eligible for it. Therefore on the back of the prescription form, whenever anybody gets the special benefit at no cost, that is a pensioner, or at

a $2 cost, that is a health care card holder, he is asked to write the number of his entitlement on the back and also sign it in the form of a declaration.
I know that this introduces additional paper work. I know that chemists are not terribly happy about it because at the moment they do not have to bother at all about checking these things. I know that it is going to be a bother for pensioners to do this but we have large sums of money going out on things like pharmaceutical benefits and medical benefits. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is inquiring into questions of fraud and possible overservicing relating to medical benefits. I see it as my very clear duty, since there is a change of system, to try to make people clearly responsible when they claim on the taxpayer for a benefit and for it to be auditable and followed up by proper auditing systems. I have written to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia explaining to it exactly why I am bringing in a system which is a bit more complicated than that with which it has to deal now. I am unhappy about that, but I believe that I have a responsibility to the taxpayer to do this.
As regards the pensioners, it is not true to say that pensioners are liable to fines and imprisonment for making mistakes. That is absolutely not true. I saw a scare story to that effect in a newspaper in Orange-in fact, in the honourable member's electorate. I think it is very unfair to pensioners to put about these scare stories. If people make mistakes and so on, of course they are not liable. But if people seek to defraud-as I think everybody would agree--that is a different matter. At the moment, with this rather loose system, I am concerned that there may be cases of fraud which are undetected. I think the whole House would want me, where I can and where it is reasonable, to try to tighten up the systems to make fraud much more difficult.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the honourable gentleman to the balance of payments statistics for October which show a further worsening of Australia's trade position, with a balance of trade deficit of $263m for that month. Is the Treasurer aware that the latest annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board shows a record level of foreign borrowings by enterprises in Australia of over $8 billion and that over 44 per cent of these borrowings are short term? That figure was for the first three quarters of 1981-82. Does this mean that the Government is relying on the easy option to balance our international accounts by allowing

Questions without Notice

the buildup of massive foreign debts? When will the Government begin to address the problems of Australian industry and the massive and rising levels of imports, and stop encouraging short term solutions through foreign borrowings?
Mr HOWARDIf my recollection of the figures serves me correctly, during the September quarter of 1982 imports rose by only 7 per cent and exports rose by about IS per cent. So the substance of the honourable gentleman's question would not appear to be sustained.
Mr Keating-Have a look at your figures.
Mr HOWARD-That may have applied to the month of October. The fact of the matter is that our trade account has worsened. It has worsened because of falling volumes of our exports. The reasons for this can be found in very much reduced commodity prices for many of our primary and mining exports and also in the accumulating uncompetitiveness of many of our export industries due to many of the cost and wage pressures to which my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, referred. Over the years we have traditionally run a very large current account deficit because of the large invisible item in our account. Traditionally that has been balanced by private capital inflow. In fact, the position of our balance of payments as such is healthier for this part of the financial year than it was during a corresponding period last year because, due in no small measure to very large investment in Australian Government securities by Japanese institutions, the volume of private capital inflow has been much stronger than was the case in the previous quarter. The honourable gentleman invites the Government not to embrace an easy option for curing our competitive position. I put it to members of the Opposition very strongly that they, indeed, are adopting the easy option in relation to our uncompetitiveness because of their repeated refusal and failure to recognise the massive contribution wage increases have made to our uncompetitiveness over the last two years.
DISALLOWED QUESTION
Mr Tambling proceeding to address a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman's question is out of order.
COMMONWEALTH-NEW SOUTH WALES JOINT TASK FORCE ON DRUG
TRAFFICKING
Mr HAYDEN-Has the Acting Prime Minister had an opportunity to note in the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task

Force on Drug Trafficking report the quite apparently convincing evidence of linkages between Australian and American intelligence agencies and the Nugan Hand organisation through identities such as Michael Hand and Mr Bernard Houghton? Is he aware that more than 12 months ago, in a confidential briefing provided for me by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO assured me that no such linkages existed with ASIO and American agencies and that, in respect of the latter matter, ASIO was convinced of this because the Central Intelligence Agency had sent it a letter, in response to correspondence from it, hotly denying any such association? In view of the very disturbing evidence which has been produced in this Joint Task Force report and the substantial nature of that evidence, is the Minister satisfied with the information which was conveyed to me by ASIO? If, like me, he is totally dissatisfied with it, will he take prompt steps to have speedily investigated these particular matters referred to in this Joint Task Force report to ensure, in the first instance, that the operations of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation have in no way been compromised by any association with Nugan Hand or people associated with it and, in the second instance, that foreign intelligence agencies have not been behaving improperly through any medium such as Nugan Hand or people who have been associated with it?
Mr ANTHONY-I have not had a chance to examine the Joint Task Force report which was released by my colleague, I think yesterday, but I have read of the reference in that report to people who were previously associated with the Central Intelligence Agency. It is true that statements have been made that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has had no associationnor do we believe that Nugan Hand people have had an association--directly with the CIA. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already stated that he likewise does not believe that there has been any direct association with the CIA and accepts that some of these people have previously had associations with the CIA. Merely because they might have had earlier associations with it, that does not necessarily mean that they have been acting on behalf of or with the CIA.
Mr HaydenRead the report.
Mr ANTHONY-- There is an element of doubt. The evidence that has been produced by this Joint Task Force report will need to be examined more closely. No doubt there will be further debates in this House on the question.

Budget Paper No.2

INDUSTRIAL ACTION
Mr TUCKEY-Can the Treasurer advise the House of the cost of industrial action, in particular industrial action in Bass Strait, to our overseas reserves? Will the Treasurer advise whether this has any effect on internal interest rates?
Mr HOWARDI can certainly confirm to the honourable member for O'Connor that industrial activity, not only in our resource industries but also in our other export industries, which causes loss of production obviously has a very adverse effect on our volume of exports and therefore on our export income. I suppose that, to the extent that that widens our current account deficit and causes us to need more private or official borrowings from abroad and given certain interest rate differentials between Australia and other countries, it could have a very adverse effect on our interest rates. There is no doubt that earlier this calendar year it was necessary for Australia, because of our large current account deficit, in order to balance our payments, to bring very large amounts of capital in from abroad. That could be achieved only by allowing our interest rates to go to very high levels. That was never denied by the Government. Of course, the linkage between that outcome and the contribution made by industrial stoppages to falling export volumes is quite obvious.
BUDGET PAPER No.2
Mr SPEAKER-The Treasurer has indicated to me that he wishes to add to an answer that he gave yesterday.
Mr HOWARDYes. Mr Speaker, I was asked a question yesterday by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)----
Mr Lionel Bowen--Not again.
Mr HOWARD-- Yes, again.
Mr Keating-- You are back again.
Mr HOWARDYes, back again. I always like to answer the honourable member in full.
Mr Keating-I will be back too so don't worry about it.
Mr SPEAKER-- The Treasurer should proceed.
Mr HOWARD -I indicated that I would have a luok at Budget Paper No.2 for this year to see whether the types of forecasts about employment and unemployment contained in it were different--
Mr Scholes-There was no question today.
Mr Keating-I take a point of order. I gave notice of a motion today in respect of this subject.

If the Treasurer wishes to call that notice on for debate I would be happy to debate it.
Mr SPEAKER-I indicate to the Treasurer that he is speaking with my indulgence, after the end of Question Time, in order to add to an answer. It is a matter for the Treasurer to consider whether he wishes to proceed to give the answer if issues arise which indicate that indulgence would be opposed. The Treasurer can continue his answer if he chooses to do so.
Mr HOWARD-I simply indicated to the honourable gentleman yesterday that I would check, which, of course, he could do also because these are matters of public record, whether the types of forecasts about employment and unemployment in this year's Budget Paper No.2 were different from the types of forecasts on those subjects in earlier statements. It is not only my view after checking those figures but also the view of my departmental officers, whom I consulted to obtain their opinion, that the types of forecasts are not materially different although the substance is different. The only other matter I would mention, and it is a matter of--
Opposition members interjecting-
Mr HOWARD-All right; if indulgence is being opposed and I am prevented from correcting an inadvertent error which I made in giving an answer yesterday, be that on the head of the Opposition.
Mr Keating--On a point of order, I have not denied the Treasurer leave at all. I have suggested that he bring the motion on. If he does not, we will, of course, give him leave to reply.
Mr HOWARD-The other matter I wanted to add is not of any consequence. However, because I did inadvertently mislead the House, I ought to--
Opposition members-Oh!

TREASURER
Suspension of Standing Orders
Mr KEATING-(Blaxland) (2.54)-1 move:
That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Blaxland moving that this House condemns the Treasurer for misleading it by tendering a false commitment to the Parliament of 18 August 1982 in respect of the alteration of official departmental figures for inclusion in the Budget Papers.
Mr SPEAKER-The motion needs to be in writing and seconded.
Mr KEATING-It is now, Mr Speaker. The reason I seek the suspension of Standing Orders is that on 18 August this year, in answer to a question put by my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:
Nobody at a political level has in any way altered those figures.
That was in answer to a question relating to the alteration of figures in respect of the Budget, the Government having falsified the 1977 Budget. The question was put by my colleague in respect of estimates for employment growth and unemployment and, therefore, the effect upon the deficit, and that was the answer. I alleged in a question yesterday, and I allege it again, that there was alteration of official figures. Nothing the Treasurer has said here today in respect of the labour market forecast relates in any way to the sort of quantification one normally expects to see-and did see the previous year-in relation to the forecast for unemployment growth. Last year, for instance, total employment growth was estimated at 2 per cent compared with 2.6 per

cent in 1980-81. The same applied to unemployment. This year all that was said was that it followed that there was unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83. Indeed, already there has been a significant drop in employment. The Government went on to say:
Even so, it is likely that there will be a marked increase in recorded unemployment this year.
What happened, Mr Speaker, is--
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman is now proceeding beyond the reason for the suspension of Standing Orders and putting his basic argument.
Mr KEATING-Mr Speaker, 1 argue that Standing Orders should be suspended because the labour market forecast was sanitised politically by the Government, and sanitised at the Treasurer's behest. He was not man enough to debate the matter. The Government sought to deny me leave to make that point. I will debate it here until the cows come home because 1 know he has falsified the figures. He sent Hewson over there to doctor them up and now he will not own up to it.
Mr SPEAKERIs the motion seconded?
Mr HAWKE (Wills) (2.58)-1 second the motion. The Government's attitude in this House to unemployment has been an absolute disgrace. It is well known that on the night of the Budget the Treasurer (Mr Howard) misled the House. That misleading of the House resulted either from a deliberate--
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman is not entitled to use those terms.
Mr HAWKE-Mr Speaker, I am arguing that what has happened in this House on the matter of unemployment has happened for one of two reasons. Either there was an intention on the part of the Government, through the Treasurer, to give to this House a misleading picture or there was gross and culpable incompetence on the part of the Treasurer and those advising him. On either ground, it is a matter which should be discussed by this House. We are not considering some peripheral matter; we are considering the issue of the level of unemployment and what the Government anticipates it to be. The situation is disastrous. This matter should be discussed here. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) should be given the opportunity of exposing either the dishonesty or the incompetence of this Government.
Sir James Killen-Mr Speaker, it may save time if I indicate that the Government accepts the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.

Motion
Mr KEATING (Blaxland) (2.59)-Mr Speaker, I think it is about time the Government came clean instead of trying to hide behind a ruse. Yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Howard) added to an answer he gave earlier and I sought leave to make a statement on the same subject. For the Government to deny me leave was cowardly in the extreme. What other recourse has the Government now but to grant leave? I will now make some points clear. The question I asked yesterday related to estimates of --
Mr SPEAKER--Order! I interrupt the honourable member for Blaxland to remind him that he now has leave to move his motion and he should move his motion.
Mr KEATINGI move:
That the House condemns the Treasurer for misleading it b) tendering a false commitment to the Parliament on 18 August 1982 in respect of the alteration of official departmental figures for inclusion in the Budget Papers.
I moved this motion because the Government needs to be nailed in regard to the falsification of official documents. It is worth recalling, to get the history of this matter correct, what happened in respect of the 1977 Budget to start with. In respect of the 1977 Budget the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), sought to have an election in 1977 before the expiration of the 1975-78 Parliament which occurred after the mid-term leadership election of the Australian Labor Party in that year. He made it clear that he wanted the capacity to offer tax cuts which he knew we could not afford and which, if paid, would cause a blow-out in the Budget deficit. Since he had made a bogey of Budget deficits there was no way that that blowout could go on.
What happened? In 1977 we saw a falsification of the Budget Papers. The only reason that blowout has ever come to light is the fact that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the former honourable member for Flinders, Sir Phillip Lynch, was hospitalised during the course of the 1977 election and was stood down from the Treasurership by the Prime Minister and told that he would not go back into the Ministry. That Minister made it clear to the Prime Minister that he would table the original Treasury Estimates which would show how the Prime Minister falsified the Budget upon which he was then fightmg an election. That is the basis on which Sir Phillip Lynch went back into the Fraser Ministry, and we all know it. The result was of course that the tax cuts which were offered in Nove:nber were taken away in the following May. We had a massive telephone ring-in so that people could

find out how much their tax cuts would be. The tax cuts were promised for February, and the result was that an election promise was breached within a few months. The tax cuts were given in February and were taken away the following May. The result was that the Budget blew out by $1,OOOm, and the estimates for employment growth were inserted into the Budget Papers by the Prime Minister or at the Prime Minister's behest. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) asked a question about this matter-I had previously raised it in the Parliament-the day after the Budget was presented this year. The Treasurer said:
. . . all the revenue figures in the Budget have been supplied by the Taxation Office, in the case of excise by the Department of Industry and Commerce . . . by the Treasury or, in any other miscellaneous cases, by the relvant expert departments. Nobody at a political level has in any way altered those figures.
I contend that the Treasurer tendered a false statement to Parliament when he said that. He misled the Parliament when he suggested that nobody at the political level in any way altered those figures. I contend that they were altered because the Treasurer knew of the disastrous rate of growth in unemployment that was likely to occur. Indeed, just a few months since the Budget was passed, we are now witnessing that growth. We saw a serious of notices of motion today pointing to the urgency of the matter. Yet the Treasurer understood that to be the case when he made that statement. But the labour market statement, part of Treasury Statement No.2, which the business community, the political community and the Press of this country look to as an indication by the Department of the Treasury of the state of the economy and a true reflection of what has been and of what is to be, contains these sorts of oblique references:
. unlikely to be any growth in employment . .
There was no specification or quantification because the quantification would have embarrassed the Government and so it was removed. My contention is that it was removed at the Treasurer's instructions.
Mr Howard-Are you saying the figures were altered?
Mr KEATING-I am saying that the Treasurer removed them and altered them. To the extent that he changed them, I am not aware.
Mr Howard-Are you saying that I altered the figures?
Mr KEATING-I know the Treasurer changed the statement. He should listen to what [ have to say. Further, in relation to unemployment, that paper states:

Treasurer

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2957

Even so, it is likely that there will be a marked increase in recorded unemployment this year.
That is true; at that time everyone knew it to be the case, but nobody knew it to be as urgent or as severe as it now is or will be. It was only the statement by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) who said in a moment of candour at some subsequent point that unemployment would reach 8+ per cent or would go beyond that figure-we have seen other private estimates of unemployment of around 10 per cent-that causes us to realise just how sanitised this labour market forecast was at page 61 of the Budget Papers. The Budget Papers further state:
the Budget estimales allow for the average number of unemployment benefit recipients to rise from an average of 332,000 in 1981-82 to an average of 395,000 in 1982-83.
When the Budget Papers were published that figure was already 405,000. I think it is well beyond that now. From memory, it is something like 435,000. Indeed when we compare that figure with last year's labour market forecast, we find in the statement in the Budget Papers of 1981-82:
The forecasts provide for growth in total employment of about 2 per cent in 1981-82, compared with 2.6 per cent in 1980-8\. Wage and salary earner employment in 1981-82 is estimated to grow at a similar rate to the total and that rate has been adopted in the Budget estimates for PA YE collections.
The Budget statement refers to participation rates et cetera. There is no way in which one can compare the bland and indeed deceptive statement on the labour market of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in Budget Paper No.2 this year with the explicit way in which it has been treated in previous years. I think the result is clear to all and sundry. The Government was embarrassed by what it saw as the declining state of the economy, the disastrous rise in unemployment and the likely fall in employment. Indeed, even the figures in respect of present recipients was understated as was pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) on the night the Budget was brought down. It is my contention that there was an alteration of Budget Paper No.2 by Professor Hewson at the behest of the Treasurer.
Mr Howard-The figures?
Mr KEATINGYes. The Treasurer has changed and deleted things. He has changed things. I know that he has changed things. He knows that I know that he has changed things because he is embarrassed about it. He will not scramble out of this with any glib phrases.
Mr Howard--I did not know that I knew you knew.
Mr KEATING-The Treasurer should just hold on for a second. I wish to make one point

clear to him. He said that nobody at a political level had in any way altered those figures.
Mr Howard -Figures.
Mr KEATING Figures.
Mr Howard Ah!
Mr KEATING-- The Treasurer is now getting slick. He is talking now about altering figures. What about taking figures out? What about altering the meaning and import of the statement ') Yesterday the Treasurer told us that he runs hi" eye over all these staternents. The Treasurer is moving bit by bit and step by step. He has changed all these lIgures and estimates. The Treasurer has changed the impact of this statement to minimise the effect upon his government as a result of his disastrous economic policies and the dramatic rise in unemployment in this country. I submit to the Parliament that the Treasurer should be condemned for his specific statement that nobody at a political level had in any way altered those figures. He is now trying to sneak Jut of this by saying that he did not alter the figures. Figures may disappear. My complaint is that the quantification of figures, v"hich has been the pattern of preVIOUS iabour market forecasts in the Treasury's statement, is not there this year. The figures are there only in respect of recipients of the unemployment benefit. Of course, we were able to establish that those figures were wrong even on the njght that the Budget was pu.blished. But in respect of the important matters of employment and unemployment there ar:: no figures at all. The T reastner is saying that he has not altered the figures. The point is that there are no figures to alter. If there were figures they have gone. They have gone because the Treasurer has had the statement sanitised.
I ask the Parliament: Where do we go in this nation when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury al!d responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australiall nation can base some economic jUdgment, falsifies that document? It is the habit of this nation to have annual Budgets and Budget statements prepared by the premier department of the Government, the Treasury. Where do we go when we find as we did find, that the 1977 Budget was falsified so that the coalition Government could gll to an election and otTer tax cuts that it knew it could never afford? It gave those tax cuts in February and took them away the following May. Fortunately for the Government nobody found out about it until a couple of years later. But now, when we look at the intrigues, we find that while Sir Phillip Lynch was in hospital lying on his back

2958 REPRESENTATIVES JO November 1982

Treasurer

he was having the Treasurer's job taken from him. The reason he went back into the ministry as Deputy Leader of the Government was that he was going to expose the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the middle of the election campaign by publishing the unaltered versions of the Treasury documentation which showed that there was no way in which the Government could afford tax cuts at the 1977 election and that there was no way in which they could have been offered without blowing the Budget deficit out. That is what happened-the Budget deficit blew out by $1 ,OOOm. Then the Government took the tax cuts away the following May, the action to be effective in July.
We are in a classic situation this year. We were coming up to an election. There was talk about an election this year when this Budget was framed. This Budget has been regarded by everybody as an election Budget. Therefore, this sensitive estimate of the labour market forecasting was sanitised so as to minimise the electoral damage to the Government. It is the most serious charge that can be laid on the Treasurer. This Treasurer has already seen one of his Budgets leaked in its entirety. He has responsibility for the Budgets of this nation yet one Budget---not just snippets; the total Budget-was entirely leaked to the newspapers. Yet the Treasurer sat it out with no thought of resigning, no thought of saying: 'I am responsible for this; I will resign. It was my responsibility'. Whilst he disapproved of the leaking of the Budget he sat it out like he did the tax avoidance issue. He sat for years telling us that he thought that there was a need for new tax laws because the existing laws were inadequate. Andrew Menzies from the Attorney-General's Department during a Senate Estimates hearing said that various divisions of the Department had never examined the existing law. So, the Treasurer moved away from that. His other alibi was the Costigan clause wherein Costigan said that the Treasurer was constrained by the information given to him by the Australian Taxation Office. It was not until a couple of weeks later that we established that there had been a total, free flow of information.
What did we find when the telephone bookthe letters from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Treasurer---was published? The Taxation Commissioner started off in the understated prose of a public servant and then finally screamed in his letters that if the Government did not do something about tax avoidance in terms of criminal sanctions the Taxation Office would have to give this matter up. Yet the Treasurer says that he was not apprised of this. The Government ran

that ruse for a week before the Treasurer went away on his trip overseas. This Treasurer will say anything to save his political skin in respect of the loss of a Budget and the tax avoidance issue. He sat for five critical years while this country was ripped off by all the tax merchants in the nation, all the cheats out there trying to rip off the average taxpayer. He sat for five critical years and watched this go on only to say to us that he needed criminal sanctions, new criminal law, to attack matters of tax avoidance.
Mr Howard-What has this to do with unemployment?
Mr KEATING-I am talking about the Treasurer's record of truth. I am talking about his capacity to stand up here to tell the truth. I suspect that if he tried to lie straight in bed he would end up in the same state as the Prime Minister. I make that clear. On every occasion the Treasurer has been tested-I refer to the loss of the Budget, the veracity of his statements on tax avoidance and, indeed, the specific statement he made on 18 August in respect of the sanitisation of figures for inclusion in the official statements of the Department of the Treasury-he has been found culpable. Yet he believes in the sit it out principle. This dishonourable Government will never stand down a Minister. We have seen the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) almost wreck the meat trade with the United States of America. He was condemned by a royal commissioner. The attack went on the royal commissioner, not on the Minister. He still sits in the Parliament, like the Treasurer sits presiding over the most massive tax avoidance in Australian history. He is still sitting it out.
Today members of the Government regard it as a joke for the Opposition to raise legitimate criticisms of the Government. They sit back with a cavalier approach. They will not give us leave to speak. They use all of the parlimentary tricks against us. It is only when they come up against the sanctions of public and Press opinion that they decide to suspend Standing Orders and let the matter be debated. It was quite clear that this Government wanted an election some time this year. It could not get it. This Budget was designed for an election. The labour market section of Budget Paper No.2 was sanitised at the behest of the Treasurer so as to minimise the electoral damage to the Government were it to go to an early poll. It is just very unfortunate for the Treasurer that the Opposition happened to find out about the shenanigans of Professor Hewson doing the Treasurer's bidding. I could not care less whether he is a member of the Liberal Party. The Treasurer said that nobody at a political level had

Treasurer

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2959

in any way altered those figures. Professor Hewson was employed by the Treasurer on his political staff, on his political tick. That was the point I made yesterday. But the Treasurer came back with this lame excuse that he was a professor, not a political analyst. God, how weak can one get. The substantive question I put was whether in fact the Treasurer had sanitised the Budget figures.
Today, the Treasurer raised a point of order to add to an answer. What do we get added to the answer? We are told that Professor Hewson is not a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. That is big news! No doubt we are all just riveted with that information, absolutely riveted. Let the Treasurer have a look through the Budget Papers. Does he not think it is a little askew that we have seen record unemployment and a decline in employment with factories laying people off all over the place, but there is no assessment in this respect in this document? Does it not seem just a little unusual that there is no assessment and no quantification as there is for the other years? It is quite obvious that the Government has had its evil hand engaged again in the falsification of Budget documents. This Treasurer has misled the Parliament and he should stand condemned for it.
Mr SPEAKER-- Is the motion seconded?
Mr HAWKE (Wills) (3.17)-1 second the motion. As my friend, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has made clear, it needs to be established at the outset of this debate that we are not dealing with some new approach. As he said, this is exactly the sort of approach which was adopted by this Government in 1977 in exactly the same circumstances when it was contemplating an election. It could not bear to have the truth told to the people of Australia and, in 1977, it cooked the books and it has done so again on this occasion. Let me refresh the memory of the House of the judgment made on this matter in 1977 by completely independent observers. This is not a judgment made by the Australian Labor Party; this is a judgment made by independent observers. I have had cause to remind the House of this fact before.
I firstly refer to the article by Max Walsh in Australian Business on 13 May this year in which he analysed the capers that the Government got up to in 1977 in terms of cooking the books, in terms of deceiving this Parliament and in terms of misleading the people of Australia. I refer to what that independent commentator has to say in talking about the year 1977. In referring to the Budget estimates provided in 1977 by Treasury to Cabinet, Walsh said:

the figures were reworked figures was prepared.

A new set of

It was pointed out that the article referred to the Cabinet meeting at which the new figures were
presented. It stated:

'Two senior bureaucrats were present at that meeting. They were the then Head of the Prime Ministers and Cabinet, Sir
Alan (can do) Carmody, and the then Head of Business and Consumer Affairs, Tim Besleythe two men told the Cabinet that the figures were "O.K. ". They were--if you ignored, or
did not believe Treasury's estimate on employment growth Treasury said employment would grow by I per cent
through financial year 1977-78. It is clear that forecast, which proved to be correct, was not used on this basis for the Budget estimates .

That is what was clearly said at that stage. The
article concluded that the 1977 Budget was, from the evidence-and I point out that one cannot
have a more damning indictment from that evidence to which the author referred-'deliberately cooked for election purposes'. I emphasise the phrase 'deliberately cooked for election purposes'. So, there is one independent assessment of the way in which this Government in 1977, for conceived electoral advantage, cooked the books and misled the people.

That is not the only independent observation.
The article by paul Kelly and Andrew Clark in the National Times of 26 August 1978 stated:

'There were at least two areas where the 1977 Budget, described at the time by Mr Lynch as "rubbery", had inserted in it optimistic figures amounting at the financial year's end to
about $230 million.'

The article stated that these were average weekly earnings forecasts and Customs receipts forecasts. The article continued:

But the Prime Minister refused to accept the Treasury
figures and probably sought advice from his own Department. He finally accepted a figure of 10.5 per cent.

On the question of Customs receipts forecasts, the article by Kelly and Clark had this to say:

. . . the Prime Minister rejected a Treasury estimate, and sought alternative advice from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the secretary of his own De-
partment, the late Sir Alan Carmody. Fraser received and approved a Customs revenue figure higher than the Treasury estimates.

So, one sees established right at the outset the facility and veracity of what the honourable member for Blaxland has said in his contribution
on this matter. He is saying that we are not
confronted with something being done for the first time. There is no morality about the people
inhabiting the Treasury benches when they get a sniff of an election in their nostrils. Once they think that there may be an election, truth and
morality go out the window and the figures are cooked. Walsh said it in respect of what happened in 1977; Kelly and Clark also said it in respect of
1977.

2960 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Treasurer

There has never been an) refutation in respect of these claims.
Now we come to what happened in this Budget in this year. As honourable members know, I am in the privileged position of being able to speak in terms of having pointed out at that time that the figures were crook. On the night of 17 August when the Budget was delivered, I pointed out nationally on television that there was no way that the figures could be accurate. I will quote a section of my speech on the Budget to which my friend the honourable member for Blaxland referred. I mentioned the fact that the figures represent an average amount of $395,000 for 1982-83, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Blaxland. I stated:
Yet the number of unemployment benefit recipients in Jul,
This information was already available at that time--
"as alread) 405.000. The Government is forecast-ing. according to the Budget. 'a marked increase in recorded unemployment' this financial year.
I asked:
The question is not: Will the Government's forecast for unemplo)ment bcnclit payments in 1982-83 prove accurate') Rather it is: By how much will that forecast in the Budget "hich is palpably incorrect. be exceeded')
There it was. We were saying this on the night of the Budget and we were saying it in the Parliament in the days and weeks that followed as we had the opportunity to make speeches to this House.
The question obviously arises: What explanation can people give when they are confronted with the fact that it was obvious on the day when the fIgures were presented that they were wrong? With due respect to the House, I question the situation in which people can stand up on this side of the House on the day when the figures come down and say to the Government, the Treasury, and the people of this country: 'Those figures are wrong and it is only a question of time before there will have to be a concession that those figures are wrong?' When that happens. there can be only one of two explanations. One explanation is that, as the Government had the information available, there is deliberate dishonesty and intent on its part to mislead. I do not think that people are going to say that I, as the honourable member for Wills. uniquely on 17 August had the information and the technique of analysis available to me and that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Treasury did not have at least the same resources as I had.
There is, therefore, one possible explanation: They had the same resources, they knew as much

as I did and, we will say, they had the intellectual resources available to match my own to draw the conclusions. If they had the resources, why did they make the wrong statement? The explanation which is available in those circumstances is that there was an intent to put the best possible gloss in August on the economic and employment situation. The Government had already made up its mind at that stage that it would be going to the people in an early election. It made up its mind that, if it were going to call an early election - be it September or October-it did not want the people to know the dimensions of the unemployment situation.
The only other explanation, if there was not a deliberate intent to mislead, is that the Government is guilty of gross incompetence. With all the resources that the Treasurer has available to him within the Public Service, the Treasury and his own staff, are we to be asked to believe seriously the proposition that there was no one there who had the right information or the right techniques of analysis available to him to point out when the level of unmployment benefit recipients for the month of July was already 405,000 that the Government could not possibly say that the average figure for 1982-83 was going to be 395,000. I suggest that there would not have been a single economist in this country who was not on the payroll of this Government who would have swallowed that figure. In other words, I am saying that of the two explanations availableincompetence or a deliberate intent to misleadhonourable members cannot possibly buy the one of incompetence which says that the Government did not have the information available. That proposition simply will not wash.
Let us look at some of the other things that were said in the passage to which my friend the honourable member for Blaxland referred. The first paragraph under 'Labour Market' on page 61 of Statement No.2 says:
The prospect of stagnant economic activity, together with the currently depressed level of profitability and the uncertain economic outlook further ahead, can all be expected to encourage firms to greater efforts to economise on their labour requirements. It follows that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83.
The statement that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment is another example of deliberate misleading of this country. The Government knew that the employment market in this country had already collapsed. It was a deliberate misleading of the people of this country simply to put the gloss on it that there was unlikely to be any growth. The people advising the Treasurer and, I suggest, the Treasurer himself knew that the correst statement was that there would be a

Treasurer

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2961

collapse and a decline in employment. What has happened? Let me point to the figures which are contained in a Press release of mine of 21 October this year. I said:
Australia is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis. The numher of people in full time employment in September
The month after the Budget was released-
was 72,000 lower than a year earlier.
All the evidence had been accumulating in the months leading up to August that the employment market had collapsed. I was saying in Press release after Press release in the months leading up to that Budget that the employment market had collapsed, that the number of jobs was declining. It was therefore a gross misrepresentation for the Treasurer to present to this Parliament a statement which contented itself with saying that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment. Is not this country entitled to have the Government tell it the truth about the economy? Is it not entitled to be told the truth about what has happened to employment and not simply that there is not likely to be any growth? The people of this country should have been told that employment had collapsed and that we were looking at a situation in which the number of jobs available would in fact decline.
As I say, in those circumstances there is only one conclusion to which we can come and that is that the consideration which was overwhelming and predominant in the minds of members of the Government was that we were going to have an early election, so that truth and morality would go out the window and they would cook the books. The Budget should be an honest, direct statement and forecast of what will be confronting this country in the 12 months ahead, but they have used it as a miserable electoral tool to try to mislead the people of this country. That is why today Opposition members gave notice of motions which suggest that this issue should be discussed by the Parliament and that the Parliament should remain in session, Instead of having to put up with this technique of falsehood and misrepresentation for electoral purposes, the Government should accept its responsibility and keep the Parliament in session so that we can, with full honesty, have the situation put properly in front of us and before the people of Australia and we can do what is now being recognised as necessary in many quarters around the world,
There has to be a new direction. Let me name the range of people who have called in the last few days for a new direction-the Pope, Sir Charles Court and Premier Gray of Tasmania. Is it possible that the Pope, Court, Gray and others who

are recognising that we need to undertake new programs and new approaches are all wrong and that this Government, which misleads this country and will not tell it the truth, is right ') What is certainly true and what certainly should be recognised is that the sine qua non of decent debate and getting this country going in the right way is a preparedness on the part of this Government to tell the truth and not mislead this country.
Mr HOWARD (Bennelong - Treasurer) (3.31)--The real shallowness of this motion was best illustrated about one-third of the way through the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who, in his contrived rage and finger poking rhetoric, said: 'You altered it all'. Four or five times I interjected: 'Are you accusing me of altering the figures or are you talking about something else'. For a moment he said: 'The figures'. Then he got a bit worried about that, and so he ought to because it is untrue, and he shifted his ground and started to talk more generally, and for 5+ minutes we had a lecture about tax avoidance. That is how empty the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland was. For 5+ minutes in the middle of a debate about unemployment figures we heard a speech about tax avoidance. Of course the speech of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), whose thunder had been stolen by the intervention of the motion moved by the honourable member for Blaxland and whose speech in support of the suspension of Standing Orders was about as relevant as the 5+-minute speech of the honourable member for Blaxland to which I have just referred, was also caught thoroughly hopping by this exercise by the honourable member for Blaxland.
Let us put aside the rhetoric and let us put aside the personal abuse for which the Opposition, in terms of accusation of lying, untruth and misleading, has scaled new heights over the past few months. I thought the honourable member for Wills might have been a little above some of that. Of course, his stocks are now so low with his colleagues that he has to get down with them on that subject and that approach. I thought a little better of the honourable member for Wills but he has fallen foul. He has to get into it and say: 'They are all crooks, they are all liars and they are all trying to mislead the Parliament'. Even he has to get into it now. He must have felt absolutely terrible when he had to write that letter.
The truth of the matter is that we are dealing with a serious situation. We are dealing with a situation in which the employment position in Australia has deteriorated and deteriorated very

2962 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Treasurer

severely. The one and only point that is at issue in this debate is whether I, on having been given an employment forecast by the Department of the Treasury, instructed that it be altered because that employment forecast was too bad. That is the accusation that has been made by the honourable member for Blaxland. Let me hear now whether I misrepresented the honourable member.
Mr Keating-- You changed the meaning and impact of it.
Mr HOWARD-He says that I changed the meaning and impact of the statement. The honourable member would do terribly in a witness box.
Mr Keating-Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Will the Treasurer table the Treasury document? It will then be all clear.
Mr HOWARD-The honourable member would do brilliantly in a witness box with that sort of performance. He talks about people not being able to answer straight. The honourable member introduced the motion into this house. Talking about misleading figures, I gave the honourable member for Blaxland an opportunity to say whether he was accusing me of cooking the books. I stopped speaking. What did the honourable member do? He backed and shoved and he said: 'You are altering the meaning and impact of it'. He has not got the courage to accuse me of cooking the figures.
Mr Keating--Mr Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented. I contend that the Treasurer took the figures out. It is not a matter of altering them.
Mr SPEAKER-I will call the honourable gentleman on a personal explanation later.
Mr HOWARD--I have now taken the figures out! 1 have not cooked them; I have not altered them. 1 have now taken them out. The honourable member for Blaxland, once again, is shifting his ground. 1 think that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is looking better every day as the shadow Treasurer so far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned.
The fact of the matter is that on 8 October this year 1 was advised by my Department that, primarily on the basis of the figures then available for the early months of the financial year, it had concluded that the Budget estimate of unemployment benefit recipients was a considerable understatement and that substantial additions to estimated outlays would be involved. That is the advice 1 was given by the Department on 8 October.
The other piece of misinformation being put around by the honourable member for Blaxland

relates to the role of Professor Hewson, who is a very valued member of my staff, has been a valued member of my staff, and has been an economic and political adviser to me in the whole time. I have been Treasurer. Professor Hewson does, of course, assist me in going over submissions put to me by the Treasury. What else would an economic consultant do? What on earth does one employ somebody in a political and economic role on one's staff for other than to do that? Why would one not do that? Anybody in the Labor Party should not be heard to say that a person should not have private office staff capable of giving a bit of advice.
The suggestion that in some way Professor Hewson reduced the unemployment estimate figure is absolute nonsense. In reality, at various stages of the discussion, Professor Hewson raised with me the question of whether the unemployment estimates which were being submitted might in fact not have been a little too optimistic in all the circumstances. Nonetheless, they were the figures that were submitted. It was a firm determination on the part of the Government that, in relation to the actual figures to go in the Estimates, we were going to adopt the figures submitted to us by departments. I do not say this critically of the Treasury. I have had my differences with the Treasury and no doubt I will have differences with it in the future, but I respect it very greatly as a department. It, like any other department, can get estimates wrong. It, like any other department, can give wrong advice. But in the five years in which I have been Treasurer of this country I believe that I have always been the beneficiary of competent, professional advice, even though on occasions I have not agreed with it and even though on occasions it has been proved to be wrong. Let us put to one side completely and utterly any question of my criticising the Treasury or distancing myself from the Treasury.
Let us get one thing straight. The figures that went into the Budget Papers were departmental figures. They were not adjusted by Professor Hewson or by anybody else. They were departmental figures. The explanation that can very readily be given is that the Budget estimate was derived from the Treasury's forecast of actual unemployment, as measured by the Commonwealth Statistician, converted to unemployment benefit recipients by the use of a ratio which, of course, also had to be forecast for 1982-83. This ratio, which represents the proportion of the unemployed receiving unemployment benefit, had increased substantially over the past decade from 23 per cent in 1971-72 to 79 per cent in 1981-82. However, it had been fairly stable in the last few

Treasurer

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2963

years. For the Budget estimate the Treasury assumed that there would be only a very moderate increase to 80 per cent.
The figures for the first few months mentioned above-this is speaking as at a time after 8 October-suggested that the ratio had risen to about 88 per cent. The reason for this marked and sudden shift appeared to be that a substantial part of the increase in unemployment had occurred amongst adult males. Males have a cor:siderably higher propensity to seek the unemployment benefit than do females. In fact, the number of males in receipt of unemployment benefit was about 110 per cent of male unemployment as measured by the Statistician. For females the proportion was only about 60 per cent. I should add that the improbably high figure for males reflects the different definitional basis of the two sets of data which could be taken as being indicative of substantial numbers of part time employees receiving unemployment benefit. Hence, with the increase in unemployment being concentrated among males, the proportion of the unemployed receiving benefits had risen substantially.
The Treasury observed that whether the increase in the ratio would be sustained, would increase further or would decline, was difficult to gauge. Its analysis of the experience of the 1970s did not provide much guidance. The concentration of the increase in unemployment among males may have had much to do with the shake out in the labour market following the wage surge and the concentration of that in the manufacturing and construction industries. Future increases in unemployment might be more evenly distributed across males and females. There was generally a seasonal decline in the ratio from December with the annual influx of school leavers. The Treasury was inclined to revise its estimate on the assumption that there would be no further significant change in the ratio this financial year.
That is the explanation of what happened. Honourable members opposite can choose to disbelieve that. They can say that, therefore, I misled the Parliament, that I was in a conspiracy with my Department, that I was in a conspiracy with my colleagues in the Cabinet or that I was in a conspiracy with my colleagues on my staff. Honourable members opposite can choose to argue that until they are blue in the face but they will not get to first base because the fact remains that people on that side of the House who are honest know darn well that this Government and I, in particular, on this issue have not been guilty in any sense, shape or form of misleading the Parliament. I am happy to stay here until doomsday and debate

that point with the honourable member for Blaxland, the honourable member for Wills, the honourable member for Gellibrand, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) or indeed anybody else.
I like debating with the honourable member for Blaxland because he really is such a marvellous performer in the witness box. He has that infinite capacity to shift his ground according to changing circumstances. He has that great capacity to start like Emile Zola, saying: 'I accuse, I accuse'. That is how he starts. But as time goes on and he realises that he has gone in a little too deeply he finds that he has to back back a bit. He is probably being tugged on the coat tails by his recently acquired mate, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). He is being tugged a little by the Leader of the Opposition who is saying: 'Steady down Paul, you might be going a bit too far'. He realises that he is a bit far in. Of course, what does he say when I put the blunt question to him asking: 'Are you really accusing me of altering the figures?' He does not say: 'Yes, I am'. No, he says: 'I am accusing you of altering the meaning, the thrust and the impact of Statement No.2'. I say that this motion moved by the honourable member for Blaxland is a sham motion. It is a hollow motion. If the Opposition really cared about unemployment it would not move motions such as this. I now move:
That the question be put.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Original question resolved in the negative.

AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND: CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS
Ministerial Statement
Mr ANTHONY (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Resources)--by leave-I wish to advise the House that the Government has approved a comprehensive package of new arrangements to govern trans-Tasman trade under a closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand. These arrangements cover the most far-reaching economic undertakings that Australia has yet made in a bilateral agreement. The Government's decision was taken following Cabinet's consideration of a report on my meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Muldoon, in Wellington on 28 October. At that meeting, Mr Muldoon and I reached agreement on a number of variations to earlier proposals and

agreed to put these to our respective Cabinets for endorsement. New Zealand's acceptance of the new arrangements was announced by Mr Muldoon on I November. It is proposed that the formal signature of the heads of agreement for a new trade treaty will take place within the next few weeks, and the new arrangements will apply from I January 1983.
The decision by both governments to implement new trading arrangements completes a process of detailed study, consultation and negotiation which was formally launched after a meeting between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Mr Muldoon in Wellington in March 1980. A joint communique issued by the two Prime Ministers was tabled in this House by the Prime Minister on 25 March 1980. That communique referred to close relationships which had developed between Australia and New Zealand across a wide front, and said that an appropriately structured closer economic relationship would bring benefits to both countries and improve living standards. The new arrangements give practical meaning to that view in respect of trade. They are a logical step forward in a series of trade agreements between our two countries which started with the preferential Trade Agreement of 1922, and led through to the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement of 1965 and the 1977 Agreement on Tariffs and Tariff Preferences. The previous framework of agreements supported the development of a vigorous trade across the Tasman and recognised the fact that each country is the other's major export market for manufacturers. By removing the remaining trade barriers, the new arrangements are expected to further expand this trade, with positive effects on production and employment.
When he tabled the 1980 joint communique,
the Prime Minister gave an assurance that there would be full consultation with interested parties, and that the details of any proposed new arrange-
ments would be made public before substantive decisions were taken. In keeping with that commitment, on 4 June this year the Australian and new Zealand governments released a report containing draft Heads of Agreement for proposed new arrangements to govern transTasman trade under a closer economic relationship. The main aim of these proposals was quite simply the gradual and progressive liberalisation of trade across the Tasman for all goods produced in either country. With this in view, there was provision for the phasing out of tariffs within five years of the commencement of an agreement. There was also provision for the progressive removal by New Zealand of import licensing and

Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations 10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2967

tariff quotas, by increasing access by 10 per cent a year in real terms, and completely eliminating these restrictions by 1995 at the latest. It was agreed that in the long term, there should not be export subsidies and incentives in trans-Tasman trade, and all performance-based export incentives were to be removed no later than 1987.
The draft Heads of Agreement released in June gave full details of proposed arrangements, but it is important to note that the proposals envisaged modified arrangements for a small range of goods. Some of these arrangements, such as those for dairy products and wine, were based on agreements reached between the respective Australian and New Zealand industries. It is also important to note that the draft Heads of Agreement included provisions for consultations and safeguards to offset any unfair advantages which might arise from dumping, subsidisation or intermediate goods problems. There were also general safeguard provisions to cover any cases of severe material injury arising from the trade liberalisation process during the transition period of the agreement. In addition, the draft Heads of Agreement covered such matters as rationalisation, government purchasing, agricultural stabilisation and standards, all of which are significant in a free trading relationship.
After those draft proposals were released, Commonwealth Ministers and officials held extensive consultations with State governments, national industry organisations and other interested parties throughout Australia. These consultations showed that there was widespread support in principle in Australia for the objectives of the proposed new arrangements, that is, bringing about equality in trading opportunities and fair competition in trans-Tasman trade. There was a wide recognition also that the proposed arrangement will result in an improvement, over time, in the inequalities facing Australian industry under NAFTA. At the same time, however, there was criticism of certain aspects of the draft proposals. The strongest criticism was directed at the proposed dates for the ultimate elimination in trans-Tasman trade of performance-based export incentives and import restrictions, by 1987 and 1995 respectively.
Taking account of reactions to the draft package, Mr Muldoon and I tried, in the final phase of negotiations, to explore the scope for mutually acceptable modifications and improvements in the arrangements, consistent with the guiding principles and objectives of the closer economic relationship. While it did not prove possible to provide for earlier termination of export incentives and import restrictions, we reached agreement on

the means by which certain measures would be modified to take account of Australian concerns. It has been agreed that performance-based incentives available to New Zealand exporters in transTasman trade will be halved in 1985, with further reductions of 25 per cent in 1986 and 1987. This agreement does not preclude faster phase-down arrangements being established by the New Zealand Government as a result of its current review of future export assistance policy. Furthermore, I have been assured that Australia's concerns will be a major consideration of the New Zealand Government in its review.
On import restrictions, it has been agreed to double the minimum access levels applying under the Iiberalisation formula, from $NZ200,OOO to $NZ400,OOO in each item code-quota category. Further, it has been agreed that the 10 per cent a year real growth in access opportunities, generated under the standard liberalisation formula, will be increased to 15 per cent a year for all
item codes-quota categories where access opportunities are below $NZlm. This higher rate will apply until such time as access opportunities reach or exceed $NZ Im; after that, a 10 per cent growth factor will apply. These modifications will result in a significant increase in access opportunities available to Australian exporters in the first year and will, of course, be compounded as New Zealand's import licensing regime is progressively liberalised under the new agreement.
It is important to recognise that both countries do not enter the exercise from equal positions, in terms of the nature and extent of protective and assistance mechanisms available to their respective industries. The industrial bases in each country also differ in their breadth and composition. For these and other reasons, it was necessary in the negotiations to strike a balance between achieving equality of opportunity and fair competition between the two countries as soon as possible and the need for gradualism in the trade Iiberalisation process to allow time for industries on both sides to adjust.
The Government is aware of suggestions that detailed studies are required to ensure that the proposed new arrangements carry no adverse implications for particular States, regions or industries. There have also been suggestions that special adjustment assistance may be needed. The Government does recognise the concerns underlying such proposals. It does not, however, consider that such measures are necessary. It is also satisfied that the new arrangements do not carry any significant adverse implications, either short or long term, for employment or regional activity. On the contrary, the overall impact is expected to

2968 REPRESENTATIYES 10 November 1982 Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations

be positive. This is because the provisions of the new agreement, which will be the most comprehensive bilateral trade agreement ever negotiated by Australia, are designed to apply gradually, to minimise disruption and to provide for adequate safeguards. In addition, special arrangements for modified programs have already been established, as I have stated, for industries which are regarded as particularly sensitive to increased transTasman competition.
It must be recognised, however, that there are still sections of industry that feel concern over the possible impact of the proposed agreement on closer economic relations. I believe the great majority of these fears can be clearly shown to be misplaced-indeed, it can be shown that without closer economic relations it would not be possible to find solutions for several existing inequities in trans-Tasman trade. In the timber industry, for example, there are fears that the proposed agreement will lead to unfair competition from increased imports. The fact is, under the proposed arrangements there will be no change in duty and access provisions for trans-Tasman trade in sawn timber and plywood. Trade across the Tasman in these products has been duty-free and unrestricted since 1966. Without the proposed new agreement, moreover, there would be no redress of inequities such as New Zealand's exports incentives and lack of free access for other forest products. This applies to other sensitive areas, such as horticultural products.
Performance-based export incentives are probably the issue of greatest concern to the industry, and some people will probably be disappointed that it has not been possible to remove these even earlier. However, Australian industry will retain its existing right to take action against New Zealand imports where it can be shown that dumped or subsidised imports are causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry. Some Australian industries, indeed, have already sought anti-dumping or countervailing action. I do regret that such action has become necessary, 'Particularly when it occurs in industry sectors where it had been hoped that industry-toindustry understandings could be reached. Unfortunately efforts to come to understandings on sawn timber and plywood have not yet produced positive results. It is to be hoped that, in the very near future, satisfactory joint industry undertakings can be reached. I would hope that, generally, any problems that might arise would be resolved through consultations, avoiding the need for resort to anti-dumping or countervailing action.
A number of other improvements and modifications have been agreed, in respect of aspects of

export incentives and import restrictions, allocations of exclusive access, transitional safeguards, intermediate goods, government purchasing and a number of specific product issues. Overall, I believe that this agreement represents an outcome with which both sides should be well pleased. The decision to proceed puts both countries on the threshold of a new and most comprehensive trading arrangement. Both Australia and New Zealand can look forward to growing transTasman trade, to the benefit of both their peoples, and they can look forward also through this agreement to the security that will come from a strengthened ability to contribute to the development of the region. Around the world today, we see increasing trade restrictions threatening international economic growth, and inward-looking policies in many countries becoming the order of the day. It is timely, in these circumstances, to remind ourselves that the commitment we are making to trade and commercial expansion between Australia and New Zealand has the ability to add to the wealth and employment for both our countries. If similar faith and vision can be displayed in forthcoming international forums where trading problems are to be dealt with, we will be well on the way, I believe, to achieving the international economic recovery that we all so deeply want to seek. I present the following paper:
Australia-New ZealandCloser Economic Relations~- Ministerial Statement, 10 November 1982.
Mr HURFORD (Adelaide)-by leaveCloser economic relations with New Zealand are a very proper aspiration for our country and are supported in principle by the Australian Labor Party. We could have made difficulties for our political opponents during the delicate negotiations which have taken place. We did not do so. I believe in that respect we did not act as our political opponents would have acted had the boot been on the other foot, if the Government's actions during its time in opposition between 1972-75 are any guide. There will be a limit to my charity, and I will come to that in a moment. I will continue talking about principles.
Our Labor Party policy states that the carrying out of adjustments to protective measures should be done through processes of international negotiations. In the past, we have made the mistake of carrying these out in a unilateral, across the board way. We have learned by those mistakes. We reject unilateral moves. We commit ourselves to the planned negotiated approach such as is evident in the statement just read by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). We realised that the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement was dead. We realised that something had to take its

Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations 10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2969

place. As I said, we have not in any way made difficulties for the Government in its delicate negotiations.
Having said that about the principles, I state that my personal approach to the statement made today is one which is characterised by faith, hope and charity. We have a common market of 18 million people-I 5 million here in Australia and three million in New Zealand. That total of 18 million people is far better than separate markets of 15 million people here on the one hand and three million people in New Zealand on the other hand. It would have been better if New Zealand had come into some form of union with us in 1900. Foolishly it did not do so, and relatively, its standard of living has declined when compared with ours to the point where it is now well below our standard of living. That is why we have that enormous immigration across the Tasman from New Zealand to Australia. There would have been less cost to us if this union had been arrived at in 1925 rather than in 1950 or 1975. Certainly there would have been less cost if the union had come earlier than in 1982. We have to face the facts that the cost of making this act of faith is less now than it would be at the end of the century.
I mentioned hope as well as faith. We must enter into this union in a spirit of optimism. It is a tragedy for us all that this is happening at a time of economic crisis foisted on this country by monetarism-or Friedmanism as it is sometimes called-which I know to be a false doctrine. It is affecting us through the low level of international economic activity-that low level of activity caused by Reaganonomics in the United States. Monetarism is affecting that engine economy and affecting this country through what is known here as Fraserism. It is a tragedy that in many respects we are making this leap into the unknown, making this act of faith, at a time of such uncertainty here in Australia, at a time of economic crisis when so many people are being retrenched. Quite understandably, there is much scepticism abroad in our country that a sick Australian economy is now tying itself to one of the sickest economies in our region. Let us hope that in some way the union of two sick economies will help to make the total more healthy.
The third characteristic that I mentioned was charity. Frankly, there is a distinct limit to my charity when it comes to the details negotiated in this agreement at present in relation to the manufacturing sector. I believe that it is unfortunate for Australia that we have not had negotiating on our behalf a person with a commitment to the manufacturing sector. I make the claim that the Acting

Prime Minister may have looked after the Australian countryside. The Government has agreed that my colleage the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, will also have a short time to respond in this debate. He will tell us about the effect of the agreement on our countryside. However, what I say is that manufacturing industry has not been looked after as I believe it should have been looked after. I believe that the lack of commitment of the Acting Prime Minister to manufacturing is shown for instance in a report in today's Canberra Times to the effect that he made the claim that Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has exclusive rights to 85 per cent of our domestic steel markets.
It is relevant that I point out in passing just how wrong the Acting Prime Minister has been on numerous occasions in relation to our manufacturing industry. Apparently he is not aware that the recent Government decision applies to only approximately 50 per cent of BHP's domestic production and that absolutely no guarantees have been given elsewhere. Apparently he is not aware that the so called 85 per cent exclusive right is based on some extremely shaky assumptions about the size of the domestic market this year. These are assumptions which are hopelessly optimistic. Apparently he has not been aware that in those areas not covered by tariff quotas import shares are expected to be as high as 21 per cent. In the case of John Lysaght (Aust) Ltd and Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, the import shares are expected to be in excess of 30 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. I believe that this is relevant because it shows that we have in the person that has negotiated on the part of Australia someone who has not understood the problems of Australian manufacturing. That is manifested in three particular areas of the agreement. I will come to those now. I believe that what the Acting Prime Minister is saying-and is reported even in today's Press as saying-shows he makes attacks on Australian industries which have undermined business confidence in this country and which are threatening yet more jobs.
The first of the three areas that I mention briefly is export incentives. These performancebased incentives will only be halved, when they are New Zealand incentives, by 1985 with further reductions of 25 per cent in 1986 and 1987. I am glad about the improvements to the original agreement that was given to us in draft form, but still they do not go far enough when we focus on the fact that Australia's export expansion grants scheme is to be phased out in 1983. This must give

2970 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982 Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations

the New Zealand exporter a considerable advantage. New Zealand also has a myriad of other schemes, incentives and allowances which can amount to a subsidy, I am told, of about 25 per cent of its exports in addition to its performance based export incentives, and there is no mention of any changes in or the phasing out of those
schemes.
The second area concerns import restrictions. There will now be some improvement in the final document, but still there is this matter of New Zealand import restrictions not being phased out entirely until 1995. This is not welcome for our country because it will mean that we will not be able to export to New Zealand what might otherwise have been exported. The third area that needs to be mentioned concerns what are known as intermediate goods. The problem still has not been solved; no improvement was stated in the Acting Prime Minister's statement today. This spells great dangers for certain industries, such as plastics and lawn mowers. A number of Australian companies may well be forced to move offshore to New Zealand to gain the advantage of cheaper inputs. Because those inputs go into New Zealand free oftariffs these companies will go offshore, manufacture there, and be able to export to Australia whereas previously, of course, they created jobs here by making the products here.
I believe that New Zealand and Australia should have negotiated to have a common external tariff. There is no commitment in the agreement to establishing that common external tariff and by-law policy. What use is there in rhetorical statements about the virtues of a common trade zone when different tariff structures are operating? This is particularly so, I repeat, with intermediate goods. I agreed that the time for which I would speak would be limited. It is unfortunate because this is an enormously important subject for our country. I repeat that, in principle, the Australian Labor Party and I are in favour of closer economic relations with New Zealand. I regret that there has not been tougher bargaining on the part of Australia when it comes to a number of manufacturing products. I leave it to my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa to
talk about the effect on the Australian countryside.
Mr KERIN (Werriwa)~by leave~The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) is of vital concern to primary producers, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania. I am disappointed that there is not to be a full scale debate because I and other members of the Opposition representing rural seats have been lobbied very strongly by

representatives of those rural industries which think that they may be affected or which quite clearly will be affected. I am rather disappointed that the Tasmanian members particularly and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will not seek to speak on this very important matter.
As my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide, Mr Hurford, has already said, the Australian Labor Party is not opposed to closer economic relations. I believe we all have to be in favour of freer trade. We cannot very well lecture the European Economic Community on some of its crazy economic policies with respect to restrictions on agricultural trade and at the same time not enter into freer trade with New Zealand. This does not mean that there is not room for a lot of legitimate debate between the parties in the Parliament and with a fair degree of commonality on the transition arrangements, particularly in respect of timing, safeguards and the need or otherwise for adjustment measures.
The Minister in his statement today said that the Government does not see any need for adjustment measures. We simply say that there may be a need for adjustment measures. Representatives of the primary industries to whom I have spoken, and representatives in Tasmania in particular, are not expressing quite as much concern now as they did a while ago. In other words, they are adopting a somewhat suck it and see principle. This does not mean that they have not identified their real concerns and worries. I still put it to the House that there is ro~)m for genuine concern as this relationship unfolds. Representatives of the horticultural industry~particularly berries, peas, beans and potatotes~and the dairy, forestry and fishing industries have expressed concern to me. Detailed submissions have been made and many representatives of the industry groups have come to the Opposition. As we know, the primary industries are divided on some of the free trade issues, but the industries that will be affected certainly do see the need for protection to a greater degree.
I refer to the forestry industry. The Minister's statement today detailed what is happening in that industry to some degree but he left out the matter of particle board. Thousands of people in the timber industry are being put off. By definition that does not mean that CER can be responsible for that because we do not have CER. I wish some people petitioning me could understand that point. Even so, they have some worries about the future. There are ongoing problems with respect to our two timber industries. Whereas once upon a time they were complementary as between hardwood and softwood, now to a large degree

Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations 10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2971

those industries are of a somewhat similar nature. We are not starting off in an exactly parallel situation. I think there is a need for quite a lot of negotiation with representatives of the timber industry, and the Minister has acknowledged that. The Australian Bureau of Customs pointed out on 3 November that it had imposed counterveiling cash securities on imports of square dressed structural softwood timber. That would have amounted to about 19 per cent protection for us and would somewhat have squared with the 10 per cent export incentive given to the New Zealand industry. These are very complex matters. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of the taxation incentives and various other measures given to encourage the New Zealand industry as an example of what we have to be concerned about.
The dairy industry was given the opportunity to discuss these matters with dairy farmers on both sides of the Tasman, but they were putting some faith in the fast track anti-dumping procedure which was to be put in place with the development of CER. The first such reference concerned the Downs Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd and blue vein cheese. It presented a case which was not successful. So the dairy industry has now been thrown back into some state of confusion. Industry representatives are concerned. They just do not believe that the procedures engaged in by the Government or the bureaucracy were sufficient to meet or even properly to judge the case in question.
The Government has pursued this matter with a lot of determination. Government-togovernment negotiations have been going on. The Opposition has not been included in the discussions. But we would like to record our interest, and our continuing interest, given the qualifications which both the honourable member for Adelaide and I have put forward. There have to be winners and losers in this developing relationship. I think that we in the Parliament, the Ministers and the bureaucracies have to be sensitive as this relationship unfolds.
I shall conclude my remarks by referring to the theory of freer trade and the reality and shall put on the record some of the concerns that the horticultural producers have been putting to me. People at Ballarat have put it to me that if potatoes, for example, come across the Tasman a lot more freely than they have in the past, it may have the effect of taking off the high price peaks and therefore the general effect will be to lower returns to potato producers in that area. Processors who are represented on both sides of the Tasman will play ducks and drakes with the prices

to the producers or the suppliers to the integrated processing factories. Some say that the integrator will say: 'Look, boys, we ought to keep the price down this year, otherwise the New Zealand imports will come across'. As we know, many of these food lines are in the hands of the big chain stores and they are already saying: 'We are not going to take any product from you this year; we will take it from New Zealand'. These are the
sorts of concerns-I am not saying they are necessarily 100 per cent legitimate concerns-- that have been expressed by representatives of the horticultural, dairy, timber and fishing industries. If I had time, I could refer to them in more detail. I hope that the Minister and the Government are aware of the need for this issue to be handled sensitively in the interests of the countries on both sides of the Tasman, New Zealand and Australia.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)-The honourable member for Werriwa during the course of his speech sought leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard what was described as a table. In actual fact it is not a table within the criteria laid down by the Speaker for the incorporation of documents. Therefore, it is not permitted to be incorporated in Hansard.
Mr ANTHONY (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Resources)-by \eave-l wish briefly to reply to some of the comments made by the two Opposition speakers. I think a personal explanation needs to be made as I have been misrepresented in a few areas. All through this exercise I have endeavoured to achieve a bipartisan approach to this problem of trans-Tasman trade because I believe it is to the mutual benefit of both countries. To a large extent I believe that that has been achieved. I appreciate the attitude of the Opposition during the course of negotiations. It could have made negotiations more difficult if it had wished to. Those comments were made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I react to his comment that there was not a strong enough negotiator on behalf of manufacturing industries. There were many issues about which we had to negotiate for a long time. Preference was not given to any section. If there was a real need to try to further Australia's position in many of these areas then certainly that was achieved. The real winner, of course, in this whole closer economic relationship will be the Australian manufacturing industry. It is the one that will get the greatest benefit. The improved access that I have now been able to achieve which increased import licences mainly of manufactured goods from $65m in the first year to the present $120m is a very significant move forward. Indeed, the licences to be issued by New Zealand for the first 18 months will

2972 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982 Australia-New Zealand Economic Relations

be 210 million in New Zealand currency. That is a significant improvement.
Steel is one of the special exempted industry products where there will have to be further discussions and negotiations with New Zealand-as there will have to be with the motor industries in both countries-because a long program is involved. But for honourable members opposite to misquote me or to report on misleading statements made about recent speeches or comments that I have made regarding liberalisation of trade, and for them to interpret that as my wanting unilaterally increasing trade access in Australia is totaly wrong. That is not the approach of the Australian Government. We want a multilateral approach to freer trade where other countries make any similar commitment to that which we might make.
I turn now to the comments regarding Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and about my having no understanding of BHP. Any comments I have made about 85 per cent of the market being protected for the Australian steel industry related to that which was under reference and which covered about 2.4 million tonnes of steel. In that case, at the time the investigation was undertaken by the Temporary Assistance Authority, some 15 per cent penetration of the market had been made by imported goods. Australia froze the imports at that level. Of course that level will go down further if consumption in Australia drops. But the
facts of the matter are that imports are frozen at a certain level until there is a complete Industries Assistance Commission report. I would hate there to be any thought amongst people in the manufacturing industry that there was not concern about their interest. One particular matter of interest which was raised by the honourable member was the question of intermediate goods. That is a very complex issue. But at least we came to a formula arrangement so that whenever there was a problem and a protest was lodged within 45 days there would have to be consultations between the two governments and a resolution of the problem within 90 days. The procedures for handling the intermediate problems if and when they arise are laid down in black and white. This has been done with a whole range of aspects dealing with countries of origin, goods and the manufacturing area. For instance. in the white goods area special arrangements have been entered into as with some of the primary industry products whereby the whole phasing out of import licensing in New Zealand will take place on a seven-year to a nineyear basis. This is a much shorter period than the 1995 terminal basis. Special rationalisation arrangements have been made and there is an

understanding in the white goods industry that New Zealand will produce some products and Australian industries will produce other products. That is a very sensible approach to take. But that has not been achieved easily. In fact that is a matter that we have been working on for almost two years to get agreement between industries on both sides of the Tasman. So any thought of negligence or a lack of concern on my part for the manufacturing industry is quite wrong and ill-founded. This needs to be an agreement where all sections of the industry are taken into consideration and concern expressed.
I turn now to the timber industry. The honourable member mentioned that reconstituted particle boards have not been dealt with. That certainly is an area where there has been a great deal of discussion and consultation. It was hoped, at industry to industry discussions that took place in July, that there might have been an understanding or an agreement reached between them. That was not achieved. But I am very hopeful, now we have put countervailing duties on sawn timber and plywood, that the New Zealand industry will come to the party in all these areas of timber products where there are no agreements. There are agreements with the paper and pulp industries at the moment. Once that is done I think Australian industry can rest assured that there will not be undue penetration into the Australian market of New Zealand forest products.
Mr Kerin-It is a pity we cannot have more discussion about that.
Mr ANTHONY-! conclude by stating that I think there is a lot of detail where honourable members opposite might like more information. Officers of my Department will be available should honourable members seek that information. I would be happy to make it available. For instance, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) mentioned that potatoes were coming from New Zealand. No raw potatoes are coming to Australia from New Zealand. Quarantine restrictions have been operating for years yet we keep hearing the furphy that the Australian industry will be ruined by the importation of New Zealand potatoes. The fact of the matter is that potatoes just do not come into Australia. Processed potato products come to Australia from New Zealand and processed potato products are being exported to New Zealand. Actually the balance of trade is very much in Australia's favour and not in New Zealand's favour.

Standing Committee on Road Safety

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2973

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY REPORT ON TYRE SAFETY
Ministerial Statement
Mr HUNT (Gwydir)-Minister for Transport and Construction)-by leave-The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety on Tyre Safety was tabled on II September 1980. the Committee's inquiry was prompted by public concern in 1978 and 1979 particularly regarding the safety of steel belted radial tyres for passenger cars. The Committee is to be congratulated upon the diligence with which it pursued its task. The inquiry and the tabling of the report in themselves contributed significantly to the resolution of issues which prompted the inquiry. For this reason, rather than respond in detail to each of the Committee's 29 recommendations, I will indicate what action is being taken or proposed to further implement them. Many of the recommendations on tyre standards and tyre performance have already been incorporated or are under consideration for inclusion in the Australian Design Rules and Draft Regulations Defining Vehicle Construction, Equipment and Performance Standards developed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council. These specifically take into account: The revision to the United States Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard No. 109 on tyres; the high speed performance requirements as specified in ECE Regulation 30; and the marking of tyres with the date of manufacture.
Draft regulations are being considered to cover issues raised in the recommendations about the substitution of tyres equivalent to those nominated by the manufacturer of a vehicle; standards for spare tyres and temporary spare tyres; application of uniform minimum tyre tread depth requirements; and the operation of vehicles with grossly underinflated tyres. In respect of the need for other standards, ongoing investigations, including monitoring of overseas research, are proposed on the following matters which were the subject of recommendations: The need for testing of tyres under conditions of side force; the practicality of requiring rims to retain deflated tyres under side force; techniques for designing tyres to improve the warning of tread separation; whether flat ledge rims can safely retain tubless tyres; devices to inform drivers of the loss of tyre inflation pressure; and the role of tyres in accident causation.
This last matter has been examined as part of an in-depth study of road accidents in Adelaide

but the results were not conclusive. The other information will be pursued by the Office of Road Safety in conjunction with the technical committees of the Australian Transport Advisory Council.
A number of the recommendations are directed towards publicity and education relating to proper tyre selection and maintenance. I believe that tabling of the Committee's report and the publication of similar reports on tyre safety have already gone some way towards informing the public in this area. ATAC's Publicity Advisory Committee on Education in Road Safety is considering the proposal for publicity on the importance of tyre maintenance, covering the dissemi-
nation of correct tyre pressure information to users and encouraging regular visual inspection of tyres, and making information available to motorcycle riders on tyres and tyre performance.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee proposed regulatory action under the Trade Practices Act, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Attorney-General (Senator
Durack), on replacement and retreaded tyres. Legislation was also proposed to implement compulsory recall of defective or unsafe tyres. The Government would, in these areas, prefer the approach of voluntary recall codes which have worked effectively in relation to motor vehicles and are being further developed. This approach would be quite appropriate for tyres as manufacturers' quality control has already shown marked improvement as is acknowledged in the report. In the event that an unsafe tyre is produced, action can already be taken under section 62 of the Trade Practices Act to ban unsafe goods. The recommendation on recall of defective tyres is being considered by an ATAC task force for the recall
of vehicles or components with safety related defects. The recommendation concerning training courses for employees in the tyre retailing and
retreading industries is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). I understand that his Department is progressing the matter through the National Retail Motor Industry Training Committee.
In summary, the main benefits which can come from the Committee's inquiry have already been achieved. An indication of this is the fact that there is little or no controversy today about the safety of tyres, particularly steel belted radial tyres. Nevertheless, the technical committees of ATAC and my Department's Office of Road Safety are continuing to monitor and review tyre safety and will make recommendations to improve tyre safety further as it becomes necessary

2974 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Standing Committee on Road Safety

to do so. I thank the Committee for its efforts in conducting the inquiry and am pleased to acknowledge the positive action which it stimulated. I present the following paper:
Road Safety-Standing Committee-Report on Tyre Safety-Government response-Ministerial Statement, IO November 1982.
Motion (by Mr Hodgman) proposed:
That the House take note of the paper.
Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (4.38)-The statement by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) provides some information, but really this Government has an abysmal record on road safety. That is again reflected in the statement that has just been made by the Minister on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety on Tyre Safety. There has been more than two years of proscrastination in respect of this report. It has taken more than two years to produce a response which in the main sidesteps almost all the major issues covered in the Committee's 29 recommendations. In fact, the Minister and the Government are paying mere lipservice to what is a critical issue.
One of the first actions of an incoming Australian Labor Party government will be to re-establish the Road Safety and Standards Authority, which was abolished by this Government and which has been replaced by the Office of Road Safety. It is by that Office of Road Safety in the Minister's Department that this response has been drafted. The Office of Road Safety and the whole area of road safety have been starved of resources since 1975. The Office of Road Safety lost most of its staff-two out of every three-in the transfer from Melbourne. In 1980 the Government abolished the Minor Improvements to Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Program--a most effective program, a program that provided for the removal of black spots in traffic conditions, for the channelisation of intersections and for electromatic signals. It was the most cost-effective program on road works or road safety that has been produced in this country. The Budget papers show that since 1975-76 there has been a very sharp cut in real terms in funds for road safety promotion and research other than the half a million dollars that is being provided this year for the promotion of an anti-drink driving campaign.
I turn to the Minister's statement in more detail. This statement, unlike the one that he is to make later, is an abysmal statement. It sidesteps the major problems thrown up by the Committee's recommendations. The Minister, in congratulating the Committee in his opening remarks, in effect, in my opinion, patronised the membership of the Committee. We do not want

kind words and nice thanks from the Minister and from the Government; we want action. We want the Government to take action on the recommendations. That is what we want; not pats on the back. The Minister said on page I of his statement:
Many of the recommendations on lyre standards and tyre performance have already been incorporated or are under consideration for inclusion in the Australian Design Rules and Draft Regulations . . .
The Minister uses that as a reason for not dealing with the individual recommendations. One can refer to other Ministers in this Parliament and to the Minister's own response in a statement on railways to come up later to see that matters are dealt with item by item. There is a recommendation then a government response. Here, in a very important area of road safety, in a very important area of ignorance by motorists-the standard of tyres and their performance-the Minister has lumped all the recommendations together in groups. It is impossible to get any proper analysis of response. It is a totally unsatisfactory way to approach a very serious problem. In the lumping together in the first group the Minister referred to the revision to the United States of America Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard No. 109 on tyres. This is a very important standard because it covers the performance standards in relation to strength and endurance of tyres, walls of tyres and the tread of tyres. The Minister referred to the high speed performance requirements as specified in ECE Regulation 30. This also is a very important regulation. The Minister referred to the marking of tyres with the date of manufacture. This also is very important because the age of the tyre has a bearing on the stability and the performance of the tyre. Unless the motorist is readily aware of the age of the tyre that he is buying he is risking himself and his loved ones by its purchase. Over the years there have been a range of rackets in clearance sale of tyres. The recommendation for the marketing of tyres was a very important recommendation of the Committee.
What has happened with respect to each of those recommendations? Who knows? The Minister has not been able to tell us. Two years and two months to the day almost after this report was presented we have this generalisation of response by the Minister. The Minister went on to say:
Draft regulations are being considered to cover issues raised in the recommendations about: The substitution of tyres equivalent to those nominated by the manufacturer of a vehicle; standards for spare tyres and temporary spare tyres; application of uniform minimum tyre tread depth requirements; and the operation of vehicles with grossly under-inflated tyres.

Standing Committee on Road Safety

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2975

These recommendations are all very important, all critical to life and limb if one experiences hazardous conditions on the roads and one is unaware of a defect or a failing of the tyre in anyone of those conditions. What the Minister really said to us a few minutes ago was that virtually nothing has been done about those recommendations. The Government does not have draft regulations. The Government is saying that draft regulations are being considered. This is after two years and two months. How many people have been injured in the period since this report was presented?
Mr HoweIt doesn't worry them.
Mr MORRIS-Of course it does not worry the Government. That is what I am saying. This is an important matter. It is not a matter for posturing by politicians. It has not been approached that way by the Committee. The Committee, in its deliberations and hearings, operates on a bipartisan basis. Its recommendations are brought forward on that basis. But when Ministers and other politicians go from the Committee to the Parliament to seek political credit for their so-called achievements it becomes another matter. Here we are considering the Government's response to those recommendations. A number of us put quite a deal of work into this matter. The Minister also stated:
In respect of the need for other standards, ongoing investigations, including monitoring of overseas research, are proposed-
Not 'have been taken', not 'have been carried out'; 'areproposed'-
on the following matters which were the subject of recommendations: The need for testing of tyres under conditions of side force;
The report states this is a matter of vital concern if one is buying a tyre, considering the weight to be put on a vehicle or assessing the performance of a tyre. The Minister continued:
the practicality of requiring rims to retain deflated tyres under side force; techniques for designing tyres to improve the warning of tread separation; whether flat ledge rims can safely retain tubeless tyres; and devices to inform drivers of the loss of tyre inflation pressure.
That is important particularly with those who have little mechanical knowledge. They do not know whether the tyre has gone down or whether it has lost several pounds in the course of the operation of the vehicle. If there is an automatic device that registers and shows the driver of the vehicle, male or female, that there has been a substantial deflation of the tyre in the course of the journey he or she is alerted. I am sure a number of honourable members know of cases where a driver has been involved in an accident or a near accident because of the sudden deflation of

a tyre of which they were unaware because of the handling characteristics of the vehicle. It has taken the Minister for Transport and the Government two years to determine the ongoing investigations which are now proposed. The Minister then lumps together the next section of the 29 recommendations. He said:
A number of the recommendations is directed towards publicity and education relating to proper tyre selection and maintenance. I believe the tabling of the Committee's report and the publication of similar reports on tyre safety have already gone some way towards informing the public in this area. ATAC's publicity advisory committee on education and road safety is considering the proposal-
What a wonderful achievement. This is two years and two months after the event and about two more years after the extensive publicity that went on in the Australian media, from police associations, from leading motor writers, from leading commentators and leading journalists about concern with the performance of radial tyres. Something like 3+ to 4 years after this matter came to public notice the Minister and the Fraser Government says: 'Cop Out'. The Minister really said that it is a cop out and the publicity given to this issue by the Road Safety Committee in its bipartisan deliberations has been adequate and it has drawn attention to the problems. It is not good enough. Considering the problems it is not good enough for the people of this country. The Minister continued:
The proposal for publicity on the importance of tyre maintenance, covering the dissemination of correct tyre pressure information to users and encouraging regular visual inspections of tyres . . .
All those things were happening before the Committee started its inquiry. People are supposed to look at and check their tyres. The Minister does not refer to the fact that the Committee found that there are differences in the recommended tyre pressures put out by the manufacturers of the vehicle and by the manufacturers of tyres. In some cases this has happened because the vehicle manufacturers realised that if a radial tyre were inflated to give maximum performance and maximum safety the ride of the vehicle would be harsher. That could go against the sales opportunities of the vehicle. So the vehicle manufacturers recommend a pressure of a few pounds less. From the evidence I heard and the discussions we had in the Committee that has an impact upon the performance and the safe operation of the vehicle.
There was a major problem of inaccuracy of gauges. The Minister said: 'Enough was published about this matter, and people can check their pressures.' But how do they check the pressures accurately? There is sufficient evidence around. I ask any honourable member to check his vehicle's

2976 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Standing Committee on Road Safety

tyre pressure with a proper hand gauge at the next half dozen garages. I am very confident he will not find uniformity in the readings. That is the problem, and that problem has not been addressed here. What is the point of checking tyres if the gauge one is checking them on is inaccurate? The reason for inaccuracy is not the fault of the service station proprietor or the fault of the manufacturer of the gauge, it is rather the fault of the nature of the industry. People check their own tyre pressures. They are urged to do so. They get the gauge in their hand, check the pressure and then throw the gauge on the concrete; and bang, there goes the gauge. The gauge which could have just been serviced that morning, could be 8 lb out in the afternoon. That, again, is a major problem. This has not been addressed by the Minister in his statement or by the Government. It is a serious problem and it does affect the performance of the vehicle. What it affects also importantly, is the motorist's pocket.
One thing that came out very clearly is that whilst there may not be widespread and sharp evidence that an underinflation or minor underinfla-
tion of radial tyres affects the performance of the vehicle, there is very clear evidence that underinflation of radial tyres leads to earlier failure of the tyres. That leads to earlier replacement and motorists having to buy tyres sooner and more often. So in this circumstance to protect the interests of motorists it is important that they know that the tyre pressure is correct and that it is tested with an accurate gauge. As a result they will have a safer vehicle to drive and they will be spending less money on tyres.
The Committee recommended mandatory standards for retreaded tyres. This issue is quite different from the voluntary recall that the Minister addresses on page 4 of this statement. He refers to the preference for the approach of voluntary recall codes where tyres are defective. That is
just not good enough. The Minister referred to a power under section 62 of the Trade Practices Act but that is not good enough. If it had been good enough, if it had been working and if voluntary recall codes had been working, the Committee's inquiry would not have been necessary; the public furore would not have arisen. If those procedures had been followed and if they had been effective we would not be discussing the matter this afternoon.
I put it to the House that what the Minister has said on behalf of the Government represents a policy of danger and irresponsibility. People's lives are put at risk and avoidable expense for motorists incurred by the Government not facing up to the responsibility of ensuring that product

standards are complied with, that the powers of the Trade Practices Commission are used and that mandatory standards for retreaded tyres are introduced. It is shameful that it has taken two years and two months to get to this position in a very important area of road safety.
The second last page of the statement contains a recommendation concerning training courses for employers in tyre retailing and retreading industries. The Minister finds after two years and two months that it is the responsibility of his colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). He has asked him to look into the matter. He could have told the Committee that in 12 hours, but it has taken two years and two months. The Committee's report did not refer to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations; it referred to the recommendation which called for discussion between the States and the Territory education authorities. That is not a sufficient response from the Minister. On the last page he states:
The main benefits which can come from the Committee's inquiry have already been achieved. An indication of this is the fact that there is little or no controversy today .
There are not many complaints. It is like the Treasurer (Mr Howard) saying that we were not doing much about tax avoidance because the people were not asking us to. It is as irresponsible as that. In this case that is an irresponsible assertion by the Minister. It endangers public life and limb. Evidence given to the Committee showed that members of the public were not aware of the nature of the tyre defects or the dangers that arose from underinflation. As I said, it is an irresponsible assertion by the Minister and the Government. It is based on a false assumption that motorists are aware of the cases where premature failure of tyres can contribute to particular road crashes. Recommendations 18 and 24 of the Committee's report relating to a survey by the Office of Road Safety of underinflation of tyres and of the draft regulations to be amended to make it illegal to drive the underinflated tyres appear to have been totally ignored.
In summary, the response is totally unsatisfactory. It is based on irresponsible assertions. It is long overdue. The Government should be condemned for its failure to act and even report on the many recommendations in the report for two years and two months after its tabling. The statement, on a very important subject, is ill presented, irresponsible and ill-considered. What was in the statement for all it is worth could have been presented to this Parliament 48 hours after the tabling of the report. Let me make it clear that a Labor government road safety policy would see

Standing Committee on Expenditure

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2977

the re-establishment of the miters program, the re-establishment of the road safety authority and proper and adequate funding for road safety promotion and research. Road safety would go back to being an issue of high priority and not the poor relation it has become under this Government.
Debate (on motion by Mr McLean) adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON
EXPENDITURE REPORT ON THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
COMMISSION
Ministerial Statement
Mr HUNT (Gwydir-Minister for Transport and Construction)-by leaveThe report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure was tabled in Parliament on II March 1982. The Government has given full and detailed consideration to the Committee's report and I am pleased now to present the Government's response. The Government considers the Committee's report to be a useful and thought provoking evaluation of the problems and prospects of the Commission. The Government agrees with the general thrust of the Committee's report that the Commission should be free to operate in a commercial manner with the minimum of Government intervention consistent with the need for it to be accountable and responsible to the government and the Parliament. The Government applauds the Committee for producing such a comprehensive report and is grateful for the efforts of those involved in carrying out this very significant investigation.
The report's theme is fully in accord with our stated policy towards the Commission and indeed all Government transport business undertakings as exemplified in the new Australian National Railways Commission Bill that is currently before Parliament. While the Government has already taken action to deal with many of the report's recommendations, it has some difficulty with those recommendations relating to the corporate planning processes. As I have already stated, the thrust of the legislation currently before the House is to give the Commission sufficient flexibility to operate in a commercial manner while retaining proper provisions to ensure accountability and responsibility. The Bill requires the Commission to undertake corporate planning processes, but leaves the specific techniques for the judgment of the Commission. I believe this to be the proper approach and note that the reserve powers provided for in the Bill would allow the

Minister to intervene should it be judged necessary.
I note that, in the period since the Committee received the evidence on which it based these conclusions, the Commission has continued to refine its corporate planning processes in the light of the experience it has gained in the use of the techniques involved in corporate planning. There has been quite close correlation between the Commission's financial results and its projected performance. In the light of this I would not propose to intervene in this matter at this stage.
The other major area where the Government has some difficulty with the Committee's recommendations relates to the question of explicit funding of Public Service obligations. The Government agrees that explicit funding of PSOs is desirable in principle. Indeed the new Australian National Railways Commission Bill makes specific provision for reimbursement of costs of complying with Government directions. The Committee recommended that the Commission should not delay applications for PSO funding until accurate cost data is available from its cost management information system. It must be recognised however that the benefits of separate funding of PSOs are highly dependent upon the availability of accurate cost data.
The Government notes that the ANRC is in the process of implementing its cost information system and believes it would be more appropriate to defer explicit funding of PSOs until this system is properly operational and decisions can then be based on accurate cost data. Once again, I commend the Committee for the work that it has done in preparing this report. I table a document detailing the Government's response to each of the Committee's recommendations.
Mr MORRIS (Shortiand)-by leave-Mr Speaker-
Mr Charles Jones-Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I note that the Minister has just tabled a document which is obviously not a table. Bearing in mind your ruling on tabling and incorporating documents in Hansard, I ask: Is the document to be incorporated in Hansard or only tabled?
Mr SPEAKER-It is only tabled.
Mr Charles Jones-That is okay.
Mr MORRIS-The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), which comes some eight months after the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure tabled its report on the Australian National Railways Commission. We have had a more prompt response

2978 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Standing Committee on Expenditure

than usual from the Government. In acknowledging the Minister's compliments in respect of the work of the Committee, I should also point out, on behalf of my colleagues, that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) has acknowledged, on an earlier occasion, the major input that was made to the Committee's deliberations and report by members of the Opposition. The recommendations of this report were bipartisan from all those concerned on the Committee. In the main, this report sets a model for style of presentation compared with the previous report I have referred to by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. The style of presentation is set out well. Detail is provided in respect of each of the recommendations of the Committee. Generally the recommendations of the Committee are accepted.
My comments will be brief as I have promised to restrict my remarks to enable other speakers to participate. We welcome the statement. It generally accepts the recommendations of the Committee. I will refer briefly to those matters that it does not accept. Recommendation No.4 refers to establishing a public complaints mechanism. We cannot agree with the Government that any complaints in respect of rail charges and over charging-obviously we include quality of service-should be referred to the relevant Minister or the Ombudsman. That is all very well for those who have access to those services, who can readily make contact and can readily put in a complaint at the time when the problem occurs. There should be a consumer mechanism-not necessarily a tribunal-by which people who are dissatisfied or aggrieved about the quality, nature or cost of the service, whether it is freight or passenger, can take their complaints to the Commission. I think it is to the Commission's benefit to have that kind of facility available to the public. I recommend to honourable members who are interested in the activities of the CommissIOn and the Committee that they should read the statement which has been tabled by the Minister. The Government's acceptance of what the Committee proposes in recommendation No. 12, in respect of Public Service obligations, is only a half-half exercise. Where the Commission is required to operate services which are loss incurring or which, in the course of normal commercial operations, would not otherwise operate, we wish to see the cost of those services separately identified. There should be a direction from the Minister to operate such services. The cost of the operation of each direction should be presented to the Parliament. It does not matter whether it is presented in the

annual report or elsewhere, so long as it is presented in a separate statement. I will come back to
that shortly.
The Government did not agree with recommendation No. 13 that Australian National should not be allowed to delay applications for Public Service obligations until its new cost management information system came into operation. The Minister referred to that in his statement. He made that point. I do not accept that; the Opposition cannot accept it. The argument advanced by the Government is that the full benefits of the Public Service obligations procedure depend very much on the availability of
accurate cost data and on a range of levels of service for each candidate activity. As a new system has come in and there has been an amalgamation of three other systems, accurate data is not available: That is really what the Minister is saying. Under the present system, the cost of those kinds of services is buried in the total loss recorded by the Australian National Railways Commission. I put this proposition to the House: If the information that now is being prepared and acted upon by the Commission is not accurate enough for the costing of Public Service obligations, how the devil does the Commissioner arrive at decisions in respect of rates, passenger fares and the preparation of its accounts? I think it is quite invalid for the Minister to advance the argument that Public Service obligations should be delayed until the new cost information system is fully
operational.
There is a partial recognition of the level of accountability endorsed by the Committee in recommendation 14. We wish to see full accountability in the terms recommended particularly in respect of Public Service obligations. Recommendation No. 15 deals with capital. The Government has agreed to the recommendation but in the Australian National Railways Commission Bill, which, is on the Notice Paper of this House, there is in our view inadequate acceptance of the Committee's recommendation. The capital value picked up is that taken out of the existing accounts. The Bill provides power for the Minister for Finance to set the capital value in the accounts of the Commission. The reason why we are so interested in and have some concern about this item is that the Commission's performance is measured publicly and in debate by the return on its capital. If the capital is inflated or understated for political reasons the public perception of the performance of the Commission is inaccurate and there is a totally distorted public understanding of the performance of the Railways Commission and of the services it provides. For that reason-that

Standing Committee on Expenditure

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2979

there be proper public accountability and understanding of the performance of the Commission~we believe the capital should be dealt with in the manner recommended by the Committee. That is a matter with which I will deal when that Bill comes back to the House. I will have more time to discuss that matter then.
Other recommendations are Nos 19 and 20. Recommendation No. 21 has been partly picked up. Recommendation No. 22 relating to an effective commercial division has been partly picked up. Recommendation No.2S(c) relates to an alternative scheme and consultation about superannuation. The Committee argue~we believe correctly~that where the Commission incurs ad-
ditional expense for superannuation funding, any addition above that available in the comparable private sector should be treated as a Public Service obligation. That is the way the Government is treating Trans Australia Airlines. The point to be made again is that these public authority transport undertakings had no say in the imposition on them by government of these new superannuation liabilities. In those circumstances, if they are to be accounted and assessed properly, government should pick up the responsibility for the additional superannuation charges involved. As I have said, that point conflicts with the Government's action in respect of TAA.
Recommendation No. 28(b) relates to the alternatives available to improve intersystem railway operational and marketing practices. That is a very important recommendation of the Committee. The Commission gave evidence on the rail freights being set for intersystem and interstate traffic. The Commission finds it extremely difficult to charge effective and realistic rates. The Government's response to this recommendation seems to have ignored the real problem. It has talked about investment and non-investment measures. I ask the Government to consider that item again, to take another look at it and to concentrate on the intersystem rating problems it involves. In general terms we welcome the statement. It is a well prepared statement. It has come forward fairly promptly and has picked up most of the recommendations of the Committee.
Mr LUSHER (Hume)~by leave~The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure welcomes the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) in this Government response to the Committee's report on the Australian National Railways Commission. It also acknowledges, as the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) pointed out, that the Government has responded in relatively quick time. In fact, this is the second

best response time the Committee has had from the Government in relation to its reports. The response is generally supportive of the Committee's recommendations and the Committee is pleased that that is the case. We are delighted that the Government agrees with the thrust of the Committee's report.
I want to make only two very brief comments. One relates to corporate planning. The evidence available to the Committee was that the early record of Australian National in relation to its corporate planning was far from good. The Minister in his statement says that the situation is now very much better and the Committee is pleased that that is the case. I think the points made by the Committee in the report are still valid in that the bases of the corporate plan are very suspect. They ought to be looked at by Australian National if they have not been. The Committee believed that Australian National would not break even by 1988 but we are pleased that things are in a lot better shape, according to the statement made by the Minister. The Committee will give consideration to taking further evidence from Australian National on the corporate plan to see whether, in fact, things have advanced in the way in which it appears that they have.
I would like to make a comment also in relation to the Public Service obligations. We welcome very much the commitment which the Minister has made and which is incorporated in the legislation before the House that the Public Service obligations will be funded once the Cost Management Information System is in operation. I would like to point out that it is contradictory to have a commercial objective on the one hand and Public Service obligations on the other. I think that is acknowledged. No private enterprise operator would run at a loss at the request of the Government. One of the points that concerns us is that it has already taken eight years for the Cost Management Information System to be implemented. I think it would be helpful to know when it may be available so that Australian
National will have the basis on which to make claims to government for its Public Service obligations. But the Committee expressed the view that it should be being done manually, that Australian National should be putting the claims into government and that it would be up to government to contest those claims if, in fact, it thought that they were being improperly made.
I thank the Minister very much for the response he has made, firstly, because it is a rapid response and, secondly, because it is a supportive response. Members of the Committee who have put time into a report such as the amount of time that went

2980 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

into the Australian National report appreciate nothing more than a supportive response from the Government.
SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT
Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed:
That the House. at its rising. adjourn until a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker. or in the event of Mr Speaker being unavailable. by the Chairman of Committees, which time of meeting shall be notified by Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees to each member by telegram or letter.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (5. II )-The Opposition cannot agree with this motion because it means, in the terms in which it has been moved, that we will not know exactly when the House will resume sitting. I think we are aware of the fact that there are still some 70 Bills to be considered in the Senate, which proves, of course, that the House has functioned rather assiduously in dealing with legislation. There are very many other matters that this Parliament ought to be discussing, as honourable members would note from what took place earlier this afternoon when at least 18 notices of motion were given all indicating the problems involving unemployment in a number of electorates in Australia. It is counter-productive for the Government to say now that we will adjourn to some date in the future. We ought to come back in a week's time as there could be legislation from the Senate to consider and, more importantly, the House of Representatives Notice Paper could be dealt with adequately.
As honourable members are now having to grapple in their electorates and, in fact, throughout the nation with the massive problem of unemployment, it is important that this House discuss those matters. This afternoon 18 of my colleagues saw fit to give notices of motion indicating that they in turn want to discuss specific matters in each of their electorates. I think they are fully entitled to be able to discuss those matters.
Mr Bradfield-Oh!
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-It is no laughing matter. As the honourable member knows, we have massive unemployment now with enormous numbers of lay-offs about to occur. What is wrong with this House continuing to sit? It seems to me that the Government has run out of steam. It has lost its cohesion. We accept the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is ill, but that is no excuse to close the Parliament. Only about a week ago we had about 2,000 miners berating the Government and storming the Parliament looking for some security of employment, none of which will be given. It is our duty, as an Opposition, on behalf of the many people in

Australia, to suggest that this Government should start to announce some policies on job creation policies that will help all these individual electorates and guarantee some assistance to industries.
I asked the Treasurer (Mr Howard) a question this morning. The question I asked referred to the Treasurer continuing to trade with a deficit, having had a deficit in the trade account for the past 13 months, and the Government borrowing on the short term money market to finance the deficit. I asked what poiicies the Government has to avoid the catastrophe which is looming over every Australian because the Government is accumulating such massive debt and encouraging that debt by allowing Australians to have what are amongst the highest interest rates in the Western world. Where is the policy of the Government? It is certainly not helping investment in industry. It is certainly not helping the housing industry. The Government is certainly not helping to create employment opportunities.
Upon looking at the business paper I noted a number of matters that should have been given some discussion in this Parliament. Those matters relate to private members' Bills, two of which come from my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). One Bill relates to a fresh water study for the River Murray which, I think, is a matter of major importance. The Bill at least should have been discussed. The other Bill is the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Bill, which is certainly a matter of some significance now, particularly given today's news, which suggests that there are serious problems in the insurance industry, particularly in relation to what might be deemed to be adequate deposits in relation to the claims that might have to be met. Last, but by no means least, is the private member's Bill proposing land rights for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. I would have thought that those matters could have been brought on for debate, as we have been pressing the Government to do for some time. We could find time to do at least that. I am mindful of the fact that the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) has to take instructions from the Cabinet. I do not berate him personally at all, but I think it is unfair to this Parliament to have matters of this nature stood over indefinitely, never to be dealt with. It is important that we discuss those three specific matters.
I know that it is the view of the Government that we will come back for a day or two only to deal with whatever matters the Senate will give to us. If it does not give us any matters, we will not come back. I do not think that is at all satisfactory. It will certainly disappoint the many people

Special Adjournment

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2981

in Australia who expect us, as their representa-
tives, to put things before a government which might be able to do something about their specific
problems. The amount of work on the Notice
Paper would keep us busy until at least the second week in December. We ought to be meeting to dis-
cuss those matters. If the Government has run out of Government Business, that is no excuse for the
House of Representatives to stop sitting, because there is ample opportunity to debate these mat-
ters. As we know, a matter of public importance is about to come on for debate. I am prepared to
wager that it will not be allowed to continue be-
cause the Government will say that there is insuf-
ficient time. Yet we are about to adjourn sine die without any indication as to what we will do when
we come back, if we come back.

Today is an excellent example of a tired government that has run out of steam, has no idea
what it ought to be doing by way of legislation, has
failed completely in the economic sphere, and has around its neck massive unemployment from
which it is running away as we go towards the by-
election in Flinders. I hope that the people there
will adequately give the right verdict of this Government's policies. I do not want to delay the
House because I am anxious that my colleague
have the chance to debate his matter of public importance. In my view and in the view of the Oppo-
sition, this House should resume in about a week's time when we should have at least some knowl-
edge of what the Senate is about. If the Senate still
has not done anything in a week, which may be its wont, at least we could discuss some of the mat-
ters I have mentioned. For those reasons the Op-
position regrets that it cannot agree to a motion proposing that we adjourn to an unknown date.

Question put:

That the motion (Sir James Killen's) be agreed to.

Discussion of Matter of Public Importance
Mr SPEAKER-I have received letters from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107,1 have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Gellibrand, namely:

The Government's back-down in its Budget announcement to seek the release of $300m from the Reserve Bank for home lending purposes.

Petitions

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2985

(I) That United States, Australian and allied forces used huge amounts of toxic chemicals for military purposes, such as Agents Orange, Blue and White, in Vietnam during the war there;
(2) many of these chemicals were, and are, known to be highly dangerous to human health;
(3) Australia's Vietnam veterans and their families are suffering many severe problems which may be due to their exposure to these chemicals; and
(4) the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia has been seeking a Royal Commission for well over two years to ensure an independent investigation of these matters.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia will

(b) urge the Federal Government to establish the Royal Commission immediately.

National Estate Areas
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the lack of effective Federal environmental protection legislation and urge that suitable legislation be enacted immediately.
Your petitioners are concerned that National Estate areas such as South West Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Western Australian Jarrah Forests cannot be fully protected until adequate legislation exists and is enforced. Your humble petitioners therefore call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that all provisions of the Heritage Act and the Environment Impact of Proposals Act are fully complied with in respect of National Estate Areas. In particular your petitioners cal upon you to adopt the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment on South West Tasmania. Your petitioners

believe that this is a national issue and must be resolved by the action of the Federal Parliament.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Slaughter of Marine Mammals
To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
I. Since the Australian Whaling Protection Act, 1980 provides for the banning of importation into Australia of all whale by-products, and
2. The Prime Minister has stated that he and his Government support the International Banning of Whaling,
3. Then consistent with (I) and (2), this Government should immediately legislate to ban the importation of all marine mammal by-products, including the harp seal of Canada, and
4. Through the Australian delegate in the United Nations General Assembly, the Prime Minister should state his Government's support for an International ban on the slaughter of any marine mammal for commercial reasons.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: Consistent with Legislation on whaling, this Government should ban the importation of marine mammal by-products, and support an International ban on the slaughter of any marine mammal.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Pensions
To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that some single supporting parents are unfairly disadvantaged in having chosen to care for children full-time during the formative years, believing such care was essential to their well-being; and that women without dependent children, and who are under 50 years of age are not eligible for a continuing pension. These women have devoted their whole lives to their families and do not have skills relevant to the present employment situation. Their future prospects, with increasing age and length of time out of the workforce are a deterrent to employers. Skilled workers find it difficult to obtain employment and unskilled workers find it even more difficult. Unemployment benefit was not designed for long term usage and the low rate of payment plus the work tests over a long period of time lead to a general decline in the physical and mental health, with the result that the women are being placed on sickness benefits. Sickness benefits however, were also designed for short term usage and are unable to provide security for these women.
Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should:
(i) Amend the Social Services Act to reduce the age of eligibility for a Class B Widows pension from 50 to 40 years; and
(ii) Expand existing training schemes to include women taken off supporting Parents' Benefit.
(iii) Provide rehabilitation for women with disabilities which preclude them from the paid work force.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Philippines
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain undersigned persons (citizens of Australia) (electors of

the Division of Perth) shows concern and dismay that Fr. Brian Gore, an Australian citizen and missionary priest in the Philippines is charged with subversion, possession of explosives and of inciting rebellion, warrants of arrest pertaining to which have been issued and served on the 18th October, 1982.
Your petitioners therefore pray that you do all in your power to urge the Philippine authorities to cease harassment of Fr. Gore and to allow him to continue his missionary work without threat or fear of arrest; furthermore, if a warrant of arrest is to be served, that Fr. Gore be allowed his right to legal advice and representation and of access at all times to his friends and religious colleagues.
by Mr Beazley.
Petition received.
South West Tasmania: Wilderness Area
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. This area is on the Register of the National Estate and therefore is of national concern.
Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Birney.
Petition received.
Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that Australia Council funding for the Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland has been entirely cut for 1983.
The Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland has made an important contribution to the cultural and artistic life of the Australian community for the past eight years taking innovative and original theatre to sections of the community who would not normally attend live theatre performances.
The Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland is the only theatre company in Australia which consistently presents theatre of social comment and tours nationally every year.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will resolve to ask the Australia Council to reserve its decision in respect to the Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Broadcasting Licences
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That Family Radio Ltd represents the largest single interest group in the community-i.e., christianswho do not have a voice in public broadcasting commensurate with their representation.

Petitions

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2987

That prime time access to existing broadcasts by christian groups is virtually non-existent, and access at other times is fast disappearing.
That, by comparison with other capitals, Brisbane is entitled to at least one more category'S' FM broadcasting licence.
That there appears to be no prosect of the release of further category'S' FM licences in the near future for Brisbane.
That satisfactory fulfillment of the aims of family radio and its expansion can only be achieved by broadcasting in its own right under licence.
That family radio has a responsibility to the large support groups which have contributed substantially to its development, to achieve the aims in broadcasting and community work for which it was established.
That there is an urgent need for the kind of service and support that family radio can provide to other community groups through the particular type of integrated programming proposed by the company under a full-time licence.
And that pruned government resources are obviously insufficient to advance the development of public broadcasting as originally intended.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government will support family radio's application for a broadcasting licence and will enable more category'S' FM licences to be made available in Brisbane.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Retirement Benefits: Prhate Enterprise
The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth our concern that:
I. The Income Tax Assessment Act (the Act) and its administration is inadequate in providing retirement benefits for employees in private enterprise;
2. The Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) denies deductions necessary to index retirement pensions;
3. Deductions for the self-employed and employed are inadequate;
4. The Commissioner has exercised his discretion improperly by negating a choice the Act allows on investment in Government Securities;
5. The Commissioner's constant alterations to guidelines and lack of communication has created great uncertainty.
6. The Commissioner is acting arbitrarily, and without proper notice in restricting trustee's investments with employers;
7. The Commissioner seeks to apply new actuarial guidelines retrospectively to July 1981.
Your Petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, take action to remedy these inadequacies and in particular we pray that action be taken:
(i) To ensure that the Commissioner exercises his discretion only with proper regard to legal principles;
(ii) To ensure that the Commissioner does not delegate to auditors part of his function of administering the Act;
(iii) To enact legislation allowing proper levels of retirement benefits to be provided;
(iv) To ensure that retirement benefits are regulated by a Department with a primarily social welfare function.

And your Petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray.

Defence Service Home Loans
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as 'Australian Soldiers' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.
They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other la'1ds.
In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Airforce could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.
Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is injust and unfair.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Bank Account Debits Tax
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned members of the Rothmans Employees' Credit Union Limited respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned that the Commonwealth Government's Bank Account Debits Tax discriminates heavily against Building Societies and Credit Unions. As it stands, it exempts debits from Savings Banks and all bank cheque debits.

This will give great benefit to the large and profit making banks whilst costing the members of co-operatives such as ourselves, a great deal of money.
In the next financial year it will cost this Credit Union alone $9,500.00. This will come from the members because we do not make profits.
As it stands this is a tax on the little people and exempts the big corporations.

JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY
Report
Mr FRY (Fraser)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I present the Committee's report on proposals for variations of the plan of layout of the City of Canberra and its environs (75th Series-Item 3 and 76th Series-Item I).
Ordered that the report be printed.
Mr FRY-by leave-In the 75th and 76th series of variations to the city plan, the Committee deferred its approval on two items in the suburb of Florey, pending the provision of further information by the Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission about changes to the existing system of land servicing.
The Committee has received a letter from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), dated 5 November 1982, providing further information and requesting the Committee to approve the two deferred variations. The Minister informed the Committee:
Cabinet recently agreed to responsibility for the servicing and marketing of land remaining with the NCDC and the Department respectively, pending the Government's decision on any recommendations that arise from the current NCDC review.
Further, the Minister stated that arrangements for the land servicing and marketing by the private sector are still in the development stage. Accordingly, the Committee notes the Minister's undertaking to consult with it on any new arrangements before they are implemented. The Committee would wish to examine the arrangements before it would approve any variation that involved private sector land servicing and marketing. The Committee therefore approves the variations at Florey, that is, Item 3 of the 75th Series and Item I of the 76th Series, provided that land servicing is conducted by the NCDC and marketing is conducted by the Department of the Capital Territory.

JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
Report
Mr CONNOLLY (Bradfield)-by leave-On Thursday of the week before last, I tabled two most significant reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which went to the heart of public administration. They concerned the form and standard of financial statements for Commonwealth undertakings, the Committee's 199th report, and the selection and development of Senior Managers in the Commonwealth Public Service, which was the 202nd report. At that time. I did not refer to the latter due to time constraints on the House.
The 202nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is unusual at it has broken new ground by addressing problems of Public Service personnel policy. In its 1980-81 annual report, the Committee advised the Parliament of the need for an inquiry into the selection and development of senior public servants. The Committee has feared for 'Some time what has become manifest since, that in some areas the management of the Public Service is not meeting the demands of government. I must emphasise that the Committee does not denigrate the valuable contribution of many dedicated, loyal and efficient officers at all levels in the Service but believes that reforms are necessary to ensure that senior officers are able to give of

their best in the service of Australia. The Commonwealth Public Service is the nation's largest employer. Through it, the Commonwealth Government manages an extraordinarily complex organisation engaged in a wide range of activities as diverse as defence and foreign affairs, construction, consumer protection, health, education and social welfare. Such diversity requires flexibility in applying systems of management and personnel policy which the Committee believes are often
neglected.
The Australian political system is based on the principle of responsible government, in which Ministers are accountable to Parliament, and ultimately to the people, for the conduct of public administration. The Commonwealth Constitution vests all legislative power in the Parliament and
the executive power in the Ministry, assisted by departments. Yet it is a fact of contemporary political life that the Government now includes the Public Service, with which the Ministry uses executive power. Under the Australian democratic system, power must not be severed from responsibility. By responsible government we mean not only that the Ministry is responsible to Parliament but also that the Public Service, through senior administrators, is answerable not only to Ministers but also to Parliament for its management of the resources provided by government through the Parliament. One must acknowledge that the Ministry and Parliament are legitimately empowered to determine the political parameters within which public policy is to be administered. However, within those parameters, senior public servants exercise a host of management functions relating to the delivery of programs that provide services to the public. A major factor in the degree to which the Commonwealth Government can successfully respond is the performance and motivation of senior public servants.
At Federation, the task facing the Public Service was relatively simple. In addition to the Treasury, only five Commonwealth departmental responsibilities are mentioned in the Constitution. As a result of substantial increases in the number of departments, the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to administer policies of great complexity has grown. Although Ministers remain responsible to Parliament for their departments, recent events have highlighted how difficult it is for an individual Minister personally to direct all activities relating to policy in the department. It is for this reason that the reforms recommended in this report are so important. The focus of this report is upon selection and development of senior managers and their departmental heads. A written appraisal system; external recruitment;

on-the-job development; mobility; special development programs and courses; and the role of the Public Service Board in this field are all considered. However, it should not be thought that it is only the public servants who require more careful selection and more thorough training. The Committee notes that Ministers also require managerial skills. Consequently Ministers, and potential Ministers, should have greater opportunities for training in management and policy skills. While this may be difficult to achieve it is a goal to which governments should aim.
The essence of good management is taking responsibility for an organisation, even though the details of directing its activities may be delegated to others. This inquiry convinced us that current senior staff selection and development practices need to be changed if the Public Service is to meet the challenges of the I 980s and beyond. The Committee has recommended that the First and Second Divisions of the Public Service be replaced by a senior executive group, within which promotion would be to a personal grade or level rather than to specific positions as at present, leaving departmental heads to allocate, and to reallocate, specific tasks. These promotions would be made on the basis of general management, policy and administrative skills rather than the requirement of a specific job. Departments would have much greater flexibility to design their top structures to accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of particular senior executives-thus a department would have freedom to promote an individual to a higher level, without necessarily adding to the breadth of responsibilities, and also to reduce the role of an officer with limited abilities.
Consequently the Committee believes that the concept of permanency should be redefined so that senior career officers have permanency within the Public Service but no claim to a specific rank or position indefinitely; and the holding of senior rank within the senior executive group depends upon consistent and satisfactory performance of duties, together with the needs of the department and the Service. This means that an officer could be required to accept a demotion should the annual appraisal reports indicate an inability to maintain an acceptable level of efficiency and effectiveness at that level. Under some circumstances, officers may wish to take a demotion in order to have less responsibility, a choice not currently available to them. The Committee expects that the Public Service Board would be the appropriate body to develop guidelines for the implementation of these recommendations. We assume they would include

adequate provisions for appeals and the preservation of accrued superannuation at the higher level.
I wish to express the appreciation of the committee to the other members of the sectional committee in particular the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) who compiled this report. The Committee also wishes to thank Dr A. P. Gallagher who made a significant contribution to the report as secretary of the sectional committee while on secondment from the Department of Education. Those from both the public and private sector who appeared as witnesses and many others who gave advice and assistance also require our thanks. We believe this to be one of the most significant reports presented by the Committee in recent years and urge that the Government give its recommendations early attention. I commend the report to honourable members.
Mrs KELLY (Canberra)-I seek leave to make a brief statement.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilIar)--Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.
Sir James KilIen-Two minutes, my dear.
Mrs KELLY-Two minutes? I spent a year working on this, and I get two minutes. What a farce. Speaking for the two minutes that I have on this report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I point out that this report is meant to be a constructive report and comment on the Public Service. It is not meant to be a destructive or critical comment. Rather, the members of the Committee have acknowledged the difficult task that public servants have with today's complex government. We have looked at the complex tasks that the Public Service has to perform. There is no doubt that over the past months there has been considerable criticism of the Public Service in its duties. What we have done, is to look at how we can have the best possible Public Service rather than to look critically at the performance of the Public Service today. So, we hope that the report will improve the Public Service, especially the top echelons of the Public Service.
We have particularly looked at the senior management, that is, the current Second Division of the Public Service, because we know the importance of leadership within the Public Service. What we decided to do was to examine from the top down because we believe that any reform that is necessary in the Public Service should start at the top. It would then filter down throughout the

2994 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Joint Committee ofPublic Accounts

Public Service. We also recognise that at the moment in the Public Service morale is, indeed, low. We know that there are many reasons for thatone has been the consistant stress over the past seven years on staff numbers rather than constructive policies and development policies within the Public Service. We acknowledge that but we want to take that a step forward now and start looking constructively at the Public Service. One particular area we have looked at is the category of departmental heads. The Committee recommends that we abolish the concept of permanency of what we have termed previously 'permanent heads'. We recommend that that class should disappear and in its place there should be departmental heads who are reviewed. Therefore, there would be a system of accountability within the Public Service at the very top.
Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of permanency in the Public Service. We are not attempting in this report to undermine permanency; rather, in relation to what is now called the Second Division in the Public Service, we insist that at that level the officers have to earn their position. We are not saying that if a person does not perform at that level he should be dismissed from the Service, rather we say that he would revert to the Third Division. We stress that it is im-
portant in the Second Division, or the senior executive corps as we believe it should be called, that people earn their position and do not have any right to that position. It is necessary that they fit in with the demands of the Service and live up to what is expected of officers in those positions.
One other area that we looked at is the discrimination against women in the Public Service. The facts speak for themselves. Only 2 per cent of officers are women in the Second Division. If the current situation continues without any direct policy to promote women in the Public Service, we estimate that by 1987-this is supported by the Public Service Board-only 5 per cent of the Second Division will be women. I was pleased that the report dealt specifically with that matter. We also hope that this report is only the start of looking constructively at the Public Service. We have recommended that there be a review in the future of the role of the Public Service Board.
I would like to make just a brief comment on the Reid inquiry that is currently under way. I think it is a great shame that the recommendations of this report did not come down earlier. I cannot see a great deal of need for the Reid inquiry. Currently the Public Service has been reviewed and over-reviewed. I hope that instead of continually analysing the Public Service we proceed to start implementing some constructive

policies in the Public Service. In conclusion, I hope that this report is the start of this Government looking more constructively at the Public Service. I hope the Reid inquiry will take on board the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee report. I would like to thank the members of the Public Accounts Committee staff who have assisted in the matter, particularly Dr Gallagher, and the members of the Committee who assisted in bringing forward this report. I recommend the report to members of the Parliament.
INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION
Report
Mr IAN ROBINSON (Cowper)-by leave-I present the report of the Australian Delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in 1981 and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
Mr IAN ROBINSON-I had the honour to lead the Australian delegation to meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Manila and Havana during 1981. I now present to the House the official report of the delegation. The InterParliamentary Union, as the only world-wide organisation of parliaments, is a major international forum. Since 1889 it has maintained the continuity of its existence and has expanded its membership and field of work. When Australia joined in 1956 the member countries had reached a total of 39. At the sixty-eighth conference in September 1981 had increased to 99 member countries.
Two regular sessions of the Union are held each year. The first is in April, when the standing study committees meet preliminary to the lnterParliamentary conference in September. The activities of the Union are based on the participation of parliamentarians from around the world. They come from varied parliaments, many not based on the Westminster pattern and many far different in form from the multi-party parliamentary democracy familiar to Australians. The stated objectives of the IPU are primarily to contribute to international understanding and peace, to strengthen parliamentary institutions and to support the objectives of the United Nations. Many at times wonder whether it is adhering effectively to these objectives. Confrontation between East and West sometimes appears to threaten the Union's very viability. Indeed, it produced considerable strain within it during 1981.

Inter-Parliamentary Union

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2995

The spring meeting in Manila in April opened amid widespread concern at the continued Russian occupation of Afghanistan and developments in Poland. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its satellites, however, endeavoured persistently to circumvent the efforts of Western nations to reflect this concern in the resolutions adopted. The atmosphere of the sixty-eighth conference in Havana is outlined in the report. When problems besetting the work of the Union are highlighted as vividly as they were at that conference, it may be as well that we reflect on where the Union is going and assess the magnitude of the threat. It is, I believe, vital for better international understanding to be pursued and it is within the Union that every effort must continue to be made to gain understanding between its members.
In the debate, discussions and other activities at IPU meetings, Australian parliamentarians who are privileged to attend find opportunities to pursue this goal. Our understanding of other countries-rich and poor, developed and undeveloped-and of their problems and aspirations is a challenging task. Equally, we are afforded an opportunity of seeking from other parliamentarians with whom we debate and have formal discussions, and with whom we mingle less formally, an understanding of Australian problems and aspirations. I believe that in this process we can playa part, each in his own way, in supporting and enhancing an important role for Australia. Our natural resources and commodity exports, together with our industrial base, create ever-increasing links with both developed and developing countries. Those interests afford us unique opportunities in our relationships with other nations.
In 1981, the Australian delegation was active in efforts to modify resolutions and seek reasonable compromise where this was deemed appropriate. Australia has traditionally played this kind of role. By our position in world affairs, we are well placed to play an effective part-often a leading part-in efforts to reconcile differences between delegations of other countries, and to help resolve differences. The work of the IPU is diverse in relation to major world issues. In many specific areas it has attained important achievements, on its own initiative or in concert with other organisations. A particular example was the organisation of the Parliamentary Conference on Population and Development in Africa which was held in Nairobi in July 1981. The Union's work to protect the human rights of parliamentarians is well known. This task continues with a considerable

measure of success through the Special Committee on Violations of the Human Rights of Parliamentarians.
Australia is a member of what is known as the Ten Plus Group within the IPU. This is one of a number of informal associations between member groups which have developed for the purpose of facilitating discussion on matters of importance. Such informal associations exist among groups from the East, the West and the non-aligned nations. I wish to acknowledge the work of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) who was appointed Chairman of the Ten Plus Group in 1981. In 1981, Australia hosted the first meeting of the Group to be held in this country. It took place in Canberra in April prior to the spring meeting of the Union in Manila. Further meetings were held in Manila, and again in Washington and Havana in September 1981, making the year a notable one for Australia as convenor during that period of the Ten Plus Group. Dr Edwards has also served with great credit to Australia as a member of the Executive Committee of the IPU since 1980.
I wish also to mention current proposals to reform the work of the Union. After preliminary consideration in 1981 a working group of members of the Executive Committee was appointed during the Havana meeting to examine these proposals in detail and make recommendations about what action might be taken. Dr Edwards was elected a member of the working group. The proposals under consideration envisage the holding of two self-contained sessions of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference each year. These would take place in April and September, combined with meetings of two or possibly three of the standing study committees, and would occupy a week on each occasion. It is worth noting that, under this kind of arrangement, the consideration of a topic would be carried through the relevant study committees and the plenary debate in the conference in the one session instead of beginning in the study committee in April and concluding in the conference in September as at present. It will be necessary for the Australian National Group to consider the implications of such proposals.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide, Mr Mick Young, deputy leader of the delegation, for his support, co-operation and active participation in our IPU work throughout 1981. To all members of the delegation I also express my appreciation for their work and support. The delegation responded well to the circumstances and needs of the meetings

2996 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Inter-Parliamentary Union

during the year. I wish also to thank the delegation secretary, Mr R. G. Thomson, for his cooperation and dedicated service. Miss Sue Boyd, adviser to the delegation, was transferred to the Australian Mission to the United Nations in New York at the conclusion of the Havana Conference and on behalf of the delegation I acknowledge the assistance she rendered.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect)~by leave~1 was not a delegate at the 1981 Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference but I was at the ]982 conference. I would like to criticise the attitude of not only the Australian delegations generally but also all Western delegations for taking the line which the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) described as modifying resolutions. Masses of motions are moved both at the United Nations and the IPU criticising what we call Western countries' democracies for all kinds of terrible things which we allegedly do. The best that some hope for is that we modify those sorts of resolutions. It is my view that we ought to go on the attack.
We have the best system of government; we certainly believe that we do. I think that we can win arguments at that conference. This year we took the initiative~ I take some credit as a member of the Ten Plus Group-for moving aggressive motions dealing with Afghanistan and Ethopia's invasion of Somalia. We were advised that it was not worthwhile raising the matter because we would not get a two-thirds majority, we got a two-thirds majority and overwhelmed the Soviet Union. That showed, quite clearly, that only relatively few countries in the world, when it comes to the crunch, will support the Soviet Union. I hope to make some comments on this matter when the 1982 report is tabled.
I reiterate a point to honourable members who are likely to go to the IPU Conference next year. I suppose what I have to say applies also to our attitude at the United Nations. I was a delegate there in 1973. Western countries sit back and cop it all the time. We are attacked and insulted by everyone and all we ever try to do is modify resolutions instead of putting up alternative motions which would very often get quite a lot of support from many delegations from countries all over the world.
Mr CHARLES JONES (Newcastle)~by leave~I wish to support the comments that have just been made by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). I do not always agree with him on everything but the facts are that there is a need at the Inter-Parliamentary Union for the Ten Plus Group to adopt a more aggressive stand

than what it has in recent years. At the first conference I attended in 1978 I found that a number of Western countries were prepared to go on the attack. Whenever the Soviet Union had a crack at the United States the United States came back and so there was a vigorous exchange between the Western and Eastern blocs. Invariably the eastern bloc was defeated in a vote. That is what happened at the Conference in Rome. When the real issue of colonialism was stood up, the Irish moved an amendment to include the Soviet Union as a colonial power and it squealed like hell when the conference carried the motion. That is an indication of what can be done. For example, when the Brits moved an amendment to delete the Falkland Islands as a colonial territory from the resolution the motion was defeated because our colleagues from across the Tasman~the New Zealanders~packed up, left the conference and went home the day the voting took place. Why the hell did they go to a conference and leave the day the voting took place? If delegates have only a limited amount of time to spend at the conference they should come one day late, but they should stay for the count. We saw the same thing happen with the Americans. At the final count they had one delegate present which gave them five votes out of the 22 that they hold. At the conclusion of the conference America did not have a delegate present.
We should go to the conference and be prepared to put forward a point of view. For example, at the seven conferences that I have been to in recent years I have put forward a motion on East Timor that embarrassed the Government and one of my colleagues. I was successful in writing into the decolonisation resolution very strong amendments~they covered both the preamble and the operative clause~ concerning the need for Indonesia to give the people of East Timor the right to self determination. I say this even though my former leader is in New York saying certain things which I believe are a monstrous fabrication.
We all have an opportunity of putting forward a particular point of view at these conferences. If the delegates of various countries will not stay until the vote is taken, if they are not prepared to put their points of view but are prepared to be kicked around by the Soviet bloc, I think that the best thing we can do is to wrap it up altogether and say to the coms: 'You can have the damn thing'.

House that the Senate has agreed to the Bill as amended by the House of Representatives at the request of the Senate and without further requests.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON EXPENDITURE
Mr HOWARD (Bennelong Treasurer)- For the information of honourable members. I present the Government's response to recommendation 8 of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure: Parliament and Public Expenditure, together with the text of the statement relating to a report by the Minister for Finance.
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION (GOVERNMENT SERVICE) AMENDMENT BILL 1982
Bill presented by Mr Macphee, and read a first time.
Second Reading
Mr MACPHEE (Balaclava-Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations) (8.29)-1 move:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
This legislation is designed to repeal the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920 and to vest the jurisdiction under that Act on the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. These amendments recognise that the structure and range of Commonwealth Public Service employment and the functions of the Public Service Arbitrator have changed considerably since the establishment of a separate jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator in 1920. Honourable members will recall that the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration took the same view in its report of 1976 and recommended that action be taken along the lines of this legislation.
What is proposed is a natural progression from the statutory links between the jurisdictions of the Arbitrator and of the Commission-and of the Arbitration Court before it-that were established in the 1950's when the system of appeals and references to the Commission from the Arbitrator was introduced. A further alignment occurred between the jurisdictions in 1972 when the concept of an industrial situation was injected into the Public Service Arbitration Act to give the Arbitrator scope to deal with industrial action in the public sector. The legislation has been the subject of intensive examination by the National

Labour Consultative Council and a special Committee of the Council. The Australian Council of Trade Unions supports the Bill's objectives.
A new Division IA is to be inserted into Part III of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and this will encompass the areas of Commonwealth employment presently covered by the Public Service Arbitration Act. Certain Northern Territory government service employment will also be covered by the new Division. I should point out here-and it is a very important point-that certain areas of Commonwealth activity which presently do not come within the scope of the Public Service Arbitration Act will not be the subject of the Commission's jurisdiction under the new Division but will remain within the Commission's general jurisdiction under Division I of Part III of the Act. I speak here, for example, of such enterprises as Qantas Airways Ltd, the Australian National Line, Trans Australia Airlines and the postal and telecommunications commissions. However, provision has been made in the Bill for the transfer by regulation of Commonwealth and Territory authorities and employees as defined between Division IA and other divisions of the Act as appropriate.
In addition, provision has been made for the President to have power to arrange for specific matters to be dealt with by a panel in a Division other than IA and vice versa to cater for situations where it is desirable that similar matters in each Division be heard by the one panel. I would point out to the House that the jurisdiction of the fire brigades and the prison officers tribunals in the Northern Territory will not be immediately drawn into the jurisdiction of the Commission. The relevant unions in the Northern Territory are presently covered by separate tribunals and require time to make the necessary arrangements which will leave them free to move into the Commission's jurisdiction. The Government is prepared to leave the operation of the process of rationalisation as to these tribunals in abeyance for the time being. The provisions of the Bill as to them can be brought into operation by regulation when there has been further consultation about them.
I now turn to the main details of the Bill. Clause 9 inserts the new Division lA into Part III of the Act and it will embrace a number of new sections designed to empower the Commission to deal with industrial disputes and industrial matters concerning Commonwealth and Territory employees. Proposed section 70A contains relevant definitions for these purposes and provides for the exclusion from the new Division IA of members of

2998 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Conciliation and Arbitration Bill

the Defence Force, the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission. Other specified authorities such as the Australian Shipping Commission, if not brought within Division IA by regulation, will remain within the general jurisdiction of the Commission. Provision has also been made for the exclusion of certain other employees who are not presently within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator.
Proposed section 70B removes the limitations imposed by the definition of 'industrial dispute' and 'industrial matter' in section 4 of the Act. The new section 70C extends the panel system for the hearing and determination of matters to the new Division. The purpose of new sections 70G and 70H is to provide for the transfer where appropriate of the hearing and determination of a matter from the new Division to another Division or vice versa. This is similar to the procedures already in the Act which allow the President flexibility in the allocation of matters to be determined.
Section 70J will effectively carry over to Division IA the powers of the Public Service Arbitrator under section 12D of the Public Service Arbitration Act in relation to orders made to end or prevent industrial action. Proposed section 70K will give the Commission power to declare terms of awards to be common rules for the whole or a part of the government service.
Clause 5 of the Bill deals with section 36 of the principal Act and the right of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to intervene in matters before the Commission. The Minister already has such a right in proceedings involving significant matters before the Commission. That right will now be extended to all matters involving disputes in the Commonwealth public sector. This does not mean that the Minister will enter proceedings in all such casesfar from it. But the Government has decided to reserve to itself the right, as a most significant employer and in the public interest generally, to put views to the Commission in relation to its own area of employment.
The other important elements of the Bill are in clause II and IS. Clause II inserts a new subsection 132 (5) in the Act to provide for the continuance of the registration of associations of less than 100 employees which were registered under the authority of the Public Service Arbitration Act. The registration of such bodies is not to be cancelled by virtue of sub-section 132 (I) (b) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act unless their membership falls below 60 per cent of the number

of employees in the relevant industry in the Public Service. Clause 15 makes certain transitional arrangements to enable, for example, determinations of the Arbitrator to continue in force and matters pending under the Public Service Arbitration Act before its repeal to be dealt with.
As I have pointed out, these proposals have been the subject of detailed consultation with the labour movement and have its general endorsement. I commend the Bill to the House.
Debate (on motion by Mr Hawke) adjourned.
HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1982
Bill presented by Mr Carlton, and read a first time.
Second Reading
Mr CARLTON (Mackellar-Minister for Health) (8.36)-1 move:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
The House will recall that on 28 October 1982 the Senate amended the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1982 to delete provisions that would have prevented State and Territory governments from levying special taxes on health insurance organisations registered under the National Health Act. On the same day I moved that this House agree to the amendments so that the Bill could pass and the substantial benefits provided for in that legislation would not be delayed. At the time. I foreshadowed that the Government would reintroduce the deleted provisions. The Bill now before the House contains those provisions. I draw the attention of the House to clauses 4 and 6 which would preclude the application by any State or Territory of any tax based on or calculated by reference to any matter connected with the business of that organisation. A tax based on the number Qf contributors or the amount of contributions w0uld be such a tax.
As I advised the House during the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) the Victorian Government has imposed a levy on health insurance organisations in that State. That levy is at the rate of 80c per week per family contributor and 40c per week per single contributor for basic hospital tables. It has been imposed since I August 1982. The levy purports to finance outpatient services provided to insured persons.
I believe I should once again place before the House the main principles at stake in this legislation. As I said during the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), this issue

Health Legislation Amendment Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2999

raises directly the division of responsibilities between the State and Federal governments for the hospital systems. In September last year the Federal Government introduced new funding arrangements for State hospitals. In all States but South Australia and Tasmania, it abandoned the 50-50 cost-sharing arrangements which the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals said had 'rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient'. Under the cost-sharing scheme the States were reluctant to accept managerial and planning responsibility for their hospital systems. Because financial responsibility was divided between the States and the Commonwealth the States had not, in general, bothered to manage their hospitals efficiently.
The changes made last year have been effective in this regard. The States have, in general, begun to make the difficult managerial decisions necessary for efficient hospital systems. There have been difficulties in the transitional phase. There have been disagreements over the revenue raising capacity of some of the States. The Commonwealth viewed their difficulties sympathetically at the Premiers Conference, although some Statesmost notably Victoria-believed they should have been more generously treated.
One of Victoria's major problems has been the institution of an effective revenue collection system for its hospitals, particularly for out-patient services. In communications with the Federal Government Mr Roper has acknowledged that this is an administrative and managerial problem. He has referred to this 'incapacity of Victorian hospi-
tals to devote the requisite resources to the pursuit of fees for all chargeable occasions of (outpatient) service'. Apparently unable to implement the necessary mechanisms, the Victorian Government decided to abolish out-patient charges for insured patients, and to impose a special levy on them through their insurance funds. The Federal Government cannot object to the Victorian Government's decision to abolish out-patient charges for insured patients, although it considers it to be an unwise course. The Government's concern is with the particular mechanism the Victorian Government has adopted to finance the resulting revenue shortfall. It has selected a discriminatory tax on a particular group of Victorians-those who have been prudent enough to take out health insurance-and at the same time, as I shall show later, imposed a tax levy on all Australian taxpayers.
The State Government can charge for its outpatient services in whatever way it likes, provided it meets the shortfall out of its own funds. Victoria

is free to fund its hospitals, as Queensland does, from its general taxation or other revenue. The
objection of the Federal Government is to this discriminatory levy on the health insured. In adopting this course the Victorian Government has exceeded its responsibility for hospitals funding and encroached on health insurance which is the Commonwealth's constitutional responsibility. Parliament has given the Federal Minister for Health power to declare standard hospital fees for health insurance purposes. To protect the insured and to prevent the abuse of the insurance system, the Federal Minister has power to determine the benefit liability and contribution rates of funds. The imposition of a levy on the funds by Victoria has altered their financial situation, pushed up contribution rates and reduced the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations to health insurance contributors.
The Government is also particularly concerned for those pensioners who, though entitled to free
health care, have insured themselves in order to have the choice of doctor while in hospital. These people, who are already paying for that privilege, now find themselves having to pay an additional cost imposed by the Victorian Government. This unfortunate effect of the levy has been brought to my attention in correspondence from Victorian pensioners who find themselves in this difficult position. I would repeat that although the Federal Government acknowledges the power of the Victorian Government to abolish direct charging for health services, and to replace it with a general tax on Victorians, it does not consider it a sound course of action. The implementation of user-pays has had a clear impact on hospital utilisation rates and the abolition of this discipline in Victoria must contribute to an excessive use of these very costly and scarce resources.
Another of the Federal Government's major concerns has been with the fact that the Victorian levy will raise revenue in excess of that required to pay for the utilisation of out-patient services by those with health insurance. The Commonwealth has estimated that the total income to the Victorian Government from this levy will be $44m. Again, on our best estimates, if the Victorian Government were collecting all the out-patient revenue that it should from insured patients by individual charging, it would be collecting only $31 m. There is a difference of $13m involved, an important $13m since it is a direct tax on the insured to pay for other aspects of the Victorian health system.
But more significantly, the Federal Government, and by that I mean the taxpayers of Australia, is obliged to pay 30 per cent of that

3000 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

Health Legislation Amendment Bill

$13m through revenue forgone through the health

insurance taxation rebate introduced last year by

the Federal Government. I ask honourable

members: Why should taxpayers in Cairns and

fPoerrtthh~

in Adelaide managerial

and Sydney, be forced to pay incompetence of the Victorian

Government's hospital system to the tune of over

$3m? Clearly, they should not. Other States of

Australia could only regard it as discriminatory

for the Federal Government to permit a special

payment to Victoria outside of th~ revenue

sharing agreements. Victoria says that It ha~ s.uf-

fered in the Commonwealth Grants Commission

and the Premiers Conference. Very well, let it

take the matter up through the established mech-

anisms like every other State. That course is open

to the Victorian Government. I cannot guarantee

that it will be successful. I do not know. But the

Federal Government cannot stand by and allow

the Victorian Government to take over $3m from

the Australian taxpayers without legislating to

stop it.

I now turn briefly to some of the specific concerns with this legislation raised in the oth~r pl~ce during the debate on the Health LegislatIOn Amendment Bill (No.2) 1982. There has been some concern that Victoria was not treated equitably in relation to its hospital revenue-raising capacity in the discussions leading up to the Premiers Conference. I do not accept that argument. In my opinion, considerable leeway was given to all the States to enable them to cope with the transition to the State of full managerial and financial Responsibility. However, the Government ~as made it clear here and in the other place that VICtoria can raise issues relating to its share of tax revenues at Premiers Conferences. These are matters which are broader than health funding alone, and are properly matters for discussion between heads of government and Treasurers.

I also wish to correct an error repeated several
times in the course of the debate on these pro-
visions while they were part of the Health. Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). The actions of
the Victorian Government do not, in any way to
which the Federal Government objects, resemble the funding system of the Queensland Govern-
ment for its hospitals. What concerns t~e Fed~r~1 Government about the Victorian levy IS that It IS directed at a section of the population for whom the Federal Government has particular concern,
for whom it has constitutional responsibility and to whom it provides a special tax rebate-those with health insurance. By comparison, the
Queensland Government funds its hospital sys-
tem from the Casket lottery and from general taxation revenue. I say here, as I have said before in

this House, that if the Victorian Government wants to fund its hospitals in that way-through lotteries and from tax revenue-the Federal Government will not stand in its way. That is entirely a matter for Victoria.
The Victorian Government has protested that up to 2,000 jobs could be lost if it do~s not make up a shortfall of $20m in health fundmg. ~ccept ing for now the $2Om figure and assummg that such a shortfall were recoverable in no other way-both dubious propositions-the unemployment argument may provide a reaso~ for so~e sort of tax, but it is no case at all for thiS very discriminatory levy. It is not a sufficient argument for this levy that workers will lose jobs if !t is ~ot imposed. Other courses are open to the Vlctonan Government.
However, I do not accept that the Victorian Government cannot collect this money. Other State hospital systems can manage it. I remind honourable members that this levy will collect money only from the insured section of the population. It leaves those without health insurance to be billed in the same way as any ordinary commercial debt, so some billing system is already in place in the Victorian hospital system. These arrangements help the Victorian Government make up a shortfall that exists because it has not pursued debts of insured patients. What sort of an administrative system does the State have whe~ it cannot collect debts from a limited number of msured patients? That is the question the Fede.ral Government has been asking. It is the questIOn the Jamison Commission asked, in effect, and it is the reason why the Federal Government in September last year gave the States full responsibility for the expenditure of hospital funds.
In conclusion, I draw the attel)tion of the House to clause 2, which provides that the Bill will come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. This will allow the. Vi~t?rian Government time to reintroduce mdlvldual charging systems. Finally, let me emphasise that the proposed amendments do not affect the basic responsibility of the States and the N~rthern .Territory to determine charges for public hospitals. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the Federal Government has the power to carry out its full responsibility in the area of health insurance and to protect contributors' interests. I commend the Bill to the House.

NATIONAL CRIMES COMMISSION BILL 1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr N. A. Brown:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general

debate be allowed covering this Bill and the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 1982.
Mr RUDDOCK (Dundas) (8.52)-Yesterday when I was speaking on this Bill I mentioned that 1 saw two important questions involved in the legislation. The first was the Commonwealth's relationship with the States of Australia, the way in which the States were affected by this proposal and the extent of the Commonwealth's power to legislate more broadly in this area. I canvassed a number of ways in which 1 believe the Commonwealth could legislate more broadly than it has in the legislation before us. I suggested ways and means to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) by which this objective could be achieved. 1 meant these comments in a very proper way because 1 am of the view that where possible we ought to co-operate with the States but when the States indicate that they are unwilling to participate in an arrangement such as this 1 think it is encumbent upon us to examine the other ways by which the Commonwealth can act. 1 believe there are ways and means by which the Commonwealth can address these important matters of criminal activity across State borders involving drugs and the like. 1suggested yesterday that the nationhood power that has been referred to by members of the High Court of Australia was one means by which this could be done. The use of the trade and commerce power was another. The use of some of the particular conventions to which Australia has subscribed dealing particularly with drugs might be a way in which the external affairs power can be used.
The second matter to which 1 addressed myself was the nature of the protections contained in this legislation of individuals who may be affected by inquiries undertaken by the National Crimes Commission. The Acting Attorney, when introducing this legislation, mentioned that the Commission was a standing body able to accumulate experience and expertise within the areas of its inquiry and that reference from the Government requiring particular matters to be looked at would not be necessary. But 1 think it needs to be understood that the body is set up only for five years. The Bill contains what is popularly known as a sunset clause. Of course, if the National Crimes Commission were found to be exceeding its charter, if it were found to be acting in ways which were unreasonable in relation to the way in which individuals were treated, obviously at the end of that period the Parliament would, 1 am sure, examine the Commission critically. It is not a body with indefinite life, infringing the rights of individuals in some surreptitious way. It will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Of course, it is

3002 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

envisaged that at the end of five years we would look at the way in which the Commission had performed. If it had not performed properly and the Parliament did not by positive resolution seek it to continue its role, then it would not be able to continue with its inquiries.
The second matter that the Acting Attorney pointed out was that the National Crimes Commission would be given a wide discretion in relation to the conduct of its hearings and that it would be able to conduct those hearings in private. This provision was intended as a protection for individuals who might be slandered unreasonably by reason of the way in which this body carries out its inquiries. I think it is appro-
priate that that protection should exist. It is not intended that there be secret trials. In fact, the Commission is exactly what that word implies-it is a commission to undertake inquiries; it is not a commission which can, if its own motion convict people of criminal activities. It is a body which only gathers evidence. If that evidence is accumulated successfully the body may of its own volition, or through a special prosecutor or the Attorney, arrange for the people guilty of offences to be prosecuted.
The third matter I wish to raise relates to selfincrimination. This legislation specifically makes it a lawful excuse for failure to answer questions put by the Commission if people believe that they might be incriminated by the evidence they give. Of course, in appropriate cases evidence might be used against a person in subsequent proceedings except where immunity has been granted and the answers given by a witness would not be able to be made by the statute inadmissible in other proceedings. This special protection, which was envisaged as being appropriate in the circumstances, relates to evidence given by individuals. I want to make that point because I understand that one of my colleagues has been critical that this protection does not extend to documents that the Commission may require witnesses to produce or that the Commission of its volition might seek to have produced or discovered by way of searches and the like.
I would like to mention another matter before I go on to the question of the provision of documents. The Commission is also not permitted to name people in public reports as being suspected of committing criminal offences. The reason for that is that if the Commission does accumulate evidence of that sort it is expected that it will bring the matter before a court. Of course, if people are suspected of criminal activity the proceedings, if brought, will follow in the normal way. I have mentioned that self-incrimination can

be used as a lawful excuse for failing to answer questions asked by the Commission when particular matters are under investigation. This is an important matter. It is one of which I know other honourable members have been critical.
The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said during the debate on this Bill last night that it was a matter of judgment on his part that this protection contained in the legislation did not extend to the production of documents or other things. That is his judgment; my judgment is otherwise. He does not adduce evidence. He merely says that he believes it is a long standing principle that this protection ought to extend to the production of documents. I do not think he adduced any evidence that would indicate why that view ought to be considered to be a matter of great principle or moment. In my judgement-this matter was considered by me and my colleagues on the Government members Law and Government Committee which advised the Attorney-General in relation to some of these matters-the mere production of documents to the Commission ought not to be used as a basis for gaining a special privilege for those documents which could be obtained in other ways. It ought to be understood that there are in the case of the police, who can make inquiries of their own volition, provisions by which they can obtain search warrants and ascertain documents. There are other means and other forms of inquiry which can be used to obtain documents. I regard it as inappropriate that those other bodies might find that documents that they discover as a result of their proper inquiries could not be adduced in evidence because the Crimes Commission had had them tendered by a particular person who was likely to be pursued and those documents had gained a special protection.
The fact of the matter is that this form of protection would be a very new form of protection. In my judgment it could be open to abuse. The Commission itself could be abused because people could think of all the documents that they might wish to produce to the Commission-which they would not like to come to notice by any other means-and thus seek to have given to them this unique form of protection. Any documents obtained by the Commission speak for themselves. Mr Costigan in his inquiry said that he regarded the production of documents as being very important to his inquiry and a very important part of his being able to pursue successfully his quest to gain information which might be used in later prosecutions. The mere fact that people are required to produce documents to the National

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3003

Crimes Commission does not mean that the person who produces them could be questioned about the nature of those documents. Such a person could claim, in relation to the evidence that he might be asked to give in connection with those documents, the special protection that this legislation requires. The documents, if they are produced, will not have any special protection under this legislation. I think that is the appropriate way for this legislation to proceed.
I do not think the amendment that my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney is proposing in this regard is worthy of support. I have seen some of the other amendments that my colleague has proposed and I think some of them have some substance. I believe he has consulted with the Acting Attorney-General on this matter and these proposed amendments might be looked at quite sympathetically. In relation to this matter I certainly caution the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) against giving any special consideration to the particular amendment moved by my colleague. I think the National Crimes Commission Bill is an important piece of legislation which will assist the national government in bringing about a new and fundamentally correct approach to the investigation of organised crime.
I think it is very important that new minds be brought to bear on these problems. I think a National Crimes Commission affords that possibility. The fact that we can appoint new people with clean records without the previous experience and contacts that many of our criminal investigation mediums, particularly in the States, have had will afford an opportunity to bring about new evidence which can be used successfully in our quest to stem this tide of organised criminal activity which has been spoken about in this very important debate. I commend the Bill to the House and certainly encourage all my colleagues to support it in the form in which it has been presented.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (9.4)-1 preface my remarks by saying quite clearly that I am strongly opposed to the National Crimes Commission Bill. Whenever governments wish to restrict people's civil liberties they pretend there is a great danger against which people have to be protected. At present we are in the situation where a lot of hysteria is arising as a result of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the report into Nugan Hand, and probably other inquiries-for example, the Stewart Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking. People who base their attitude concerning the level of such activity in this country on the sensationalised newspaper

headlines, especially of the afternoon or Sunday newspapers, would probably think we have to be protected against what is called organised crime by quite extreme measures.
My reason for opposing this legislation very strongly in its present form is that it is inquisitorial. I think this issue does not really concern party politics. I hope that honourable members who decide to support this legislation will support it on the basis that they would also support it if it were being enforced by people on the other side of politics whom they dislike extremely. I put it to honourable members that we should not support this legislation on the basis that the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack), the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) or any likely Attorney-General is a reasonable person. That is not the way in which we should hand over our civil liberties. As other speakers in the debate on this legislation have pointed out, the Victorian Bar Council and the Law Institute of Victoria have come out in opposition to the legislation. The Victorian Bar Council stated that it:
. . . sees the dangers associated with the Crimes Commission as greatly outweighing its advantages. Some of these dangers were referred to in the judgments of the High Court in the recent case of Hammond v the Commonwealth . . . which arose out of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry.
Mr Justice Deane made reference to the fact that an inquistorial inquiry "is to no small extent following the general form of a criminal trial shorn of some of the privileges and safeguards which protect the accused in such a trial" . . . Mr Justice Brennan cited with approval a Judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States which referred to the "inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods of interrogating accused persons which has long obtained in the Continental system and until the expulsion of the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688 and the erection of additional barriers for the protection of the people against the exercise of arbitrary power was not uncommon even in England".
The Bar Council-
The Victorian Bar Council-
considers that the establishment of a permanent Crimes Commission involves a reversion to something like the system rejected in the 17th Century.
It is interesting that when we talk about inquisitions to note that only last week His Holiness the Pope, when visiting Spain, came to the conclusion finally that the Catholic Church, back in the fifteenth century, had been wrong about the Inquisition. I will quote one aspect of a reported statement of Mr Cornell, the president of the Law Institute of Victoria. He is reported as arguing:
. . . that the introduction of a Federal Crimes Commission would be a return to the injustices of the notorious 16th-Century Star Chamber of Chancery Courts.
Also I draw honourable members' attention very strongly to a recent judgment-I think it was in the Hammond case-in which it was stated:

3004 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

Many in governments throughout the world would be satisfied if they could establish Commissions with the prestigious names and the trappings of Courts, staffed by persons selected by themselves but having no independence (in particular, not having security of tenure deemed necessary to preserve the independence of judges) assisted by government selected counsel, who largely control the evidence presented by compulsory process, overriding the traditional protections of the accused and witnesses, and authorised to investigate persons selected by the government and to find them guilty of criminal offences.
The trial and finding of guilt of political opponents and dissenters in such a way is a valuable instrument in the hands of governments who have little regard for human rights. Experience in many countries shows that persons may be effectively destroyed by this process . . .
And so the judgment continues. To my mind the questions of inquisitorial powers are the most important ones. Let us look at the practicalities of what is happening in this country at present. On one side of the Parliament we have Government members who believe that anybody who has organised a strike is a criminal. Some honourable members on this side believe that anybody who has ever made a profit and not sought to maximise his tax liability is also criminal. That is the position at present. I think that when we are speaking rationally over a cup of tea or whatever we would all agree that those are ridiculous propositions. At the same time, that is the position. I think legislation such as this is being introduced to go in for witch hunting. That is all it is intended to do. It is intended to smear people, to incriminate people and to force them to incriminate themselves, or to force other people to give incriminating evidence. That is important-to force other people to give evidence which incriminates other people.
It is possible for the Attorney-General, as I will point out later, to say that a person will not be prosecuted and then to force him to give evidence against anybody, including his spouse, for the purposes of proving a criminal conspiracy or whatever on the part of that person. Any political party can be investigated. Under the propositions put up the Government can refer to the Commission on its own motion any circumstances suggesting that an offence may have been committed or may be being committed against any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. Let us be quite clear. Certainly, all the conciliation and arbitration Acts are part of that law. There are many other laws. Any union can be investigated. I have quickly jotted down some of the sorts of things which can be investigated across the board. I think it is a difficult proposition to support.
Any political party, as I said earlier, can be investigated. I think any churches can be investigated-the Church of Scientology and the Ananda Marga included. Whatever views we may have of those sorts of fringe religions, I think there

is a danger involved in allowing the setting up of these sorts of commissions to investigate them. I think the Scientologists were at one stage investigated by a similar sort of commission in Victoria back in the early 1960s. I hold no brief for the Scientologists or the Ananda Margas or any other religious group for that matter. Let me be quite clear: I do not believe it is the function of governments to appoint commissions to expose religions. Aboriginal political movements can be investigated. The proposition is held by some that Zionism is racism and therefore criminal and can therefore be investigated. Any people who are alleged to be Zionists can be investigated.
Criminal activity which even some members of this House may have occasionally indulged in, such as starting price betting, can bring them within the purview of this sort of investigation. I think that republicanism or some sort of opposition to the monarchy can be investigated. The Commission can also investigate any sort of sexual deviation or after hours trading. Can honourable members imagine the sort of people who will be appointed to investigate retail stores? After all, after hours trading in the Australian Capital Territory has even been investigated by one of our committees. It has nothing to do with the States. The legislation applies to building dams or anything in areas on the Australian heritage list. Once an area has been declared the heritage people can argue that almost any sort of activity carried on in that area should be investigated because it is classed as criminal activity as a result of some binding resolution which we signed overseas.
I remember very well-I opposed it at the time-when the now Mr Justice Murphy, who was Attorney-General, carried out a witch hunt against Croats because they were alleged to be criminals en masse. He organised a parliamentary investigation. That is the sort of thing that can come about here. A Fred Nile type of Attorney General could carry out a commission of inquiry into almost anything that gives anybody pleasure. A royal commission could be set up to smear people and to cause them to incriminate themselves. It has been said of Mr Costigan, whom I have never met, that he has performed an excellent job. I shall make a point in regard to Mr Costigan. I must admit that I was overseas when he admitted to some mistakes in his interim report No.4. I am not sure whether I am referring to the admitted mistakes, but let me look at some of the statements he made which I consider to have been wrong. Page 34 of the interim report No.4 of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union which was tabled in

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3005

this House refers to Mr Gleedman's medical condition. Paragraph 3.25 states:
He was suffering from hyperthalmic depression, as he had done for many years in the past.
I can assure the House that I have checked every possible dictionary that I can find, and there is no such thing. It may be a misprint; there may be all kinds of reasons for it. This is an official report which has been tabled. Costigan had been a royal commi~sioner for approximately 18 months when he tabled this report. I think he has a fairly large staff. On page 56, referring to a chap called Bercove, he stated:
According to Mr Gleedman, Mr Bercove placed the telephone number of the Perth Office of the Crown Solicitor in the advertisements for the business. Mr Bercove denied this, and I have at this stage no other hard evidence on this matter, but as between him and Mr Gleedman, I find Mr Gleedman the far more credible witness.
That was just after having stated that Gleedman has a psychiatric condition and was dismissed for good reason. The point I am making is that this person, who has been a royal commissioner for 18 months and has the assistance of staff, has not bothered to check whether an allegation is true; he merely repeated the allegation. Surely it would have been extremely easy to check whether advertisements containing the Crown Solicitor's phone number were published. All he said was that he was not able to check. How many more years does he need to check that matter? One of the matters I am always worried about is that even people with good intentions have all kinds of hang-ups. Let us look at Mr Costigan's hang-up. I will not use a religious phrase because it antagonised a lot of people in the Australian Labor Party Caucus when I mentioned it. Mr Costigan talked about Bercove's wife and about the escort agency which she started. The first point is that that matter is completely irrelevant. Bercove is being criticised for a failure to do certain things. That is fair enough. I think he and his wife can be criticised because she was allegedly involved, according to this report, on the basis of being a secretary of some companies involved with the Maher organisation. The Commissioner then talked at great length. He has obviously got a hang-up and a guilt complex about escort agencies. How is this relevant to his inquiry into the affairs of the painters and dockers or taxation problems? Paragraph 3.56 on page 53 states:
I do not believe that the services provided by this business are limited by the euphemistic description of 'escort agency'. I cannot accept that it is anything other than organised prostitution. It would defy common sense and knowledge of worldly affairs to suppose that a business such as this grossing each year something in the order of $16,000 (which involves an average of 7-8 assignments per week spread amongst five girls)

was capable of doing so in circumstances that did not involve the escort providing sexual entertainment.
What business is that of Costigan? The report further states:
The amount charged, $40-$60 a time, supports this conclusion.
That is his own view. I do not know how much he normally pays. He continued:
There would be very few men prepared to pay such an amount merely for the pleasure of an escort to a dinner at which, no doubt, a similar amount or more is to be paid again.
I can assure Mr Costigan that I know many people who are prepared to spend that sort of amount, if they have that sort of money, to entertain themselves. The only reason I mention these points is to show that a person who has been praised all over Australia as an outstanding person to be appointed to run this sort of crimes commission has, to my mind, quite significant deficiencies. That is the point I am trying to make as far as the National Crimes Commission is concerned. These sorts of commissions, whether they are royal commissions or crimes commissions, are set up to get the answer which people want. They will keep asking questions until they get the right answer. People are not protected. The commissioners have a preconceived idea as to who is guilty and who is not guilty and they will go on and on until they finally trap a person into making some sort of admission.
In the United States-l think this should be directed more to honourable members on this side of the House in order to encourage them to vote against this sort of legislation-many people, from Alger Hiss onwards; under what was called McCarthyism, were convicted not for having done anything but for allegedly giving false evidence or refusing to give evidence to commissions and committees. That is the crime with which they were charged. They finished up in gaol. That is exactly what we are proposing to do under this sort of legislation.
Going through the legislation-l do not want to retain the House much longer, but I hope to be able to speak in the Committee stage-I think it is important to note that this legislation is being rushed through this House. I think that is being done for political reasons. At the time when it was introduced, an election this year was rumoured. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) has foreshadowed six quite reasonable amendments. The Opposition is preparing to move 14 extremely valuable and important amendments. The Acting Attorney-General has indicated that he will accept at least some ofthose amendments and is moving nine amendments himself. Surely this indicates that we have not

3006 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

studied this legislation sufficiently. 1 certainly hope, as was suggested yesterday-I am not sure whether the honourable member for North Sydney or the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) did so-that the Bill will lie on the table before the Committee stage is initiated. Obviously no great hurry exists to pass this legislation.
One of the worst aspects of the proposed National Crimes Commission is the sort of fishing expedition which may be commenced. 1 instance the case where it is not known what charge can be levelled against a person. The allegation is made that a particular person makes his money in some illegal fashion. A fishing expedition is then undertaken into his affairs. It has always been my view that where a warrant is issued for a specific purpose and elements unrelated to that warrant are found during a search of premises or other investigation it should not be possible to use that unrelated material against that person. It is obviously easy to get a warrant to search people's premises. A search under a warrant issued for a specific purpose may result in the discovery of evidence on a complet~ different matter. It is my view that it should not be possible for that sort of evidence to be used in court.
On the question of search warrants, it is quite clear from clause 14 in the National Crimes Commission legislation that union offices, political parties, offices, parliamentarians' offices and churches et cetera can be raided. Premises of any kind and even aircraft can be searched. Anything may be taken from any premises following an allegation to the Commission which results in a search. One of the worst aspects of the National Crimes Commission legislation, is to be found, 1 think, in clause 17 which provides that if somebody is granted immunity that person must answer all the questions concerning other people including what those people have ever been seen to do. 1 understand that the words 'other people' include spouses in this instance. Questions must be answered concerning whether those people have done whatever the Government wants to smear them with, including whether a person was a member of any subversive organisation, whether a person ever had an SP bet, whether a person ever traded on Sundays or whatever is going at any time. Punishment for these sorts of offences is very severe. There are fines of $2,000 and/or imprisonment for 12 months for refusing to do certain things or for allegedly not doing them in the way that they ought to have been done. 1 very strongly urge the House to reject this piece of legislation.

NATIONAL CRIMES COMMISSION BILL 1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed.
Mr HYDE (Moore) (9.25)-1 congratulate the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) on a very libertarian speech. I will not detain the House long. The legislation before the House enters new ground. The inquisitorial method of investigating and dealing with crime is not the way of some the English-speaking nations. It is the way of the United States of America but it is not the way of Australia. The legislation covers very new ground. Major changes ought not be made quickly. In my view the National Crimes Commission Bill ought best be allowed to lie on the table over the summer recess so that others can view it and consider it. The bar councils around Australia seem to be coming out against it and that gives me cause of concern.
The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) intends to move three amendments that have not been accepted by the Government-other amendments are to be accepted by the Government-to protect witnesses appearing before this National Crimes Commission. 1 will be supporting those amendments. 1 understand that several of my colleagues, including the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), also will support those amendments. In the McCarthyist atmosphere that has pervaded this Parliament-in fact, the whole nation-over the last eight weeks or 90, expressions such as the one 'UnAustralian' have been bandied around. This is no time to be rushing through legislation that just might prejudice fundamental liberties. 1 urge the Government even at this late stage to let the Bill lie on the table during the summer recess.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

Clause 6 (Establishment and constitution of
Commission).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith)
(9.27)-1 move:
(1) Clause 6, page 3, after sub-clause (5) insert the following sub-clause:
'(SA) A person shall not be appointed as a member unless he appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment by reason of his having expertise, or having had experience, relevant to the work of the Commission.',
As presently drafted, clause 6 provides that the Commission shall consist of a chairman and not less than one or more than four other members. The person to be appointed chairman would need to be, or have been, a judge or enrolled as a legal practitioner for not less than five years. Going back to the second reading debate, I think a lot of concern was expressed by honourable members that the legislation should guarantee in respect of a commission of this type about which there is a lot of unhappiness that the rights of the individual are not infringed and that it does not become an inquisitorial commission which later on can run parallel with some other action that may be taken. If the Government is determined to go it alone in this area with people from the States and other areas not being involved, the Opposition is anxious to ensure that there is at least a component embodying some expertise or experience relevant to the work of the Commission. I fully support the proposition that the people who do this sort of work must be mindful of the rights of those who appear before them. In my vew we should be very mindful of the fact that some people who give evidence may need protection in terms of anonymity.
Without wearying the Committee too much, I refer again to the Volkman case. This gentleman happened to be a Commonwealth officer in the Bureau of Customs. Of his own volition and to his credit he went along, as a citizen, to the hearings of the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and gave evidence in what was deemed to be in camera. He thought that evidence was confidential. The interesting thing is that the people assisting the Royal Commission happened to be Commonwealth police officers. One of themnamely, Detective Sergeant Brian Cartersubsequently took part in a search of Volkman's premises following a warrant being issued for such a search. This shows what can happen. It was an incredible situation. We must fully support all the things that have been said by both sides of the chamber. What protection did Volkman have when he went before the Williams Royal Commission to give evidence in camera? One of the Commonwealth police officers immediately

reported to superior officers virtually all that Volkman said. We should bear in mind that Volkman was talking about perjury. He was talking about massive dealings in narcotics. He was talking about involvement with intelligence agents. He was talking about corruption at the highest level. He named people in his evidence. All that was immediately relayed to the people involved. Volkman named a person called Adams. Adams was also one of those who took part in a search of Volkman's premises. In the trial of Volkman it was suggested that Adams might be able to give evidence. He was not available because he was in the United States of America.
It must be of concern to all of us in this nation if people who are prepared to help bring criminals to justice and to eradicate rottenness and corruption in the Public Service and elsewhere are victimised. How is it that these people can be so pilloried and presecuted, as happened with Volkman? For that reason ifthis Commission is to proceed, we need to have people who' clearly understand that they may need to protect the people giving them information. They should not be turned over to the abuses that happened in the Volkman case. If this Commission is ever to work it will need people of the highest calibre, of the utmost discretion and of the greatest expertise to guarantee that we do not have this outrageous infringement of people's rights and the persecution of them. I add that this has been done by a government in terms of an ex officio indictment by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). If we are to clean up our society and if some evidence is given that people with official responsibilities are not doing their jobs that should be investigated and an appropriate report should be made. The amendment, weak as it may be, moved by the Opposition will guarantee that at least there will be some close scrutiny of those who are to be appointed to this very sensitive Commission.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (9.34)-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has put forward some persuasive reasons as to why the proposed sub-clause should be inserted in the Bill. It has been said in general terms that it is important that the right people be appointed as members of the National Crimes Commission, people who have the appropriate expertise and experienceexperience which, of course, is relevant to the work of the Commission. They are, in the view of the Government, good reasons why such an amendment should be made to the Bill. Accordingly, the Government accepts this amendment.
Amendment agreed to.

3008 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bimm

Clause, as amended, agr-:ed to.
Clause 7 (Functions).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (9.37)-1 move:
.(2) Clause 7, page 4, lines 12-23, omit sub-clause (2), substItute the following sub-clause:
"(2) In this section, 'offence' means an offence--
(a) relating to organized criminal activities, that is. activities that appear to involve a number of offences connected with one another, several offenders and substantial planning and organization;
(b) involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques; or
(c) relating to bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or of a Territory.".
At present sub-clause (2) says that the National Crimes Commission shall seek to direct its activities in relation to offences. What the Opposition is endeavouring to do here is to redraft the subclause by suggesting what 'offence' means. It means an offence relating to organised criminal activities. At the present time that is said in a different way. The Opposition would like the subclause to say that organised criminal activities can be defined as activities that appear to involve a number of offences conne"ted with one another et cetera. We go on to define the situation. We think that the sub-clause is far too wide at the present time, particularly if one looks at paragraph (d), which states:
Other offences of kinds thaI persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating.
In our view that could mean anything. It does not necessarily relate at all to what one would call organised criminal activities. The words 'other offences of kinds that persons or bodies are exoerie~cing special difficulty in investigating' I~ave Wide open the sorts of powers the Commission may take into itself. We should bear in mind that this Commission is to assemble with a view to the prosecution of any evidence in the commission of an offence. We do not want the Commission to go on a wide-ranging search and destroy expedition without having any clearcut purposes as to what it has in mind. For that reason, we have moved for the substitution of a new sub-clause (2) that will be in three sections, not four sections. The proposed sub-clause picks up, in our view, the intentions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in the Government's sub-clause and omits paragraph (d). We think that acceptance of our amendment would mean that there would be minimisation of the. r!sk of the Commission getting into political ~Ct1vlty under the cloak of suggesting that it is mterested in apparent offences that there was some special difficulty in investigating. We do not

want to see that sort of concept arise. I think the Opposition's amendment is perfectly reasonable. It in no way weakens the concept of what is involved here. Accordingly, we ask that the amendment be accepted.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (9.38)-1 support the Opposition's amendment. I have a number of queries which I would like to raise. My first query deals with clause 7 (I) under which the National Crimes Commission may investigate of its own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General. Why are references to be confined to the Attorney-General? Let us assume-I hope this will ultimately happen-a legal division is set up within the Australian Taxation Office. I think such a division would be more competent to assess whether areas such as those raised by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the McCabe-Lafranchi report ought to be referred to the Commission. In England there are only about 15 or 16 members of staff in both the Crown Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office; the rest of the departments in Great Britain have their own legal divisions.
If ever an area needed to be examined by a commission at this point of time it is the Bureau of Customs. The officers there deserve that. They warrant that examination. It is time the Bureau was inquired into. It is long overdue. If the matter is left in the hands of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) it will never get investigated. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock) is competent and is responsible to the Parliament and to the nation for Customs and is responsible for business and consumer affairs. He ought to have sufficient faith in the Government to make the reference if he considers it necessary and not have to go through the Attorney-General. Clause 7 (1) (a) deals with the question of extra territorial applications. I would Eke to know from the Minister: Are offences against the law of the Commonwealth? Does it need an express clause to make it clear that the Crimes Commission can investigate breaches to Federal law which occur outside this country? For instance, people may operate outside Australia, particularly public servants, and may be involved overseas in this sort of activity. We have five officers, if my memory serves me correctly, operating within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs, or we did have, in Bangkok. I think a clause is needed to ensure that the Commission can investigate breaches of either federal law or territorial law which occur outside
Australia.
Let us turn to clause 7 (I) (a) which deals with the impediment to federal law. We may need to

National Crimes Commission Bimm

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3009

look, as we have to look, at the Crown Solicitor's Office, where the Department and the lawyers have in fact failed to enforce Federal law. That has been amplified by the Costigan Commission. I would like to know from the Acting Attorney General how in fact he envisages-if the Bill becomes placed on the statute book and a commission is set up-the commission would go about its work to investigate, firstly, the Crown Solicitor's Office and the Solicitor-General's Office. How does he intend to go about that? What does he have in mind? The other matter I want to raise concerns clause 7 (2) (d). Does it in fact enable the Commission to co-ordinate its activities with bodies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation or indeed with Scotland Yard; that is, on the question of international co-operation? Does it mean reciprocity of investigation?
At this point I refer to clause 13 because it locks in with clause 7. Why does the Minister not take the additional logical and constructive step to permit the Commissioner to recommend to appoint a special prosecutor particularly in a case in circumstances where investigation is needed to inquire into the way law enforcement officers have failed to apply the law? I mention the Mackay case. There is a conflict of interest between the police and the Government with the woman caught in between both. These cases, in my view, warrant the Commission having the power to recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor.
Let me make another observation. I would imagine a commission would set up a task force to investigate alleged offences of this nature. I imagine it would be sensible. There are two arms to it. There is the investigative arm, which would be the police, and the prosecution arm. I think a special prosecutor would be appointed at the same time as the appointment of the task force. So indeed the special prosecutor, in fact, is part of and is competent to make a judgment right through the whole investigative procedures. It is not unreasonable in cases where there is a conflict between the departments in this case, as appeared in the Costigan Commission, because the Crown Solicitor or certain Crown Solicitors' officers failed to enforce the law. In my view we ought to permit the Commissioner either to make recommendations or to appoint special prosecutors. That is all I have on the matter.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (9.46)-1 would like to ask the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) to deal with the following proposition. Clause 7 (I) states:
. . the functions of the Commission are-
(a) to investigate of its own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General-

(i) any circumstance suggesting that an offence may have been . . . committed against a law of the Commonwealth . . .
It repeats that in different forms four times; that is, enforcement of any law, et cetera. I think subparagraph (iii) is different from sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iv) in the same way. Sub-clause (2) states:
The Commission shall, in the course of investigating circumstances, allegations and activities referred to in paragraph (I) (a), seek, so far as practicable, to direct its activities in relation to-
(a) organised criminal activities . . .
That is what we are trying to amend and tighten. What I would like to hear from people with legal expertise is that even assuming that we tighten sub-clause (2), and it is accepted by the Government or agreed to by the House, how do we restrict it to criminal activities? The sorts of things that I would hope we all think should not be investigated by this sort of Commission, for example, breaches or attempted breaches, or conspiracy to breach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court and after hours trading laws and things like that, are not relevant. Most of us would not consider them to be criminal activities, yet they are breaches of Commonwealth law. I am sure lawyers can think of other examples. Does sub-clause (2) somehow restrict sub-clause (1) or would it still be possible for an Attorney-General to direct the Commission or request the Commission to investigate what I consider to be semi-political infringement of the law? Sub-paragraph (iv) states:
any activity that is, or appears to be, impeding the implementation or enforcement of a law of the Commonwealth or of a territory;
The two most obvious ones, because in a sense they are on opposite sides of the political fence, are the ones dealing with srikes on the one hand and the ones dealing with after hours trading on the other hand. Would the Commission be able to investigate it, or is it restricted by the reference to criminal offences in sub-clause (2)? I think most of us would agree-maybe I am wrong-that breaches of after hours trading would not be a criminal offence.
Sir James Killen-It could be, depending on the nexus.
Dr KLUGMAN-That is the sort of thing that worries me-I hope it worries other honourable members of the House; that is, that a National Crimes Commission will be appointed to investigate those sorts of matters. In principle, even those who strongly support the Commission are really concerned with what the community at

3010 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bimm

large would all agree are serious criminal activities. How can we amend the legislation so as to prevent this sort of activity on the part of the Commission?
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (9.49)~There is one point I wanted to raise that I overlooked. Could the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) ultimately explain what is not in the legislation? I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) made reference to it; that is, what occurs if the Commission discovers a breach of law? Has the Commission or has not the Commission the power to bring an indictment? That is not provided for and I cannot find it in the second reading speech, in the explanatory memoranda, or in the Bill.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley~Acting Attorney-General) (9.50)~The Government is not able to aCcept the amendment that is proposed on this occasion by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Government takes the view that the effect of the amendment would very severely restrict the National Crimes Commission in its work. Indeed, far more significantly than that, the omission of
paragraph (d) from sub-clause (2)-that is, to omit the words 'other offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating'~ would substantially defeat the very reason why the National Crimes Commission is to be established. It has been felt for some time, particularly in recent times, that there are very clearly offences which the estalished law enforcement mechanisms have had particular difficulty in resolving and investigating. To make the omission that is proposed would, in our view, severely restrict the National Crimes Commission in a very important area of its work.
The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) asked a number of specific questions
about why references to the Commission are to be confined to those made by the Attorney-General. The answer is that clearly there must be ministerial responsibility with respect to the Commission and there must be a request by one Minister to activate the Commission on the assumption that it is not proceeding on its own volition, which of course it can. But it would seem, at first glance at least, to be an impractical situation if a succession of MinistersI think the honourable member suggested this in effect-were referring a whole host of matters to the National Crimes Commission at the same time. The work clearly has to be regulated and distributed and it is appropriate that one person should make those requests to the Commission.

In addition to that, it would certainly be the intention of the Government to watch the operation of the Commission and if a practical problem arises of the sort that the honourable member has referred to that could be examined. But for reasons of practicality and good sense it is clearly sensible that the matters should come before the Commission either on the motion of the Commission itself or at the request of one responsible Minister, who in this case is the Attorney General; he is responsible for the administration of this Act. I do not wish to detain the Committee with discussion of extra-territoriality. The situation is that with some exceptions most criminal laws do not apply extra-territorially--
Mr Jacobi-Yes, they do. They apply under the Crimes Act.
Mr N. A. BROWN-As the honourable member said, the Crimes Act does. He is absolutely right. If an offence is committed extraterritorially, on my reading of clause 7, it would apply. The honourable member asked: 'How does the Government expect the Commission to conduct its activities?'. I draw his attention to a significant clause-clause 12-which provides, amongst other things, that the Attorney-General is not entitled to give directions or furnish guidelines to the Commission in relation to the conduct of a particular investigation. It is very important, having established a body of this sort, that it sould be allowed to get on with its own work. It would be very wrong in principle to have the Attorney-General or anybody else constricting and directing it as to what it should and should not do. It is given a charter under the Bill and it is appropriate when the Bill becomes an Act that the Commission should be at large to perform those functions set out under the Act without being restricted or directed by the Attorney General or anybody else. The honourable member referred to special prosecutors. I refer him to clause 13 of the Bill which provides, amongst other things, that:
. . the Commission may either-~
(b) . . . or to a person nominated by that Attorney General or Minister to receive the evidence.
There are similar provisions which I will not take the Committee's time to read out. Presumably a special prosecutor may be appointed in that case. In addition a special prosecutor may be appointed under those circumstances that are set out in the Special Prosecutors Act which was recently passed by the Parliament and which makes it plain what the functions of a special prosecutor are. With respect to what are and what are not offences, the answer to the honourable member's question is that we certainly would not expect

National Crimes Commission Bimm

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3011

this, on our interpretation of the legislation at this stage, to have as wide an ambit as some of the matters that the honourable member referred to. The question is whether it is an offence and that will depend upon the terms of the Act concerned. If a particular statute which creates an offence is involved, then, of course, the Commission would have an area of operation.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (9.56)-The reply of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) is quite unsatisfactory. What it means is that all one needs to do is draw the attention of the National Crimes Commission to the fact that somebody is committing an offence under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or the trading hours ordinance and the Commission can investigate it and go on a fishing expedition against people, unions or employer bodies involved. Our proposed amendment deletes (d) as the Acting Attorney-General pointed out. 1 would be happy if he would point out to me what other offences persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating would be covered by this legislation but are not covered by the first three parts-the organised criminal activities, the offences involving use of sophisticated methods, or bribery or corruption involving officers. What other kinds of offences is he thinking of? Surely that is exactly the sort of thing that we are worried about. We are extending the ability of the Commission to undertake fishing expeditions and inquisitorial actions regarding things which are not criminal activities. What kinds of offences is the Minister thinking of which he wants to cover?
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (9.57)-1 think that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), with respect, is placing a wrong emphasis on clause 7 (2). The purpose of clause 7 (2) is to direct the National Crimes Commission, in the course of conducting its investigations, to have regard to particular matters. It is for the very reason that we are seeking to direct the Commission to have regard to particular matter that the body is being established. There is a situation with respect to organised criminal activities and sophisticated crime--
Dr Klugman-But you emphasised (d).
Mr N. A. BROWN-I appreciate that. There is a reference to bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or a Territory or other offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating. There is no point in restricting unnecessarily the Commission from

areas of activity which may well open up for it in the future and which it may well be appropriate for it to investigate. There is no point in restricting the Commission in that way. Indeed, it is appropriate that the Commission should be directed to a situation, whatever the offences may be-it is impossible to say what they are-in which the established law enforcement agencies are having special difficulty in investigating offences, by reason of international involvement or by reason of any other circumstance. It is impossible to list offences and say today that these are offences of the kind that established law enforcement agencies are having special difficulty investigating. The offences may well change. If a situation arises in which State police bodies or the Australian Federal Police-or whatever other agency it may be-are having difficulty dealing with particular areas of crime or offences, whatever they may be, it is very appropriate that the Commission should bring its expertise to bear on investigating those matters.
Amendment negatived.
Mr Lionel Bowen-I did not press for a division because of the lateness of the hour but 1want it noted that the Opposition would normally press for a division because it wanted this clause amended as proposed.
Clause 7 agreed to.
Consideration interrupted.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Hon. Charles Jones)-Order! It being 10 p.m., I shall report progress.
Progress reported.
ADJOURNMENT
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! It being after 10 p.m., 1 propose the question:
That the House do now adjourn.
Sir James Killen-I require that the question be put forthwith without debate.
Question resolved in the negative.
NATIONAL CRIMES COMMISSION BILL 1982
In Committee
Consideration resumed.
Clauses 8 and 9-by leave-taken together, and agreed to.
Clause 10 (Establishment and constitution of Commission) .
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (10.2)-1 move:

3012 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

(I) Clause 10, page 5, after sub-clause (2) add the following sub-clause:
'(3) In any report by the Commission under this section the Commission shall take reasonable care to ensure that the identity of a person is not revealed if to reveal his identity might, in light of any material appearing in the report, prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence. '.
The effect of this amendment is to add an additional sub-clause to clause 10. Sub-clause (1) of clause 10 provides for general investigations by the National Crimes Commission where a request has been made in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (I). It is provided that the commissioner shall report to the Attorney-General or, in cases where a request has been made by a State Minister, to that State Minister, his findings and recommendations for the enactment of laws or the taking of administrative action that the commissioner considers appropriate to reduce or remove the cause of that criminal activity. Subclause (2) of clause 10 goes on to provide:
A report by the Commission under this section shall not-
(a) identify persons as being suspected of having committed offences; or
(b) identify persons as having committed offences unless those persons have been convicted of those offences.
So the clause is limited to a restriction on identification of someone who is a suspect and a restriction on identification of someone as an offender save in the latter case where the person has been convicted. It is my view that that protection is far too limited. For this reason I have proposed that a further sub-clause be added to clause 10 after subclause (2). The proposed new sub-clause would read:
In any report by the Commission under this section the Commission shall take reasonable care to ensure that the identity of a person is not revealed if to reveal his identity might, in light of any material appearing in the report----
These are important words-
prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.
Of course we are all concerned with organised crime but I think we are also concerned with fundamental safeguards, fundamental rights and the protection, safety and reputation of citizens. I spent some three years of my professional life mainly concerned with conducting inquisitions of the kind we are here considering. These were special investigations under the Companies Act. I must say that in the course of these investigations I learnt a lot about the effect of publicity upon people. I saw some of my own reports appearing on the front pages of newspapers. I am very glad to say that it turned out that my judgment was correct because the two persons who most concerned me are now serving lengthy sentences of

imprisonment. But what if my judgment had not been correct? Could those reports ever be recalled? They certainly could not be in the minds of the average reader. Once the words go out the damage is done for ever. The ordinary person has no recourse at all.
For those reasons-as well as my concern, of course, with safety and fair trial which are fundamental matters for all of us-I have moved the amendment in the form in which it appears. I am glad to say that the Government has agreed to the amendment save for the words 'or reputation' which appear in the third last line. The Government is content. I thank the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) who has been most forthcoming in conversations about these amendments. The Government is prepared to concede all but the words 'or reputEltion'. But is reputation not such an important matter, and is it not for all of us an asset which once lost can never be recovered? Would we not all want to be in a position where our reputation could not be tarnished by, let us assume, well-intentioned people who got their facts wrong?
How would any of us like to feature in a report by a commission under the provisions of clause 10 and find that we are accused of activities or of guilt by association and, let us say, six months later the commission says: 'Look, we are very sorry; we made one or two mistakes and we will publish a retraction'? Who ever recalls the retraction? Nobody does. One always recalls the initial damage, slur and destruction. The person concerned will always be known as the person who featured in the commission's report. This concept of a basic protection is, in fact, picked up elsewhere in the Bill. I direct the attention of honourable members to what appears in clause 16, subclause (6). It gives force to what I put about the need for protection of reputations. Honourable members will see that that sub-clause deals with the exercise by the Commission of its discretion to have public or private hearings. Sub-clause (6) specifically provides:
In exercising its discretion . . . the Commission shall have regard to whether it is necessary or desirable for evidence that is to be given to the Commission at the hearing to be taken in private in order to ensure that a person who has been or may be charged with an offence will or would receive a fair trial for the offence or in order to avoid prejudice to the safety or reputation of a person.
If it is relevant for the Commission in determining whether a hearing should be private or public to consider the possibility of damage to the reputation of a person, why is it not equally relevant when that same Commission comes to report on the activities that it has examined again to be concerned with the reputation of a person? Surely, in

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3013

terms of logic and in terms of common justice the two must go together. There is no prejudice on the part of the Commission. No doubt many reports of a confidential nature will be made. That is part of the inquisitorial nature. 1 know that myself. 1 have written reports which were for the Attorney General's eyes only, and those reports stayed with the Attorney-General. There can be no prejudice but, as 1 have put to honourable members, the damage is just too obvious. The opportunities for abuse are too obvious. The likelihood of damage from human error is too obvious. Therefore, why should not the Commission, in furnishing a report under clause 10, take reasonable care-that is all that 1 ask-to ensure that the identity of the person is not revealed if to reveal his identity, in light of any material appearing in the report, would prejudice the reputation of that person? 1 put the example we all know about for guilt by association-'You were seen with X or you were seen at y's place five years ago'. We are all conscious of how important our reputations are. We should be at least as concerned with the reputations of the many citizens who will be called before this Commission and who will be nothing else but good citizens trying to do the best they can by the country and by the Commission.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (10.12)-1 want to add to what was said by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) a point which really relates to clause 20 dealing with the power of the proposed Commission to deal with contempt. 1think we have to face the fact that we are dealing with organised crime and that to that extent we have the problems of physical violence, of intimidation and of the protection of peoples' reputations. 1do not know whether clause 20 will really protect witnesses. Does one assume that the Crimes Act may be sufficient? Will section 36A in Part III of the Crimes Act be brought to bear in these sorts of judicial proceedings?
1 cite the case of Volkman which was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). 1 would have thought frankly that Part III of the Crimes Act ought to have been brought to bear to protect a person such as Volkman. Can the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) give an assurance that that section will be brought to bear? As 1 understand it, the legislation establishing the Joint Committee of Public Accounts provides for the protection of witnesses appearing before that Committee. Section 37 of the Crimes Act deals with the corruption of witnesses and seeks to prevent their fabricating evidence. Section 40 of the same Act concerns action taken to prevent witnesses attending a court.

Surely people ought to be protected from intimidation.
Another matter 1 would like to hear about from the Acting Attorney-General is not provided for in the Bill although 1 think it is provided for in the royal commissions legislation. There ought to be a provision to guarantee employees continuity of employment so that they cannot be dismissed because they give evidence before the proposed Commission. Another matter not provided for is the payment of witnesses. 1 would like some explanation from the Acting Attorney-General on that.
Mr N. A. Brown-There is an amendment on that.
Mr JACOBI-I am delighted that that is so. That answers that query. The matter 1 raise concerns action to encourage people to give evidence. I think we ought to think about this. 1 believe there is a need to provide the Commission with the power to request or recommend to the Attorney-General the grant of a pardon. I know that the Acting Attorney-General will tell me that that is an entirely different thing, but I think he ought to look at the pardon aspect.
Mr HYDE (Moore) (10.15)-1 will speak to the two words 'or reputation' so as not to waste the time of the Committee as I believe the Government is to accept the rest of the amendment. I do not think that it will be disputed by the Government that a man's reputation is a precious asset and that it ought not to be squandered, particularly by other people. I call the attention of the Committee to the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Persons who were named in that report, even though Costigan went to some lengths in some cases to point out that there was no evidence that they were in any way culpable, were still grossly damaged by their mere naming in the :eport. It got worse than that after the report came down. Persons were then named in this place and their reputations were further damaged. The class of persons mentioned in the report had odium heaped on them by people in and out of politics and by people on both sides of this chamber. The reputations of persons named in the Costigan report, or identified without being named in the Costigan report, were so damaged that they are most unlikely to be recovered within the lifetime of those persons. That is clearly a gross injustice.
The purpose of the public reports of the proposed National Crimes Commission is to inform the public of the general areas of its activities. It is not necessary for it to report in such a

3014 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

way that an individual can be identified so that his reputation may be damaged. It is surely not our intention to conduct justice in this country in the manner in which it was conducted by the McCarthy inquisitions in the United States at the height of the Cold War. That is the risk that this type of inquiry runs if there is not adequate protection of the reputations of people. A reputation is a valuable asset and there is the risk that the punishment will come before the trial. That ought to be unacceptable to any government and certainly to any party that calls itself 'Liberal'.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1 0.17) -The Opposition supports what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) has put forward. We think there is no more precious thing than a reputation. Without delaying the Committee, we fully support what he has in mind.
Mr SHACK (Tangney) (10.18)-The state of my voice will ensure that I will be brief. I support the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). A reputation is that community opinion by which a citizen is known, regarded and treated in our society. Notwithstanding that, we live in a social context in which we all too readily accept guilt by association and in which we forget the time-honoured principle that one is presumed absolutely innocent until the contrary is proven. We live in a social context in which, when mud is thrown, a little sticks in the community mind. When there is smoke, in the community mind, there is fire. We in this chamber have cause on many occasions to be ashamed of our own behaviour in the way in which we have totally disregarded the reputations of people outside this place. A man's reputation is almost as precious as his physical safety. At least in this legislation, in the absence of a charge, we should ensure that reasonable care is taken to protect a person's reputation. That is all that is asked for by this amendment.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Hon. Charles Jones)-I call the honourable member for Casey.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (10.19)-1 am reluctant to intrude on the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer). 1 simply say that the Government will accept this amendment in its entirety. 1 do not know whether the honourable member would then wish to speak. I am sure that there will be an opportunity for him to speak. There is certainly no intention on the Government's part to create a situation in which the reputation of people will be prejudiced. That should be made completely clear to all who have contributed to the debate. The

concern is simply whether the inclusion of the words 'or reputation', which in fact can be given a very wide meaning, will unnecessarily restrict the National Crimes Commission in the writing of its reports. Nevertheless, on balance, when one has regard to the necessity for the Commission to write accurate reports which may in fact refer to people's reputations and when one has regard, on the other hand, to the matters of overwhelming importance which have already been referred to concerning the importance to protect people's reputations, the Government would accept the amendment.
Mr FALCONER (Casey) (10.21)-1 intended to rise to support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I am grateful that the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) has indicated that the Government will support that amendment. I would, however, like to take the opportunity to comment on something that the Minister had to say while he was indicating the Government's support. He raised the question whether the inclusion of the words 'or reputation' in the clause might in some way restrict the Commission in the carrying out of its functions and in the writing of reports which adequately dealt with the subjects the Commission had before it. As indicated by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) when he spoke during the second reading debate, even judges can become somewhat expansive in their comments in writing reports and they do not necessarily, in the context of reports of commissions, strictly adhere to the standards that would apply if they were handing down a judgment in a court of law. I think that this is a tendency that we must seek to guard against in establishing this Commission.
I think it is worth noting the attitude that has always been expressed by the Victorian Supreme Court to the prospect of judges of that Court participating in royal commissions and commissions of inquiry. In 1923 Chief Justice W. H. Irvine quite clearly set out the attitude of the Victorian Supreme Court to participation in royal commissions. He wrote to the Government of Victoria in the following terms:
The duty of His Majesty's Judges is to hear and determine issues of fact and of law arising between the King and a subject, or between a subject and a subject presented in a form enabling judgment to be passed upon them, and when passed to be enforced by a process of law. There begins and ends the function of the Judiciary.
Chief Justice Irvine made the point that if a judge is not constrained by proper standards of presentation of evidence, rules of evidence and so on he or she, like any other citizen, may be inclined to

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3015

become too expansive and run the danger of making comments that cannot be properly supported. So I think it is a very valuable addition to the Bill to have this rigour, this discipline, established for the commissioners.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley~Acting Attorney-General) (\O.23)~1 wish to answer very briefly a point raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). Section 31 has a definition of 'judicial proceeding' which would seem by its terms to cover the National Crimes Commission. Therefore, that part would apply.
Mr Jacobi~ What about the pardon aspect?
Mr N. A. BROWN~Perhaps I could take that up with the honourable member at a later stage.
Mr Jacobi~ You ought to put it on the record. Never mind about taking it up in the corridors.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Hoo. C. K. Jooes)~Order! If the honourable member wishes to address the Chair he should rise in his place and receive the call.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause II agreed to.
Clauses 12 and 13~by leave~taken together.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley~Acting Attorney-General) (IO.25)~by leave~1 move:
(I) Clause 12, page 5, lines 35 to 39, omit sub-clause (3), substitute the following sub-clause:
'(3) If the Commission has functions conferred on it by or under a law of a State as mentioned in section 8, the Attorney-General shall not give any directions or furnish any guidelines to the Commission under sub-section (I) with respect to the performance of those functions unless the appropriate Minister of that State has agreed to the giving of the directions or the furnishing of the guidelines.'.
(2) Clause 13, page 6, line 4, omit 'laws of the Commonwealth or of a State', substitute 'laws of the Commonwealth or of a Territory, or against the laws of a State'.
(3) Clause 13, page 6, line 9, before 'continue', insert 'to the ext<ent to which it is within the scope of the functions of the Commission to do so,'.
The view has been taken on closer examination that there can be amendments made to the Bill which will further cement the general attitude which the Government has taken on this matter with respect to co-operation with the States. The amendments seek to achieve that purpose further. With respect to the first amendment, the view has been taken by some that the words in the Bill as introduced might well give rise to some objection on the grounds that the requirement to consult with the States does not sufficiently recognise the interest of the States in relation to this sub-clause. Under the proposed amendment the requirement

to obtain the agreement of a State is limited to directions or guidelines with respect to functions conferred by a State. With respect to the second amendment, under the Bill as introduced subclause 13 (1) does not pick up offences against the law of a Territory, such as the Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island, and the amendment is designed to rectify that situation. The third amendment is designed to meet the concern expressed by some that paragraph (b) in the Bill as presently expressed could enlarge the jurisdiction of the Commission to continue an investigation into offences against State laws. That not being the intention, the amendment seeks to clarify that situation.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.26)~Basically we do not oppose these amendments. But I would make the point that we will be moving an amendment to, I think, subclause 5 of clause 14 which it appears will be amended by the insertion of the word 'mutilated'. I just make the point, in case it is thought that we will not raise the matter, that we are anxious to press our amendment to clause 14 which, if agreed to, would make irrelevant some of these amendments.
Amendments agreed to.
Clauses, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 14 (Search warrants).
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley~Acting Attorney-General) (10.28)~by leave~I move:
(4) Clause 14, page 6,line 32, after 'lost', insert 'mutilated'.
(5) Clause 14, page 7, line 28, after 'loss', insert 'mutilation'.
Both amendments are designed to bring the Bill into line with similar provisions in the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (10.29)~The Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) made reference to the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill. Does this include section 6N of the Royal Commissions Act, which deals with the guarantee of continuity of employment? This is provided for in section 6N of the Royal Commissions Act. Perhaps I could read that section to the Minister. This is the matter that I think was raised by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). He stated:
Any employer who dismisses any employee from his employment, or prejudices any employee in his employment, for Or on account of the employee having appeared as a witness before a Royal Commission . . .
I would like to know whether there is a guarantee to a witness quite apart from his reputation?

30 16 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

Mr N. A. Brown-It does not have anything to do with that. The answer is no.
Mr JACOBI-So a witness is not protected or guaranteed for employment if he appears before a royal commission?
Mr N. A. Brown-The honourable member is referring to the wrong clause.
Amendments agreed to.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.31 )-1 move:
(3) Clause 14, page 7, lines 18-29, omit sub-clause (5).
We are very anxious to press this amendment because presently clause 14 (5) states:
If, in the course of searching, in accordance with a warrant . . .
(a) any thing of another kind that he believes. . . to be connected with that matter; or
(b) any thing that he believes on reasonable grounds to be connected with another matter . . authorise him to seize that thing.
think this is unfair. I now immediately come back to the Volkman case which catches up all the things that worry us about this matter. I add at the outset that I understand the Mr Volkman is seeking some ex gratia compensation for what has happened to him. I will use him as an example. A search warrant was issued against Volkman. As I said his only crime was to give evidence in camera stating what a rotten Narcotics Bureau we had. That was subsequently found to be true. He went on to give all sorts of detailed evidence about corruption in the Bureau. He made reference to the fact that the officers were a lot of yahoos. He named them. He went on to talk about very serious matters relating to Nugan Hand Ltd, intelligence agencies and matters of that type.
When the search warrant was issued, apparently on the basis of the charge that he was exporting birds, the first thing the arresting officers seized-of course he named them-was a transcript of his confidential evidence to the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The officers took that. The officers knew what they were searching for and they got it. In the same process the officers also took a number of other things such as a typewriter. It is admitted that they did all these things. That is extraordinary behaviour. I include as a matter of detail the fact that they also took his mortgage repayment book. The man has had no end of trouble trying to get the return of those items. The officers made the point that they wanted these for some evidentiary purpose. That shows the danger, if a warrant is issued, that somebody can go along and say, 'I am glad to be in your house. Now let us have a crack at everything we can find. I know damn well

if I can find something against myself I have a good chance of intimidating this witness'.
Of course, when we come to Volkman's case which was heard as recently as 23 September, before Mr Justice Miles and jury, we find this sort of evidence coming out in cross-examination. That was in the examination of Mr Victor Arthur Anderson who was the Assistant Commissioner for national operations of the Australian Federal Police. He was asked by Volkman's counsel why this evidence was taken from Volkman's house. Mr Anderson said that well, he did not really know but he thought that perhaps it would be used. Anybody in his right mind would know. I now come to what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said in his speech. He admitted that following the issue of the warrant for the search of Volkman's place, and the details in the collection of this evidence, a policeman named Inspector Thomas, who had nothing to do with the case, called a Press and television conference and announced that there had been some search of Volkman's premises.
In the course of cross-examination Mr Hiatt asked Anderson, 'Did you call a Press conference?' He said, 'No I did not'. Hiatt said, 'Who did call a Press conference?' The answer was 'Detective Inspector Don Thomas called it'. Hiatt said, 'Was he in charge of this case?' Anderson replied, 'No he was not. He was in charge of the Greek conspiracy case'. Hiatt asked, 'How is it that an officer not in charge of this matter wanted to call a Press conference?' Anderson said, 'I don't know. I was horrified. I got to the conference later. I found all sorts of undertakings being broken, including the fact that we had given an undertaking to the American authorities not to disclose certain names. I complained about the matter to Thomas'.
Here we see a whole set of circumstances. Volkman as a former officer was on a charge and being named on television. Is it any wonder the man feels a grave injustice. Anderson was asked, 'What steps did you take to correct the false statement made at the Press conference on television?' Anderson said, 'I did not take any steps at all'. It is a rotten old justice that is happening here-it is a little wide of the mark. Here we have people hauled up before commissions and other people who want to scuttle them and trying to prevent others getting to the truth. We have police officers calling Press conferences naming people before they come to trial. I would like the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) to have a look at what is wrong with this whole aspect of justice. I think if these sorts of people are going to

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3017

be involved in the question of any commission for assisting they should n::>t be in on the job.
The point I am making is: How can we justify these sorts of people walking in and picking up any other matter that they might find convenient in the conduct of a search. I am mindful of a letter written to Volkman's solicitor as far back as October 1980 by Mr Kennedy, the then Deputy Commissioner, making all sorts of curious statements in answer to questions by Volkman's solici-
tor as to why Volkman's in camera evidence was taken from his place. The solicitor received the curious answer to the effect, 'Well, the document has been photocopied. The photocopy has be retained for evidentiary purposes.' It was never used for evidentiary purposes. It was obtained and there is an admission of that in the letter. I am not making accusations without some evidence. When there was some complaint as to why other property was removed from Volkman's premises there was some admission about that. Mr Kennedy said, 'They will be returned at the completion of the court proceedings'. These had nothing to do with the case. They had decided to hang on to them. When there was some allegation, which of course is denied, of interception of telephone calls and the transcript of a telephone call to America-
which the solicitor has made but which has been denied-we are left with the very strong information that perhaps the police were not going to admit everything.
There were allegations of harassment and the matter of Press releases containing confidential information obtained from evidence that Volkman had given to the Federal Royal Commission. This is an extraordinary situation that can affect not only a man's reputation but also his livelihood. Following this charge Mr Volkman was suspended from service. He never even got any pay. In that context how can we justify not having any judicial supervision. That is what we want to get at. In all the actions I am prepared to trust the judiciary if others are not. We have to have some immediate supervision and answers as to why the purpose of the warrant was avoided to the extent that so many other pieces of Volkman's property were taken and why confidential information was released. Why should we now be expected to accept that in the course of a warrant being issued any other information can be taken on this wide ranging search mission? Why should this now be allowed under sub-clause 5?
I hope that the Acting Attorney-General agrees with this. We say that if there is some significant matter that ought to be the subject of a search warrant we propose a further amendment called 14A that would provide an opportunity to get a

warrant by telephone if that were so urgent to prevent any loss or mutilation of evidence. I leave my remarks on that matter until a little later. I again mention the extraordinary set of circumstances, beyond disputation, which were carried out in relation to this particular case. Mr Volkman has been crucified and virtually destroyed because he tried to do something. Anybody who is interested in white collar crime and interested in giving evidence before a commission such as this deserves the utmost protection whether it be in the terms of confidentiality in a report or any evidence given in a court or Press conference that could certainly damage or prejudice a trial.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (10.40)-The Government is not able to accept this amendment. May I say in support of that statement that it should be remembered that the sub-clause does not relate, of course, to any matter that may be discovered, but to anything of another kind that the person executing the warrant believes on reasonable grounds to be connected with that matter. The same emphasis is also placed on matters connected with matters being sought under the warrant in clause 14 (1) (b). There is the additional requirement that the person executing the warrant must believe on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the additional matter, whatever it may be, in order to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction. In those circumstances the warrant is deemed to authorise him to seize that thing, whatever it may be. So with those qualifications it seems a reasonable, sensible and common sense provision to have in the Bill.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.41)-1 refer to the case in which things were removed with no justification at all and not returned. This is admitted in correspondence by the Commissioner of Police, who said: 'We admit that we have the property and we may use it for evidentiary purposes'. It was never used. This case involves the bona fides of what police officers can do. The Minister will leave himself in a dreadful position if he relies on that sort of lack of integrity. The items have now been returned but they were certainly seized. They were things within the meaning of this clause. They had nothing to do with the case. For example, a typewriter and the transcript of evidence had nothing to do with that case. None of those items was returned. It is admitted that they were not returned.
Mr N. A. Brown-They have been returned, though.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-They were returned when he was acquitted. What I am asking is this:

3018 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

How does it prejudice a citizen if there is this discretion on the part of police who can search and decide whether to seize? Where is the sanction against their going outside the terms of the warrant?
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (10.43)-1 feel very strongly about this matter. I believe that we are dealing with fishing expeditions. The Commission will be able to do what police do now. I object to it. Police can pick up young people driving in a car, and under the pretence of looking into the boot to see whether the spare tyre is bald or otherwise, they look, for example, for evidence of marihuana for personal use. If such evidence is found they will prosecute those people. The police will pretend that they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search. I refer to the position some years ago in the United States of America. Police officers had to have 'reasonable grounds' to enter people's homes. They had no evidence whatsoever but it was held in sOme case that if the police officer could hear from outside the House that the toilet was being flushed there were reasonable grounds to believe that people were disposing of incriminating evidence. The police officers used to break into homes without any warrants being issued. The evidence always was that, no matter how thick the walls, as the police passed they could hear the toilet being flushed. That was considered to be sufficient evidence on so-called reasonable grounds to carry out searches without warrants. I believe that the Commission, when it asks for a warrant to be issued, should be quite clear. Clause 14 (4) (a) states:
a statement for the purpose for which the warrant is issued, which shall include a reference to the matter in respect of which the Commission is conducting an investigation and with which the things of the relevant kind are connected
We should not accept the proposition that anything of another kind or anything that an officer believes on reasonable grounds to be connected with another matter altogether should be allowed to be seized without a specific warrant authorising the police to seize that thing. To my mind there is no clearer case of fishing expeditions in searches, as distinct from the inquisitorial nature of the hearings which we will deal with later, which give unnecessarily wide powers to the people con'- nected with the work of this proposed Commission. I therefore strongly urge the Government to accept the removal of clause 14 (5).
Mr DONALD CAMERON (Fadden) (10.46)-- I wish to join with the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) in expressing my concern at the all-embracing nature of this

clause. It frightens me that we enshrine in legislation for ever and ever principles which normally would not be accepted in a community because of
basic beliefs in liberties and the freedom of people. Here we are, in a fairly emotional period in this nation's history in terms of commissions, et
cetera, embellishing legislation with provisions which if wrongly used could ensure that some individuals in our community suffer for a long time, and permanently. Considering the penalties available in this clause, the Government should examine whether this is necessary. As with the case of the flushing of the toilet referred to by the honourable member for Prospect, someone can say: 'Yes, the person flushed the toilet and we have every reason to believe that it was heroin or marihuana'. In such an instance how can we prove that a person has in fact destroyed documents unless that person admits to it? That would be a totally different situation. The area of proof is what causes me grave concern.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (10.48) -One or two honourable members have spoken since I made my last comments. I say simply that it should be remembered that the procedure for the issue of search warrants is set out in considerable detail in the Bill and of course they are issued only in the course of the Commission applying to a judge for a warrant. In the view of the Government it is quite sensible that if in the course of the investigations the person executing the warrant comes across material which he believes on reasonable grounds to be connected with a matter that is being investigated by the Commission, it is appropriate that the person executing the warrant should have the power to seize that thing. It should be recalled also that it is not simply if the person executing the warrant comes across something connected with another matter, as the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) seemed to imply; it is another matter into which the Commission is conducting an investigation. So in fact the power to seize other things found by the person executing the warrant is in fact subject to a quite reasonable restriction in that regard. It is common sense that this power should exist, and the Government is not able to accept the amendment.
Mr RUDDOCK (Dundas) (10.49)-1 have some brief comments to make on this matter. I refer to some comments made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron). He suggested that penalities are involved in this clause. No penalties are involved in this clause. There are penalties elsewhere in the Bill but there are no penalties in relation to this. If something is being taken under sub-clause (5) it seems quite

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3019

obvious to me that if an excess of authority is exercised by the officer involved and he takes items which this clause suggests it is not appropriate for him to take, the taking of those items could be challenged. The person involved could go along to the court and say: 'The officer seized something in excess of the warrant. He had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that it was related to any other proceedings of the type mentioned in sub-clause (5)'. Under those circumstances the person could get those goods, items or things back.
The alternative that has been suggested by the Opposition is that if there were items that the officers had reason to believe might be concealed, lost or destroyed in some way the officer should get to the door and say that he has found these documents or something that may be relevant to the inquiry that is under way. He would then say: 'Wait a moment. I want to go off and find a telephone. Would you just leave them there while I go and get a telephone and ring through to the judge and ask him whether he will extend my warrant?' Can honourable members imagine what would happen in those circumstances? The test ultimately in relation to this is whether the officer has formed a reasonable conclusion and, if he has not, that itself can be challenged.
Amendment negatived.
Mr Lionel Bowen-Mr Chairman, we did not press for a division because of the lateness of the hour.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Proposed new clause 14A (Application by telephone for search warrants).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.52)-1 move:
Page 8. after clause 14 insert the following new clause:
Application by telephone for search warrants
-14A. (I) Where, by reason of circumstances of urgency, the Commission considers it necessary to do so, the Commission may make application by telephone for a search warrant under sub-section 14 (I).
'(2) Where a Judge issues a search warrant upon an application made by telephone, he shall-
(a) complete and sign that warrant;
(b) inform the Commission of the terms of the warrant and the date on which and the time at which it was signed; and
(c) forward a copy of the warrant to the Commission.
(3) Where.a search warrant is issued upon an application made by telephone, a member of the staff of the Commission or a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the Police Force of a State may complete a form of warrant in the terms indicated by a Judge under sub-section (2).

(4) A form of warrant duly completed in accordance with sub-section (3) shall be deemed to be a warrant issued under section 14.'.
I turn now to the point that has been raised. It is important to regularise whatever is seized. There may be cases where matters are destroyed, lost or mutilated. If they are in someone's possession at the time it would not be difficult to cover the legality of it by getting a warrant. I understand that the Government is sympathetic to this amendment. That being the case, I will not delay the House.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (10.53)-The Government accepts this amendment.
Proposed new clause agreed to.
Clause 15 (Order for delivery to Commission of passport of witness).
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (1O.54)-As I understand it we have under this provision, if it becomes law, a conflict of law with the Passports Act. 1am pleased to see the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock), who is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the chamber at the moment. Ministerial discretion was changed in May 1979. Prior to that date the Attorney-General had the discretion to freeze a passport when he had received recommendations to do so from respective corporate affairs commissions in the various States, an insurance commissioner, life insurance commissioner or indeed from the Attorneys General in the respective states. It is the opinion of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown)-honourable members on this side of the House agreed with him-that he should not exercise that discretion unless prosecution proceedings have taken place and a warrant has been issued.
I ask the Minister whether I am right in assuming that the provisions under this National Crimes Commission Bill are purely investigatory and that no prosecution proceedings are pending. I want the Minister to explain this to me. He will have a conflict in two statutes. He is to give powers to a commission which in my view is no different to a corporate affairs commission or a royal commission. Yet legislation requires proceedings to take place before a passport can be frozen. The investigations by the corporate affairs commission could be in the same area--corporate crime, white collar crime, corporate misfeasance or tax evasion. We will find that a royal commission will be able to freeze a passport without prosecution proceedings. Yet ,he Passports Act says that that cannot be done unless prosecution proceedings are pending and a warrant has been issued.

3020 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

I have always supported the view that in the case of people who get away with shareholders' funds or policy holders' funds and who are being subjected to investigation by corporate affairs commissions and not prosecution proceedings, in the interests of both the shareholders and the policy holders their passports ought to be frozen. I want the Minister to explain to me whether I am right in assuming that the passports will be frozen by order of the judge without prosecution proceedings. If that takes place I think the Minister will have to revise this legislation. If that is the case will he be consistent in law at any rate and revert to the old procedures under the Passports Act where the Minister has the discretion, on a request from the corporate affairs commission, life commissioners or insurance commissioners that the passports be frozen in the interests of people.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (10.55)-This clause, of course, speaks for itself. It is not contingent on prosecutions being launched or proceedings being taken.
Mr Jacobi-That is precisely the problem.
Mr N. A. BROWN-I am giving the answer to the question. It is not contingent on proceedings being taken, as I read it. With respect to whether there was any other provision in the Passports Act which is inconsistent with it, I certainly will have an examination made of the Passports Act in order to answer that question.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 16 (Hearings).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.56)-by leave-I move:
(5) Clause 16, page 9, line 23, before 'whether' insert 'such matters as the Commission considers appropriate, including'.
(6) Clause 16, page 10, sub-clause (II ), after paragraph (c) insert the following word and paragraph:
'; or (d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing:.
Dr Klugman-Mr Chairman, I take a point of order. It might just help things for me to mention that the honourable member for North Sydney intends to move an amendment to this clause. If the Government accepts his amendment our amendment would probably be covered.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Dr Jenkins)-It is not really a point of order.
Mr N. A. Brown-Mr Chairman, that, in fact, is the case.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-Mr Chairman, think I will yield.
Amendments-by leave-withdrawn.

Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (10.57)-1 move:
(2) Clause 16, page 9, lines 22-27, omit sub-clause (6), substitute the following sub-clauses:
'(6) In exercising its discretion under sub-section (5) in relation to a hearing or part of a hearing, the Commission shall have regard to-
(a) whether it is necessary or desirable for evidence that is to be given to the Commission at the hearing to be taken in private in order to eosure that a person who has been or may be charged with an offence will or would receive a fair trial for the offence or in order to avoid prejudice to the safety or reputation of a person;
(b) whether the evidence that is to be given to the Commission includes, or is likely to include, evidence that relates to the profits or financial position of any person and the taking of the evidence in public would be unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the person;
(c) the wishes of any person appearing as a witness at the hearing; and
(d) any other matter which in the opinion of the Commission is relevant.
(6A) An application by a person that his evidence or any part of his evidence, should be taken in private shall, if the person making the application so desires, be heard in private. '.
I will outline briefly what the amendment seeks to achieve. First of all this amendment is concerned with the decision the Commission has to make as to whether a hearing should be in private or in public. Under the original draft Bill paragraph (a) as it presently appears in the amendment was sub-clause (6) of clause 16. It reads:
(a) whether it is necessary or desirable for evidence that is to be given to the Commission at the hearing to be taken in private in order to ensure that a person who has been or may be charged with an offence will or would receive a fair trial for the offence or in order to avoid prejudice to the safety or reputation of a person;
That is straightforward enough. It seems to me that there are other matters that needed specific considerations to which the Commission should direct its attention in making the decision whether there should be a public hearing: Hence paragraph (b) which is based directly on section 60 (2) of the Royal Commissions Act with some rephrasing. Honourable members will see that that paragraph provides:
whether the evidence that is to be given to the Commission includes, or is likely to include, evidence that relates to the profits or financial position of any person and the taking of the evidence in public would be unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the person;
That is self-evident. Paragraph (c) directs the Commission to take into consideration the wishes of any person appearing as a witness at the hearing. The reason for that is this: It is sometimes supposed that witnesses do not want to be examined in private. That is frequently not the case. Many professional men, many businessmen, many ordinary citizens, will prefer to be examined

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3021

in private and will be far more forthcoming in private. 1 speak here from, as 1 said earlier, approximately three years spent in the conduct of special investigations, a large part of which was spent in examining witnesses. Therefore, if a witness says: 'It is my desire that 1 be examined in private', that is a very relevant consideration for the Commission to take into account. Paragraph (d) of sub-clause (6) simply directs the Commission to consider any other matter that may be relevant and makes it plain that the Commission must consider any other relevant matter.
Sub-clause (6) (a) simply provides that, where a person wishes that his evidence or part of his evidence be taken in private and wants to make an application for that purpose, the application should be in private for the perfectly obvious reason that if one believes, for example, that one may be unfairly prejudiced by a public hearing and one has to state in public the reasons why one is going to be unfairly prejudiced, to a very large extent, there will be prejudice. Hence, if it is the wish of the person making the application that the application be made in private, that wish should be acceded to.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (11.2)-1 ask the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) to look at clause 16 (12). 1 ask the Minister whether he will consider the penalty for publication of articles. 1 think that is what that sub-clause refers to. 1 do not quibble over the penalty of $2,000 if, in fact, it means that it applies, for instance, to a journalist. 1 do not think that is an unreasonable fine. It is a rather heavy fine for a freelance journalist. The question 1 raise is why there is not a heavier penalty, for instance, for a publisher. 1 think we ought to consider that.
Mr Scholes-You pay ten times that much for a story line.
Mr JACOBI-Exactly. Quite apart from the journalist the damage is really done by the publisher. The publisher, 1 think, ought to be considered. That penalty is not an unreasonable penalty for a freelance journalist. But 1think that fine should be much heavier for the publisher if we are to protect the witness to the level we ought to protect him.
Mr N. A. Brown-We will examine that.
Mr JACOBI-I would be grateful if the Government would.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley) (Acting Attorney-General) (11.3)-The Government accepts this amendment.
Amendment agreed to.

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (11.4)-1 move:
(6) Clause 16, page 10, sub-clause (II), after paragraph (c) insert the following word and paragraph:
'; or (d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,'.
We think the amendment is just tidying up the situation. There can be circumstances where a person may be about to give evidence. There ought to be some direction that that evidence should not be published. This is in addition to the directions that may be given under clause 16 (6) (c) which relates to persons who have already given evidence. 1 think the amendment is self-explanatory.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (11.5) - The Government accepts the amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (11.5)-1 move:
Clause 16, page 10, line 21, at the end of sub-clause (II), add, 'or shall not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies'.
This amendment gives the Commission a wider range of options as to the orders it can make as to non-publication, as is apparent. This amendment is in line with the Royal Commissions Amendment Act.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Proposed new clause 16A.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (11.6)-1 move:
Page 10, after clause 16 insert the following new clause:
Actions for defamation
'16A. For the purposes of any action under the law of defamation which may be taken in respect of the publication of evidence given before the Commission it shall not be a defence to that action that the publication was privileged in so far as it constituted a fair and accurate report of that evidence.'.
This proposed new clause deals with actions for defamation. We make the point that merely because statements or allegations are made it does not mean that they have been proved. Therefore it is quite dangerous to have a report of statements and allegations and then to rely on the fact that it is a fair report. It certainly can prejudice a person and it certainly can affect a reputation. We feel that there has to be protection. People appearing before the Commission ought to be given protection against the publication of any evidence which could well be hearsay evidence which would not

3022 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

even be admissible in any ordinary court proceedings. For that reason we want to see this prohibition that action can be taken and there shall not be any defence to that action should there be a breach of the tenet of what is involved here. The basis of clause 16 is that people will be protected. Of course, a defence of fair and accurate reporting should not be allowed where one is talking about fair and accurate reporting of evidence that really is not evidence at all and could be destructive and damaging to a person's reputation.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (11.8) - The Government is not able to accept this amendment. The general principle which would apply in circumstances such as this Commission is that fair reports of the public hearing conducted under the authority of a statute, which would be this case, would attract qualified privilege. If that were not the case there would be little significance in the public nature of the hearing, having regard to the very few people who could normally be expected to attend. The Press could be expected to attend, of course, as one would expect it to. I think many people, even if not associated with the Press, would want to defend that principle. That is to say, there should be a qualified privilege covering the reporting of the proceedings. In those circumstances it would be appropriate that privilege should remain.
Proposed new clause negatived.
Proposed new clause 16A
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (11.9)-1 move:
Page 10. after clause 16, insert the following new clause:
Reimbursement of expenses of witnesses
'16A (I) A witness appearing before the Commission shall be paid by the Commonwealth in respect of the expenses of his attendance an amount ascertained in accordance with the prescribed scale or, if there is no prescribed scale, such amount as the Commission determines.
(2) Where at a hearing before the Commission a person giving evidence has been represented by a legal practioner or where any other person has, with the consent of the Commission, been represented by a legal practitioner, and in the opinion of the Commission it is just in all the circumstances to do so, the Commission may authorize the payment of such sum to meet the costs of legal representation as the Commission deems reasonable.'.
I move that amendment in two parts because the Government agrees to the first part but does not agreelo the second part. 1 will therefore deal with the proposed new clause 16A (I) as it appears. That clause is put in for the very simple purpose of allowing expenses of attendance-that is, witnesses' expenses-to be paid to those who come before the Commission. A section to a similar effect is to be found in the Royal Commissions

Act and it is no more than common justice that a person who is required to attend should have his expenses defrayed, as takes place in the courts. I understand that the Government accepts that amendment and I desire to say nothing further about it.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Dr Jenkins)-I point out to the Committee that the amendment we are dealing with is the proposed new clause 16A(I).
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (11.11)-1 come back to the question I raised before, about the provision in the Royal Commissions Act. I still have not got an answer to it and 1 am concerned about it. Section 6N of that Act guarantees witnesses before royal commissions continuity of employment. I would like some assurance that that provision will in fact apply to people who are obliged to or willingly come along before a royal commission to give evidence.
Mr HydeDuring the period.
Mr JACOBI-Yes. Let me read the section of the Act. It is important not just for that period. Section 6N states:
Any employer who dismisses any employee from his employment, or prejudices any employee in his employment, for or on account of the employee having appeared as a witness before a Royal Commission, or for or on account of the employee having given evidence before a Royal Commission, shall be guilty of an indictable offence.
1 think it is a matter that ought to be looked at. Witnesses are entitled to that protection. 1 support fully the first part of what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said. I agree with that. We ought to take it a step further. Why should we treat people who appear before royal commissions differently from those who appear before the National Crimes Commission? 1think it is quite odd.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Dr Jenkins)- May I clarify a point. 1 understood that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), because of certain indications that had been given to him that proposed new clause 16A (I) would be accepted and that proposed new clause 16A (2) would not be accepted, was just moving an amendment about proposed new clause 16A (I).
Mr Spender-I will then move proposed new clause 16A (2).
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-Procedurally it would be better if the honourable member moved the amendment as circulated and then the Minister moved for the deletion of the proposed new clause 16A (2). That is just procedural advice. Otherwise it presents some difficulties not only to

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3023

the member but also to the Chair. The Chair accepts that the honourable member has moved the amendment in to to and that the Minister will take appropriate action.
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (11.13)-The purpose of proposed new clause l6A (2) is to empower the National Crimes Commission to make an order or a direction for costs. It states:
Where at a hearing before the Commission a person giving evidence has been represented by a legal practitioner or where any other person has, with the consent of the Commission, been represented by a legal practitioner, and in the opinion of the Commission it is just in all the circumstances to do so--
I emphasise the words 'just in all the circumstances to do so'.
the Commission may authorize the payment of such sum to meet the costs of legal representation as the Commission deems reasonable.
Why, it may be said, should anyone need legal representation if he has nothing to hide? The fact of the matter is that anyone-any person of any substance, any person who is concerned about his reputation and who is called before a Commission which is charged with the investigation of criminal activity-would want to be legally represented.
Mr Jacobi-Particularly for sophisticated crime.
Mr SPENDER-Particularly, as the honourable member says, if the Commission is concerned, as it will be, with sophisticated crime. One may need to take advice. One may not have the slightest idea of what allegation one may have to meet. It may be that most serious and baseless allegations have been made, allegations which reflect very adversely upon a witness. In such circumstances, when a person is called upon to assist the Commission, surely he is entitled to legal represenation. After all, he is helping the Commission. When in 1975, with two members of the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales, I was conducting an investigation into Mumba Oil NL and other companies I formed a very clear view about the need for legal representation where what has been examined represents a difficult and complex set of circumstances and a witness may not know what he is to be questioned about, may not know what has been said about him. In our final report, which was given to the Attorney-General on 3 November 1975, we said:
While provision is made in the case of examination of officers for the attendance and participation of their legal representatives, there is no provision for the payment of costs of legal representation. We think that the absence of any power of the inspectors to award costs can occasion an injustice and we provide the following illustration. Where investigations are being made into a company, it is a common occurrence for outside accountants or auditors, who have performed services on the company's behalf, to be summoned for examination.

The examinations can be lengthy and complex. When summoned, the individuals are unaware of what allegations may have been made against them by other persons concerned in the investigations and are often unaware of the ambit of the matters which the inspector intends to investigate into.
All of that would apply precisely to a crimes commission. Our report continued:
A professional man placed in this position may wish to have a legal representative to assist him and to protect his interests. This is, we think, a prudent and wise course for a professional man to adopt. The person concerned may have a considerable reputation and be an acknowledged expert in this field. He may have nothing with which he should reproach himself. But still it is, we think, perfectly understandable that he should want to have a legal representative present at his examination. The examination may last a number of days and the cost of such representation may be considerable. The witness may do everything in his power to co-operate and may provide considerable assistance. But in the result he is very much out of pocket. Such a result is, we think, quite unjust.
That was my view in 1975 and it has only been reinforced by my experience since. It is for that reason that I propose that when witnesses or other persons are allowed legal representation, where it is just in all the circumstances so to do, the Commission should be in a position to authorise the payment of sums to meet the cost of such legal representation. In a few words, I ask whether it is right that those who assist as witnesses, who reasonably engage legal representation, should at the end of the day or at the end of many days, having done everything in their power to assist the Commission, having perhaps shown through their legal representatives that demonstrable falsehoods have been told the Commission concerning their activities or the activities of others, have to reach into their pockets and say: 'I have done my duty as a citizen and have assisted. It is going to cost me $15,000 or $20,000 and I am very glad to pay it'.
We all know who will be able to meet the cost of legal representation. It will be those who are themselves deeply involved in corporate and organised crime. They will have no difficulty in finding the money. The people upon whom there will be an unfair burden will be the citizens who have reputations to protect, who have come along to assist. Therefore, the Commission should have a discretion to grant costs.
Mr ROCHER (Curtin) (11.20)-1 support in full the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender)-that is parts (I) and (2). I will not dwell on either part for very long; I certainly will not dwell at all on clause 16A (I) because of intimations to which you, Mr Chairman, have already referred and which have been given by the Government to the honourable member and others. It is possible to envisage, as the honourable member for North Sydney has said, that someone who appears as a

3024 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

witness in front of a royal commission may very well find, because of the nature of the hearing or the subject matter, that things are going against him. It may not be in the terms of that hearing but it may be that unbeknown to that witness he has transgressed under a State or Commonwealth statute. It is essential, as the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) acknowledges, that in a case where sophisticated crime is involved legal representation is available. To be sure of that in all cases clause 16A (2) is required.
The mover of the amendment has pointed out that it is up to the National Crimes Commission to decide that legal representation is just in all the circumstances before such costs or a sum, not necessarily the full costs of total representation, be made available to the witness. Certainly if clause 18 which follows later stands as printed in the eventual legislation it is more important that reimbursement of fees for the legal representatives of witnesses be available. Clause 18 requires the production of documents or things. It is a cause of concern which will be discussed under that clause. It may incriminate a witness or lay him open to charges arising out of the Commission's proceedings. Given what the honourable member for North Sydney has said, given what is provided for in clause 8, and if it remains as written, I fully support it. I believe it is fully justified that clause 16A (2) be included.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (11.23)-The Government accepts the first part of the amendment, that is, sub-clause (I) but not sub-clause (2). Accordingly, I move:
That the proposed new clause 16A be amended by omitting sub-clause (2).
There is a lot of obvious good sense in what has been said with respect to the desirability of witnesses having representation before the National Crimes Commission. However, that is a long way from saying that public moneys should be expended on the legal representation of witnesses when the tribunal before which witnesses are appearing does not determine final rights. It does not make orders affecting rights as does a court, in which case, of course, the legal aid scheme would apply. In those circumstances, in the view of the Government, the amendment should not be made.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (11.24)-1 am not satisfied with the explanation of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown). I am not saying that everybody who appears before the Commission should automatically have his legal expenses paid. But the amendment moved by the

honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) does not say that. It says that should happen if it is the Commission's view that the cost of representation should be paid. I believe people could be destroyed by the Commission conducting a long hearing into their affairs. People could be destroyed financially by a Commission inquiry going on and on. It is quite obvious that those people need legal representation. There is no provision for that whatsoever. I am not sure whether an ex gratia payment can be made by the Government. I suppose it can be. Perhaps advice could be given to the Governor-General, but it could well be too late by then. A malicious type of investigation in which somebody has made allegations about someone for which there is very little or no evidence can financially destroy that person quite effectively. I think it would be a great pity if the Commission was not able to make some sort of an order as to costs, at least in extreme cases.
Mr HYDE (Moore) (11.26)-1 remind the Committee that the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown), who is sitting at the table, said that there was a lot of good sense in witnesses before the National Crimes Commission being represented. He also pointed out that no legal aid was available. Is the Government really prepared to tolerate a circumstance that will provide justice for the rich but not for the poor?
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (11.27)-The Opposition supports what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said. I put it to the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) that the National Crimes Commission can make a number of investigations. In the course of those investigations all sorts of hearsay evidence and accusations, as the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) said, can be made. A person needs to have some protection. A person may needto have some effective representation not so much to protect himself or herself against the Commission, but for protection against a defaming person. In this sort of inquisitorial situation, personal prejudices and accusations could be made that are really unbalanced. Surely the safeguard for the Government would be that costs in this type of investigation would be paid only if the Commission felt that it was just and reasonable to do so. It is not as if a person would be put in an adversary situation when charged by the Crown.
A person might think that he is not involved in an investigation of the Commission until he learns that somebody has named him about something or other. That person then has to fight for his rights.

National Crimes Commission Bill

10 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3025

In those terms anybody could become involved. That is one of the dangers of the whole structure of the Commisson. It is unfair to such a person if the Commission is not given the power to reimburse the costs incurred. Without that provision there is no opportunity for the person to be reimbursed. A person could be rendered bankrupt if he tried to protect himself against any number of people who could give evidence before the Commission, who could make all sorts of outrageous accusations and who would be protected in so doing. A person would be placed in a position of trying to redeem his own character and needing some legal expertise so to do. I think that is the important part of what we all think adds a bit of strength to the National Crimes Commission Bill, which certainly has a lot of weaknesses.
Mr SHACK (Tangney) (\ 1.28)-Earlier tonight in this debate the Government accepted an amendment which ensured that the concern for the reputation of a person would rank alongside the concern for the physical safety of that person and the rights and liberty of that person. The arguments put forward tonight by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spencer) in support of this amendment have as much to do with reputation and the preservation of reputation as they do with the rights and liberty of an individual vis-a-vis the power of the state. When one considers that an individual may be involved in a long, drawn out and complicated series of hearings before the National Crimes Commission, the rights and liberties and the preservation of the reputation of the individual may well depend on legal representation. Access to that legal representation may well depend on public reimbursement of costs. For those reasons I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney.
Mr RUDDOCK (Dundas) (11.29)-1 am somewhat troubled about the matter that has been put before the Committee because, in a sense, I think it has lost some perspective. All sorts of proceedings are brought before the courts where people's liberty can be involved-not just their reputation-and in which there is no certainty that legal costs will be met.
Mr Scholes-They have to be charged though.
Mr RUDDOCK-Here we are in a situation where there is no charge, where there is an inquiry and where the National Crimes Commission is being asked to consider what is just in the circumstances. I can envisage circumstances where it could well be just. But I wonder why, in circumstances where people in our system are otherwise

deprived of legal aid because of their circumstances, because somebody is being dealt with before the National Crimes Commission the Commission would have the authority to make such an order.
Recently some comments have been made about Mrs Mackay and the inquest that is to be held in New South Wales in relation to the death of her husband. She wanted to be represented at those proceedings and the New South Wales Legal Services Commission refused to provide such representation. The Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) has indicated that she could apply to the Australian Legal Aid Office for financial support but she would be income tested against all of the tests that are required to be administered before anybody will receive aid from
that system. In terms of justice one would think that it is appropriate that Mrs Mackay be legally aided but it has been felt appropriate that her financial circumstances ought to be looked at before aid is made available. It seems to me that in circumstances such as this there might well be a situation in which reasonable people looking at a person's circumstances would want to see financial assistance granted to ensure that people are legally represented. But I do not think assistance ought to be more generous in circumstances in which the National Crimes Commission is involved than it is in relation to other forms of inquiry or proceedings before courts.
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (11.32)-1 would like to answer briefly what has been put by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). Firstly, when one is called before a commission one is not a party; when one appears in court one ordinarily is a party. In most cases there is power in the court to award costs. In any event there is a legal aid system. If it is not as generous as it should be and if the honourable member for Dundas wants to have it examined and brought before this House, I would certainly look at it because I think representation before courts and tribunals is a basic right. I sum up by saying this: The fact that there are injustices in other systems does not mean to say that we should start this Commission with injustice embedded in it.
Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (11.33)-There seems to be a paradox in a situation in which a person can be compelled to go before a commission when that person has no charges against him and is not considered to be guilty of an offence, and can be cross-examined, and required under the law which is being enacted tonight to answer questions, and can have allegations mad~ against him which do not require any substantive proof-nor do they have to meet any of the normal rules

3026 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

which would apply in a court-and that person can have justice done to him only if he is in a position to meet legal costs. I want to make just one point that the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) seems to have overlooked. The reason this National Crimes Commission is being set up is so that matters that could not be tried or heard before a court can be aired, either in private or in public, so that investigations can be carried out into whether charges can be laid and to determine whether criminal offences which are prosecutable have been committed.
I think this Committee should remember that there is a long history of that type of inquiry ending in a lot of muck-raking and a lot of damage to
many innocent people. It is estimated that some 50,000 persons in the United States of America were improperly convicted of crimes which never existed and which they never committed. They were denied their rights as citizens of that country and their future employment because of the McCarthy hearings. The only crime committed by many of those whose careers ultimately were totally destroyed was the crime of telling the truth before an inquiry about their views on certain political issues which were contrary to the views of the chairman and the people who supported that inquiry.
The National Crimes Commission is no different. The Government will not give guaranteesnor can it-that future governments will not place before it matters which could involve a person's liberties and reputation. It is possible that in situations which involve certain political considerations, certain political heat, we could have another Petrov type of investigation. We could have another Builders Labourers Federation inquiry or some other inquiry into corporate, commercial or other representative bodies where, in the heat of a particular set of circumstances, people's reputations and actions could be prejudiced because of certain hysterias in the community. Had Australia or the United Kingdom held an inquiry into the rights of conscientious objectors during the First World War, for instance, no person putting a point of view which was pacifist in nature would have got a fair hearing from any source.
The Government is saying that unless the person concerned is of sufficient means to be legally represented before a body which can only destroy his reputation-it cannot convict him of a crime nor, prior to his being called before that body, can he be said to be guilty of a crime-he should be fined the cost of his legal representation for the privilege of giving evidence before the Commission. If the Government feels that this method

of investigation is necessary, it is quite improper that the persons who will be asked to go before the Commission and give evidence, who have no charges against them and who have 'probably committed no offence, will be liable for the cost of serving their community far in excess of the extent which it is reasonable to expect.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (l1.37)-Before I reply to what has been said, before I forget I want to answer the question of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi).
Mr Jacobi-I would have reminded you.
Mr N. A. BROWN-I am sure the honourable member would have reminded me, in any event. The answer to his question is contained in section 36A of the Crimes Act, which sets out certain cases. For example, it provides that a person who threatens, intimidates or restrains and uses violence and such like a person who has appeared or is about to appear as a witness in a judicial proceeding shall be guilty of an indictable offence. The penalty is imprisonment for five years. That would seem to cover the situation raised by the honourable member.
I have said that the Government is not able to accept the amendment because the proposition that public funds should be expended on paying for the representation of witnesses before a body which does not make determination as to final rights of parties is one which breaks entirely new ground. However, I would like to investigate the circumstances under which ex gratia payments would be made to persons in these circumstances and I would like also to investigate further the precise provisions of the legal aid scheme to see which, if any, of the persons who are likely to come before the Commission would be eligible under the legal aid scheme which already exists. It may be that some are eligible, although normally the scheme does not apply to witnesses. In those circumstances, it may be necessary when the National Crimes Commission Bill goes before the Senate to make some amendment to provide what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) seeks to provide in the second part of his amendment. At the moment the Government would not be able to accept the amendment, but I can certainly give the Committee an undertaking that, if it transpired that assistance could not be given by means of an ex gratia payment or by means of the legal aid scheme, the Government would certainly look sympathetically at a provision of this sort. That would then be taken up in the Senate.

Clause 17 (Power to summon witnesses and take evidence).
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (11.48)-1 move:
(7) Clause 17, page 10, lines 33 to 41, omit sub-clauses (2) and (3), substitute the following sub-clauses:
'(2) The member or acting member presiding at a hearing before the Commission may require a person appearing at the hearing to produce a document or other thing.
'(3) The Commission may. at a hearing, take evidence on oath or affirmation and for that purpose--
(a) a member or acting member may require a person appearing at the hearing to give evidence either to take an oath or to make an affirmation in a form approved by the member or acting member presiding at the hearing; and
(b) a member or acting member. Or a person who is an authorized person in relation to the Commission, may administer an oath or affirmation to a person so appearing at the hearing.

'(4) Subject to sub-sections (5) and (7), it is a reasonable excuse for the purposes of sub-section (2) for a
person~
(a) to refuse or fail to answer a question put to him at a hearing before the Commission; or
(b) to refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before the Commission,
that the answer to the question, or the production of the document or thing, as the case may be, might tend to incriminate him.
(5) It is not a reasonable excuse for the purposes of subsection (2) for a person~
(a) to refuse or fail to answer a question put to him at a hearing before the Commission; or
(b) to refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before the Commission,
that the answer to the question or the production of the document or thing might tend to prove his guilt of an

3028 REPRESENTATIVES 10 November 1982

National Crimes Commission Bill

offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory if the Attorney-General has given to the person an undertaking in writing that any answer given or document or thing produced, as the case may be, will not be used in evidence in any proceedings against him for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory and if the Attorney-General states in the undertaking~-
(c) that, in his opinion, there are special grounds which in the public interest require that answers be given or documents or things be produced by that person; and
(d) the general nature of those grounds.
(6) The Commission may recommend to the Attorney General that a person who has been or is to be served with a summons to appear as a witness at a hearing before the Commission or to produce a document or thing at a hearing before the Commission be given an undertaking by the Attorney-General in accordance with sub-section (5).
(7) It is not a reasonable excuse for the purposes of subsection (2) for a person--
(a) to refuse of fail to answer a question put to him at a hearing before the Commission; or
(b) to refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he was required to produce at a hearing before the Commission,
that the answer to the question or the production of the document or thing might tend to prove his guilt of an offence against the law of a State if the Attorney-General of that State has given to the person an undertaking in writing that any answer given or document or thing produced, as the case may be, will not be used in evidence in any proceedings against him for an offence against a law of that State and if the Attorney-General of that State states in the undertakinng-
(c) that, in his opinion, there are special ground which in the public interest require that answers be given or documents of things be produced by that person; and
(d) the general nature of those grounds.
(8) The Commission may recommend to the Attorney General of a State that a person who has been or is to be served with a summons to appear as a witness at a hearing before the Commission or to produce a document or thing at a hearing before the commission be given an undertaking by the Attorney-General of that State in accordance with subsection (7).
I move this amendment not with any great desire to depart from the Government. I support the thrust of the Government's legislation but I find clause 18 particularly troubling. In essence subclauses (4) to (8) of clause 18 provide that a person who is called before a Commission and is given an undertaking by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth that his answers will not be used in evidence against him for a breach of Commonwealth or Territory law must answer. Furthermore, there is no protection at all accorded to that person when he is required to produce documents. This system is open to very wide abuse and it makes a fundamental break with the basic right of citizens of this country not to be compelled to give testimony against themselves.
Let me tell the Committee how such a system can operate. I was conducting on one occasion a

special investigation into Gollin Holdings. I heard of a person who was leaving the country and who might be able to give me information. I sent a summons to him. I had him up in my chambers two hours later. I put a tape recorder on the desk in front of me. I gave him the Bible and told him to take the oath since I was empowered for that purpose. I then advised him that he was bound to answer any question that I put to him although, if he claimed privilege, the answer could not be used against him for any proceedings save for proceedings that could arise if he tried to mislead me. That is the sort of thing I am talking about. What would happen if we took away the right to object to the production of documents? This would mean that the Attorney-General's undertaking never extends to documents. Therefore, if a person is summoned to produce certain documents and those documents are incriminating, the documents, if produced, can be used against that person.
No court can force a person to go into the witness box to give evidence against himself. No policeman in this land can force a person to answer a question that may incriminate him. But what is being proposed is that the Attorney General by an undertaking which extends only to oral evidence will place a person in a position where he has to answer and where he has no protection at all if he is summoned to produce documents. I would have thought that, if we were talking about basic rights, we would speak about the right to vote, the right to freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial and the right not to be forced to incriminate oneself. Recently a case was heard in the High Court of Australia which involved a Mr Hammond who had been questioned by a royal commission. That case was different because he had been charged. Let me remind the Committee that, if a person has any skill as an investigator, he simply defers having the charges brought until all the evidence is obtained.
Let me quote some passages from the judgment of the High Court because to my mind they illustrate~although, mark you, in the context of a case in which a man had been charged-the whole current judicial thinking about the right not to be compelled to incriminate oneself. Let me tell the Committee what the Chief Justice had to say. He most relevantly said:
It was said that the privilege is only against testimonial disclosure -disclosure that may be used in evidence-~- and that since, under both the Commonwealth and State Acts, the answers are not admissible in evidence there is no infringement of the privilege . . . Again, I am not satisfied that this is correct; I would incline to the view that the privilege is against the discloser of one's own criminality.

National Crimes Commission Bill

lO November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3029

Why should that be? It is because hundreds of years ago we departed from an inquisitorial system, and that was the inquisitorial system that had existed up until the time of the Stuarts. Later, the Chief Justice said:
It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence.
Mr Justice Mason agreed with him. Let me read only one other passage, because time is short and my voice appears to be wearing out. Mr Justice Brennan said this:
An accused person may not be deprived of this immunity from interrogation by the exercise of the prerogative power to appoint a Commission of Inquiry and Report. Whether the Parliament could deprive him of that immunity when he stands charged with an offence against a law of the Commonwealth is a question which need not now be determined, for it is not to be thought that Parliament, in arming a Commissioner with the powers to be found in the respective Acts, intended that the power might be exercised to deny a freedom so treasured by tradition and so central to the judicial administration of criminal justice.
What I propose is that the Attorney-General, in giving an undertaking, should give an undertaking that extends to documents, and the undertaking should state that there were special grounds for compulsion where a person claimed that the answers to questions or the production of documents might incriminate him, and that the Attorney-General should set out the general nature of those grounds. We are moving into entirely new territory. I have pointed out that this Commission will be able to do what the police cannot do. There is a very strong argument for the Commission, but there is a very strong argument for hastening slowly when we come to such a breach of fundamental rights. I see no reason why the Attorney-General should not have to act only when there are special grounds, and I can see no reason why the protection to be afforded should not extend to documents. We all know who will be the people that produce documents-the honest, the foolish and the incompetent. Does anyone here think that any master criminal will produce documents when summoned to do so? Of course he will not produce them. The people who will be caught will be the small people, those who are guilty of technical offences of one kind or another-certainly not the important people.
We are, as it were, taking a great leap in the dark. We do not know where it will end, but a leap in the dark it most certainly is. Let us hasten, as I say, slowly, and instead of moving so quickly let us see how it runs, and at the end of the year the Commissioner can come to us and say 'It is not working and these are the reasons'. Then we can

re-examine it. But for the time being, let us ensure that those who are called before the Commission have adequate protection, protection which accords with the way in which the criminal law of this country has been administered since we became a country.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (11.59)-The Opposition is interested in helping to improve the Bill. One of the matters of relevance is the very matter mentioned by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender)-the rights of the individual as against the rights of the state. We have said in earlier discussions this evening how unfortunate people, when up against the Government of the state, have a lot of difficulty in establishing their rights. But the High Court of Australia, fortunately, in recent cases, has made a couple of interesting decisions. We have the Winneke decision arising from the Builders Labourers Federation case and we have the Hammond case. In trying to get some reasonableness into law perhaps we have been helped a little by these decisions. For example, in the Hammond case it was stated that the most important factor to emerge from the judgment was the insistence that royal commissions should not trample on the normal rights of citizens against self-incrimination. Mr Justice Deane, in talking about the administration of justice, said:
It is fundamental to the administration of criminal justice that the person who is the subject of pending criminal proceedings in a court should not be subject to a parallel inquisitorial inquiry.
Maybe it will be said that at this stage the person is not subject to criminal proceedings. But, as has been adverted to, it could well be that as a result of such an inquiry there will be criminal proceedings. It matters little in the sense of justice to think that the parallel inquisitorial inquiry will take place and put people in a much worse position than they would be in if they were to be dealt with in a criminal court, as most of these people would have to be. We should bear in mind that this is a commission which is to assemble evidence with a view to the prosecution of offenders.
It seems unfair and unreasonable, certainly contrary to the spirit of what Mr Justice Deane was saying, to say that this really does not fall within the ambit of the Hammond case because in the Hammond case there were criminal proceedings pending-and therefore the High Court was dealing with the matter on a different basis. The evidence can be admitted in this case and then used or referred to in criminal proceedings which follow. He makes the point than an extracurial inquisitorial investigation of the involvement of a person who has been committed for trial which

3030 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and II November 1982 National Crimes Commission Bill

forms the basis of criminal procedures against him constitutes, in his view, an improper interference with the due administration of justice or proceedings against that person in the criminal court.
I think we can say the same thing would apply if we were to have that sort of obligation put on a person appearing before a commission whose sole purpose is to marshall evidence for prosecution. I cannot see how we can say that we are not really going against the interference with the due administration of justice. Mr Justice Murphy, whom we all know, has said: that the privilege against self-incrimination virtually is part of our legal heritage. He has made the point that in the United States there is a Bill of Rights and that Australia does not have a Bill of Rights but it has the equivalent in his view; that is, that privilege is presumed to exist unless excluded by express words. I think it follows that it is in the interests of justice to get evidence without making the point one can get it under this sort of Act of Parliament which says that one is obliged to produce it, perhaps to incriminate oneself. Ostensibly it will not be used against that person but once the evidence is known to exist, particularly from the point of view of documents, it certainly will be marshalled against that person. I think there is a fair amount of weight in what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) is trying to do here. We support him.
Thursday, II November 1982
Mr SHACK (Tangey) (12.4 a.m.)-We have a legal system which has developed over hundreds of years and which provides a citizen before the law with the fundamental right not to answer incriminating questions or produce incriminating documents. Forcing people to answer questions or provide material in the legislative way proposed is to my mind the modern equivalent of the rack or the thumbscrew. I ask: Have we come so far in hundreds of years to go back so quickly? As I sit here, I am struck with the enormity of what we do in this place. Perhaps I am naive in the law making business. We sit here making laws which affect the fundamental liberty of the subjects and as we take, as the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said, a leap into the dark in this respect I would err on the side of the individual visa-vis the State. If I am wrong, we can come back and look at it again.
Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (12.5 a.m.)-I would like to appeal to the Government at this stage. We are dealing with a very dangerous type of legislation. I think even the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) would agree that the debate has been carried out on a reasonable basis.

When votes are taken on this legislation we will have the influx of a significant number of Government supporters especially the boys from the National Party, who have been to end-of-term parties. They are significantly affected by those end-of-term parties not to be able to intelligently--
Mr Ian Robinson-I raise a point of order.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member for Cowper will resume his seat. The honourable member for Prospect will withdraw the reflection he made on honourable members of the Committee.
Dr KLUGMAN-I certainly will not, Mr Millar. It is quite obvious from their behaviour that they have been to an end-of-term party and are unable to understand the significance of what is going on in the Committee.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member should withdraw in view of his own dignity and the dignity of the Committee. He has made a very serious reflection. Admittedly it is of a collective nature but it rests clearly on every honourable member of this Committee. I ask the honourable member for Prospect to withdraw the reflection. If he wishes to persist he must do so by substantive motion. I ask the honourable member to withdraw.
Dr KLUGMAN-I will not withdraw, Mr Millar. It does not rest on every member of this Committee. It rests on a significant number of members of this Committee. You know as well as I do that a Government supporters' end-of-term party has been going on since 9.30 tonight. It is now 12 o'clock and the amount of liquid that has been consumed is so significant that I am sure they are not able to follow fairly intricate legislation.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The Committee will come to order. If the honourable member persists he will put the Chair in a very difficult position.
Dr KLUGMAN-All I am asking is that the Government postpone consideration of this legislation.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member has put the Chair in a difficult position.
Dr KLUGMAN-Good.
The CHAIRMAN-It relieves the tedium, can assure the honourable member. In the process, although no doubt it was not his intention, he has defied the Chair. No good can come of his comments. Whilst the reflection was collective in nature, he has not identified those that he has in mind. By virtue of that, he has left every member

National Crimes Commission Bill 10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3031

of this chamber under some cloud as to their connection with the conditions he described. The Chair, in the interests of this institution, cannot overlook the honourable member's action in defying the requirement of the Chair to withdraw. Whilst I have been speaking the honourable member for Prospect has had time to reflect on the position. I suggest that the problem can best be resolved by his, even at this stage, accepting the Chair's direction to withdraw the reflection.
Dr KLUGMAN-Mr Chairman, normally I would withdraw but on this issue the voting will not be taken along party lines. It is quite clear to me that there are some people in this chamber or people who are not in this chamber now but who will enter if there is a division who are not capable of deciding on which side they should be voting.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member is offering an opinion to the House. I would not-
Dr KLUGMAN-If the Government had any sense it would postpone the discussion of this-
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The Chair would not presume to challenge the competence of the honourable member for Prospect to make such an assessment of the condition of honourable members. The simple fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Prospect leaves the Chair in the position where it has no alternative but to take action against him for defying the Chair. The Chair, as I hope every honourable member in this place will appreciate, is reluctant to do that but it is left with no option. The matter is now entirely in the hands of the honourable member for Prospect. I invite him for the last occasion to withdraw. No further debate will ensue. If he fails to do so the Chair has no option but to name the honourable gentleman.
Sir James Killen-Mr Chairman, I ask myoid friend, with whom I have had significant differences of opinion, in deference to the Committee and to facilitate the business, whether he would undertake a favourable response to your request.
Dr KLUGMAN-I hope that the Government, if I do that, will also take a reasonable attitude and postpone consideration of anything significant tonight which deals with the liberty of the citizen. It is silly for me to withdraw because I believe there are significant numbers of members in this House who are not able to deal with this sort of issue.
The CHAIRMAN. Order! It may be argued that none of us is as competent at this hour of the night as we would have been 10 hours ago, but the

fact remains we have a problem to deal with. We cannot delay this matter. Does the honourable member withdraw without qualification?
Dr KLUGMAN-Only if I have an indication from the Government that the-
The CHAIRMAN-No, I must ask the honourable member to withdraw without qualification.
Dr KLUGMAN-No.
The CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Prospect is named.
Mr Jacobi-Mr Chairman, may we perhaps reflect on the position-
The CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member for Hawker is not free in these circumstances to address the Chair. The report must be made to Mr Speaker. The Committee is awaiting the arrival of Mr Speaker, and no debate can ensue during this period.
Consideration interrupted.

The CHAIRMAN-Mr Speaker, I have to report that the Chair has named the honourable member for Prospect on the grounds of serious allegations in the collective sense against members of the Committee.

In Committee
Consideration resumed.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (12.20 a.m.)-I think what has taken place is very unfortunate. But let me say to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) in all seriousness that of all the provisions contained in this piece of legislation, this is the one provision that seriously affects the individual. I do not want to repeat what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) or the Deputy Leader Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said. I have made the same notes on the same judgment.
I refer to Hammond's judgment in Volume 56 of the Australian Law Journal. That judgment was made in 1982. I suggest to the Acting Attorney-General quite seriously that the three judges involved in that case raised constitutional doubts as to whether the Parliament can take away the right of self-incrimination. I would like

to know whether the people who drafted this piece of legislation looked at that judgment and at the Winneke judgment. If they had they certainly would not have put this provision in this legislation. I understand the concern of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). Before the Minister proceeds with this legislation I plead with him to get somebody to look at that matter very seriously. I ask him to do so for another reason. The Minister and his advisers ought to apply their minds to the Royal Commissions Act which has more or less the same provision.
I do not think there is any doubt at all that if this legislation is passed and becomes a statute there will be an appeal to the High Court of
Australia when the Government attempts to enforce the legislation. I make a special plea: If the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) is not agreed to at least the Government ought to defer the legislation until it has thoroughly considered the full implications of the legislation and people's individual rights are protected. I think what has occurred is appalling. People on both sides of the House who have stud-
ied this matter have grave doubts about the implications of the legislation.
Mr RUDDOCK (Dundas) (12.22 a.m.)-I spoke earlier on this matter during my speech in the second reading debate. The first point that ought to be made in relation to the comments of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who made some observations about the role of the Government's advisers is that if he had looked very carefully at the amendments proposed in the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill which is being debated cognately with the National Crimes Commission Bill he would be aware that some specific amendments are proposed arising directly from Hammond's case. For him to suggest that the Government's advisers have not directed their attention to the matters raised in that case and are unaware of it, which is the nature of the observation the honourable member made, having regard to the background that I have given, is an unreasonable assumption.
I want to make a number of short points in relation to the National Crimes Commission Bill. Firstly, if people are required to produce documents that is a different matter to people being questioned about those documents. There is no requirement in the Bill that will ensure that people who produce documents, if they are likely to incriminate themselves and offer evidence in relation to those matters which will incriminate themselves, cannot receive the sort of undertaking that is provided for in this legislation. As I understand it, that is the nature of the clause. If people

National Crimes Commission Bill 10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATlVES 3033

are to be asked questions about documents the protection that is contained in the Bill will operate.
Secondly, documents speak for themselves. Of course, nobody wants to question the right of a person to remain silent. But the documents can be read by others and can be seen by others. People can form a view based on what those documents say. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) admits this. This is why he said that the documents can be very much more harmful to an accused person than the evidence that he might offer out of his own mouth. I accept that but the point is that the documents not only can be produced by a person in a court but also can be obtained in other ways. They might be obtained on a search warrant. If they are obtained on a search warrant they can be adduced as evidence in proceedings and they will speak for themselves. But the honourable member is saying that if a person brings them along to the Commission on a summons those same documents cannot speak for themselves in exactly the same way as they would if they had been obtained by another method. I am worried that people might be able to use this system of being able to protect themselves from incriminating statements in documents by endeavouring to enter into an agreement with the Attorney and thereby avoiding the consequences of what those same documents might say if they were discovered on a search warrant. That would perhaps restrict very much the ambit of further inquiries. I accept that the right to remain silent is a very important right, a very treasured right, but I do not think that in this legislation it ought to run to the production of documents.
Mr HYDE (Moore) (12.26 a.m.)-I wish to make one point. The protection of witnesses against self-incrimination has long standing in British law. It arises out of abuse of enforced selfincrimination. It is part of our legal procedure. Law councils, bar councils and law societies around Australia have come out against this piece of legislation. As far as I am aware, they have come out universally against it. Ought we not to suspect that something is wrong when we are legislating with such haste in a matter that so offends those people who are most skilled in the conduct of the law? I urge the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) either to accept this amendment-it would be a dreadful thing if we did injustice to people that we did not need to-or set the whole issue aside so that it can be studied at leisure. People who are laymen, such as myself, will not have to take on the task of trying to defend the individual against the power of the state.

It can be left to those people at leisure who have greater skills to do it.
Mr ROBERT BROWN (Hunter) (12.28 a.m.)-I hope that the enormity of what happened in connection with the consideration of this provision of the Bill has not been lost on honourable members. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) at least on the Government side have expressed their very serious reservations about this provision. Yet without casting any aspersions on you, Mr Chairman, there was no alternative but for you to take the action that you took. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) is one of the few members of this House competent to make intelligent comments about the Bill generally and about this particular provision. He is a man with a background of concern for civil liberties. Despite that being the case, the honourable member for Prospect tonight, because of his concern-not just the particular concern to which he drew attention but the fact that at 12.30 a.m. this House is required to consider this provision and the Bill as a whole generally-
The CHAIRMAN (Mr MilIar)-The honourable member might now come back to the question immediately before the Committee.
Mr ROBERT BROWN-In connection with the provision that is being considered now, the fault lies not with the Chair, the honourable member for Prospect or any other back bench member of this House, but with the Government for insisting at this hour on the last day of this period of sitting, that this question now be considered by the Parliament. It is quite clear that the members of the Parliament are not at present as adequately equipped to deal with the question as they should be.
The CHAIRMAN. The honourable member must come back to the question. The Committee is considering the amendment.
Mr ROBERT BROWN-I conclude my remarks in a way similar to the way that I opened them. I hope that the enormity of what happened tonight is not lost on members of this Parliament.
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (12.29 a.m.)-I would just like to point out exactly what we are doing. We are establishing a commission which will be in existence for five years. The purpose of that Commission is to investigate criminal activities of an exceedingly wide-ranging nature, including offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating. That is a very

3034 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and 11 November 1982 National Crimes Commission Bill

wide description indeed. When an undertaking is given a person must answer. Blanket undertakings can be given so that every person who appears before this National Crimes Commission for the next five years, if the Attorneys-General are so minded, must answer.
All I am seeking to do is to restrict at this stage the ambit of the power that the Commission will have so that if a National Crimes Commission is established-I believe it should-it will operate more in accordance with our concepts of justice. We will not be handing over for a period of five years to a body-no matter how well staffed, no matter how well intentioned-powers that no other body in this land possesses. That is the purpose of the amendment that I have moved. I hope that some members of the Government side would consider those proposals seriously enough to venture with me, should the opportunity arise, to support those proposals in a division.
Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (12.31 a.m.)-I raise a parallel to what we are saying here. This clause would mean that a person who refuses to confess to a crime would be imprisoned for his failure to confess. The amendment would eliminate that situation. A person who refuses to produce evidence which would provide for his conviction of a crime will be prosecuted under the law for failing
to convict himself. I ask Government members: What is the dIfference between the view of each of those honourable members opposite who will vote for this provision and the view of those in totalitarian states in which failure to confess to a crime for which the State demands a confession means banishment and the denial of all civil liberties? I think Government members ought to look at exactly what they are up to tonight. They are placing in the hands of politicians the power to take away the liberty of the citizen. The citizen will not confess to crimes to which the Government asks that citizen to confess. Nothing will have to be proved against that person. His guilt will not have to be established. He will not have to be charged with any crime. The Government has only to demand that he answer its questions. If he says 'No' or if he fails to produce the documents the Government asks for then the Government imprisons him. The Government is giving itself that power.
I ask Government members: Where in British justice does any such provision exist? Where in the traditions on which this Parliament is founded does any such provision exist? Government members may say that I overstate the case. But the case I make is exactly the case that is in these provisions. The Government is setting up an organisation which requires self-incrimination. It is

setting up an organisation which punishes refusal to incriminate oneself. That is a total denial of all that is known of British justice.
Mr FALCONER (Casey) (12.34 a.m.)-I would like the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) to respond specifically to a very practical point made by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) about the effect of the provisions as it presently stands in the Bill. As I understand him, the honourable member for North Sydney said that the present provisions as they stand will really only catch up the small people, those who have made some silly mistake. Perhaps they are people who have been a bit foolish and who do not really know how the hide documents or how to make them unavailable or people who are not even quick enough to destroy them.
If the purpose of the proposed National Crimes Commission is to investigate alleged offences that are otherwise too difficult to investigate through the existing law enforcement mechanisms and if the purpose of the National Crimes Commission is to look really closely at the major organised criminal elements in our community, I suggest that they are the very elements in the community that will be able to distance themselves from the present provisions in the Bill. They will be able to destroy documents and organise things so that there are no documents to produce in the first place. I would be grateful if the Acting Attorney General could explain to the Committee how the Bill, as it is presently framed, will have a desirable effect in terms of really getting at the major offenders, the organised criminal elements, rather than just ensnaring the smaller elements in the community.
Mr HOLDING (Melbourne Ports) (12.37 a.m.)-I expressed my real concern about this legislation in the course of my speech in the second reading debate. I say to the Committee that the Australian people are entitled to receive from this chamber mature concern for and sober judgment on legislation which goes to the fundamental rights and liberties of the Australian people. I think the reality is that, at twenty to one in the morning-
Mr MeVeigh-You cannot even read. It is not that late.
Mr HOLDING-The Minister is candid. He admits that he cannot even read the legislation when it is this late. One other Minister has been asleep on the front bench for most of this debate. For a moment I was concerned. I thought he might be dead. I even thought the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) might have

National Crimes Commission Bill 10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATlVES 3035

to give him the kiss of life, oxygen. That could be a fate worse than death for some, I suppose.
Many points raised have not been answered. We are creating a structure which, as I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, can be used by an Attorney-General to strike at any citizen, at any business corporation or at any political party, large or small, within the Commonwealth. I indicated that the powers that will be conferred by this legislation can be used without any difficulty at all. A Labor government could use the powers that we are now discussing to invoke an inquiry into the Liberal Party or into the National Party. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite to think about the implications of that. I do not believe that this Government should have those powers. I do not believe that any government should have those powers. Concern at these provisions has been expressed by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. Bodies such as the Victorian Bar Council and other representations from the legal profession have expressed concern about legislation which can be the subject of abuse by the executive government of the day.
From time to time. I have heard, in this chamber, Ministers opposite say that they believe that certain State Attorneys-General have abused their powers. I have heard members on this side of the Chamber say that they believe the present Acting Attorney-General has abused his power. It does not matter whether the allegation is true or false. What is important is that we are adopting an inquisitorial process which is, essentially, foreign to the legal structure which goes to the essential fabric of our society. That is why this concern is being expressed. It is being expressed, I believe responsibly, from both sides of the chamber. Those are arguments that need to be addressed, and they need to be addressed with great seriousness. I do not believe-I do not want to canvass the argument that has been made by my colleague-at twenty to one in the morning that that concern is going to be addressed.
I suggest to the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) that the proper thing in the interests of good legislation and in the interests of this Parliament is to adjourn this debate. There are members on the other side of the Chamber for whom I, as a lawyer, have profound respect. They are voicing their concern again and again and they are trying to talk to their own party. It is not a reasonable or a sensible political exercise to ramrod this legislation through in the way in which it is being ramrodded through. We will live to regret it later.
Mrs Child-Let us go home.

Mr HOLDING-It is not a question of just going home; I believe that the Government needs to look at this legislation again. I say that as someone who would vote against this type of legislation and these powers being given to a Labor government.
Mr RuddockYou would have to resign.
Mr HOLDING-If the honourable member wants to make a joke of it because he is prepared, in his desperate attempt to climb into Cabinet, to go along with any of the provisions that are put forward and put his hand up without regard to the consequences, I leave that to his conscience. I implore the Acting Attorney-General, who is at the table, to adjourn this debate. Let the Government parties have another look at the matter and another think about it. We are coming back to this Parliament. I do not believe that continuing this debate is in the interests of this institution but, above all, it is not in the interests of the Australian people. We are talking about their rights. We are talking about their liberties. It is not in their interests that this debate continue in the way in which it is being continued. I say to the Leader of the House, who I believe cares about this institution and cares about the rights and liberties of the Australian people: 'Adjourn this debate now and allow this legislation to have the more mature consideration which I believe it so urgently, indeed desperately, needs'.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (12.43 a.m.)-I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced in the course of the debate on this clause. I have had the advantage of discussing it with several honourable members. In view of the arguments that have been advanced I propose to accept the amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (12.44 a.m.)-by leave-I move:
(8) Clause 18, page 12, after sub-clause (8) insert the following sub-clause:
'(8A) A reference in sub-sections (4), (5) and (7) to the incrimination of a person, to the guilt of a person, or to proceedings against a person shall be taken to include the incrimination or guilt of that person's spouse, or proceedings against that person's spouse, as the case may be.'.
(9) Clause 18, pages 12 and 13, omit sub-clauses (10) to (12) (both inclusive).
Protection should be afforded the spouse of the witness as well as the witness. It should be lawful to refuse to answer questions that may incriminate one's spouse, in addition to those that may incriminate oneself. I believe that that is self-explanatory.

3036 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and 11 November 1982 National Crimes Commission Bill

Opposition amendment No. 9 concerns subclauses (10) to (12) inclusive, which provide that where a person has refused, without reasonable cause, to answer a question or produce a document, certification of the fact may then be given to the Federal Court or to the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. Under existing sub-clause (9), anyone who contravenes sub-clauses (1), (2), or (3) is guilty of an offence punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, so a penalty is already provided. The Opposition fails to see why it is necessary to have a double penalty, to suggest that there could be duplication of a penalty in that a person could be dealt with by the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. Briefly, two proposals are involved. One concerns a proposed new clause (8A) and the other seeks the deletion of sub-clauses (10) to (12) because the matter involved is already dealt with in sub-clause (9).
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (12.47 a.m.)-The Government is unable to accept proposed new clause (8A). In fact, earlier I explained the Government's attitude to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). We believe that the amendment is based on a misapprehension concerning the law. Evidence would not be acceptable against the spouse in any event. It would be hearsay in any proceedings against the spouse and therefore not admissable against her. With respect to Opposition amendment No.9, we believe that the two sub-clauses which it seeks to omit are essential and should remain.
Amendments negatived.
Mr Lionel Bowen-We did not press for a division but wish our objection to be noted.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (12.49 a.m.) - I move:
(8) Clause 18, page 12, line 39, after 'Court', insert " upon application by the Attorney-General, '.
The amendment seeks to avoid a possible constitutional difficulty that may arise if the clause is left in its present form, in that it could be argued that it does not invest judicial power. A corresponding amendment is to be moved to the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 19 (False or misleading evidence).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (12.50 a.m.)-I move:
Clause 19, page 13, at the end of sub-clause (2) add 'or by a fine not exceeding $20,000'.

The amendment relates to clause 19 subclause (2) on page 13 of the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 which at present suggests that an offence against this sub-section can result in imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years. The Opposition is suggesting that a fine be an alternative to the penalty to imprisonment. At present the Commission has no alternative but to gaol a person who is guilty of giving false or misleading evidence. Again we make the point that this is not a final court which determines matters that relate to crime. In our view it would be more appropriate if a crime were so serious that it should at least be dealt with by a fine rather than depriving the subject of liberty. If a person is going to be penalised by going to gaol as a result of appearing before the Commission, which itself has no power to convict for any criminal offence but only has the power to assemble evidence with a view to prosecution, it will certainly be extremely unfortunate for that person if he then has to face a criminal charge arising out of the Commission's findings.
In other words, we think it is quite unfair that a person can face what one could call the double jeopardy of going to gaol because the Commission has decided this matter pursuant to its preliminary inquisition. If there were an alternative-we think there should be-why not put it on the basis as we envisage of imposing a substantial fine of, we suggest, not exceeding $20,000? In other words the Commission would have a discretion. It is very unfair when one has a commission of this type with all the difficulties and objections to it. It can infringe personal liberties but it cannot send anyone to gaol for the offence. Yet in the process of its inquisition it could send somebody to gaol because it has been found he gave false or misleading evidence. Surely if it relates to the crime that person will be dealt with in the course of subsequent criminal proceedings.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (12.57 a.m.)-The Government is not able to accept this amendment. It is not felt that a fine is appropriate for that sort of offence.
Amendment negatived.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 20 (Contempt of Commission).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (12.57 a.m.)-I move:
(II) Clause 20, page 13, omit paragraphs (a) (b), (c) and (d) of sub-clause (I), substitute the following paragraphs:
'(a) obstruct or hinder the Commission or a member in the performance of the functions of the Commission; or
(b) disrupt a hearing before the Commission. '.

National Crimes Commission Bill 10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3037

Clause 20, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) state that where there is contempt of the Commission by insult, interruption, disturbance or any other act, the person found guilty is liable to a penalty of $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months. We have no objection to dealing with people who are in contempt but we think that there ought to be a better definition of what the contempt is all about. Accordingly, we suggest that it ought to be limited to firstly, obstructing or hindering the Commission or a member in the performance of the functions of the Commission or, secondly, disrupting a hearing before the Commission. It is certainly getting into the realm of very subjective decision making to think that a person is insulting. That could perhaps cover a wide number of utterances or actions.
Sir James Killen-He could just sit there and look at you.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-Exactly. When the honourable member looks at what we have to look at he can understand that at times even we get upset. There can be the question of creating or continuing a disturbance in or near a place where the Commission is holding a hearing. I cannot think of anything which is more varied than that. If one is unfortunate enough to be in the corridor outside the Commission and some disturbance takes place in which one is involved one could well be framed under this proposed amendment. It could be said that one was taking part in the disturbance.
Let us get to the point: If the Commission has a job to do, it would know if it had been obstructed or hindered. I doubt very much that a person could insult the Commission. Surely the insulting aspect would arise from being part of an obstruction or hindrance. We must not be left in a position whereby some unfortunate person who might be giving straightforward answers to questions could be deemed to be insulting a member of the Commission. We must bear in mind that the human element is such that those who are clothed with some powers often try to exercise them unfairly. They can form all sorts of prejUdices and lose their tempers. We even see that happen in this place, balanced as it is to the extent of 50-40 at best.
The amendment is one of drafting nature which prevents the personal vindictiveness on the part of commissioners who think they can deal with people whom they deem to be insulting or who have taken part in a disturbance. We think that is irrelevant and unnecessary. It would render a number of people liable to penalties which are quite substantial-12 months' imprisonment or a

fine of $2,000. Therefore, I have moved the amendment.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (12.58 a.m.)-We have considered very carefully what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said. But on balance we feel that the clause should remain as it is.
Mr Lionel Bowen-l indicate that we will not press for a division.
Amendment negatived.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 21 agreed to.
Clauses 22 (Terms and conditions of appointment) .
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (12.58 a.m.)-by leave-I move:
(12) Clause 22, page 14, line 13, omit '5', substitute '2'.
( 13) Clause 22, page 14, at the end of sub-clause (1) add 'for a period not exceeding 2 years'.
In a nutshell amendment No. 12 deals with the terms and conditions of appointment to the National Crimes Commission. It means that a member would hold office for a period not exceeding two years. At present clause 22 states that a member should hold office for a period not exceeding five years. Amendment No. 13 would ensure that a person would not be eligible for reappointment to the Commission for a period not exceeding two years. Pursuant to the amendment moved by the Opposition, there would be a period of appointment of two years with eligibility for reappointment for a further two years. We think that is adequate. At present the appointment is for a period not exceeding five years with eligibility for reappointment.
The significant point about the whole concept of the National Crimes Commission is that it is a test. A period of five years is far too long for the wrong people to be appointed to the Commission. We have an enormous number of complaints now about people who hold judicial office. They are very difficult to remove; in fact, they are seldom removed. When talking about appointment of five years, it should be remembered that this is a very sensitive area. It is an area which will go very close to affecting the rights and liberties of a person by what would not be a normal process of law; it is a process of investigation and inquiry. Investigations may be made in private. There are all sorts of difficulties regarding the assembling of evidence with a view to instituting prosecutions in matters relating to white collar crime of a sophisticated nature.

3038 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and II November 1982 National Crimes Commission Bill

In recognising the difficulty in finding the evidence regarding an alleged crime, we realise that very special people are needed in this area. I think that has been admitted by the Government in that it accepted our first amendment to the clause establishing the constitution of the Commission. We said that the members had to have special expertise in that area. The Government has accepted that. The best proof of expertise, the qualifications or the experience will come only by looking at the performance of the Commission, certainly in its first 24 months of operation.
Accordingly, five years is far too long a period. As we in the Parliament have a three-year term, a government should be able to change the Commission in the term of a government-that is, within a three-year cycle. Parliament should not be inhibited or prevented from so doing because appointments had been made by a prior government for a period that might well go past the incoming government's term of office. For these reasons I think there is merit in the fact that if the person appointed to the Commission is performing the task he certainly should be eligible for reappointment. A five-year period is far too long for the reasons I have mentioned. I have moved the amendments accordingly.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.1 a.m.)-The Government feels that five years is an appropriate time considering the nature of this body. Therefore the Government is not able to accept the amendments.
Amendments negatived.
Mr Lionel Bowen-I would like to think that the ayes had it, but I will not press for a division.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 23 (Remuneration and allowances).
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.2 a.m.)~-I move:
(14) Clause 23, page 14, omit sub-clauses (I) and (2), substitute the following sub-clause:
'(I) Subject to sub-section (3), a member shall be paid such remuneration and allowances as are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal but, if no determination of that remuneration and those allowances is in operation, a member shall be paid such remuneration and allowances as are prescribed. '.
At present it is proposed that remuneration and allowances be determined by the Attorney General. We do not think that is adequate when salaries of everbody else in a similar position, including those of members of the High Court of Australia, are determined by the Remuneration

Tribunal. We think it would be a far better yardstick and give a balance if the Remuneration Tribunal determined the allowance and salaries. I see no objection to that proposal.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.3 a.m.)-The Government is not able to accept this amendment. As the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said, there are a wide range of people whose salaries are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Nevertheless, in view of the background and experience of the sorts of people concerned-appointments which have now been written into the Bill-who are likely to become members of the National Crimes Commission we believe that the matter should rest where it iswithout the amendment.
Amendment negatived.
Mr Lionel Bowen-I would like to think the ayes had it.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 24 to 35-by leave-taken together.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (1.4 a.m.)-I refer to clause 27, which is the disclosure of interests provision. Sub-clause (1) states:
A member or acting member who has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter being considered or about to be considered by the Commission shall, as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge, disclose the nature . . .
Sub-clause (2) states:
A disclosure under sub-section (I) shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the Commission . . .
I want to put a proposition to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown). I am not asking for any decision to be made but I think the Minister ought to think about this matter. We had the position not long ago whereby witnesses before the National Crimes Commission could in fact self-incriminate themselves. A public disclosure could be made. Politicians will be asked to declare their pecuniary interests. I refer to part time commissioners on the National Companies and Securities Commission. Honourable members know the case. I will not go into the details. We know the details of the case of Uhrig and Nosworthy. Both those people had conflicting interests in a takeover position which the Commission had to determine. I put this to the Minister quite sincerely. What are we thinking about when we talk about pecuniary interests? Obviously we are looking at a commission that will inquire into four or five areas-corporate crime, computer crime, white collar ..:rime, bank related crime and, perhaps, miscellaneous fraud. I would not have thought it unreasonable, if witnesses are

National Crimes Commission Bill 10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3039

to be placed in the position of having to disclose certain things, that acting members of the Commission should be obliged to disclose any conflict of interest or pecuniary interests in a matter. The public is entitled to that disclosure. People before the Commission in regard to a particular investigation also have an entitlement to know that. I am not asking the Minister to make a decision tonight but the matter is worthy of consideration. I do not see why it should be saddled up in the minutes of the Commission. If I understand the position from my lengthy questions to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), the National Companies and Securities Commission has to face exactly the same problems. I think the Government will have to bring in amending legislation to overcome those problems. The situation is quite wrong. These details ought to be made public and I can see no reason why they should not be. I would like to have an indication from the Minister as to why they are not to be made public.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.6 a.m.) -Certainly I will examine that matter. Of course clause 27 does relate to a member, not to a witness.
Mr Jacobi-Irrespective of that, it says member or acting member.
Mr N. A. BROWN-I will consider the matter.
Clauses agreed to.
Clause 36 (Commission to keep Attorney General informed of its operations).
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (I. 7 a.m.) - I move:
(9) Clause 36. page 19, at the end of the clause, add the following sub-clause:
'(2) Where any functions are conferred upon the Commission by or under a law of a State, the Commission shall-
(a) from time to time inform the appropriate Minister of that State concerning the general conduct of its operations in respect of the performance of those functions; and
(b) furnish to that Minister such information in relation to its operations in respect of the performance of those functions as that Minister requires.'.
This Government amendment, No.9, is selfexplanatory. It is moved to answer any possible objection that clause 36, as it presently stands, does not recognise the interest of State Ministers whose functions have been conferred on the National Crimes Commission by State law. It is sought to recognise the interest of State Ministers by this amendment.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (1.7 a.m.)-I raise another matter that I think the Acting Attorney General (Mr N. A. Brown) ought to consider.

Again, we could have a conflict in the law in relation to the Customs Act, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act and several other Acts. Clause 36 says that the Commission shall from time to time inform the Attorney-General concerning the general conduct of its operations, furnish information, and so forth. We are dealing basically with not only organised crime but also sophisticated crime. Let us wrap that up. I do not see why the Leader of the Opposition ought not to be kept advised at certain times, in certain cases and for certain reasons. That was done in regard to the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and it is done under the provisions of other legislation. It is an aspect that ought to be at least considered so that the practice can be made consistent.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.8 a.m.)-I will give consideration to that proposal.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Remainder of Bill-by leave--taken as a whole.
Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (1.9 a.m.)-I raise some points with the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) and then I will leave it at that. We ought to think about these things. We ran into trouble in regard to the Costigan Royal Commission in regard to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. If the Government intends to slot this legislation into operation I suggest it thinks about the Acts which contain exactly the same restrictive provisions which would apply to any commission. The National Health Act, the Australian Federal Police Act, the Health Insurance Act and the Social Services Act-I have not gone through the whole list-each contain secrecy provisions. I think it would be most advantageous for any commission that is set up to be asked: 'What are you going to do on each of those occasions?' For instance, I can envisage the Commission looking at medical frauds and social security frauds, quite apart from tax evasion. I think the Government really ought to consider what it will do with all these Acts which contain secrecy provisions.
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (1.11 a.m.)-I move:
Clause 37, page 20, after sub-clause (3) insert the following sub-clause:
(3A) In any report by the Commission under this section the Commission shall take reasonable care to ensure that the identity of a person is not revealed if to reveal his identity might, in light of any material appearing in the report, prejudice the safety or reputation of a person Or the fair

3040 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and II November 1982 National Crimes Commission Bill

trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.
This amendment is identical to one which has already been agreed to by the Government. I understand that the Government agrees to it in its entirety. On that basis, I have nothing to say.
Amendment agreed to.
Remainder of Bill, as amended, agreed to.
Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted.

Third Reading

Motion (by Mr N. A. Brown)-by leave-proposed:

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.12 a.m.)-Because of the complexity of this legislation, because the Government has not accepted the amendments that the Opposition wanted accepted and because we feel that the Government should seriously consider redrafting major sections of this Bill, we oppose the third reading, rare as it is to do so.

Clauses I to 3-by leave-taken together, and agreed to.

Clause 4 (Search Warrants).

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.20 a.m.)-I move:
(I) Clause 4, page 4, proposed section 4, omit sub-section (5).

Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.21 a.m.)-The Government does not accept the proposal to leave out sub-section (5) of proposed section 4.

Amendment negatived.

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.22 a.m.) - I move:

(2) Clause 4, page 4, at the end of the clause add the following proposed section:

Application by telephone for search warrants

.., 5. (I) Where, by reason of circumstances of urgency, a relevant Commission considers it necessary to do so, the relevant Commission may make application by telephone for
a search warrant under sub-section 4 (I).
'(2) Where a Judge issues a search warrant upon an application made by telephone, he shall-
(a) complete and sign that warrant;

Royal Commission Amendment Bill

11 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3041

(b) inform the relevant Commission of the terms of the warrant and the date on which and the time at which it was signed; and
(c) forward a copy of the warrant to the relevant Commission.
'(3) Where a search warrant is issued upon an application made by telephone, a member of the staff of the relevant Commission or a member of the Australian Federal Police or of the Police Force of a State may complete a form of warrant in the terms indicated by a Judge under sub-section (2).
'(4) A form of warrant duly completed in accordance with sub-section (3) shall be deemed to be a warrant issued under section 4. '.".
In a nutshell, this amendment relates to the ability to get search warrants by telephone. It is compatible with a similar provision put in the National Crimes Commission Bill. I understand that the Government will accept the amendment.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney General) (1.23 a.m.)-As we did in the case of the National Crimes Commission Bill, we accept this amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 5 agreed to.
Clause 6 (Self-incrimination).
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.24 a.m.) - I move:
(1) Clause 6, page 5, at the end of proposed section 6A, add the following sub-section:
'(3) This section does not apply where the offence in respect of which the production of a document or other thing or the answer to a question might tend to incriminate a person is an offence with which the person has been charged and the charge has not been finally dealt with by a court or otherwise disposed of.'.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 7 agreed to.
Clause 8.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.25 a.m.)-The Opposition opposes clause 8. Clause 8 repeals section 6C of the principal Act. We wish to leave section 6c of the original Act as is. Proposed new section 6C is opposed by the Opposition also. The difficulties are similar to those that we expressed in respect of the National Crimes Commission Bill. There could be a report to a Federal court or a supreme court about a person who has failed to comply with requirements. In other words, we have the difficulty of a person being sent off to another court, whether Federal or State, to be dealt with. We do not think that is the right approach. Under section 6C of the Royal Commissions Act, where a person has omitted to do anything, each such omission shall be a separate offence. We think that that is adequate to deal

with it, rather than having the difficulty of having another court deal with these matters.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.27 a.m.)-I move-
(2) Clause 8, page 5, line 32, after 'court', insert " upon application by the Attorney-General,'.
Amendment agreed to.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clauses 9 to 12-by leave-taken together, and agreed to.
Clause 13.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.27 a.m.)-I move:
(4) Clause 13, page 7, at the end of sub-section (2) of proposed section 6H add 'or by a fine not exceeding $20,000'.
At present section 6H provides that anyone committing any offence which is an indictable offence, of course, shall be subject, on conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years. We make the same point as we made earlier on the National Crimes Commission Bill. We want a discretion there to say that the penalty need not be imprisonment but could be a fine not exceeding $20,000.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Acting Attorney-General) (1.28 a.m.)-For the reasons given in the previous debate, the Government is not able to accept the amendment.
Amendment negatived.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 14.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (1.29 a.m.) - I move:
(5) Clause 14, page 7, line 28, after 'Commission' insert 'wilfully'.
The idea of the amendment is that a person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that a document might be required in evidence before a commission, must wilfully, do certain things such as conceal, mutilate or destroy documents.
Mr N. A. Brown-The Government will accept that.
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (by Mr Lionel Bowen) negatived:
(6) Clause 14, page 7, at the end of sub-section (2) of proposed section 6K add 'or by a fine not exceeding $10,000'.
Mr Lionel Bowen-I ask that our objections be noted.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Remainder of Bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to.

ADJOURNMENT
Whitlam Labor Government-Illegal Immigrants-Demonstration at Parliament
House
Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed:
That the House do now adjourn.
Mr SCOTT (Hindmarsh) (1.33 a.m.)-I wish to draw the attention of this House to the fact that we have now reached II November, the anniversary of that infamous attack on the democratic process perpetrated by the Liberal and National Country parties on the Whitlam Labor Government. It will not be forgotten by the people of Australia. The people who were involved in that infamy will have to live with it.
Mr MAHER (Lowe) (1.34 a.m.)-I do not wish to waste the time of the House on a trifling matter. I draw to the attention of honourable members tonight the problem of a number of people who have lost their liberty because they are illegal immigrants. I was approached on 18 October by a person living in my electorate who said that his sister and her husband and their daughter, aged 22 years, were in detention. The position is, apparently, that they are still in detention. On the day when I saw the constituent about these people-Fijian nationals-I sent an urgent telegram to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges). Nothing has since happened. The person aged 22 is proposing to marry an Australian citizen.
It is obvious that the Minister's Department or his officers are investigating this matter, but the point that I am trying to make tonight is that these people are still in detention. They are people who have never committed an offence in their lives. They are very distresed by their experience. I believe that there should be a more speedy process of decision-making in relation to these people who are put into detention. There is no court they can approach. There is no tribunal to hear their claim. Their names are Mr and Mrs Hari Bhajan Singh. It is of great concern to me that the whole tradition of British justice that no one is sentenced to gaol without trial is being flouted and ignored in this case. The relatives of these people saw me and asked whether they could stay until their daughter was married in October. It is now well into

November. So far as I know they are still in detention in Australia. They have not even been told of their legal rights under the Migration Act.
The young woman is proposing to marry this Australian citizen. I am told that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is claiming that it is not a genuine marriage. I do not know how the Department works out whether a marriage is genuine. The matter is of great concern to me. These people have lost their liberty. No family should be kept in custody for such a long time, whether they are illegal immigrants or anything else. I draw this matter to the attention of the House. It is a matter of great concern to me. I trust the Minister will act on it immediately and say to these people, 'You are free and the marriage can go ahead as long as you leave the country within 21 days', or some such thing. No one should be kept in prison, in detention, without trial. It is a very serious state of affairs when the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is so inefficient and so run down that people such as these people are kept in custody without trial.
Mr BAUME (Macarthur) (1.37 a.m.)-This morning I want to draw the attention of the House to one particular aspect of the break-in of the Parliament-the breaking down of the doors and the storming of the Parliament by the-
Mr Carlton-A scandalous occasion.
Mr BAUME-As the Minister said, it was a scandalous occasion. The break-in was carried out by a group of what were alleged to be demonstrators from the coal and steel industries. I have in front of me a photograph of that break-in. In the forefront of the photograph of those people forcing their way into this Parliament House is the State Labor member for Kiama.
Mr Hunt-What is his name?
Mr BAUME-His name is Mr W. E. Knott, M.P.
Mr MaherMr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Labor member for Kiama is a cripple. He is a man with an artificial leg. He could not have been leading the charge into this chamber.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! There is no point of order. I call the member for Macarthur.
Mr BAUME-Mr Deputy Speaker (Quorum formed). I recognise that this is a matter that the Labor Party does not want to hear about because, of course-
Mr Milton-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is so much noise coming from the other side of the chamber that I cannot

hear what the honourable member is saying. I wish you would ask honourable members to keep quiet.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! No point of order arises. I call the honourable member for Macarthur.
Mr BAUME-I understand the reluctance of members of the Australian Labor Party to listen to this matter, but the fact is that a member of another parliament has offended against this Parliament and has offended against the principles of democracy.
Mr Morris-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.
Mr Hodgman-Stand up!
Mr MorrisYou economic traitor.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! There is no point of order.
Mr Morris-I was about to take a point of order before I was interrupted by the Minister for the Capital Territory. I am seeking your guidance. Is it in order for a member of this chamber to reflect upon a member of another parliament? He is not a member of this Parliament.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! There is no point of order.
Mr Morris-There is no point of order? Mr Deputy Speaker, that seems to be a very strange ruling from you at this time of day. You have a very broad knowledge of the Standing Orders, Mr Deputy Speaker-
Mr BAUME-He condemned himself by breaking into our Parliament.
Mr Morris-Come down here and say that. Come over this side and say it, you smearer.
Mr Baume-Would you like the photograph tabled?
Mr Morris-It is a mock-up.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The House will come to order. The debate will not be resumed until the House has come to order. The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr HURI"ORD (Adelaide) (1.42 a.m.) -The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) invited members from this side of the House to look at the photograph. I took up the invitation and I want to tell the House that there is no evidence in that photograph that the State member concerned was anywhere near the vanguard of those breaking into the Parliament. The State member, I assert, was carrying out his proper duties to be with the people who are suffering the

unemployment that has been created by monetarism and by those sitting on the benches opposite. They have created the appalling economic conditions in this country. Any State member worth his salt would have come to this city with those who were suffering at that time.
Mr Coleman-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.
Mr HURFORD-This will not be a point of order. I invite you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to take action against the honourable member for not bringing a proper point of order.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Adelaide will resume his seat. I will hear the honourable member for Wentworth on a point of order.
Mr Coleman-Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member is misleading the House in that the picture shows the member-
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Adelaide.
Mr HURFORD-We have just heard an honourable member who parades as somebody of integrity in some of the journals of this country pretending that he had something to offer in the way of independent evidence in other spheres of this country. Firstly, he suggested to this House that he was making a point of order which was found not to be a point of order. Secondly, I invite anybody on that side of the House who has any integrity to look at that photograph to see whether there is any evidence whatsoever that the State member concerned was breaking into this Parliament-
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar) -Order!
Mr HURFORD-I might say that anybody around that photograph at the moment-
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Adelaide will resume his seat. Honourable members on my right will resume their seats or I shall deal with them. The Minister for Transport will resume his seat. Order! I warn honourable members, even at this late or early hour, depending on how they see it, that if they persist in defying the instructions of the Chair I will deal with them.
Mr HURFORD-This is just another occasion when the honourable member for Macarthur (Mf Baume) has given witness in the Parliament and to the nation of the sort of person he is, the sort of integrity that he has, the sort of smearer that he is, the sort of advice that he is prepared to give the Parliament. He is prepared to detain us at this

time of night in order to try to gather another headline at the expense of someone else and is doing so with a photograph that does not in any way substantiate the point that he is making. I believe that the Parliament and the people will properly judge him at the very next opportunity and we will find that he is another has-been.
Mr Baume-I seek leave to table the , photograph.
Motion (by Mr Morris) agreed to:

Companies: Naturalised Status
(Question No_ 4990)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 August 1982:
(I) Further to his answer to Question No. 64 (Hansard, 31 March 1981, pages 1155-6) in which he indicated that no firm time scale for achieving 'naturalised' status has been set by the Government in relation to Conzinc Riotinto Australia Ltd (CRA), what has been the increase in Australia~ equity in CRA since it was granted 'naturalising' status.
(2) Are other companies regarded as 'naturalised' or 'naturalising' for the purposes of foreign investment guidelines; if so, (a) what are their names, (b) when was each company granted this status, (c) what was the level of Australian equity in each company at that time and (d) what is the present level of Australian equity in each company.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
( I) When agreement was reached between the Government and CRA in early 1979 on the terms on which CRA would be granted naturalising status, Australian equity in the company was 27.4 per cent. By the time CRA formally became a naturalising company in May 1979, its Australian equity had risen to 31.8 per cent. Since then its Australian equity has risen to 42.7 per cent.

Reserve Bank: Recruitment
(Question No. 4993)
Mr Maher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 August 1982:
Does the Reserve Bank recruit permanent staff over the age of 26; if not, what justification exists for this discrimination on the ground of age.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I am advised by the Reserve Bank that whilst the bulk of its staff is recruited at younger ages as schoolleavers, university graduates and undergraduates, the Bank does recruit permanent staff over the age of 26. Before doing so, it assures itself that the relevant job vacancy cannot be filled satisfactorily from existing staff. This accords with an understanding with the Reserve Bank Division of the Commonwealth Bank Officers' Association.
Social Welfare: Family Income Supplements
(Question No_ 5012)
Dr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 September 1982:
(I) What are the administrative arrangements needed to implement the Family Income Supplements.
(2) Why are these arrangements causing the deferment of payment of the supplements until May 1983.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) The administrative arrangements needed to implement the Family Income Supplement are:
Interpretation of the legislation into computer system and clerical terms.
Computer programming of the identifiable system requirements.
Design and implementation of a liaison sub-system to allow the automatic transfer of information between the Family Income Supplement system and other Social Security benefit systems.
System testing and introduction of the new system and the liaison sub-system.
Acquisition of additional processing staff.
Staff training and familiarisation with the new benefit.
Writing, printing and distribution of national clerical procedures.
Design, production and distribution of claim forms and review forms.
Issuing invitations to claim the Supplement to families receiving Health Care Cards.
General publicity to encourage claims for the Supplement.
(2) Because of the logistical implications and the sequential nature of many of these tasks a lead time of some months is necessary.
The Government is anxious to get this new scheme of assistance operating as soon as possible and has settled on May 1983 as the earliest date by which the necessary administrative action to introduce the new benefit can be completed.

Answers to Questions

10 and 11 November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3047

International Visitor Arrivals without a Valid Visitor's Visa
(Question No. 5050)
Mr Jull asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 September 1982:
(I) How many international visitors arrived at ports and airports in Australia during 1981-82 without a valid visitor's visa.
(2) How many of these persons were required to leave Australia on the next available flight.
(3) Under what conditions are visas issued to visitors at the port or airport.
(4) How many visas were issued under these circumstances during 1981-82.
Mr Hodges-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) In the period I July 1981 to 30 June 1982 a total of 3,199 overseas persons arrived at Australian airports and seaports without visas. It is not possible to separate 'international visitors' from other categories of arrivals without visas. It is also possible that some of these persons did in fact possess visas but either the validity had expired or the passport was no longer valid.
(2) During the period under consideration 186 persons were refused entry and required to leave on the next available flight.
(3) Persons arriving at airports/seaports without a visa seeking entry as visitors are interviewed by an Immigration inspector at the point of entry to assess what, if any, special circumstances exist and their bona fides, i.e. subject to valid reasons for arrival without a visa, have they sufficient funds to cover the period of stay, do they possess a return or onward ticket or sufficient funds to pay for onward fares. If established, an appropriate entry permit is granted. Persons unable to establish their bona fides are refused entry and the responsible carrier company is required to remove them from Australia.
(4) A total of 3,013 persons were granted temporary entry permits under these circumstances during the financial year 1981-82.
Drought Assistance
(Question No. 5091)
Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 15 September 1982:
(I) What (a) is the expected total monthly cost to the Commonwealth of the Government's recently announced drought assistance package and (b) are the assumptions on which the estimate of cost is based.
(2) What (a) is the expected monthly cost to the Commonwealth of the fodder subsidy and (b) are the assumptions relating to the level of fodder purchases and the nutrient value of the types of fodder likely to be purchased on which this estimate is based.
(3) What is the expected monthly cost of the interest rate subsidy.
(4) How many producers are likely to qualify for the interest rate subsidy and what is the distribution of debt, by level, source and interest rate, among these producers.
(5) What will be the impact on the Government's Budget strategy of the drought assistance package.

(6) Has his attention been drawn to allegations in the metropolitan and rural media that the result of the fodder subsidy will be a massive increase in fodder prices; if so, how effective will be the subsidy in helping producers to maintain breeding flocks and herds.
(7) What is the current level of Australia's fodder reserves.
(8) How much fodder, and what types, are located in the eastern States.
(9) How do reserves compare with likely demand.
Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I), (2), (3) and (4) The fundamental aim of the assistance package is to assist in the survival through the drought of our rural industries, by helping drought affected farmers who are having difficulties in servicing debt and by helping farmers retain sheep and cattle. While it is impossible to forecast with any precision the cost of the Drought Relief Fodder Subsidy and Interest Subsidy Schemes, sums of $320m and $36m are appropriated under the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Act for the interest and fodder subsidies respectively. It is not practical to reduce these estimates to an accurate monthly costing. They are based on the assumption that there will be no significant easing of current drought conditions during the current financial year.
In respect of the fodder subsidy, the funds appropriated take into account an estimated 14m head of cattle and 93m head of sheep drought affected as at I September 1982. It has been further assumed that about one-third of the stock in drought affected areas will need to be totally hand fed and that two-thirds of this fodder will be purchased off-farm.
In respect of the interest rate subsidy, BAE survey data indicate that drought affected farmers have an average debt with interest greater than 12% of $32,300. It is further estimated that 10% of the 100,000 drought affected farmers as at I September 1982, have an average rate of interest on this debt of 18% and have limited or no liquid assets. In addition, it is assumed that a futher 6,000 farmers would become eligible as the drought progressed, a futher 5,000 producers would take out new loans, and a further 5,000 farmers would become eligible through run-down of liquid assets.
(5) This is a matter for the Treasurer. While it would not be possible to gauge accuragely the impact of these Schemes on the Budget, because no-one can predict the extent and severity of the drought, it can be said that the impact of the drought upon the economy and the Budget strategy will be far greater than any impact expenditure under the assistance package may have on the Budget.
(6) It is not unusual for fodder prices to rise as drought develops and this may well take place irrespective of whether a subsidy is available or not. The price of wheat is related to conditions in the international wheat market and basing the subsidy on the nutritive value of fodder relative to wheat will effectively prevent fodder prices escalating as a direct result of the subsidy. The fodder subsidy will enable primary producers to retain sheep and cattle and thereby greatly assist economic recovery in Australia's grazing industry when the drought breaks.
(7), (8) and (9) The severe drought conditions in the eastern States have placed considerable pressure on fodder supplies. Most of the feed grain stocks, other than wheat, from last season are already committed and the Australian Wheat Board is moving wheat from Queensland to NSW locations to meet demand for feed wheat. The Government has moved to empower the Board to import wheat into Australia. Should imports be necessary it is essential that they meet AustraJia's stringent quarantine provisions.

Answers to Questions

In respect of summer grains, it is understood that the recent rainfall received in parts of northern NSW and Queensland has led to widespread plantings and will no doubt take some of the pressure off wheat stocks in the early part of next year.
Canned Fruit: Export to USSR
(Question No. 5165)
Dr Cass asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 23 September 1982:
(I) Did the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation conduct negotiations with the USSR in 1981 for the export of canned fruit to that country.
(2) What quantity of canned fruit did the USSR propose to import.
(3) What terms of contract were proposed.
(4) Were any conditions attached to the contract proposal by the USSR.
(5) What has been the response of the Australian Government.
(6) What is the present position in the negotiations.
Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Since 1981, through one of its marketers, the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation has been associated with negotiations to sell canned fruits to the Soviet Union as a part of a trade package being negotiated by a local trading firm.
(2), (3), (4) and (5) No formal purchase contract has as yet been offered to the Corporation.
(6) The Australian trading firm is continuing discussions with Soviet authorites.
Private Exchange Line Telephones: Officers of the Department of Social Security
(Question No. 5178)
Mr Robert Brown asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 September 1982:
(1) How many officers in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within the Minister's jurisdiction have private exchange line telephones connected in their offices.
(2) What are the designations of these officers.
(3) Do these officers also have telephones in their offices which are connected to a PABX or PMBX.
(4) What is the rationale for providing private exchange line telephones.
(5) What was the cost of (a) rental, (b) metered calls, and (c) booked trunk calls for the private exchange line telephones for 1981-82.
(6) Would a telephone with a silent extension number connected to the PABX or PMBX serve the same purpose.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) 220.
(2) Director General-- (I); Deputy Director General- (I); State Director-(5); State Senior Assistant Director- (5); Regional Manager-( 128); Other clerical designations in Rehabilitation centres, State Headquarters and CentralOffice--(80).

(3) Of the 220 officers mentioned in (I) 211 have exchange lines and PMBX/PABX extensions.
(4) The primary rationale for providing private exchange lines is to ensure that communication with clients, other agencies and the Executive can be maintained in the case of PMBX/PABX malfunction. In smaller offices several exchange lines are more economical than PMBX of PABX.
(5) Expenditure in 1981-82 for private exchange lines was-Cal $37,815; (b) $214,933; (c) $8,645.
(6) No. Refer to answer given in 4 above.
Per Capita Income
(Question No_ 5231)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 1982:
(1) Where does Australia rank in per capita income relative to other technologically advanced nations.
(2) Where did Australia rank in 1972.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) and (2) The most commonly used approach to making international comparisons of per capita income is to convert Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita to a common currency (usually US. dollars) using exchange rates current at the time. There are, however, a number of limitations associated with this approach.
First, there are limitations associated with the use of national accounts as an indication of relative living standards. Because national account statistics are designed primarily to reflect market transactions in the economy, they provide no indication of factors such as the healthiness of the population, the quality of the environment and the distribution of wealth. Nor dod they allow for improvements in living standards through increased leisure, rather than through market production and consumption of increased goods and services. Moreover, the national account statistics of different countries are not fully comparable; in particular, there are differences in the coverage and valuation of transactions.
The conversion of GDP as measured in national currencies to a common unit of account by exchange rates also has serious limitations. Exchange rates fluctuate widely within short perods and may frequently not be a good guide to the relative purchasing power of currencies, i.e., how many units of currency in each country are needed to buy a "standard" basket of goods and services. It should be noted that the selection of a standard basket of goods and services itself raises problems when comparing countries of different cultures.
Attempts have been made to overcome these exchange-rate problems by revaluing GDP per capital at a common set of international prices in order to take account of the different purchasing power of national currencies. However, the comprehensive data needed to measure the purchasing power of currencies accurately are beyond the scope of many countries' existing statistical collections. As present the OECD has adjusted per capital GDP using estimates of purchasing power for only 15 industrial countries, not including Australia.
So far as Australia is concerned, therefore, comparisons of the kind referred to in the question can only be made on the basis of GDP per capita revalued using exhange rates. For what they are worth, the latest available estimates of GDP per capita on this basis, published by the OECD for 1980 and covering 25 member countries, show that Australia was at that time ranked 15th. On the same basis, Australia was ranked 11th in 1972.

Answers to Questions

(Mr Kerin) asked me a series of questions, without notice, concerning notes taken by Mr Landos, the Secretary of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems.
Further to the honourable member's questions, I have obtained the following additional information:
In my reply of 13 October 1982, I stated that Mr Landos is engaged in the same role as he was previously. prior to his appointment as secretary of the Kelly Committee.
When Mr Landos completed his task as secretary in March 1980 he returned to the position he held previously, namely, Director, Establishments, Consultancy and Information Services, Management Services Branch. However, in September 1980 he was appointed as Principal Executive Officer, Bureau of Animal Health. Since February 1982, he has been acting Assistant Director, Export Inspection Service.
Taxation: Allowances to Life Assurance Companies
(Question No. 2562)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:
(I) What was the cost of each of the following allowances provided to life assurance companies: (a) the exemption from tax of life assurance premiums and consideration for annuities included in total income, provided under section III of the Income Tax Assessment Act, (b) the exemption from tax of investment income from superannuation business provided under section 112A of the Act and (c) the deduction of I per cent of the value of future calculated liabilities provided under sections 114 and 115 of the Act for each year since 1975-76 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.
(2) How long have these or similar provisions existed in the Act.
(3) What is the reason for providing these allowances.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) (a) The precise information sought by the honourable member is not available. However, based on information from the Statistical Appendix to the 1980 Annual Report of the Life Insurance Commissioner relating to 1979, the increased income tax that would have been payable by non-government life assurance companies if their premium income and consideration received for annuities had been assessable would have been about $1,OOOm. This amount does not, however, represent the cost of the provision because, if such income had been assessable, it would have been necessary to allow deductions for outgoings such as related claims, surrenders and other expenses that are not allowable as deductions under the present law.
(b) The available statistics of income tax deductions allowed under section 112A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to life insurance companies for the 1978-79 income year indicate that removal of the exemption of investment income attributable to superannuation business would result in increased tax payable of about $180m. This does not represent the cost of exempting this income because, if the exemption had not applied, it would have been necessary to allow certain other deductions associated with superannuation business that are not at present allowable.
(c) The estimated cost of allowing deductions under section 115 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of each

of the income years for which the relevant statistics are available was as follows: 1975-76, $2Sm; 1976-77, $29m; 1977-78, $32m; 1978-79, $34m.
(2) (a) Since 1933, (b) since 1961 and (c) since 1933.
(3) (a) The exclusion from assessable income under section III of life assurance premium moneys received and considerations received for annuities granted is directly related to the basis on which such companies are assessed for income tax purposes, viz., on their investment income less permitted deductions.
(b) Section 112A was inserted to place the life companies, in relation to their superannuation business, on a similar footing to privately managed superannuation funds which, by also making the requisite investments in public authority securities, can obtain exemption from tax on their income.
(c) The deduction under section lIS was intended to free from income tax an amount which corresponds to the reserves set aside to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
Taxation: Lump Sum Retirement Payments
(Question No, 2568)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10June 198\:
(I) What was the cost of exempting from tax 9S% of the total amount of lump sum payments provided in consequence of retirement from or termination of any office of employment under section 26 (d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1975-76 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.
(2) How long has this or a similar provision existed in the Act.
(3) What is the reason for providing this allowance.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The cost to income tax revenue of exempting from income tax 9S% of the total amount of lump sum payments provided in consequence of retirement from, or termination of, any office or employment allowed under section 26 (d), including benefits assessed under 26AE for the 1980-81 income year has been estimated as follows: 1975-76 $27Sm. 1976-77 $3S0m. 1977-78 $4S0m. 1978-79 $360m. 1979-80 $370m. 1980-81 $4S0m.
Statistics of amount assessed under section 26AE are not recorded separately. The estimates for the 1975-76 to 1977-78 income years have been made on the basis that the whole of the lump sum along with the taxpayer's other taxable income would otherwise have borne income tax at the general rates. For the 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81 income years the marginal rate was taken to be limited to 33.S per cent, 33.07 per cent and 32 per cent respectively, the maximum rates applicable to other lump sum payments made on termination of employment that were fully assessable.
(2) Since 1916.
(3) Section 26 (d) treats, on the same basis, all lump sum amounts received in consequence of retirement from employment which might otherwise be wholly exempt from tax as capital receipts (e.g. lump sums from superannuation funds) or wholly assessable (e.g. lump sums paid on account of long service leave accrued prior to IS August 1978), but on a concessional basis which recognises that such sums may have arisen from employment spanning many years.

Taxation: Rebate for Dividends of Resident Companies
(Question No. 2569)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:
(I) What was the cost of the rebate of tax allowed for dividends included in the taxable income of resident companies provided under section 46 of the income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1975-76 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.
(2) How long has this or a similar provision existed in the Act.
(3) What is the reason for providing this allowance.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Based on 1978-79 income tax statistics, the latest data available, the immediate effect of having disallowed rebates for dividends received by resident companies would have been an increase in income tax payable by companies of about $1 ,300m. However, this cannot be taken as the cost of the rebate because, in the absence of the rebate, resident companies would rearrange their structures and distribution policies to reduce the flow of dividends between companies. Also, the additional tax that would have resulted from the change would have left less income available for distribution as dividends with the result that less tax would be payable on dividends received by individual and company shareholders. Information that would enable reliable estimates to be made of the resulting impact on revenue of denying rebates to resident companies is not available.
(2) Since 1934.
(3) Under Australia's classical system of company tax, a company pays company tax on its income and shareholders pay personal income tax on dividends paid from that income. If one or more companies are interposed between the original company and the ultimate shareholder, it is not appropriate to collect additional tax as dividends pass from company to company. The purpose of the section 46 rebate is to remove the tax from such inter-company dividends, and leave the total tax yield as it would be in the absence of the interposed companies.
Uranium Mining: Exposure of Workers
(Question No. 4440)
Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:
(I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a 45 page minority report of the South Australian Legislative Council Select Committee on Uranium Resources.
(2) Does the report estimate that exposure levels accepted in the Australian Code of Practice for the Minister and Milling of Ores may be up to 4 times too high based on the 1980 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Study.
(3) Will the Government (a) call for urgent review and updating of the Code, (b) establish a national registry of uranium workers to assist epidemiological studies and delayed compensation claims. (c) set up an independent continuous monitoring authority to publish and control radon and its decay product& in the uranium industry irrespective of State standards and initiatives, (d) prescribe conditions for tailings disposal, (e) recommend long term workers' compensation insurance levels to State Government insurance offices relating to genetic damage and malignancy risks and (f) recommend

limits of exposure for smokers and non-smokers in the industry.
Mr McVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The report of the Select Committee of the South Australian Legislative Council on Uranium Resources was tabled in the South Australian parliament in November 1981. A dissenting statement by two members of the Select Committee has been drawn to my attention.
(2) The report of the Select Committee and the dissenting statement both draw attention to a report entitled 'The Risk of Lung Cancer Among Underground Miners of Uranium Bearing Ores' (June 1980) which was prepared by a Study Group established by the United States National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has recently reviewed the same data and its conclusions do not support those of the NIOSH Study Group.
3 (a) Under the Environment Protection (N uclear Codes) Act 1970 there is provision for variation of approved codes. The Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980) is at present under review by a joint Commonwealth/State Expert Committee. The Committee is examining the current recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council and of international bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the results of studies such as those documented by NIOSH, and available data on Australian uranium mining and milling operations.
3 (b) I am advised by the Minister for Health that his Department is setting up a national repository for certain health and radiation exposure records of uranium miners to enable epidemiological studies to be carried out, should such studies seem desirable and feasible at the low levels of radiation exposure which will be received under the provisions of the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Miling of Radioactive Ores (1980). Epidemiological studies would be undertaken in cooperation with the States and the Northern Territory and involve provision by them of relevant data to the Commonwealth Institute of Health, which would have the coordinating and supervisory role.
3 (c) The Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980) includes adequate and appropriate provision for the establishment of radiation monitoring programs for collection, evaluation and reporting of data related to the lev.el of radiation exposure arising from uranium mining and milling operations. It is within the competence of the States and the Northern Territory to adopt the Code and implement these provisions of the Code. In the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has retained policy responsibility for uranium matters and has established the Office of the Supervising Scientist to supervise, inter alia, the implementation of the requirements of the Code and the monitoring of radiation protection in the Alligator Rivers Region uranium mining projects.
3 (d) Under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978 the Commonwealth, in close consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, has formulated the Code of Practice on the Management of Radioactive Wastes from the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1982). This Code identifies the principles and criteria by which the management of radioactive mining and milling wastes is to be achieved in the short and long term. It is the Government's view that the responsibility for implementation of the Code and the provision for management of tailings lies with State and Northern Territory Governments. In addition the Office of the Supervising Scientist oversees the implementation of

3052 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and II November 1982

Answers to Questions

tailings management requirements on uranium mining projects in the Alligator Rivers Region. To assist industry in meeting the requirements of the Code, advisory material in the form of guidelines is being published separately.
3 (e) No. In view of the responsibilities of the States for the operation of State Government insurance offices and for matters relating to workers' compensation insurance, I do not believe that it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to make such recommendations. I would add that the necessary data on which to base recommendations are not currently available to the Government. I understand that the Australian Radiation Laboratory is currently preparing a document on the risks associated with occupational exposure to radiation compared with risks in other occupations, and that this document will be made available to the public in due course and could assist insurers in considering these issues.
3 (f) The Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980) specifies radiation protection requirements and exposure limits adequate to protect the health of all employees associated with mining and milling activities. However, in recognition of the relationship between smoking habits and the risk of lung cancer induced by radon daughters as indicated by epidemiological studies, the Code provides that areas of low radiation levels in which workers may smoke should be identified, and that smoking in controlled areas should be prohibited. Under the training program recommended by the guideline to the Code, on Training of Employees and Supervisors, the attention of all employees should be drawn to the relationship between lung cancer, radon daughters and smoking.
Taxation: Boards of Review
(Question No. 4701)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 August 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to a paper entitled 'The Functions and Procedures of Boards of Review' by Dr P. Gerber; if so, will he supply me with the precise wording of the analysis set out in the preamble to the paper.
(2) Over recent years has there been an increasing number of requests for referral of disputed assessments to Boards of Review and as a consequence is there a substantial backlog of cases awaiting determination; if so, is there an urgent need to restructure and update the procedures for the determination of disputed taxation assessments referred to the respective Boards of Review.
(3) Is it a fact that, under sections 185 and 190 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a taxpayer who wishes to appeal against his assessment (a) must state in his objection to an assessment every ground of his appeal and (b) is limited to the grounds stated in his objection despite the fact that the Tax Office gives him very scant information.
(4) Is it also a fact that (a) the Commissioner for Taxation does not face a similar requirement and (b) the requirement (i) creates an inequitable situation and (ii) contributes to the clogging of the Boards of Review as the taxpayer must raise every conceivable ground of objection, well-founded or not.
(5) Would there be more order in a Board's proceedin'gs if the Commissioner were required to inform the appellant (taxpayee) in significant detail why his claims were disallowed as the issues facing both parties would be clearly known in advance of the Board's hearing.
(6) Might cases also be dealt with more speedily if (a) both the Commissioner and taxpayer were able to amend the grounds upon which the appeal or objection is argued, as was suggested in June 1978 by the Sub-committee on the Taxation Institute of Australia as reported in Taxation in Australia (1978), pages 817, 827-8, and (b) a Board had the power to

order further and better particulars in appropriate cases both in the interest of justice and so that these cases can proceed in an orderly and comprehensible manner as Dr Gerber, a member of No. 3 Review Board, commented in a 1981 address; if so, will he take immediate steps to have these recommendations implemented.
(7) Did the Taxation Office, as reported in a recent press article, receive 46 033 requests to refer disputed assessments to the Boards of Review in the 3 years to June 1980 whereas in 1971 there had been only 2446 requests, but by 1980 there were 19 386 requests.
(8) Is it a fact that (a) members of the present Taxation Boards of Review have recently commented on over-crowding of cases before the Boards and (b) Dr Gerber, of the No.3 Board, (i) in 1981 commented that there were over 24000 cases awaiting determination by a Board of Review and (ii) in Case PI (1981 )-82 ACT 1, 2, also commented that it appeared that Boards of Review had largely displaced the cinema as a form of popular entertainment and, since seats in the front stalls could still be purchased at pre-war prices, it is perhaps not surprising that there are queues 3 years long waiting to gain admission.
(9) Will he, as a matter of urgency, take up with the respective members of Boards of Review the question of how the appeals system could be made more efficient and tax cases could be dealt with more expeditiously.
(10) Have there been only 3 Boards of Review since 1936 despite the great increase in population and the vastly increased complexity of tax law since then; if so, in view of this unsatisfactory situation will he consider creating more Boards of Review, one for each State plus one circuit Board to service the territories and to assist where needed.
(11) Did a sub-committee of the Australian Taxation Institute in its 1978 Report recommend that additional boards be created as reported in Taxation in Australia (1978) pages 817,821.
(12) Will he, as a matter of urgency, consider appointing lawyers with experience in tax matters to preside as appeal officers or one-person tribunals to hear tax matters involving disputes of lesser sums, e.g. under $5000, as operated in the United Kingdom, to help eliminate this full backlog of cases.
(13) Will he give consideration to the proposals that (a) there be no automatic right of appeal from these tribunals with appeals only arising with the leave of either a Review Board of the Court and (b) the fee for an appeal to this tribunal be low, e.g. $10, but that appeals to the Boards of Review be increased markedly from the present sum of $2.
Mr Howard-I preface my replies to the series of questions asked by the honourable member by stating that he wrote to me on 5 July 1982 regarding the matters raised in these questions. Apparently he sent a copy of that letter to Dr P. Gerber who is a member of Taxation Board of Review No. 3 and whom the honourable member mentions several times in his questions. On 9 July 1982 Dr Gerber wrote to me and said, amongst other things:
(a) that he had made it clear in his address to the Taxation Institute of Australia that any backlog of appeals pending was in no sense attributable to a shortage of Boards of Review; and
(b) that he dissociated himself from the view that delay in getting appeals to trial would be shortened by the creation of additional Boards.

Answers to Questions

10 and II November 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 3053

I turn now to the answers to the honourable member's questions:
(I) (a) Yes.
(b) The honourable member, in his letter to me of 5 July 1982, quoted verbatim the preamble to which he refers.
(2) Yes, up to 30 June 1981. However, in the year ended 30 June 1982, the number of requests for reference to Boards of Review received in the Australian Taxation Office declined by 3,172 (or more than 16 per cent) compared with the number received in the previous year. In the year to 30 June 1982, the Taxation Office disposed of 15,236 cases without the need to refer them to the Boards of Review. At the end of that year 25,569 cases (equivalent to 0.28 per cent of returns lodged during the year) were on hand, of which 4,000 were deferred either at the request of taxpayers concerned or pending decisions in other cases. On those figures there is a backlog of about 18 months in the Taxation Office in relation to requests for reference to Boards of Review.
During the year ended 30 June 1982, the three existing Boards of Review disposed of 508 cases. At 30 June 1982 there were 768 cases awaiting hearing by the three Boards or, again, about 18 months backlog.
When announcing the Government's intention to increase the rate of penalties for late payment of tax, I said that the question of the need for additional Boards of Review is being discussed with the Commissioner of Taxation.
(3) (a) Section 185 of the Income Tax Assessment Act requires a taxpayer who lodges an objection against an assessment to state fully and in detail the grounds on which he relies.
(b) Section 190 (a) provides that upon every reference to a Board of Review or appeal to a court, the taxpayer shall be limited to the grounds stated in his objection.
It is not a fact, however, that the Taxation Office gives the taxpayer very scant information. The taxpayer has 60 days after the receipt of his assessment in which to lodge an objection. If sufficient information regarding an adjustment made by the Commissioner is not contained in the notice of assessment or the accompanying adjustment sheet, additional information will be given readily to enable an adequate objection to be lodged within time.
(4) (a) In referring a case to a Board of Review, the Commissioner is required by Income Tax Regulation 35 to furnish to the Board and the taxpayer, a statement of his reason for disallowing the taxpayer's claim.
(b) (i) The requirement of the Commissioner to supply reasons, coupled with his practice referred to in answer to Question 3, avoids any inequity and, almost without exception, results in a taxpayer being able to ascertain fully the case he has to meet. (ii) No.
(5) See answers to Questions 3 and 4 above.
(6) (a) and (b) No. Provision for amendment of grounds of objection or appeal, or provision enabling further or better particulars to be sought could obviously lead to further delays.
(7) The figures stated by the honourable member are correct.
(8) (a) No.
(b) (i) I am unaware of the comment the honourable member attributes to Dr Gerber but if it was made it was, and is, incorrect. (ii) Yes. But the remarks were made as a comment on the trivial nature of the particular case and not as a criticism of the function or operation of Boards of Review.
(9) See the answer to Question 2.

(10) No. From 1936 until 1947 there were only 2 Boards of Review. As to the creation of additional Boards, see the answer to Question 2.
(II) Yes.
(12) and (13) The suggestions made by the honourable member will be kept in mind in the consideration I have already said is being given to the need for additional Boards of Review.
Strawberries: Imports from California
(Question No, 4885)
Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 19 August 1982:
(I) Are Californian strawberries being imported into Australia at record levels, thereby threatening the collapse of the Australian industry.
(2) If so, what quantities have been imported in the past 3 calendar years and in 1982, to the date of preparation of the answer to this question.
(3) What quantities have been landed in Sydney in 1982, to the date of preparation of the answer to this question.
Mr Peacock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Official data do not record separately imports of strawberries from California. There have been some recent imports of fresh chilled unpulped strawberries from the USA however these represent a very small percentage of local market supplies. I am advised that there is no evidence that these imports constitute a threat to the Australian industry.
(2) No imports were recorded from the USA within the last three calendar years according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Imports from the USA up to the end of August 1982, the latest available official statistics, totalled approximately 22 tonnes.
(3) The imports referred to in (2) entered Sydney.
Transfer of Personnel: Department of Industry and Commerce

Private Exchange Line Telephones: Officers of Department of Home Affairs and Environment
(Question No. 5189)
Mr Robert Brown asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 23 September 1982:
(I) How many officers in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within the Minister's jurisdiction have private exchange line telephones connected in their offices.
(2) What are the designations of these officers.
(3) Do these officers also have telephones in their offices which are connected toa PABX or PMBX.
(4) What is the rationale for providing private exchange line telephones.
(5) What was the cost of (a) rental, (b) metered calls, and (c) booked trunk calls for the private exchange line telephones in 1981-82.
(6) Would a telephone with a silent extension number connected toa PABX or PMBX serve the same purpose.
Mr McVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Seventy-five.

(2) The designation of these officers are as follows: Department of Home Affairs and Environment
Secretary Director, Co-ordination Section, Environment Strategy

Director-General Assistant Director-General Director Assistant Director Repository Manager Regional Director Officer-in-Charge, Townsville Office National Library Director-General Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Chairman Executive Officer Australian Film Commission Chairman Chief Executive Secretary Assistant Secretary Director of Marketing Director of Projects Director of Creative Development Financial Controller Producer-in-Chief Executive Officer Administrative Officer Head of Production Production Manager Marketing Manager Head of Audio Visual Contracts Officer Film Promotions Officer Senior Cinematographer Producer Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service Project Co-ordinator, Kakadu National Park Australian Bicentennial Authority Chairman General Manager Australia Council Chairman Director, Art Co-ordination Director, Client Services Director, Secretariat Office of the Supervising Scientist Supervising Scientist Director First Assistant Secretary Assistant Secretary Head, Co-ordination and Services Branch Australian National Gallery Director Secretary /Manager Building Manager Australian War Memorial Director Public Relations Officer Head, Conservation.
(3) Yes.
(4) The reasons for providing private exchange linetelephones are for security, confidentiality, emergency use (e.g. fire), supplementation of equipment not capable of coping with peak loads, ensuring that senior officers have access to an outside line at all times and for use outside normal switchboard hours.
(5) (a) rental $11,648, (b) metered calls $71,603, (c) booked trunk calls $1 ,977.

(6) If the switchboard in use has an in-dialling facility, a telephone with a silent extension number connected to the switchboard would serve the same purpose as a direct line telephone for all the reasons given in (4) above except where the direct line is used to supplement inadequate switching equipment. If there is no in-dialling facility and/or the equipment cannot cope with extra lines, there is no alternative to the direct line telephone.
Bureau of Mineral Resources
(Question No. 5429)
Mr Keating asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 20 October 1982:
(I) Does the Minister from time to time obtain status reports or reviews from the Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) on exploration activity and prospects for oil and gas discoveries in Australia.
(2) What range of data is available to officers of the BMR who would prepare these reports, in the case of (a) offshore and (b) onshore areas.
(3) Is the quality and range of data available satisfactory; if not, is the Minister able to say how and when improvements will be effected.
Mr Anthony-The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) Yes in conjunction with the Oil and Gas Division of my Department.
(2) (a) BMR has access to all offshore exploration data submitted under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act and all petroleum exploration, development and production data submitted under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. (b) BMR has access to all onshore exploration data submitted under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act. BMR also has information provided by companies to assist in the preparation of assessments of petroleum resources and to support applications under the Government's crude oil pricing policy.
(3) The quality and range of data available to BMR for the offshore areas is considered to be satisfactory. For the onshore areas efforts are presently being made to improve the data available to BM R following discussions at the Australian Minerals and Energy Council meeting in Darwin on 5 August 1982. At the meeting Ministers agreed to pursue closer cooperation between BMR and the State geological surveys on the assessment of Australia's resources and, in particular, petroleum resources.
Maintenance of Army Equipment
(Question No. 5443)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 October 1982:
(I) Have funds provided for Army maintenance contracts by private contractors at Puckapunyal, Victoria been substantially reduced.
(2) If so, will this result in reductions in the ability of these firms to maintain existing employment levels.
(3) What is the reason for the lower level of maintenance requirements at Puckapunyal.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Funds allocated for private contractor repair and maintenance support of Army equipment in the Puckapunyal area

in 1982-83 reflects a small increase over the expenditure level experienced in 1981-82.
(2) There is expected to be some impact on private contractor workloads. While the allocation of funds has been increased the level of price increase applied by the major COntractor in the area significantly exceeds the level of price increase generally allowable in a Budgetary context.
(3) There is not expected to be any significant reduction in repair arisings at Puckapunyal. The real decrease in funds, caused primarily by the significant price increases applied by contractors, will necessitate some changes in repair arrangements. This will include a likely reduction in the depth of repair on individual equipments.
Planned Parenthood Federation
Mr Street-In response to Question No. 3778, asked by Dr Everingham, (Hansard, 6 May 1982, page 2482) I indicated that comment from the Federation would be sought.
The following summary information has since been received from the IPPF:
IPPF will in no circumstances tolerate any elements of compulsion in the family planning programs it supports, dnd which are run by indigenous volunteer-bared nongovernmental Family Planning Associations. In accepting funds from IPPF, these FPAs agree to abide by the constitutional requirements of the Federation to provide voluntary informed choices in the matters of pregnancy, childbirth and family size. The objective of IPPF is to make that choice possible by offering as many options in terms of methods of contraception as are considered by its International Medical Advisory Panel and the World Health Organisation to be safe, effective and acceptable. IPPF believes that the human right to seek or reject particular forms of fertility regulation and their method of delivery must be fully protected in all countries.
IPPF ceased to supply the Dalkon Shield in September 1974, shortly after the publication of the first serious reports of ill-effects (June 1974). Further action to ensure that stocks were destroyed or returned to IPPF, and that women using the Dalkon Shield should have it replaced or in the case of pregnancy, removed. followed within the next few months. Only a very small number of women worldwide had ever received the Dalkon Shield through IPPF, but maximum publicity was given by the Federation on the dangers of the Shield which was withdrawn by the manufacturers in 1974.
Depo-Provera has been approved by both the World Health Organisation and IPPF's International Medical Advisory Panel and since 1971 IPPF has responded to requests for supplies from 53 countries, in all of which the drug regulator authority or other approving body such as Ministry of Health has accepted the drug for domestic use.
IPPF selects a limited range of pills approved by IMAP usually containing 30 micrograms of oestrogen. For the limited number of women who may require a higher dose of oestrogen, pills containing up to 50 micrograms of oestrogen may be offered. (The term "high-dose oestrogen" is usually used to describe preparations containing 80 micrograms of oestrogen) .
IPPF has never supplied expired drugs. It applies the same standards to all countries, both developed and developing.
Independent Audit: Department of the Treasury

Answers to Questions

What independent audit is required by the Minister's Department to ensure the proper expenditure of funds granted to non-government organisations by the Minister or the Minister's Department.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
As the Department of the Treasury does not grant funds to non-government organisations, no independent audit is required to ensure the proper expenditure of such funds.
Grants to Non-government Organisations: Department of the Treasury
(Question No. 4797)
Mr Leo McLeay asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 August 1982:
(I) In 1981-82 what non-government organisations received grants or payments from the Minister's Department.
(2) What was the value of these grants or payments.
Mr Howard-~ The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Department of the Treasury does not make any payments of this nature to non-government organisations.
Income Tax Refund Cheques
(Question No. 4910)
Mr Maher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 August 1982:
(I) Have complaints been received that registered tax agents have been buying income tax refund cheques from clients with English language difficulties.
(2) Does the Tax Agents' Board approve of this practice.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) The practice of discounting income tax refund cheques is known to both the Commissioner of Taxation and the Tax Agents' Board in Sydney. It is understood that the practice is confined to a very small number of tax agents whose clients are drawn largely from the ethnic community.
Although the discounting of refund cheques is considered undesirable, legal advice received by the Australian Taxation Office is to the effect that it is purely a private matter between the agent and the client. However, where a Tax Agents' Board receives information that a person is carrying on discounting (or any other aspect of a tax agent's business) in such a manner as to render that person no longer a fit and proper one to be registered as a tax agent, the appropriate action would be taken. Naturally any such action could only be taken on the basis of reliable evidence received by the Tax Agents' Board.

Interest Rates
(Question No. 5345)
Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 October 1982:
Is he able to say what the average prime interest rate has been in each OECD country for each year since 1969-70.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The term 'prime lending rate' is used by banks in the United States to describe the rate of interest charged on loans to the lowest risk corporate borrowers, although in practice loans are made at rates lower than the prime lending rate. Data on a comparable basis for many OECD countries are not readily available. However, the Reserve Bank publishes information

Banks: Taxation
Mr Howard-On 27 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1852) Mr Hayden asked the Minister Representing the Acting Treasurer the following question without notice:
Has his attention been drawn to reports of a survey of the profitability of the world's top 150 banks? In particular, has he noted the fact that the survey shows that Australian banks rank first, fifth and sixth in terms of internationally comparable real profitability? Is it also a fact that the far from socialistic Thatcher Government last year imposed a super tax on bank profits when United Kingdom interest rates were well below those now prevailing in Australia? Is it also a fact that with wage and salary earners carrying an ever-increasing burden of the nation's taxation, and indeed interest rate charges, all the evidence now supports, as a matter of equity, consideration by the Government of a special tax on very profitable Australian banks?
The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The answer to the first two questions is yes. However, as is explained in the survey concerned, the figures depend importantly on the attempt to make allowance for the differing equity/assets ratios of banks by imputing a constant equity-asset ratio for all banks. I understand this adjustment to actual equity/assets ratios has the effect of boosting significantly the rate of profit calculated for the ANZ and the then Bank of New South Wales, because the adjustment imputes a lower amount of equity than those banks in fact have. The prominence of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, which had sixth place in the survey, is a reflection in part of the fact

that neither its Savings nor Development Banks pay company income tax; the survey measures profitability on an after-tax basis. More generally, of course, surveys of this nature are not able to take adequate account of a number of differences between countries in the environments in which banks operate.
In regard to the third question, I can confirm that a tax was imposed on British banks by the British Government's 1981 Budget. The tax was levied for one year only on the level of each bank's non-interest bearing deposits at a rate of 2.1 /2 per cent on deposits above a minimum level of £ 10 million.
As to the fourth question, the principal effect of imposing a special tax on banks would of course be either to push up the price banks charge for their services (chiefly by way of higher interest rates) or render it even more necessary for banks to prune their costs-in particular, their labour costs. I am suprised to see the Leader of the Opposition apparently pursuing either of those outcomes. His views will, however, be borne in mind.
Production of Parity and Non-parity Oil

Bounties: Australian Made Tractors
Mr Peacock-On 13 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1932) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following question, without notice:
I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is a fact that bounties payable on Australian made tractors were reduced earlier this year and that since that time significant unemployment has resulted in this industry? What action is the Minister planning or what action is planned by his Department in order to maintain and recover employment opportunities in Australian industries related to farm machinery which are currently in a desperate situation?
The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

3058 REPRESENTATIVES 10 and 11 November 1982

Answers to Questions

The bounties payable on agricultural tractors produced and sold in Australia were reduced on I January 1982 in accordance with a decision made in December 1976 on assistance to this industry. That decision provided for a bounty based on Australian content and power output, with the level of bounty phasing down to the level now reached.
The bounty is paid to assist the tractor sector of the agricultural equipment industry in relation to import competition. Other sectors of the industry are protected by the tariff, which has not been reduced in recent years. Loss of employment has occurred in the industry generally, not just in the area in which there has been a programmed reduction in bounty.

The causes of this employment loss vary from company to company, some of which have particular problems, but one major reason common to all is the very serious drought being experienced in so many areas.
The Government is always prepared to examine promptly any requests for a review of the assistance accorded an industry. A manufacturer of agricultural tractors has recently requested such a review and the application is being given urgent attention. The Government currently has no requests for assistance from other agricultural machinery manufacturers.
