That this House-
( 1) Notes the text of the proposed United States of America Senate Joint Resolution No. 163, viz-"Whereas the greatest challenge facing the earth is to prevent the occurrence of nuclear war by accident or design;
Whereas the nuclear arms race is dangerously increasing the risk of a holocaust which would be humanity's final war; and
Whereas a freeze followed by reductions in nuclear warheads, missiles and other delivery systems is needed to halt the nuclear arms race and to reduce the risk of nuclear war;
Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:
1. As an immediate strategic arms control objective, the United States and the Soviet Union should:
(a) pursue a complete halt to the nuclear arms race;
(b) decide when and how to achieve a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing, production and further deployment of nuclear warheads, missiles and other delivery systems; and
(c) give special attention to destabilizing weapons whose deployment would make such a freeze more difficult to achieve.
2. proceeding from this freeze, the United States and the Soviet Union should pursue major, mutual and verifiable reductions in nuclear warheads, missiles, and other delivery systems, through annual percentages or equally effective means, in a manner that enhances stability.";
(2) asserts that it concurs fully with this proposed resolution, and
(3) calls on the Government to transmit the concurrence of this House to President Reagan, as a matter of urgency.

QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE
VIETNAM WAR: AUSTRALIAN ARMY RECORDS
Mr MOUNTFORD-My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is it a fact that a large number of Army records relating to Australian Army involvement in the Vietnam War have been discovered at the Australian War Memorial? When were these files discovered and under what circumstances? How many officers of his Department are engaged in the process of checking the contents of these files? Who is in charge of this operation? How are these records being catalogued or recorded to ensure that no relevant information is lost or destroyed? Does the discovery of this information indicate that the answer provided by the Minister on 18 September 1980, wherein he indicated to the House that he had

2328 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Questions Without Notice

checked the records of his Department, was based on incomplete records and information? Will the Minister now undertake to make a full statement to the House based on all available information indicating accurately the extent of Australian troops' involvement in the use of and their exposure to toxic chemicals and the briefing received by the present Prime Minister as the relevant Minister between 1966 and 1971 ?
Mr KILLEN-The honourable gentleman has asked a very detailed question. I trust in his charity he will forgive me if I do not reply now to all of the matters that he has raised. I give him the clear assurance that I will, at the earliest possible time, respond to the detailed question. But may I invite the honourable gentleman also to reflect on an answer I gave in this House on this very subject wherein I said to the effect-do not hold me precisely to the language-that any further information that may be available will be provided and that further records were being examined. I notice one commentator of this parliamentary scene said that all records had been examined. He put it in the past tense. I invite the honourable gentleman to concur with me. I have never put my comments on this sensitive issue in the past tense. I have said 'any further records that may become available'.
I do not accept the honourable gentleman's use of the word 'discovery', because it was known as a fact that further records were there to be examined. Some 21,000 files are in the process of being examined. There are no short cuts to examining those files. It has been a very painstaking process; it continues to be. Up until a short time ago the process of examination had been continuing throughout the night and throughout weekends. I am not in a position to say when it will be completed. I cannot say who is in charge of it. But I would like to give the honourable gentleman and the House this assurance: Whatever information can be extrapolated from those files will be placed before the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which is inquiring into this matter and before any other body charged with proper responsibility in considering this issue. As soon as Question Time is over, I shall attend to the other detailed questions to which my honourable friend has referred and see whether I can provide information to him this day.
BICENTENNIAL CEI,EBRATIONS
Mr BIRNEY-As I am a direct descendant of Anthony Rope and Elizabeth Pulley, two members of the First Fleet, which arrived in Australia in 1788, I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Australian Bicentennial

Authority has decided yet on any major events for our bicentenary in 1988 and, if so, will the Minister provide details? What opportunities will Australians, especially young Australians, have to make suggestions and provide ideas on how the nation should celebrate this great national anniversary?
Mr WILSON-Before I tackle this question I want to acknowledge the interest of the honourable member for Phillip in the bicentenary celebrations. That interest is made especially noteworthy because of the fact that he has drawn to our attention that he is a direct descendant of two people who came to this country in the First Fleet. I understand that the honourable member is probably the first member of this Parliament who is a direct descendant of people who came to Sydney in the First Fleet.
In response to the honourable member's particular questions, I draw his attention to the answer that I gave last week to the honourable member for Braddon, in which I drew the attention of the House to the fact that the Australian Bicentennial Authority has been asked to draw up a program of events of national and international significance and to provide that to the Government in the second half of this year. In addition, of course, the Authority is acting as the catalyst and co-ordinator for the development of State and local programs. There are many who have origins in particular waves of migration to Australia. They are looking to their past history and using the bicentenary as a focus upon which they can have some celebration, some development of their history, so that we can have a better understanding of the way in which the waves of migration have come to this country.
As regards the involvement of the community at large, particularly young people, let me say that the Australian Bicentennial Authority has, over a long period, been consulting throughout the community and, as recently as the first weekend in April, it advertised yet again seeking submissions from community groups, young people, and governments and organisations, and suggestions as to the ways in which we might celebrate this most significant event in Australia's history.
VIETNAM: DEFOLIANTS
Mr HOLDING-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the fact that in April 1980 the Prime Minister had about 20 staff members of the Australian Archives make an urgent search of his personal papers for references to the use of herbicides in Vietnam, why has it taken the Prime Minister over 12 months to answer Question No. 1972 on the Notice Paper,

Questions Without Notice

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2329

which sought details of all briefings that he received between 1966 and 1971 as Minister for both the Army and Defence? Having regard to the discovery of new files at the Australian War Memorial, does the Prime Minister want to claim a further extension of time to prepare his defence? Now that Vietnam veterans have learnt that, in over two years of questioning related to their exposure to defoliants in Vietnam, most of the answers provided were based on incomplete records--

AUSTRALIA DAY
Mr BRAITHWAITE-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will realise that the Jaycees organisation in Australia has embarked on a program called 'Pride in our Nation'. In keeping with that program it has called for Australia Day to be celebrated on 26 January and the public holiday to be observed on that day. Will the Government agree to future Australia Days being observed on 26 January and declare that day a public holiday?

Mr SPEAKER-Will the honourable gentleman ask for information and cease giving it?
Mr HOLDING-Will the Prime Minister now accede to the veterans' request for a judicial inquiry, or is his opposition to such an inquiry based on his personal knowledge and responsibility as the relevant Minister between 1966 and 1971 and his concern that any properly based inquiry would indicate the extent of his own personal culpability?
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The examination of the archives and any papers that I might have had when I was Minister for Defence was to see whether there was any material there that ought to be made available to the Department of Defence in its examination of the matter, and any papers that came out of those files were handed over to the Department of Defence. They were searched out of the archives files for that purpose. I believed that the Department of Defence would have had whatever papers were there anyway, but I did want to make sure what had passed over my desk.
The Government has responded in ways that are known in relation to the Vietnam veterans and a great deal has been done to assist. There has been very close co-operation with the Returned Services League in all the measures that have been introduced by the Minister concerned. I think the honourable gentleman would well know that the level of concern that is felt now by honourable members on, I believe, both sides of this House is quite different from that which might have been present in the early 1970s or even quite different from that which might have been felt between 1972 and 1975 when all the information and all the material were obviously available to the government of the day. I would like to think that if the kinds of concern that have been expressed over the last few years had been present between 1972 and 1975 the government of that day might have done some of the things that we have done subsequently to assist.

Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The official day for Australia Day, as the honourable member rightly reminds the House, is 26 January but it has become the practice in the States, by agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, that the actual holiday be on the Monday closest to Australia Day. Many activities over that long weekend have been organised in a traditional way and many communities have become used to having a long weekend which in a sense would be interrupted if Australia Day were celebrated always on the 26th. Despite that, I have considerable sympathy with the sentiments inherent in the honourable member's question. Some time ago I took steps to make sure that this matter would be discussed with the States. I will see that it is raised at the next Premiers Conference because I think there would be considerable merit in having Australia Day celebrated on the 26th on every occasion and not just occasionally. But to do that sensibly we would need the agreement of the States. I will see whether that is forthcoming when we meet in June.
1977 BUDGET
Mr KEATING-My question is directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When did the Prime Minister prevail upon the Minister, as Treasurer in 1977, to accept certain revenue assumptions for the 1977 Budget which the Minister knew to be false and which were out of line with the Department of the Treasury's assumption for revenue? Was it those Prime Ministerial assumptions which led the Minister to describe the revenue figures as rubbery when questioned on the subject at the National Press Club the day following the presentation of the Budget? Is it a fact that the 1977 Budget was a falsified Budget designed to offer tax cuts for an election on the basis of funds that the Government knew could not eventuate and that it is this fact that led to the tax cuts being removed five months after they were given? Finally, will the Minister table the original Treasury Budget assumption document for 1977, which he must have in his possession?

Sir PHILLIP LYNCH-Really, the honourable gentleman is seeking to scrape the bottom of the barrel in raising a question of this type. The decisions taken at that time were, of course, taken by the Government and there is no suggestion of any falsity in relation to figures announced by the Government in that Budget at that time.
Mr Keating-I raise a point of order. There was a specific element of the question which asked the Minister to table the original Treasury assumption document-a Budget document.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman asked his question. He is not entitled to demand an answer.
Mr Keating-Are you prepared to table the document? You are not, because you know what it will show.
ORD RIVER AREA: SUGAR CANE PLANTINGS
Mr MOORE-The Minister for Primary Industry will be aware of trial plantings of sugar cane in the Ord River area. As a result of those plantings, I ask him: Is the available land in that area sufficient to supply a suitable commercial mill operation also in that area and, if so, given the state of sugar prices, both international and domestic, would such an operation be feasible without sizable government support?
Mr NIXON-I can only assume that the honourable member has not seen a report that the Western Australian Government has prepared in respect of the prospects of growing sugar in the Ord River area. That Government believes from its studies that the area of land is large enough for a viable sugar industry and obviously that a sugar mill should be part of that program. The world sugar prices have certainly declined seriously and no doubt the Western Australian Government is considering that in all its studies in relation to the prospect of a sugar industry being in the area.
One of the interesting aspects of the prospective development of the Ord River area has been the discussions between the Queensland and Western Australian Premiers and some close studies by the two departments responsible for agriculture on the prospect of developing the sugar industry in the Ord River area. I think it essential, having regard to the volatility of the industry and the way in which the world price can fluctuate, that any extension of sugar growing, whether it be in Queensland or in the Ord River area, be co-ordinated by the total sugar industry. I think it would be fatal for the Western Australians to pursue the growing of sugar on their

own without careful integration with the Queensland industry. The honourable member will be pleased to know that those talks are still progressing and I hope there will be a satisfactory outcome.
INCOME TAX CUTS
Mr KEATING-I ask the Prime Minister whether in 1977 he prevailed upon the right honourable member for Flinders, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then the Treasurer, to accept certain revenue assumptions as the basis of the 1977 Budget so that the Government could offer tax cuts at an election? Did the right honourable member for Flinders object to this approach, preferring to stand by the Treasury assumptions? Did the Prime Minister arrange for the Budget Cabinet to be addressed by Mr Carmody, the then head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and by his own appointee, Mr Besley-one of his favourites-the Secretary of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, and not Treasury officers, to sell the Cabinet a Budget based upon revenue assumptions he knew to be wrong? Is it not a fact that the tax cuts given in February 1978 were removed in July, when the Budget deficit blew out, as the Prime Minister knew it would? Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to the House that the 1982 Budget will be based on actual estimates from the Government's advisers-that is, Treasury advisers-and not on the basis of tax cuts promised in the Party room and granted on the basis of phoney Budget figures?
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Whatever is done by Budget Cabinet is done by Budget Cabinet as a whole and is a Cabinet decision. If all that the Australian Labor Party--
Opposition members interjecting-
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The question was asked in silence and the answer should be heard in silence. I call the Prime Minister.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-If all that the members of the Australian Labor Party can do is to try to talk about things that might have happened five years ago--
Opposition members interjecting-
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I indicate to the House that, if that noise level continues, I will suggest to the Prime Minister that he ask that all further questions be put on the Notice Paper. I call the Prime Minister.

Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Let me repeat that decisions taken in relation to Budgets are taken by the Cabinet as a whole, and that is it. There will not be any discussion of those Cabinet processes in this House. If all that the members of the Australian Labor Party can do is to try to dredge up questions about events that might have occurred, or not occurred, five years ago, very plainly they will stay where they are.
Mr Keating-Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I asked the Prime Minister to give an undertaking to the House about the 1982 Budget.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Keating-We know this is true.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Keating-Look at the guilty men on the other side. They are all guilty.
Mr SPEAKER-I name the honourable member for Blaxland. I have named the honourable member for Blaxland for refusing to sit down when I called upon him to do so.
Mr Keating-You would name me to protect this stinking, corrupt Government. It falsified the Budget document.
Motion (by Mr Sinclair) put:
That the honourable member for BlaJ>land be suspended from the service of the House.
The House divided.
The bells being rung-
Mr Keating-This place is being run like a banana republic.
Mr SPEAKER-That is not so. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Keating-You know that charge to be true. You know the Prime Minister falsified the 1977 Budget; you know the then Treasurer accepted that falsification.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Keating-You know they are guilty of falsification in regard to the 1977 Budget. You know the Prime Minister will stop at nothing. You know what he did to two Ministers over a television set, yet he falsified a Budget of the Commonwealth. You know these things to be true and yet you penalise me because, Mr Speaker, you are biased.
Mr Sinclair-The honourable member for Blaxland is using the microphone, making false statements. I suggest that he be asked to sit down.

Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for Blaxland should resume his seat.
Mr Keating-You have exercised your authority over me. You will not have that authority while you protect this corrupt Government.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman knows that what he is saying is a travesty of the Parliament.
Mr Keating-Look at him. Look at the guilty men of his Government. And you penalise me when you know damn well you should not have done so.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Keating-Out of respect for the House I will resume my seat, but let the guilty men protect themselves by this device.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman is taking an advantage that he knows he should not have. Lock the doors.
Dr Klugman-Mr Speaker, on a point of order--
Mr SPEAKER-The question is: That the honourable member for Blaxland be suspended from the service of the House'.
Dr Klugman-Mr Speaker, a point of order.
Mr SPEAKER-The ayes will pass to the right of the Chair, the noes to the left. I appoint the honourable members for Petrie and Mallee tellers for the ayes; I appoint the honourable members for Griffith and Hughes tellers for the noes.
Mr Les Johnson-Mr Speaker, I refuse to respond to your call because you declined to listen to points of order. Otherwise, I will not dignify these reprehensible arrangements.
Mr SPEAKER-Under the Standing Orders I declare that the question is resolved in favour of the ayes. The honourable member for Blaxland is suspended from the service of the House.
Mr Keating-I will leave the House out of respect to it but I have no respect for you or the Prime Minister or the crooked Government behind him.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will remove himself from the House.
The honourable member for Blaxland thereupon withdrewfrom the chamber.
Mr SPEAKER-Does the honourable member for Prospect wish to raise a point of order?
Dr Klugman-The only point I was wishing to make is that the microphones do not appear to be

turned on and we could not hear what was going on in the exchange in front of us.
Mr SPEAKER-That was because of the noise level, I think. I call the honourable member for Dundas.
OVERSEAS QUALIFICATIONS OF MIGRANTS
Mr RUDDOCK-The Minister for Industrial Relations will be aware of the many complaints that members receive from intending migrants and their families and relatives in Australia about the apparent inadequate recognition of professional and trade qualifications. Can he inform the House whether it is the Government's intention to improve the arrangements for migrants and others to have their trade qualifications recognised, particularly in the metal and electrical trades in Australia, and for Australian authorities to obtain and maintain knowledge of overseas qualifications standards?
Mr VINER-I thank the honourable gentleman for his question because it gives me an opportunity to advise the House of some of the work that has been done by a tripartite body comprising employers, unions and government. That work has proceeded over many years but is so often not known-and is certainly not heralded. In addition to answering the specific questions posed by the honourable gentleman, I will take the opportunity to provide the House with certain information. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act provides that persons who have gained trade qualifications overseas, adult trained ex-service personnel and others may have those qualifications recognised. The legislation has operated since 1946 and I think the House would be interested to hear some of the figures which reflect the volume of work that has been undertaken under it over that period. Since 1946 almost a quarter of a million applications have been considered and some 150,000 tradesmen's certificates have been issued. Approximately two-thirds of these have been issued to migrants. That works out at some 7,000 applications per annum.
The committees have to work on the basis of the known system of trade qualifications in other countries; so periodically over the years there have been missions comprising employers and employee representatives. I am pleased to advise the House that the next mission will be in October and November of this year to five European countries. When honourable members consider that much of the migration program that has been announced by my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is based on bringing to Australia skilled migrants, they will appreciate

the importance of a mission of this kind which is going to Europe in October and November.
Also, I would like particularly to pay tribute to the work of the people on these committees, some of whom have served for many years. I mention especially Mr George Walmsly, M.B.E., an employer representative who has worked on the committee for 35 years. I would expect, Mr Speaker--
Mr Robert Brown-Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order. Obviously, the Minister is making a statement. Such a statement should be open to debate in this Parliament. We have put up with far too much nonsense from him and his colleagues.
Mr SPEAKER-There is no point of order. However, the Minister should wind up his reply.
Mr VINER-I would have thought that the Opposition would have been prepared to hear me mention the name of a highly respected unionist.
Mr Hayden-Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order. It is obvious that, for the proper conduct of Question Time this morning, the Standing Orders ought to be applied rigidly. There has been too much of this unctuous humbug, which could more properly be part of a statement, if that is what the Minister requires.
Mr SPEAKER-There is no point of order. The Minister will conclude his answer.
Mr VINER-Mr Speaker, I wanted to mention the services of Mr Terry Addison, of the Australasian Society of Engineers, who is the employees' representative on the Central Trades Committee and who has worked on the Committee for more than 15 years. It is important that the House pay tribute to the work of people on such committees.
Mr Scott-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask that the Minister table the document from which he was reading, as required under the Standing Orders.
Mr SPEAKER-Was the Minister reading from a document?
Mr VINER-I am quite happy to table the document and, indeed, to have it incorporated in Hansard.
Mr SPEAKER-Is that a request?
Mr VINER-Yes.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows-
A. Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act provides for persons with overseas trade qualifications, adult trained ex-service personnel and others to have their qualification recognised.

HMS 'INVINCIBLE'
Dr KLUGMAN-Has the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services been drawn to a publication called 'Information' produced by the Government Information Unit and distributed to members yesterday, which justifies the purchase of HMS Invincible? Speaking of the possibility that a single missile could knock out a ship, it states:
Certainly they pose a threat but measures are available to counter both the patrol boat and the modern guided missiles. The probability of hitting ships in a task group is relatively low.
In view of what has happened to HMS Sheffield, could a revised edition be printed?
M;r NEWMAN-I think a question which seeks to make humour out of what is happening in the South Atlantic is not worthy of an answer.

COMMONWEALTH GAMES

Mr DEAN-Some people really sink low.

Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for

Herbert will ask his question or I will require him

to sit down.

.

Mr DEAN-I ask the Prime Minister whether he has any information on the outcome of the meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation which was held in London and on the prospects of avoiding any wide-scale boycott.

Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Cables came in overnight concerning the meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation. I am sure that everyone in this House and everyone right throughout the whole community will be delighted that any thought of a boycott has been removed. There has been a most productive and useful meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation in London. I wish to pay tribute to the

Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Games Federation, Sonny Ramphal. I believe that Australia and the Commonwealth Games had many friends working in their interests at that meeting. I thank them all-no matter from which countries they might have come-for making sure that there was a successful outcome. Whilst the Commonwealth Games do not belong to Australia-they belong to the whole Commonwealth; all Commonwealth countries are interested in them-Australia has a special interest in these Games because they are being held within Australia. I believe we must all be delighted that these Games are being held. I hope that all members of the Commonwealth will feel free to attend and will want to attend. I believe they will enjoy their period in Australia. I have received a communique-it is an unclassified cable-in relation to this matter. I thought it might be appropriate on this occasion for the cable to be incorporated in Hansard so that there can be a permanent record of the decision of this special meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation.
Leave granted.
The communique read as follows-

COMMONWEALTH GAMES
Summary:
The extraordinary meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation on 5 May was a success. The meeting agreed to full participation by Commonwealth Games Associations in the Brisbane Games. A statement of the Meeting, agreed upon by consensus, reaffirmed the commitment of CGA's to the Gleneagles agreement of 1977, unanimously condemned all sporting contacts with South Africa which had taken place contrary to the expectations of the Gleneagles agreement (and in particular the Springbok Tour to New Zealand in 1981), pledged sporting authorities to pursuing all practical measures to fulfil the objectives of Gleneagles, and directed that provisions be drafted for consideration by the general assembly of the Games Federation in Brisbane designed to empower the Federation in future to suspend any association 'by due process for good cause arising from gross non-fulfilment' by any country of the objectives of the Gleneagles agreement. (Unclassified)
2. Following is the text of the statement issued at the conclusion of the CGF meeting 5 May.
Begins:
A special general assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation at Marlborough House, London, on 5 May 1982, reviewed preparations for and developments affecting the forthcoming Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia. Representatives at the meeting unanimously reaffirmed the support of their Commonwealth Games Associations for the Gleneagles agreement of 1977. They acknowledged that the full realisation of its objectives involves the understanding, support and active participation of national sporting organisations, authorities and sportsmen. Pledging their own understanding, support and active participation, they proclaimed their collective and individual determination to uphold the principles, fulfil the obligations and advance the objectives of

2334 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Questions Without Notice

the agreement as part of the international campaign against apartheid.
The meeting unanimously condemned all sporting contacts with South Africa which had taken place contrary to the expectations of the Gleneagles agreement. In particular, it unanimously condemned the tour of New Zealand in 1981 by the Springbok Rugby Team of South Africa and. noted with satisfaction the strong and prompt reaction of Commonwealth Governments in demonstrating their disapproval of the Tour. In this context representatives also recognised the opportunity later provided by the meeting of Heads of Government in Melbourne in October 1981 for a further expression of the Commonwealth's disapproval of the tour and they welcomed the fact that after face to face discussion at the highest level Commonwealth Heads of Government reaffirmed the Gleneagles agreement and reiterated their commitment to fulfilling ~ffectively the obligations arising under it.
Representatives recognised that there was need for continuous vigilance and a firm adherence to principle on the part of sporting authorities if these objectives were to be fulfilled and they committed their associations to pursuing all practical measures to this end.
In the specific context of the Commonwealth Games and with a view to ensuring that their future was not impaired by the actions of individual countries through their sporting authorities or otherwise, the meeting decided that the constitution of the Commonwealth Games should be amended to facilitate pursuance of the objectives of the Gleneagles agreement. It decided that there should be a thorough review of the constitution, and that this should include incorporation of a Code of conduct and provision for the convening of special general assemblies. It directed that provisions be drafted for consideration of the general assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation at Brisbane in September 1982 designed to empower the Federation by due process and for good cause arising from gross non-fulfilment by any country of the objectives of the Gleneagles agreement to suspend the right to participate in future Commonwealth Games of that country's constitutent association.
In conclusion, representatives, reassured and strengthened by their consultations and by the many notable contributions of Australia, looked forward to the full participation in success of the forthcoming Commonwealth Games at Brisbane and to their meeting together again in September.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The only other point I would make is that no credit can be given to anyone-no matter from where they might have come-who has sought to use any events to suggest that all people should not be welcome at the Games.
NUGAN HAND GROUP
Mr HAYDEN-I ask a question of the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer to questions which I asked him on 22 April concerning the consequences that followed the giving of evidence about Nugan Hand to the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking by a person who was formerly an Army investigator. Is the Minister aware that this investigator compiled two detailed reports early in 1971, the first dealing with illegal activities in Asian countries by members of the Australian armed services and the second dealing with illegal activities by Nugan, Hand, their associates

and other persons who are prominent in public life? Is he aware that the second report dealt with the illegal traffic of arms, the movement of illegal drugs between Australia and Asian countries and serious breaches of the laws governing the movement of currency in and out of Australia? Is the Minister aware that copies of these reports were handed to t1:le Minister for Defence at the time, that is, the present Prime Minister; the then Minister for the Army, the present honourable member for Kooyong; the then Secretary to the Department of Army, Mr Bruce White; the then Chief of the General Staff, General Daly; the Department of Foreign Affairs; and other interested parties? Is he also aware of reports that all copies of the first report are now missing? Can the Minister tell the House what action was taken by the authorities following receipt of both these reports? Finally, can the Minister say whether the reports are correct that the first report is now missing from the files or that complete copies of both reports have been handed on to the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force or the royal commissioner?
Mr NEWMAN-I am aware that the gentleman concerned did make one report. The advice that I have received is that that report did not contain any of the subjects to which the Leader of the Opposition alluded-for example, the involvement of Nugan Hand with the Central Intelligence Agency, et cetera. I will have to check further to see whether there is a second report. The advice I have received is that only one report has been made and it did not include any of the subjects which the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned. The only other thing I can say to him is that if the gentleman still has those reports then he has a clear course of action available to him. He can give them immediately to the joint investigating team of New South Wales and Federal policemen. He can give them to the Stewart Royal Commission for evaluation, if he wishes. If he has those reports, I urge him-I am sure this is endorsed by everybody in the Government-to do it immediately without any loss of time.
TELECOM AUSTRALIA: CLOSURE OF MANUAL ASSISTANCE CENTRES
Mr MacKENZIE-I ask the Minister for Communications a question about the possible closure of manual assistance centres and telephone exchanges. I imagine he has received a number of complaints on this matter. Is he aware that in some of those centres, such as Lithgow, in my electorate, and Muswellbrook, rapid development is occurring, particularly in the resource industries, and that therefore there are additional

Questions Without Notice

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2335

hazards associated with coal mining and construction activities? Furthermore, is he aware that Telecom Australia's performance report of last year indicated that some centres have a very high failure rate with subscriber trunk dialling calls? For example, in Orange the failure rate is nearly 60 per cent after 9 p.m. Will the Minister bring these matters to the notice of Telecom's management with a view to re-examining the manual assistance centres that are to be closed?
Mr SINCLAIR-As I explained to the House last week, quite a number of representations have been made by the Australian Telephone and Phonogram Officers Association and by different community groups in a number of towns affected by Telecom proposals, that are now in draft form to modify the present manual assistance arrangements throughout Australia. These have generated quite strong emotions and feelings and it is understandable that the degree to which changes will in any way prejudice service available to the Australian community needs to be considered very carefully. It was for that reason that the Government asked Telecom to ensure that, before any final deFisions are made about any of the centres being closed, the matters are referred back to the Government. I will pass the honourable gentleman's request in that respect to the Telecom authorities and ask that they take account of the generality of his question.
In respect of the particular area, it is true that in some districts there have perhaps been more problems than in others because of the nature of the terrain, the dispersion of the population and the fact that, if there are accidents or other instances which involve people unfamiliar with the surrounds, the local knowledge of those manual assistance centres can be of very real community benefit. Certainly that is a real factor which the Government believes needs to be taken into account by Telecom when it takes decisions on this matter. They are matters which the Government will also be considering when Telecom's submission is made to it.
NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY Mr WEST-Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the report of the National Energy Advisory Committee entitled 'Nuclear Power in Australia: Regulation and Control' which was issued late yesterday? Does the report push the need for uniform legislation in Australia to license and regulate any future nuclear power generation industry? Does it also suggest that nuclear power is an energy option for South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, whilst giving no evidence to

support the need for such a nuclear power industry? Will the Prime Minister now make it perfectly plain to the National Energy Advisory Committee and those States that, due to enduring industry problems, such as the inability to dispose of nuclear waste, the high capital cost of plant, the increasing incidence of nuclear accidents and malfunctions; due to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a highly unstable world situation; and because of our large coal and gas reserves, nuclear power is not being considered by him and his Government as a serious option for the future in this country? Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I understand that discussions are now proceeding with the States concerning the need for uniform codes. I will. see what information I can give to the honourable gentleman. There is no proposal before the Commonwealth that I am aware of. There was an earlier Western Australian proposal for a possible nuclear power station by 1990 or 1995. I will see what other information there is that can be given to the honourable gentleman.
MITSUBISHI MOTORS AUSTRALIA LTD Mr CHAPMAN-My question is directed to
the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Has the Minister seen recent Press reports about plans by Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd to export to the United Kingdom motor vehicles manufactured at its Adelaide plants and about complaints that Mitsubishi Australia is thereby circumventing United Kingdom-Japan car import restraint arrangements? Do these plans rather demonstrate that the Australian motor vehicle industry can be internationally competitive? What initiatives is Mitsubishi undertaking to ensure this competitiveness? Which policies of the Federal Government and the South Australian Government are contributing to this competitiveness?
Sir PHILLIP LYNCH-I have seen the reports to which the honourable gentleman has referred, which indicate that some sections of the motor vehicle industry in the United Kingdom are concerned about a proposal whereby Australian passenger cars would be exported to that market. As I understand it, the complaints have been that that would circumvent the agreement between the Japanese and United Kingdom industries on the level of Japanese car exports to that country. The vehicles to be exported are Sigma vehicles produced by Mitsubishi at its manufacturing plant in Adelaide. They will contain very high levels of Australian content. Clearly it is very good news for the automotive industry in Australia as it is in particular for the development of the automotive industry in South Australia. It

2336 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Questions Without Notice

would be absurd to suggest that such cars would not be of Australian origin, just as I am sure that Honda designs being manufactured in Great Britain by British Leyland are regarded as being of United Kingdom origin. I might say generally that, under the former Chrysler management, cars were exported to the United Kingdom from time to time, just as presently Ford LTDs are being exported to the United Kingdom, and Australia has successfully marketed cars in the West Indies, Papua New Guinea and also New Zealand.
The honourable gentleman queries with me whether this'is an indication of the extent to which Australia can be internationally competitive in what is a very competitive international industry. Of course the extent to which Mitsubishi is successful in the United Kingdom market gives a clear indication that we have a capacity so long as we can contain the significant cost pressures which are emerging at the present time. Aside from the Mitsubishi program of export of completed vehicles to the United Kingdom, I can say to the House that the company is continuing to examine export possibilities for a wide variety of products which include castings, engines, engine components and CKD packs. Of course it derives from the Government's export complementation program, which is significantly supported by the South Australian Government, and I recognise the co-operation which has taken place with that Government. In summary, the program is good news for the automotive industry in Australia. I think it is very good news for South Australia in particular. It indicates that Mitsubishi, along with other companies, is seeking to use the incentive provided by the export complementation program to make companies and industries more competitive; and, of course, that is in the best interests of Australia.
PRIVATE MEMBERS BILL
Mr HAYDEN-I ask a question of the honourable member for Lilley. In passing I observe the significance of the occasion. It would be more than three decades at least since a question has been asked of a female member of this House. I ask the honourable member whether she has completed the drafting of the Bill for an Act to amend the Telecommunications Act 1975 which is listed in her name for presentation on General Business Thursday No. II?
Mrs DARLING-I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have to inform him that, although the major portion of the Bill to which he refers has been completed, owing to a number of representations from individuals and

organisations in the community the final completion has been delayed. I originally intended introducing into this House a private members Bill which embodied consumer protective legislation regulating the hours during which people undertaking direct selling were able to contact by the phone unsolicited consumers with a view to selling goods and services. I did this because of the great number of queries I have had.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member is not entitled to give the reasons why she was going to do it. Under the Standing Orders she can inform the House only of what she was going to do.
Mrs DARLING-I am answering the question, Mr Speaker. I believe--
Honourable members interjecting-
Mr SPEAKER-The House will come to order. Under the Standing Orders the honourable member can give answers concerning the procedures in relation to the Bill. I have permitted her to explain about the drafting but she is now going on to explain why she was going to include it and that is part of the argument in favour of the Bill. She is not entitled to do that under the StandingOrders.
Mr Scholes-I take a point of order. The Standing Orders provide for conditions under which questions can be asked of members or Ministers. They provide that the answers must be relevant to the question. That is an application which has consistently been put in this House by you and other members against consistent objections from Oppositions of all political colours.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member is correct in what he says, but it is irrelevant to this issue.
Mrs DARLING-I will continue. Mr Speaker, I have certainly taken note of the manner in which you ruled and the manner in which members of the Government answer questions which are put to them. I will be as relevant as, and I believe more relevant than, they are. In answering the question as to why the drafting is not at this stage complete, I would say that it has been held up because of representations from people who have been harassed by phone calls up to 10 o'clock at night, seven days a week. However, after taking note of this in the first draft I have had liaison with a number of bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, Telecom Australia officers, consumer affairs bureaus, small businessmen and women and a wider range of consumers across Australia. As a result, this has necessitated my widening the scope of the original Bill to provide adequate protection for people who consider

General

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2337

that their privacy is being grossly invaded, while meeting the needs of small businessmen and women engaging in legitimate and solicited business calls. Provision will also be made in this draft for consumers who indicate that they wish to receive no such calls. I am therefore confident that these needs have been met. I am pleased to be able to assure the Leader of the Opposition that my private members Bill, in final form and incorporating all these provisions, will be completed within the week.
Opposition members-Hear, hear!
PENSIONS: TAXATION
Mr McLEAN-My question, which I direct to the Treasurer, relates to a question asked by the honourable member for Hunter on 4 May which the Treasurer did not fully answer. Is the Treasurer aware that, with no change in the minimum tax threshold, each indexed increase in pensions leads to a situation where an increasing number of pensioners on successively smaller private incomes are progressively being required to meet increasing taxation obligations? Is it a fact that with the latest pension increase pensioners with an additional income of less than only $7 a week will have to meet tax liabilities in the next financial year? Is it a fact that the increasingly tight income test caused by no adjustment for 10 years to allowable income levels for pensioners combined with this taxation factor means that pensioners with some small private income are now entitled to less official support in real terms than was previously deemed desirable by government? Is the Government aware of these problems and can the Treasurer assure the House that they will be given consideration in the drafting of the 1982 Budget?
Mr HOWARD-I can assure my colleague that the Government is aware. We are very conscious of the total amount of pension and nonpension income which is needed to go over the tax-free threshold of just under $4,200. I know that the honourable member will understand that I am unable to speculate as to what might be in the forthcoming Budget. I can only assure him that amongst the many things the Government will consider will be what the honourable member has put in his question, because we are extremely conscious of the impact of taxation upon those people in the community who rely upon the pension and a small return from what they have invested out of their life savings.

1982 PARLIAMENTARY YEAR: FOURTEENTH ANNUAL SERVICE OF
WORSHIP
Mr CHAPMAN (Kingston) (11.57)-On Tuesday 16 February 1982 the Fourteenth Annual Service of Worship to commence the parliamentary year was held at St Paul's Church in Manuka, and a transcript of that church service was made by the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. With the leave of the House, Mr Speaker, I seek leave to have that transcript incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows-
THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
FOURTEENTH ANNUAL SERVICE OF WORSHIP
TO MARK THE OPENING OF THE 1982 PARLIAMENTARY YEAR
Held on
Tuesday, 16 February 1982
at
St. Paul's Church, Manuka
at 9.00 a.m.
This service was arranged by the President and Executive of the Federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship.
The congregation stood as His Excellency the Governor General and the officiating clergy entered the church and remained standing for the first six bars of "God Save The Queen n. The congregation was then seated.
Hon. Evan ADERMANN, M.P., President, Federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship-Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is my very great pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the Federal Parliamentary Christian Association to this, our Fourteenth Annual Church Service, marking the beginning of the Parliamentary Year. It is an important and integral part of our Parliamentary calendar.
We express our thanks to the fraternity of Ministers in Canberra for their assistance in arranging this service, and to the clergy and congregation of St. Paul's Church for providing this beautifully appropriate church for our service.
We welcome with very great pleasure Their Excellencies, Sir Zelman Cowen, Governor-General and Lady Cowen and express our appreciation again to Sir Zelman for his participation in the service. We welcome the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister and Mrs Fraser, the Right Honourable the Deputy Prime Minister and Mrs Anthony, the President of the Senate and the representative of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, representatives of Her Majesty's Opposition, members of the Diplomatic Corps, Ministers of the Crown, Members of both Houses of the Parliament. We welcome too members of the public service,

members from the staff of the Parliamentary Departments, of Ministers and Members, many members of the clergy and the friends who have joined us today. We especially thank Archbishop Little for consenting to bring the Address.
The Fellowship considers it is of great importance that in this special manner we commence the Parliamentary Year acknowledging the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and seeking His guidance and mediation on the course of our beloved nation, and His blessing upon our deliberations in the Parliament.
The Scriptures enunciate that righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people. Believing this and observing that history has often illustrated the precise truth of that Scriptural injunction, the Fellowship places much importance on this Annual Church Service in which we commit the new year and our direction and our deliberations to God.
Thank you, indeed, for joining with us for worship. We bid you welcome.
Hymn 93 (Australian Hymn Book)
God is love, let heaven adore him; God is love, let earth rejoice; let creation sing before him, and exalt him with one voice. He who laid the earth's foundation, he who spreads the heavens above, he who breathes through all creation, he is love, eternal Love.
God is love, and he, enfolding all the world in one embrace, with unfailing grasp is holding every child of every race. And when human hearts are breaking under sorrow's iron rod, then they find that selfsame aching deep within the heart of God.
God is love, and, though with blindness sin afflicts our human hearts, God's eternal loving kindness holding, guiding, grace imparts. Sin and death and hell shall never o'er us final triumph gain; God is love, so love for ever o'er the universe must reign.
Prayers of Invocation and Confession.
Archdeacon J. FALKINGHAM-We have thought on your steadfast love, 0 Lord, in the midst of your temple. As your name, 0 Lord, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
Open our lips, 0 Lord;
PEOPLE-And we will declare your praise.
ALL-Glory to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; as in the beginning, so now and forever. Amen.
Archdeacon J. FALKINGHAM-In penitence and faith let us confess our sins to Almighty God.
PEOPLE-Most holy and merciful Father, we acknowledge and confess the sinfulness of our nature and our shortcomings and offences against you. You alone know often we have sinned,
in wandering from your ways, in wasting your gifts and in forgetting your love.
We pray that you will forgive our sins. Teach us to understand our errors and cleanse us from our secret faults; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Archdeacon J. FALKINGHAM-May Almighty God, who freely pardons all who represent and turn to Him, absolve us from all our sins and deliver us from all evil; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
GOVERNOR-GENERAL (Sir Zelman Cowen)-The First Reading is taken from the Book of Deuteronomy, Chapter 6, beginning at the first verse:
Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:
That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command the, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Hear therefore, 0 Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with the, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised the, in the land that ftoweth with milk and honey.
Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord:
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
And these words, which I command the this day, shall be in thine heart:
And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought the into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give the great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,
And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought the forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
Here ends the lesson.
ANTHEM: "From all that dwell below the skies" T. A. WALMISLEY
CHOIR: From all who dwell below the skies Let the Creator's praise arise Let the Redeemer's name be sung Through every land by every tongue
Eternal are our mercies Lord Eternal truth attends your word Your praise shall sound from shore to shore Til suns shall set and rise no more
Mr Grant CHAPMAN, M.P., Honorary Secretary, Federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship,-The Second Lesson is taken from the Gospel according to St. Luke, Chapter IS, verses I to 10, reading from the New International Version:
Now the tax collectors and 'sinners' were all gathering around to hear him

But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.'
Then Jesus told them this parable:
"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home.
Then he calls his friends and neighbourns together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'
I tell you that in the same way there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
'Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbours together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'
In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.'
Here ends the Second Lesson.
Prayers of Thanksgiving and Intercession:
Rev. Father G. CARPISWe thank you, Our God, for the life you have given each one of us; for the dignity you have granted all human beings in making us in your own image. We praise you for your gifts.
PEOPLE-We thank you, Lord.
Rev. Father G. CARPIS-For the freedom and safety in which we live; for peaceful homes, justice and order in our community; for standards of truth and honour, and for all our rights and freedoms.
PEOPLE-We thank you, Lord.
Rev. Father G. CARPIS-For the right to think, and to speak for ourselves and for others; for the right to be protected by law and to take part in the government of our country. For the institution of Parliament, particularly the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, that provides a basis for sound government, and stands for the rights of individuals and the whole people.
PEOPLE-We thank you, Lord.
Rev. Father G. CARPIS-We praise you, Lord God, for your faithful servants in every age, especially those who have served in the government of our nation through all its days until now. Give us grace so to follow their example that with them we may be sharers in your heavenly kingdom through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ALL-Amen.
Rev. A. L. CHRISTIE-Lord God, ruler of the nations of the earth, we pray for all who are given authority and responsibility among us; for Elizabeth our Queen, that always she may be led by your Spirit and protected by your grace. Guide with wisdom the Governor-General and those who represent Her Majesty within the States of Australia. We pray for each person elected as a Member of Parliament and those who hold responsible office among them, that they may honour that privilege. Grant a sense of truth and rightness to the Prime Minister and all Ministers of State that they may guide and direct the life of the Parliament and the life of our nation.
Mayall be conscious that responsibility and authority do not mean power, but rather service and humility. Teach them when to be cautious and when to be bold; how to speak, how to listen, and how to distinguish that which is important.

United as a family of your people, we pray for all people everywhere, asking for peace in our minds and peace for the whole world.
May your Church be true to its calling, leading us to a deeper knowledge of you, setting an example of righteousness for the nation and giving it true life and character.
As individuals and as a nation we pray that you deepen our concern for the hungry, the homeless, the refugees, the unemployed, the oppressed, the rejected, the persecuted, the lonely, that all may respond to those reflections of your Love which they see in the loving service of others.

Lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil, For thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.
HYMN 383 (Australian Hymn Book)
Stand up and bless the Lord, you people of his choice; stand up and bless the Lord your God, with heart, and soul and voice.
Though high above all praise, above all blessing high, who would not fear his holy name, and laud and magnify?
0, for the living flame from his own altar brought, to touch our lips, our minds inspire, and wing to heaven our thoughts!
God is our strength and song, and his salvation ours; then be his love in Christ proclaimed with all our ransomed powers.
Stand up and bless the Lord, the Lord your God adore; stand up and bless his glorious name, henceforth for evermore.
The Sermon was preached by the Most Reverend Sir Frank Little, D.D., K.B.E., Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne.
SIR FRANK LITTLE-I must say that I like Canberra. Thank you for inviting me. The fading summer perhaps doesn't show it off at its best. I have always liked Autumn tints so I rather envy you the glorious colour that soon will be surrounding you. Yet, here and now in this Church of St. Paul, there is something of the feeling of Spring-expectation, recommencement, fresh hopes. Yes, the curtain is rising on another Parliamentary year.

You have wished to take part in this overture in the presence of him, who is the Author and Foundation of all the seasons. Our help is in the Name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.
You have come to pray. Thank you for that witness. Your participation in this Annual Service of Worship openly declares that your faith in God gives you purpose, priority, perspective, inspiration and motivation. Your presence is saying to each other and to the country that you commend to God both yourselves and those on whose behalf you make your decisions. You are giving public witness that you believe in God, and in the sacredness of each human person. Your action today gives a great deal of hope to millions of citizens. And on their behalf, I believe I should thank you.
Recall for a moment, the prospects for this year. Awaiting you are constant demands from telephone, correspondence, meetings, appointments and acts of presence. Of course, the greatest bombardment will be from words. On many an occasion I am sure you will be tempted to sing, 'Words, words, words; I'm sick of words'. Those words are going to fill many a volume of Hansard. And yet the first words that you have wish to hear in this Parliamentary year are God's words. May they be a kindly light amid any encircling gloom.
The Old Testament passage and the Gospel passage compliment each other. The first reading centred around the everfresh direction-you shall love the Lord, your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength-and the Gospel spelt out the value of the individual. The whole message could be summed up in just two words-all, one. Two simple words and yet if you were asked to make a summary of what the Gospels say to us, you could hardly do better than choose those two words. They speak of free commitment. They speak of willing service, and concern. How can we bring home more deeply to ourselves those two words and make them part of our lives?
Imagine the advice you would receive from an advertising agency. At the back of the sanctuary have in neon lights: 'One', 'All'. Around the walls of the church have posters illustrating the theme: 'One', 'All'. Plan the music so that those two words constantly echo through: 'All', 'One'. See that at the foot of each diary page those two simple words are found: 'All', 'One'. And yet all those means would only be reminders. What matters is that the message be written in our hearts.
The first reading has already given us that advice. Let these words I urge on you today, be written in your hearts, 'You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.'
God speaks to us through the Old Testament. Think God, think All. God wants whole-heartedness, not halfheartedness. Our love of God is to be total, without reserve, holding nothing back, no restrictions, no reservations, no floating in mid-stream, no playing all options, no half-way house. There are to be no corners in which we hide from God, no places where we would feel embarrassed.
Frances Thompson captured the spirit: 'With unhurrying chase and unperturbed pace, God, the hound of heaven, pursues us down the nights and down the days and down the arches of the years.'
The pages of history ring out with examples of this heroic and legitimate totalitarianism. We see it in an Isaiah-'Here I am! Send me!'. In a Samuel-'Speak Lord, your servant is listening'. Our Lord's own life was expressed in these terms. 'Here I am Lord. I come to do your will'. The same tradition rings out in the words of Mary-'Here I am, a servant of the Lord. Be it done to me according to your word'. Perhaps a history of every true Christian could be verified in the cry, 'My God and my All',
God also speaks to us through the Gospel. Think God, think One. That completes a diptych. Our Lord makes it quite

Fourteenth Annual Service of Worship

clear you must love your neighbour as yourself. The message of the law and the prophets is completed by loving one's neighbour.
The fifteenth Chapter of Luke's Gospel is entirely dedicated to that central theme of 'One'. One sheep in a hundred, one coin in ten, one son in two. The emphasis is now on one. There we gain a glimpse of God's sense of proportion. Every individual matters. Every person is important. It almost sounds crazy, seems exaggerated.
Surely there is a wrong sense of balance. We know that it is not the way votes are counted. It is not the way a majority is gained. Reason and experience argue that a single person, a single cause, can't be worth pursuing when the majority is contrary.
Yet listen to Jesus Christ. He repeated the lesson three times. He wanted his followers to grasp it. He says that the lost, the wayward, the marginal, the no-hoper, the dissolute and the decadent are to be the centre of concern. They're His favoured people. One man, one vote is our accepted principle. Yet the Gospel requirement is not fulfilled by tallying up how many are for, how many against, and siding with the majority. A minority of one is worthy of special attention. There is a Pauline ring to it. 'He loved me, even me and delivered himself up for me.'
I am not recommending political suicide. What I understand the Gospel to be saying is that in the nitty-gritty of counting the votes, Christians are called to consider the consequences for even the least of His brethren. I see that Christian teaching demonstrated in the Australian preferring the 'under-dog', barracking for the loser. Mateship and fair-play are considered national traits. They have a basis in Christ's words.
The distinguishing characteristic, the trademark of the preaching of Jesus Christ is that God has a care for the sole person, the one on his own. An individual is enough to justify all that God has done in love. 'He loved me, even me and delivered himself up for me.'
In living out the providential paths along which God has called us, we can't do better than to use our freedom fully by freely committing ourselves in love to God and to all those who are made in God's image, be they on our side of the House, or on the other. Such demands, please God, will prompt us to pray. Any message of God will only become part of our lives by praying. In poetic and prophetic words our own James MacAuley has summed up the value of such prayer for ourselves and for our country. 'Incarnate word, in whom all Nature lives, cast flame upon the earth, raise up contemplatives among us, men who walk within the fire of ceaseless prayer, impetuous desire. Set pools of silence in this thirsty land. Distracted men, that sow their hopes in sand, will sometimes feel an evernescent sense of questioning; they know not from whence. Prayer has an influence we cannot mark, it works unseen like radium in the dark.'
HYMN 557 (Australian Hymn Book)
Lord of all creation, to you be all praise! Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways! Your glory and might are beyond us to tell, and yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.
Lord of all power, I give you my will, in joyful obedience your tasks to fulfil. Your bondage is freedom; your service is song; and, held in your keeping my weakness is strong.
Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind, rich truth that surpasses man's knowledge to find; what eye has not seen and what ear has not heard is taught by your Spirit and shines from your word.
Lord of all bounty, I give you my heart; I praise and adore you for all you impart, your love to inspire me, your

counsel to guide, your presence to shield me, whatever betide.
Lord of all being, I give you my all; if I ever disown you, I stumble and fall; but, led in your service your word to obey; I'll walk in your freedom to the end of the way.
The Rt Rev. C. A. WARREN-God, grant to the living, grace; to the departed, rest; to the Queen, this Commonwealth and all mankind, peace and concord. And the blessing of God Almighty, Father, Son and Holy Spirit be amongst you and remain with you always. Amen.
AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE Mr NEWMAN (Bass-Minister for Administrative Services)-Pursuant to section 67 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, I present the annual report of the Australian Federal Police for 1980-81.
RETIREMENT OF CLERK, MR J. A. PETTIFER, CBE.
Mr SPEAKER-I wish to inform the House of the impending retirement, on 15 July 1982, of the Clerk of the House, Mr John Athol Pettifer. Since 1901, the Australian Parliament has been served by a Pettifer-a unique family contribution to the Parliament of 81 years of continuous service. When the Commonwealth Parliament first met in Melbourne, the Clerk's father, Tom Pettifer, was a lift attendant. Mr Pettifer senior later became Housekeeper when the Parliament moved to this building in Canberra. At the time the Housekeeper was provided with a flat within the precincts. As a result, Jack Pettifer, as a youth, was already familiar with the building where he was to spend so much of his professional life. He indicates to me that he used to skate around the corridors as a child. After war service, he returned to live with his parents in a flat in this House.
Jack Pettifer has served the Commonwealth of Australia in an exemplary manner for almost 50 years. A graduate of the University of Melbourne as Bachelor of Commerce and a qualified accountant, he was appointed to the Prime Minister's Department in 1934. Since 19 April 1939 he has served the House of Representatives continuously except for an interruption for war service.
Mr Pettifer enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941 and served in Canada in the Empire Air Training Scheme. He graduated as a pilot officer in 1942. He was for a period a pilotinstructor. He served in the Bahamas, in the north Atlantic area, the United Kingdom and Iceland from 1943 to 1945. He was appointed to Coastal Command as the pilot of a four-engined Liberator bomber, and flew long, tiring hours over the Atlantic. He was discharged in December 1945 with the rank of flight-lieutenant. He became Serjeant-at-Arms in 1954, Third Clerk-Assistant

2342 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Mr J. A. Pettifer, CB.E., Retirement

in 1955, Second Clerk-Assistant in 1959, ClerkAssistant in 1964, Deputy Clerk in 1971 and he has been Clerk of the House since 1977. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1981.
Among the many achievements of his meritorious career, the most recent was perhaps the most striking and perhaps the most enduring. Jack Pettifer, as editor, headed a team of professional officers who produced House of Representatives Practice. This publication has received wide acclaim from the academic world and the general public. It is performing a vital role in the guidance of members and is an indispensable tool for officers of our own and other parliaments. The first edition will be a fitting monument to the man and his dedication.
He was Secretary to the Select Committee on Hansard of the House of Representatives which led to the issue of a daily Hansard. He was also Secretary to the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House during the period 1966 to 1969 which covered exhaustively much of the ground which had to be settled before a new building could be built. As Joint Chairman of the current New Parliament House Committee, I am well aware of the indebtedness due to the work done by the 1966 Committee. Members can rest assured that their interests have been jealously guarded in the new building with Jack Pettifer at the helm.
As Honorary Secretary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association he has participated in many important CPA activities. Perhaps the most noteworthy was in 1978 when the Commonwealth of Australia branch hosted the Fifth Annual Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks-at-the-Table, with participants of Commonwealth countries from all over the world. Jack was appointed Secretary-General of that conference. Its complete success was a tribute to his organisational prowess.
Mr Pettifer is married, and is the father of five children. He is active in his church. He was an accomplished A grade tennis player and is still capable of providing lessons in the finer points of the game to opposing players many years his junior. He was also a most competent table tennis player, and participated, together with a former Clerk of the House, Norm Parkes, in an exhibition match against former world champion Szabados. He enjoys sailing. He has a new catamaran to try out. He enjoys water skiing and he still flies aeroplanes for recreation.

Jack Pettifer has a fine sense of humour. He directed my attention to a cutting from the Sydney Telegraph of 31 January 1967. What he drew to my attention was some verse by Sir Robert Menzies which had appeared in the Times. I think it is interesting to read. It states:
Two wise old owls sat at the table: Their wigs were grey, their gowns were sable: They looked so sad, so melancholy. As if depressed by human folly. Around them, carelessly displayed, Were all their dreadful tools of trade. The Standing Orders, Votes and Motions, The Statutes, May and such like notions. The glass, with sand so neatly piled The rulings (wrong) so neatly filed, The bells to call the members in To tread the paths of verbal sin. But wise old owls must sometimes think Of what? Of women? Food? or drink? Or are they, as they keep their places, As really vacant as their faces?
All members of the House admire the depth of his professional parliamentary expertise, his unfailing courtesy, his calmness and his absolute integrity. His sound advice is characteristically proffered in a totally unassuming manner. Typical of the man was his request to me that he cease duty with a minimum of fuss. His request notwithstanding, I am sure honourable members would have wanted me to announce his impending retirement and would endorse my wishes for a happy retirement to Jack and his wife, Ruth, who is present in the Gallery today and who has supported him throughout his years of service. We would wish to say well done to a true and faithful servant of the House and a fine Australian.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER (Wannon-Prime Minister)-Mr Speaker, I am sure all members of the House would want to join you in saying well done to Jack Pettifer, who served this House, the Parliament and Australians so well over a very long time. Mr Speaker, when you and I entered the Parliament in 1955, together with the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), Jack Pettifer was already serving as an officer of the Parliament. Like his father, he has served the House with great distinction and unstinting loyalty over a long period. Indeed, since 1939 he has dedicated his whole life to the parliamentary process, the only interruption being a period of war service when he served as a pilot, as you told us, in the Bahamas, the North Atlantic, the United Kingdom and Iceland. Perhaps his experience during the war as a pathfinder has been important to him and useful to him during his period of service to the House.
Mr Speaker, you have related Jack Pettifer's distinguished service record to this House and to

Mr J. A. Pettifer, CB.E., Retirement

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2343

all honourable members. His dedication has made every honourable member of the House aware of his professionalism, integrity, ever-present courtesy and willingness to help. As you mentioned, one of Jack Pettifer's crowning achievements was undoubtedly his editorship of the House of Representatives Practice. For too long, I think, some people in another place have been able to quote from Odgers Australian Senate Practice, but this House now has an authoritative publication of its own to which it can refer for guidance. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we can now refer to Pettifer. I have no doubt that the House of Representatives Practice will be regarded as one of the outstanding texts on any Parliament's practice and procedures and will enrich the work and history of this Parliament down through the years. The House of Representatives Practice contains a quotation from Philip Marsden's Officers of the Commons which states:
Whatever the complexion of the Government in office the House can be certain of receiving that completely impartial and professionally expert service for which its officers enjoy a reputation second to none, and upon which all members can, and do, rely unhesitatingly.
Jack Pettifer exemplifies this fine tradition. His record of service is exemplary. His dedication and sense of purpose are known to all of us. In the heat of political debate we so often seek cool and dispassionate procedural advice. In his years in this House, Jack Pettifer has provided that advice without fear or favour and in the face of what must sometimes have been quite trying circumstances. As you indicated, Mr Speaker, Jack Pettifer has served the House in a variety of capacities-not only as Serjeant-at-Arms, Third Clerk Assistant, Second Clerk Assistant, Clerk Assistant, Deputy Clerk and Clerk of the House, but also as Secretary of the Select Committee on Hansard and Secretary of the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. As you reminded us, Mr Speaker, he also served as Honorary Secretary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, an institution which is well respected around the world and which serves an invaluable role.
We will all miss Jack Pettifer's services. He has been a great servant of this House and, through it, of Australia. I am sure that his retirement will allow him greater opportunities to enjoy his recreation, his pastimes. Again, as you reminded us, Mr Speaker, they are tennis, sailing and flying. I believe I echo the wishes of all honourable members in expressing the hope that Jack and his wife, Ruth, will enjoy a long and fulfilling retirement.

Mr HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-I am saddened, as all honourable members are on an occasion like this, to be jolted suddenly by the realisation that a person who has served long, faithfully and extraordinarily well is about to leave the services of the Parliament. Jack Pettifer has been a great friend to all members serving in this Parliament and to those who have served in the period of more than four decades during which he has been a member of the staff of this Parliament. Those four decades have been punctuated only by his period of service in defence of freedom as a member of the armed forces. We are grateful for the service he has given. We appreciate the impartiality, the helpfulness and the unfailing courteousness with which he has treated all of us. It is people such as Jack Pettifer, his predecessors and his successors who give the cohesive power to the parliamentary institution.
Of course, he was eminently well qualified to serve in the foxhole, as it were, between the warring parties in this battleground. He saw active service in the Second World War in the European theatre as a pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force. There he saw quite a bit of flak. He returned to the Parliament and he has seen quite a bit of flak here. On balance I think at times he may have thought he was safer in the combat theatre than here. It is appropriate to keep the military analogy going by saying that there are traditions in the military as there are traditions in this parliamentary institution, and the traditions arise on occasions such as farewells. In the armed Service the tradition for appropriate personages is that 12 cannon are fired. This morning we did our variation of that; we ejected one member. They are different forms but they serve the same ceremonial purpose. He will go away with clear recollections of what the parliamentary system has been about.
Jack Pettifer's background has been outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) but I remind honourable members that he holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree, is an Associate of the Australian Society of Accountants, and has been Clerk of the House since 1977. He joined the staff of the House of Representatives before the Second World War. However, what I am seeking to move towards is to recall that he was educated at Telopea Park High School in Canberra, and there he would have been educated with a number of contemporaries who were to become distinguished, like himself, some of them a year or two ahead of him and some after him. I understand one who served with him was a young student, later to become well known, named

2344 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Mr J. A. Pettifer, CBE., Retirement

Gough Whitlam, and he has vivid recollections of Gough Whitlam, as he describes him, moving around the schoolgrounds from time to time in knickerbockers. I have commented on this to some of my colleagues on both sides of the House and one of them was unkind enough to suggest that perhaps he has a wrong recollection, that it was just another case, even in those early days, of Gough being too big for his breeches. Oh, my God! I suddenly realise that we are still on air. I hope the boadcast is not being beamed to Sydney; it will be the end of me.
Mr Speaker, you quoted from a poem as to the authorship of which there was some disputation a few years ago. Nonetheless, it loses none of its gloss or relevance for us members of Parliament. You quoted the role of the grey wigged owls, depressed by human folly. I think that, to the contrary, after more than four decades of service in this institution a Clerk of the House either would have to be an eternal optimist or would have surrendered all hope when he entered the portals of this establishment. Jack has been an eternal optimist and eternally cordial. He has, as I mentioned earlier, been one of that long line of serving officers in this Parliament who, regardless of which party happens to be in government or opposition, are unflagging in their energies, unfailing in their courtesies and unremittingly dedicated to making the democratic parliamentary institution work. We have been greatly strengthened by Jack's service. We are disappointed that he is retiring. We trust that his and his wife's well-earned period of retirement is a thoroughfully fruitful one. After the compilation of such a compendious work as House of Representatives Practice-a trail blazing contribution and an. invaluable one for this Parliament-I do not believe that he will long rest idle. His energies are too productive to allow that to happen. Good luck and happiness to Jack and Mrs Pettifer in his retirement.
Mr ANTHONY (Richmond-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources)-Mr Speaker, I would like to join in the remarks made by you, by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in paying an extremely high tribute to Jack Pettifer for the services that he has rendered this Parliament. I doubt whether there is another living Australian who has been more closely associated with the Parliament, or contributed more to it than has Jack Pettifer. He has had a family association with it since its beginning. His father was part of the Parliament of 1901 and remained with it. Jack was brought up in this Parliament. His family lived in the housekeeper's little flat and, as you mentioned, Mr

Speaker, Jack, as a boy, used to roller skate around this Parliament. I am told that 48 years ago when he got his first Public Service job he used to skate between here and the Records Office, carrying documents back and forth. He has certainly always been a man of many activities; he is a man who has many sides to his nature.
I suppose that when people look down from the galleries at this very quiet, dignified and calm man, they think: 'What do those two people do? Are they very important?' We are all indebted to Jack Pettifer for the depth of the advice that he has given this Parliament and the orderly way in which he manages to keep it running, such that legislation proceeds smoothly and we are helped to govern this country democratically. As has been mentioned, his advice has been enormously valuable. He is the author of House of Representatives Practice, which is now a companion to Australian Senate Practice, which was produced by the former Clerk of the Senate, Mr Odgers. To have such a document is very valuable. Of course, Jack has given all of the credit to the many people who assisted him in its publication but, as we know, publication would never have occurred unless he had really applied himself to that task.
The rather reserved appearance of this gentleman belies his real character and nature. As you have mentioned, Mr Speaker, during World War II he was a bomber pilot with Coastal Command. He still flies. I am told that he flies one of these weird contraptions that one makes oneself from a home kit, in the backyard or garage. It is not necessary to have a pilot's licence as long as one does not fly too high. Indeed, we might not have been partaking of this occasion, in this sort of mood, if an accident that he almost had over Lake George some time ago had occurred. Fortunately it did not. He is also a boatman. He has a small motor boat, a ski boat and a catamaran-you name it, if there is a bit of excitement and adventure this apparently very quiet, benign character here will be a part of it; he has really a lot of spirit. As you have said, Mr Speaker, he has been a fine athlete and sportsman. This Parliament is lucky to have had heading it for the last five years such a balanced, complete person, one who has given complete dedication and exemplary service for the 48 years during which he has been an employee of the Commonwealth. We thank him very much for his contribution. We hope that, given all of his activities and interests, he and his wife will be able to enjoy a very pleasant retirement.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith)-I welcome the opportunity to support my leader briefly on behalf of the Opposition in expressing

Mr J. A. Pettifer, CBE., Retirement

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2345

to Jack Pettifer and his good lady, family and sister our best wishes for a very happy, long and healthy retirement. I take this opportunity, as what might be called the manager of Opposition business, to express my thanks to Jack for all the guidance he has given me as to procedure. It is no fault of his that all of the well aimed missiles that we fire at the Government are destroyed. That is due to the sheer weight of numbers on that side of the House, not to anything of which Jack Pettifer would be guilty. I might add, in fairness to Jack, that he has made no contribution to the materials involved-merely to the procedure to be followed. I have welcomed his advice and thank him for it. Also, I want to place on record our appreciation of the splendid work that he has done in producing House of Representatives Practice. It will be a great asset. It clearly indicates to the nation that the House of Representatives is in no way inferior or subservient to the Senate. Of course, my view is that the House is superior to the Senate. The House of Representatives Practice should clearly indicate that. I look forward also to the fact that one day this book might have an addendum to it by Pettifer as to what really constitutes relevance. When a relevant question is asked, can we get a relevant answer? I hope this can be clearly defined because we do spend a fair bit of time here discussing such matters.
Jack Pettifer shows-I know that I am speaking for most of ushow a quiet and pleasantly deceptive character can hide a multitude of activities. None of us really realised, apart from the intellectual capacity of Jack Pettifer, the many other matters that interest him no end. I have no doubt that, when he looks at the human folly in front of him and at the glass of sand, and those matters that are on everybody's mind, he must welcome getting away from here. I can well understand why he is such an adventurous character. At times this place must drive him near to the point of distraction. It is important in a democratic society to have people such as the Pettifers and others taking an interest in the managerial aspects of a parliament on a day to day basis. I expect, as most people do, that he will write his memoirs. I only hope that he treats us all with a lot of charity.
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the House)-Mr Speaker, I support the remarks made by you, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). I wish to move a motion of commendation for the retiring Clerk of the House of Representatives. I move:

That this House places on record its appreciation of the long and meritorious service to the Parliament by the Clerk of the House, Mr J. A. Pettifer, CBE., and extends to him and his wife every wish for a healthy and happy retirement.
I am sure that all members of this House are indebted to Jack Pettifer for the kindness, the wisdom and the consistency with which he has been able to remain cool in times of some verbal crises about this place. The advice that he has given has certainly been of significant advantage to us all. For so long Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice has been available to us verbally. Henceforth it will be available only in written form. But in that written form it will retain that same essence of wisdom that has been very significant in all that you as Clerk, Jack, have contributed to this place. To you, your wife and family, I wish a long, happy and healthy retirement.
Mr JARMAN (Deakin)-As a back bencher and a Deputy Chairman of Committees I wish to say how much it means to me, and I am sure to the other Deputy Chairmen of Committees, that when we have to fill in for you, Mr Speaker, and sit in the chair-perhaps we do not have your experience or knowledge-we can press a little button which shows a green light in front of Jack Pettifer or Doug Blake and we can get the advice that we require. We have all appreciated this very much. It has been very reassuring to know-when sitting in that august position representing the Speaker-that Jack was on hand whenever we needed him. Unfortunately, he will not be on hand any more, but I am sure that with Doug Blake we will have somebody who will always be there to help us. On behalf of all the Deputy Chairmen of Committees and all the back benchers I thank Jack Pettifer very much for all the help he has given us during the years in which we have needed him.
Mr MILLAR (Wide Bay)-It would be remiss of me, as Deputy Speaker of the House, not to place on record on behalf of the Deputy Chairmen of Committees-it has been anticipated a little by my colleague, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman)-our total endorsement of all the remarks offered in respect of the remarkable tribute made by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, our friend Jack; over a great number of years. Briefly, I wish to acknowledge his instinctive tact and sensitivity. He found no urgency to accommodate one's incipient resentment or blame in a given situation. He insisted first on establishing the facts of the matter, always allowing, in an instinctive charity, that things may not always be as they appear in the first instance. He knows when he should be candid and he knows when he should be reticent. As a pilot of a modest

2346 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

stature I enjoy an instant empathy with him. I intend to ask him a question the day after he retires a question I know his sense of propriety will not allow him to answer now. When calculating the all-up weight of a pilot, should a pilot, when becoming a parliamentarian, be considered as dead weight? I wish him well, clear skies, tail winds and happy landings.
Mr SPEAKER-I have had a note passed to me by the Clerk. It reads:
Mr Speaker, thank you for your kind and generous remarks. Would you please thank the Prime Minister, the Leaders and other honourable members for their kind remarks and good wishes. I appreciate them very much.
Honourable members-Hear, hear!
Question resolved in the affirmative.
FALKLAND ISLANDS DISPUTE
Mr SPEAKER-I have had a note passed to me that comes from the Australian Broadcasting Commission news room in the Press Gallery. It reads:
The Secretary-General of the United Nations announced a short while ago that Argentina has accepted United Nations proposals aimed at resolving the Falkland Islands crisis. It is understood that Britain has given its response to the United States Secretary of State, Mr Haig. It is not yet known what that response is.
AUSTRALIAN SHEEP MEAT STUDY MISSION TO THE MIDDLE EAST
Ministerial Statement
Mr NIXON (Gippsland-Minister for Primary Industry)-Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement.
Mr Uren-Mr Speaker, does this mean that there will be an extension of time for General Business? General Business is due to stop at 12 o'clock. Has an extension of time been agreed to or will the statement be made after 12 o'clock?
Mr NIXON-Arrangements have been made with the Opposition.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for Reid is asking a question with my indulgence. For the purposes of the conduct of the House, I should seek an answer to it.
Mr Sinclair-I understand it is a brief statement.1t is not one which will take up much of the time of the House. I believe it to be noncontroversial. Time will be made available to compensate for any loss of the period normally allotted to General Business.
Mr SPEAKER-Time will be made available in a compensatory form.
Leave granted.

Mr NIXON-On 17 March 1982 I announced that the Government was sending a mission, comprising officials and representatives of trade unions, meat exporters and sheep producers, to study Middle East sheep meat markets. The mission left Australia on 18 March and returned on 10 April, having visited Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Libya. Those countries currently obtain most of their sheep meat requirements from locally slaughtered, imported live sheep. In 1981, they imported some 4.5 million sheep from Australia. A major purpose of the mission was to investigate prospects for expanding sales of dressed sheep meat to those markets and to make recommendations on means of achieving that expansion.
The Government is hopeful that the mission's investigations and follow-up action on its recommendations will help achieve Government, industry and trade union agreement on the future of the live sheep export trade. It is a valuable trade to Australia, worth $165m last year, and it is a trade which the Government supports. By the same token, we are equally interested in boosting our carcass trade wherever opportunities exist. The mission has now submitted its report and recommendations, and is of the view that there are opportunities to expand sheep meat sales. Accordingly, it has recommended a range of actions to exploit those opportunities.
In particular, the mission recommends that sales efforts should be backed up by a special market development and promotion program. It recommends Government-industry consultation on the establishment of funding arrangements, including a Commonwealth financial contribution for such a program. A campaign to inform Middle East officials and consumers of the reliability of Australian Muslim slaughter procedures is also recommended as a key element in the promotion program. The mission considers that general mistrust of the religious reliability of imported meat is impeding the expansion of sheep meat sales.
Many honourable members and people in the community are interested in this report. I have therefore decided to make it public now, even though the Government has not yet given it detailed consideration. The Government will give early consideration to all the recommendations, with a view to implementing appropriate action as quickly as possible. Finally, I would like to say I believe the mission has produced a valuable report for all those involved in Australia's sheep meat industry. I commend the members of the mission on a job well done and for the constructive way in which they tackled their task.

Mr KERIN (Werriwa)-by leave-The Opposition welcomes this report. We have not had time to read it or scrutinise it closely, but it is obvious that involvement and consultation among the various interests can result and has resulted in some education of and greater understanding among the parties all round. We hope that there will be a debate on this matter at a later date. We hope also that the Government will act speedily on the recommendations. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has said that sales efforts should be backed up by a special market development and promotion program, that there should be government-industry consultation on the establishment of funding arrangements and that there should be a campaign to inform Middle East officials and consumers of the reliability of Australia's Muslim slaughter procedures. These statements are all very welcome indeed.
This is a very complex issue. It is not just a primary industry issue; it is not just an industrial issue. The unions have shown a natural reaction to seeing live sheep being exported or loaded on to ships and abattoirs closing. There has been a lack of factual information and the issue has been debatable because there has been no overall study of the whole meat processing industry in this country. Many small reports have been made but none of them have ever been drawn together to the satisfaction of the Opposition. The unions involved have been unable to draw together a complete picture throughout Australia. It struck me, in seeing some of these people in the various States, that the union officials are exceptionally busy people. To producers, the present live sheep trade is the very basis of the economic well-being of the sheep industry. I was recently in Broken Hill and Western Australia and met graziers. There is no doubt that that trade is the very basis of the economic well-being of the sheep industry in many areas of this country. The exporters have a vested interest. I have never been sure of all the facts. Perhaps this report will go some way towards telling us about that. The animal welfare people have expressed a concern which in some instances has been justifiable and the Government has reacted to that and is taking whatever steps it can.
The Minister was taking the view of kicking heads. The graziers had shown a natural reaction because this valuable trade was the economic base of their industry. The unions were reacting negatively and imposing bans and limitations. The easiest way to get a cheer was to kick Wally Curran, or whoever, to death. Quite a few people in the grazing industry felt that way. The delegations going to the Minister were not getting

anywhere and there was not much satisfaction all round. The Australian Council of Trade Unions changed the position when it accepted the recommendations of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union which applied a ratio requirement which was clearly unworkable and said that the union movement as a whole would not load ships. Once upon a time in the ultimate it was seen that the producers themselves would load ships. That situation no longer prevailed. The ships would not even have been tied up to be loaded. So the study mission took place.
The Opposition has taken the view that compromise, consultation, give and take, measured concern and balanced judgment should have prevailed throughout this issue. The Opposition, of course, was concerned for the meat workers. Quite a few things have affected them besides the direct question of the loss of jobs allegedly because of the live sheep trade. Once upon a time during the off season in killing-as we all know, abattoirs kill seasonally in many parts of Australia-there were other jobs available in may country towns. That situation does not prevail now. There has been a massive beef downturn, which has resulted in the closure of abattoirs and in the problems of the abattoir industry. We need to understand that the unions react negatively only when they are losing jobs. Union officials are very busy people. One piece of information I received when I first became a member of this place was when I talked to the honourable member for Melbourne, Mr Innes. I asked him: 'What is the toughest job, being a union official or a member of parliament, in terms of time?' He said: 'Parliament is a snack compared with being fully involved in the El~ctrical Trades Union of Australia', as he was. That came as quite a surprise tome.
However, although the Opposition quite properly-we do not apologise for it-was very concerned with the reaction of the people in the union, the workers in the bush and the workers in the cities, it did not take the unions' side alone. We have to realise, as I am sure many members of this House do, that the sheep flock is not a static thing. It can acquire various structures in terms of age, sex and size. The matters that affect it more than the live sheep trade or any other factor are drought and alternative land use-in other words, market force decisions taken by our primary producers. It would be difficult to prove that union fortunes would change in the long run, that there would be more jobs if live sheep trades were banned altogether. That is almost impossible to prove. The report shows, from my brief reading of it, that many of the beliefs of the unions were and

2348 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

are justified. It shows that the demand for mutton in the Middle East is growing, although there is a problem with guaranteeing halal killing in Australia. My own limited experience in Egypt backs that up to some degree.
The Opposition welcomes the report. We hope that the Government will act speedily upon it and we hope that in future, in terms of this very complex issue, consultation and possibly education will be the order of the day, not confrontation.
BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE
The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests:
States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1982.
States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982.
HOUSING
Mr UREN (Reid) (11.37)-1 move:
That this House-
( I) recognises that the rapid pace and large-scale volume of export-oriented resource development being pursued in Australia is causing widespread dislocation of people from their homes and places of work while acting to drain private funds away from traditional sources of housing finance, and pressure increases in home loan interst rates;
(2) acknowledges that security of housing for a growing number of low and middle income earners is being undermined by the rising prices of land, housing and finance in the private sector;
(3) condemns the Government for the large cutbacks in public sector housing expenditure which have imposed hardship on people in need and led to a gross imbalance in the national housing stock, and
(4) calls on the Government to expand funds for public housing and develop an integrated housing policy which will address the growing housing problems.
This motion calls on this House to recognise the effect of the dislocation of people from their homes and places of work in the context of a structural change in Australia's pattern of industrial development. It calls on this House to recognise the social pressures that are brought on by these changes. It calls on this House to recognise the financial pressures that this Government's over-tight monetary policy has imposed on our national capacity to address questions of social need. In particular, the motion draws attention to the pressures acting on the housing sector in general and to the scandalous cutbacks in Federal funds for public housing in particular.
On Tuesday of this week the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) presented in this House the 1982 Review of Australia's Demographic Trends. The Review projects that Australia's population wiLl reach

19.9 million by the turn of the century. The population is not only now growing at a higher rate than it was in the mid-1970s but also is characterised by a more diverse ethnic mix and a higher proportion of aged persons. The higher population projections and the changing population composition signal a set of demographic pressures to which an integrated policy response is required. But, regrettably, this Government has failed in its entire time in office to plan in any way. This worries me and honourable members on this side of the House.
About five million Australians-one-third of the present population-are under 20 years of age and will progressively form their own households which will require accommodation and associated services. About 1t million Australians-one-tenth of the population-are aged 65 years or over. Their numbers are expected to grow to around 2.5 million by the turn of the century. New approaches to housing the aged will be required. This is a matter which in itself is worthy of separate debate in this Parliament. Again, regrettably, this discussion has not taken place; the Government does not have a philosophy to plan to foresee the problems that are going to occur in this country.
Time has not been found for us to debate this matter because the real truth is that this Parliament is to rise today for the winter recess. Never in the 24 years I have been in this Parliament has the Parliament ever gone into the winter recess so early. The real reason why it is going into recess is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has trouble with his back bench. There is real division within the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister wants the Parliament to adjourn so that he will not get dissension and pressure from his back benchers. He particularly does not want pressure from that new group called the 'dries' or, as I prefer to call them, the 'free traders'. That is why this Parliament is getting up and why many of these questions are not discussed.
The number of settler arrivals in Australia in 1982 is estimated at 123,000 compared with 110,000 last year. An increasing proportion of settlers is in categories other than 'family reunion'. The population of migrants in the family reunion category has declined from 26.2 per cent in 1977 to 17.6 per cent in 1981. Not only is there an increase in the level of immigration but also there is a growing proportion of that intake in the categories requiring separate accommodation; and that again must be viewed with deep concern. Through both natural population increase and immigration, Australia faces the need to increase the supply of housing. We need to do this at a time

Housing

of growing neglect of existing housing needs. There are 98,900 families on the waiting lists of State housing authorities and this number is growing at a remarkable rate every day and every week.
There are at least 300,000 households in the private rental market identified as being in urgent need of special assistance. There are unknown thousands of young and old people who are homeless and living-I should say 'existing'-under appalling conditions. There are countless thousands living in sub-standard, mobile or makeshift accommodation. There is a declining level of home ownership and an upsurge in the cost of rents in the private rental market as the vacancy ratios fall. Real estate agencies across the country tell us that never before has there been a lower ratio than there is at present. They say that this is an unhealthy situation. In the months ahead and even the year ahead, rentals are going to skyrocket because of the failure of this Government to maintain the supply of housing, particularly in the publiC sector but even in the private sector.
At the same time we face another set of problems relating to internal migration in this country-the shifts of population out of established centres to resource development regions and to resorts for tourism or retirement, and the shifts of population out of rural areas to metropolitan centres together with the influx of recently arrived settlers into the capital cities. There is a move from the colder States-the southern States-to the northern States. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a great upsurge in internal migration even in your State of Queensland, particularly to south-eastern Queensland, to Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. In the months ahead, the inflationary pressures on housing in that State, particularly on the south-eastern region, will be greater than they are in Sydney or anywhere else in Australia. The real estate agents already forecast these pressures.
To address these problems, we do not merely require an expansion of housing supply. We also need an integrated approach to the development of human settlements. We need a commitment to the balanced development and humane management of settlements in which people are decently housed and properly serviced with amenities, social and cultural opportunities and secure jobs as an integral part of their living environment. Mr Deputy Speaker, these things have not been discussed or thought about because the facts are that your Government, the Government which you support--

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member will be mindful that the Chair is not supporting the Opposition or the Government.
Mr UREN-I respect you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the position which you hold. But the National Country Party, to which you belong, the Liberal Party and the Government have not planned in any form and that is an extremely sad situation for this society.
The tragedy is that this Government has no concept of such an approach and is pursuing policies which jeopardise our national capacity to cope with emerging pressures. To begin with, this Government has persisted with an over-tight monetary policy which is stifling domestic economic activity. It is causing interest rates to rise to unprecedented and unaffordable levels, not only for existing home purchasers and intending home buyers but also for farmers, small businessmen, local government and other small borrowers. Hence the growth of employment opportunities and improvement in community services are seriously constrained.
Next, the Government has virtually abandoned its historical responsibilities to fund programs and co-ordinate policies for urban improvement and regional development. It has isolated housing as a matter which is not connected, as it has to be, with the provision of essential community services. It has cut back funds for social programs, and especially for housing programs, to scandalously low levels. In addition, this Government has dismantled much of the machinery for the national co-ordination of the pattern and pace of industrial development. It has withdrawn from its responsibilities to ensure balanced national development across sectors and regions. It has left the pattern of development to be determined by the profitmotivated decisions of corporations that playoff one State against the other to get favourable incentives and concessions to influence the location of investment. So we have a situation where people are leaving established regions, in which housing and other social infrastructure investments have been made, to go to regions where jobs are promised but few houses are to be found, where there are inadequate community facilities to meet the needs of the growing population. We can see this pattern in such centres as Gladstone in Queensland, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria.
I will just mention briefly the social problems that are occurring in Gladstone. Most of the industries at Gladstone have been put on Boyne

2350 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Housing

Island which is south east of that city. The prevailing winds blow from the south east. This means that the present and future populations of Gladstone will be poisoned to a great extent by the fumes from this industrial development. This is a sad situation. The workers have revolted against that development. They want an improvement in the social infrastructure of the living conditions. I hope that such a stand is taken in many other States because the workers have to involve themselves and participate in their living environment. Unless workers and people protest against government, this Liberal-National Country Party Government particularly will allow 'free' market forces to determine what is in its best interests, not in the people's interests.
If developers continue to refuse to pay a fair contribution to the cost of upgrading and expanding the provision of housing and community facilities in the resource development regions, governments will be able to afford to do so only at the expense of people in other established centres especially in the capital cities. But we cannot afford, socially, economically and politically, to allow further neglect of the needs of people in the established centres.
I have raised only a few of the questions that face the nation in a period of far-reaching structural changes and emerging demographic pressures. The Government either refuses to accept that these problems exist or is prepared to turn its back on them. But they are on the agenda and they cannot be written off. The motion also draws attention to this Government's neglect of public housing at a time of unmet and growing need, surplus capacity and high unemployment in the housing industry. In the last Budget the government allocated only one-eighth of the funds made available in the last full year of the Labor Government, in 1974-75. Over the past six years it has robbed about $1,500m from the public sector. That sum would have created about 30,000 dwell-
ings, which would have meant that for every

$100m expenditure on government dwellings, there would have been a further 5,000 people employed. So there would have been 75,000 more people working in the building industry had the Government not robbed that $1,500m from public sector housing and, in particular, from the payments to the States.
Not only has this Government starved the funds for public housing but it has also destroyed the concept of integrated public housing development. Now we are seeing the emergence of a concept of welfare housing for the deserving poor. The low income public housing tenants are being required to pay the market rents for their housing in order to subsidise the costs of replenishing the public housing stock for very low income earners. Public housing is being stigmatised as third rate, and it is being relegated to the lower end of the housing market, increasingly on the fringes of our capital cities, which are. inadequately provided with public transport, social and cultural facilities, and job opportunities.
Public housing in Australia has been and can become again an exciting concept that offers a secure alternative to home ownership for those people who either prefer not to buy their own home or cannot afford to do so. The development of Woolloomooloo and Glebe in Sydney is living testimony to what can be achieved by sensitive and imaginative planning. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who administered those in 1976, nods his approval and fully agrees. But, unfortunately, his Government has not made the necessary finance available.
In the few moments left to me, I want to develop some of the real financial problems the States have in regard to public sector housing. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of the real net payments to the States for housing, from 1974-75 through to 1981-82.

Mr UREN-I thank the House. I was talking about how, over the last six years, there has been a stealing of funds of over $1 ,500m from the States. If the Government had kept the amount of money that we made available in 1974-75, in constant terms, it would have advanced to the States $789m this year. Instead the Government made available only $255m. So for this year alone one can see that about $530m has been lost. But still worse are the problems of the States, because they are the gross amounts. Taking into consideration the amount of money that the States repay on advances and their repayments on interest, one gets a net amount. The net Federal payments to the States in 1974-75 were worth $573m. This year the figure is down to $47m. Let us look at the two crucial States where the pressure is on for public sector housing, New South Wales and Victoria. In 1974-75 we made available to New South Wales $252m. After those repayments were made, the net figure was $177m.
But what is the situation in 1981-82? First, the gross amount made available to New South Wales was $84m, but the net amount was down to $13m. So in 1974-75 the net amount was $177m, and it is now $13.5m. In the case of Victoria, in 1974-75 the gross amount was $200m. This year the gross figure is $59m. The net amount in 1974-75 was $140m. Listen to this: The total amount with which Victoria has to deal this year is $3m-a cut from $140m net in 1974-75 to $3m this year. It is no wonder that those two major States of New South Wales and Victoria have a crisis problem in

regard to public housing because the Federal Government has contracted out of public housing. It has deserted the people of the major population centres. It has sold out the people because it has transferred most of the wealth across to the big corporate sector, particularly in the resource centres.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?
Mr HOWE (Batman) (11.56)-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have considerable pleasure in seconding this motion which draws attention to one of the most serious areas of government policy and one of the greatest problems that the Australian people face. One cannot avoid being struck by the contrast between the scale of investment in the so-called resource development areas, such as Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, the Latrobe Valley and Portland, being entered into by the various .companies and authorities concerned for physical infrastructure, and the shortage of funds and lack of investment to meet basic human needs, such as proper housing. The mushrooming in these cities of the caravan parks, rising rents, the Sydney-like prices for housing in remote or, at least, provincial locations, with prices of $80,000 and $100,000 in areas such as Portland, Gladstone and Singleton in the Hunter Valley, and the pressure for change that is occurring in these cities on established residents, with people being forced out of their homes, and the overall lack of effective

2352 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Housing

planning-all this must be a matter of concern to anyone who bothers to concern himself with the human dimensions of resource development.
Certainly from my visits to such areas, I have been made very much aware of the concern felt by local government that it is confronted with ~ task which is beyond its resources, of both seek10g to protect the interests of existing resident~ an.d of coping with the influx of new people com1Og 10 to work on the major projects. The current slowdown in resource development is seen by many councillors as something of a blessing, because it provides an opportunity to absorb some of the existing change and to plan for the future.
It is the antipathy to planning of conservative governments that represents one of the most serious problems in Australia today. By 'planning', I do not refer merely to the l~ck o.f da~a and information and the lack of ratIOnality 10 the planning process, and the failure to an~icipate problems in the future. I refer also to the faIlure to look at the question of the relative claims between competing interests in the development process. It is a matter of the distribution of costs and benefits. It is a matter of who gains and who loses. It is that matter that has not been given appropriate consideration by governments.
Planning is ultimately a political process in which an attempt is made to weigh up and to adjudicate between competing interests. The commitment of conservatives to the market as the best means of resolving planning problems is inherently a commitment to non-planning, to reducing the level of political intervention. However, it is quite clear in the so-called re~ource development areas that the market is not 10terested in those aspects of development or those by-products of development which are not profitable. What this means in practice is that people with the strongest market power get the greatest share of the resources available. Prime sites are absorbed by the companies for their projects. In housing it means that the best sites are swallowed up by developers with the greatest resources. It means massive capital gains for people who own property in central locations in the cities. It I?eans that people are housed very much accord1Og to their market power. Thus people who can afford to pay very high prices-
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! As it is now two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate on the motion is interrupted.
Motion (by Mr Newman) agreed to:
That the time for the discussion of Notice No. I, General Business, be extended until 12.15 p.m.

Mr HOWE-Thus people who can afford to pay very high prices for ei~her new .or est~blish~d housing get the best hous1Og that IS avaIlable 10 the most desirable locations. But the people who cannot afford this housing, the people who are on the margin, do not have that opportunity. It also means a considerable waste of resources because much of the money that changes hands moves between people who are making capital gains on changing land use and shifting property values. Furthermore, many of the prime locations in the towns concerned are being swallowed up by large scale interests that have no roots in the communities concerned and no feeling for traditions in the areas or for the obligations that might have been accepted by long established businesses in these towns.
It is unfortunate that this Government has been so blinkered for example, in respect of the attempts of the Whitlam Government to establish planned growth centres. Surely there were lessons to be learned from this experience and, at the very least some attempt might have been made by the Commonwealth Government to assist with the planning for the development areas associated with resource-based industries. It is quite wrong, for example, that people should have been allowed by the Commonwealth Government to appropriate the benefits of a re-zoning and a rearrangement of land use so that th~ benefit goes to the individuals and large corporatIOns rather than being appropriated for the community as a whole.
The balance of this motion refers to the problems being experienced in the public sector of the community. This flows again from the conservative government's disinterest in the subject of public housing. Whatever one might say about public housing in periods of rapid a~d .ge~eral economic growth it is absolutely essentIal 10 tImes of economic recession. We have a situation, that we on the Opposition side have referred to continuously in this House, of massive waiting lists-up to 100,000 people-for housing for ~ent in the public sector. As a product of receSSIOn, new housing needs which are not being met are also emerging. I refer to young unemploy~d people, older people leaving the work force ear~Ier and being faced with high rents; families want10g their own homes but unable to raise the necessary deposit; special groups in the com~unity with special needs-for example, the maSSIve need for emergency accommodation for divided fami~ies or family in crisis; and the people who are sI~ply poor and who do not have the resources to get 1Oto the private market.
There is now an enormous demand which the public sector is quite unable to meet from existing

Housing

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2353

resources. We are now suffering, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has suggested, from a rundown in public sector housing which certainly stretches over the last seven years. But if one looks back far enough, one will find that with the exception of the period 1972 to 1975 that situation extends back over 20 years. Much of the housing stock has now been sold off. What is left in the public sector is often inappropriate or worn out. The administration of public housing in this country has been generally unimaginative and not innovative. Public housing in this society needs a new image and a new direction. Despite the circumstances, we need to move away from the concept of public housing as welfare housing which stigmatises people and which establishes a separate and lower standard of housing in the public sector. We need to see public housing as it is seen in Scandinavia, not as the residual housing sector but as the leading housing sector. We need to have a public sector which seeks to innovate, one which changes according to different social needs such as has clearly happened in Canberra where the National Capital Development Commission influences the overall pattern of housing.
We need to see public housing as an area of activity which is designed to do more than house the people. That is, it should foster a community in a variety of settings and from a variety of different age groups. This is concerned as much with the social facilities which are provided in new communities or established communities. We need to move in public housing away from a situation in which tenants have few rights and no long term security. We need to see public housing as providing a lead in the technical area of building construction, not so that housing standards can be reduced as in the case of the manufactured house project being flogged by the Department of Housing and Construction. We need to see public housing as interested not merely in new buildings but also in the renewal of cities, making opportunities available for people on a range of incomes to live in any location.
Why should public housing be restructured to the poorest locations? We need to put public housing into a new planning context where it is built as part of a process to ensure the land and housing package is within the reach of ordinary and lower income families. Why is it that we have not seen in Australia innovation such as the new in-town concept which provides increased opportunities for people to live in the city through the acquisition of land which is now obsolete such as, for example, the Newmarket saleyards in Melbourne?

There is still a case for properly planned satellite cities around major urban centres. There is still a need for growth centres such as Albury Wodonga if we are committed to reducing the pressure of population on existing metropolitan areas. There is no area of Government policy which is more depressing than the area of housing and land policy. According to the trends that were announced last week in respect of population, the Whitlam Government was, after all, not that far out in respect of its projections for population at the turn of the century. A population of 20 million people will put considerable strain on Australian resources that are necessary to house that population. It is important that the burden for these developments are shared equitably. This means that we need a national housing policy as part of our overall development policies. The public sector will have an increasing role if for no other reason than it will have to meet the needs of those people who are being forced out of normal housing markets and who may never get into them again. It is important that we begin to think of the public sector in this country with new imagination.
There is no reason at all why Australia should not continue to lead the world in respect of housing standards. However, the time is now ripe for a major revaluation of housing within this country. We need to survey the existing housing stock. We need to look at costs of rehabilitation of existing stock not as a matter that can be left to market forces where anyone on a low income will be forced out of any prime location whether it be Waterloo in Sydney, North Adelaide, or Fitzroy in Melbourne. We need to look at the whole question of tenure within this country on a national basis. We have to find ways of giving people housing security equivalent to ownership and possibly without outright ownership. Of course, housing will need more money and more resources and it should get those resources if for no other reason than it would provide, as the honourable member for Reid argued, considerable stimulation to the economy and more employment. However, the issue is important in its own right.
Housing standards have been one of the most important measures of equity in this country. On the whole people have lived in a similar standard of housing. The contrasts have not been so great compared with the situation, for example, that exists in the United States of America. But this is rapidly changing and is producing an inequity in the community which must be resisted. We need to look at how to stop speculation in housing and land because this is destroying the capacity of governments to act. I believe we have to grasp the

2354 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Housing

nettIe in relation to the whole question of capital and wealth taxation in this country if we are to stop what is happening in terms of property speculation within the major Australian cities. If we are to reduce the range of differences that exist between people and get some equity into the property and housing markets, we will have to look very seriously at imposing taxes at least on property speculation. It does not matter which government is in power, whether it be a Labor government or the present Government. Before long, any Australian government will have to act in this area if it is at all interested in equity.

.We need a new charter for public housing in

this country and a new commitment to maintain

Australia as the best housed nation in the world.

No one would believe that assertion if he looked

in any detail at what is happening in the Aus-

tralian housing market today. He would be aware

of the existence of housing classes. People are

given very different shares of housing resources

and increasingly, certainly in my part of the city of

Melbourne, are embittered by it. In my view there

is a national crisis in housing which urgently needs

examination. We need to look at the whole hous-

i~negbuisltdoicnk~

and at and the

priorities h?using for

fworharteihs asbtiilllitaatrioapn~

Idly growmg populatIOn in this country.

Unless there are fundamental changes in economic policy, none of this will be possible. One cannot separate housing from the overall thrust of the Government's policy. That is why this motion is here. If the Government goes ahead with unplanned. and unregulated resource development, it will dram the resources of the public sector into those aspects of physical infrastructure which will take enormous amounts of capital, and then it will have to cut back on housing, education, health and all of those immediate social needs of people.
If we continue on that course we will divide this nation and destroy our record in relation to housing. We will produce a nation which lacks cohesion and any kind of national identity. This motion is important as it draws attention to the most serious problem facing this country today.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.

Mr CHAPMAN (Kingston) (12.11 )-In responding to the motion moved by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and seconded by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) I seek leave to have that motion incorporated in Hansard.

Leave granted.

The motion read as follows-

That this House~
(I) recognises that the rapid pace and large-scale volume of export-oriented resource development being pursued in Australia is causing widespread dislocation of people from their homes and places of work while acting to drain private funds away from traditional sources of housing finance, and pressure increases in home loan interest rates;
.(2) acknowledges that security of housing for a growing number. of low and middle income earners is being underm!ned by the rising prices of land, housing and finance In the private sector;
(3) condemns the Government for the large cutbacks in public sector housing expenditure which have imposed hardship on people in need and led to a gross imbalance in the national housing stock, and
(4) calls on the Government to expand funds for public ho~sing .and develop an integrated housing policy which wIll address the growing housing problems.

Mr CHAPMAN-The remarks we have heard

from the honourable member for Reid this morn-

ing when moving this motion and from the

honourable member for' Batman indicate very

clearly to us that the left wing of the Australian

Labor Party has been let loose on the last day that

the chamber is sitting for some time. The Labor

Party has managed to hold those members in

check for most of the session so that it could im-

prove its with the

electoral last day,

image over recent of course, it was

tmooonmtuh~s hbutot

hold them in check.

This m~rning we heard the view expressed by the left wmg of the Labor Party, the wing that really controls it when it gets down to the nittygri~ty of policy formation and implementation which could occur if, God forbid, the Labor Party ever again achieved government in this country. We have heard a lot of generalised comments from both of the honourable members who spoke this morning, but in nothing they have said have they sustained by logical argument any valid critic!sm of the policies of the present Government, ~Ither on resource development or on housing polICy. We heard a damning of the profit motive and a damning of economic growth by the two speakers.

Mr Bourchier-They are against home ownership.

Mr CHAPMAN-That they are against home owne~ship is shown as a direct consequence of the damnmg of those two principles. The thing that always amazes me from such contributions is the unquestioning faith the Labor Party has in government decision-making and central govern-
~ent direc~io~. It has an unquestioning and unbelievable faith m bureaucratic intervention in the lives of individuals and over-regulation by government. Of course it also raised the prospect facing home owners under a Labor government of a

Housing

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2355

capital gains tax on the value of their homes. What the Labor Party does not realise is that, to provide the housing it believes is necessary, the economy of Australia must create wealth. The best way to create wealth is to allow free enterprise to do it and to have a situation where there is minimum government intervention, minimum control and minimum bureaucratic direction on the lives of people, so that they can direct their investment and resources where they will obtain the best return and thereby stimulate the maximum economic growth for this country. Then the Government will have the opportunity to do some of the things which the honourable members saw as desirable. But to achieve that the Government must maintain policies of budgetary restraint and it must do that to achieve the lower interest rates which the honourable member for Reid said are necessary.
In recognising that the Government has introduced a housing package, legislation for part of which was passed only yesterday. That housing package takes cognisance of the short-term detrimental impact which the present interest rate situation is having on the capacity of some people to purchase their homes. It addresses that problem quite effectively and efficiently. As that policy comes into operation the home ownership prospects of Australians will be improved. But overall, it is important that the Government give its first priority to economic management and to policies which allow the private sector to create the wealth that is necessary if we are to maintain high levels of home ownership. Australia still retains the highest level of home ownership in the world72 per cent, which is a significant increase over the figure which applied in 1975.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The time allotted for precedence of General Business has expired. The honourable member for Kingston will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day under General Business for the next sitting.
APPOINTMENT OF CLERK, MR D. M. BLAKE
Mr SPEAKER-I wish to inform the House, as is well known to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and to the Manager of Opposition Business-I have also spoken to the three Party leaders-of my intention to recommend to His Excellency the Governor-General the appointment of Mr Doug Blake to succeed Jack Pettifer as Clerk of the House of Representatives. I am pleased to say to the House that there was unanimous support from those five gentlemen to that

appointment. I wish Doug Blake well in his task as Clerk. I am sure that he will discharge his duty in a most meritorious fashion and I am sure that he will maintain the very high standards that have been set by his predecessors. I wish him well.
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the House)-On behalf of the Government I would like to congratulate Mr Doug Blake. He has been reared in a good rugby code, and I have no doubt that he will exercise the same standards of excellence in administering the affairs of this Parliament and upholding ideas. I have no doubt that he will achieve the same distinction here as he has on the rugby field. I do, however, wish him well and I am sure that Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice is in good hands.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford Smith)-On behalf of the Opposition, I extend our congratulations to Mr Blake. We understand he has had a naval career and that ought to fit him well for the combat that is going to come. We are very pleased with the efficiency and skill of Doug Blake. We know he will do well, as you say, Mr Speaker. He has the assurance that he will always have the co-operation of the Opposition, providing we think he is right.
AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP
Ministerial Statement
Mr MACPHEE (Balaclava-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs)-by leave-Since the Citizenship Act came into force in 1949 there have been significant changes in the way Australian society perceives itself. In a number of ways the Act no longer adequately reflects the current values and attitudes of the Australian community. It is timely, therefore, that significant changes be now contemplated. A review of the Australian Citizenship Act has been underway for some time. In this process, the Australian Council for Population and Ethnic Affairs has considered the current legislation and assisted in the formulation of proposals for change. The issues have also been raised with State Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs and they have indicated various areas where changes are desirable. A number of amendments are now proposed and it is timely that the Parliament and the general community should now have the opportunity to consider the proposals and contribute to the review. Once this process of consultation has been completed, a Bill to amend the Act will be drafted and introduced.
The most important feature of citizenship is that it makes an individual an institutional member of the nation. This brings certain rights

2356 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

and responsibilities to participate in the nation's affairs, including government, through the right to vote and the right to stand for election. Citizenship also means that the State will afford the citizen the maximum possible protection when outside the country of citizenship. Citizenship also carries a clear sense of belonging to, and identification with, the nation, its people, its values and its institutions. This is very much a personal thing. Naturally, the intensity of identification or commitment varies from individual to individual. To some people citizenship means little more than the convenience of an Australian passport and the right to return without formality after an overseas visit. For many new settlers it is a solemn undertaking involving a major change in their obligations and sense of identity.
Acquiring Australian citizenship should not require suppression of one's cultural heritage or identity. Rather, the act of becoming a citizen issymbolically and actually-a process of bringing one's own gift of language, culture and traditions to enrich the already diverse fabric of Australian society. Our vision of our multicultural society shares, with our concept of citizenship, a strong emphasis on building a cohesive and harmonious society which is all the more tolerant and outward-looking because of the diversity of its origins. To debate whether citizenship is a right or a privilege can be futile. It should be a right providing a person meets whatever requirements are specified. In another sense it is a privilege bestowed by the Australian community. Citizenship should be seen as a mutual arrangement between the individual and the nation. Each makes a commitment to the other and derives benefits from so doing. Whatever the perspective, the same requirements should apply to all potential citizens without favour or discrimination.
From the current review there has emerged general agreement on the following five matters: Firstly, it is desirable for the entire community to be aware of the benefits and the obligations attaching to citizenship; secondly, the meaning and value of citizenship should be enhanced; thirdly, there should be no discrimination within eligibility criteria for citizenship; fourthly, the provisions of the Citizenship Act should be as objective as possible and subjectivity should be minimised; and, fifthly, the administrative simplicity of the current Act should be preserved. In recent years citizenship has been the subject of considerable discussion within the community and the major parties have devoted time, thought and effort in developing policies on citizenship. The Government is committed to a policy of enhancing the status of citizenship and encouraging

those who are qualified for citizenship, but have not yet applied, to become Australian citizens. There are an estimated 1.2 million such persons in Australia. Citizenship is the symbol of a common national identity and commitment to the nation. A common national identity should be the tie that binds a multicultural Australia together.
We sometimes think of citizenship solely as a status granted by the Commonwealth Government to residents who are non-citizens. Such a perspective is misleadingly narrow. Australian citizenship belongs to all Australians. It is-or should be-important to all levels of government and all of the institutions of our society. Representatives from all tiers of government-local, State and Federal-are welcomed at citizenship ceremonies. The role of local government in conducting these ceremonies is particularly important as it brings the local community tangibly into the citizenship process. It also brings the new citizen into close contact with one of the principal building blocks of Australian society, our system of local government.
The amendments to the Act which I am suggesting for consideration are directed broadly at four goals: firstly, to remove all discriminatory aspects which give preferential treatment on the basis of national origin, sex or marital status; secondly, to eliminate anomalies and reduce subjectivity in criteria for citizenship; thirdly, to clarify and simplify administrative requirements in the application of the Act and remove provisions which are no longer relevant; and, fourthly, to provide for independent review of decisions to deny persons citizenship. At the same time there are a number of technical and other minor amendments which ought to be made in order to update the Act. In the course of community consideration and discussion of the issues, I hope there will be also close examination of the consequential amendments which will be required in the Citizenship Act or in other legislation if the proposals for change are adopted.
In the review of the Act, our first priority was to look at the fundamental concepts underlying citizenship. There is considerable variation in the citizenship laws and policies of other countries. In general, however, they tend to be based on one or other of two concepts: Citizenship by the soil, that is, birth in the country concerned-or citizenship by blood, that is, transmitted by descent. In many cases where citizenship is based primarily upon one of these concepts, there are some concessions also to the other. Australia's approach to citizenship has been a mixture of both principles. As a result, virtually all children born in Australia automatically acquire citizenship. Also, virtually

Australian Citizenship

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2357

all children, wherever they are born, may acquire Australian citizenship upon registration if they have a parent who is an Australian citizen, regardless of whether those children or their parents ever intend to live in Australia or to maintain a connection with this country.
Both of these principles are desirable. In general, the children born in Australia to people who have made their home here ought to be Australian citizens automatically by virtue of their birth here. Equally, Australians who have children while abroad should be able to pass on Australian citizenship and its benefits to those children. And, of course, in a country of immigration such as Australia it is most important that we have a mechanism through which those who were neither born here nor born overseas to Australian parents may obtain Australian citizenship after settling in Australia, getting to know their new country and committing themselves to it.
While supporting all three approaches to the acquisition of citizenship, I recognise that all three are open to abuse and exploitation under certain circumstances. If we value citizenship we should ensure that the laws and procedures which govern it strike a fair and sensible balance between the rights and the freedoms of individuals and the importance of ensuring that the status of being an Australian citizen is not open to abuse. In the present Act the only persons born in Australia who do not automatically acquire Australian citizenship are the children born to foreign diplomats and those born to enemy aliens occupying Australian territory in time of war. This means that a child born to a tourist who is making a visit of a few days to Australia is automatically an Australian citizen for life even though that child may leave Australia immediately and have no further contact with this country. Equally, illegal immigrants who bear children while in Australia automatically acquire Australian citizenship for those children. There have been tragic cases over recent years where such children have been exploited by their parents to circumvent the normal provisions of Australia's immigration legislation and policy. In other cases the acquisition of Australian citizenship by children in this way is sometimes an inconvenience or embarrassment when they return to another country. But whether such citizenship is wanted or not, its acquisition should not be the result of an accident of timing or the consequence of a contrivance to circumvent Australia's immigration arrangements. Rather, it should reflect a personal commitment or a significant attachment to Australia consistent with Australia's interests and laws.

In view of these considerations it would be logical to confine the acquisition of citizenship by birth to children who are born in Australia to Australian citizens or legal permanent residents. A child born in Australia with neither parent in one or other of these categories would thus not have Australian citizenship. That approach, however logical, contains both humanitarian and administrative difficulties. It would mean that some children could be rendered stateless. Australia, both as a humane society and as a party to the International Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, could not condone any approach that would lead to such an outcome. Also the practical administrative difficulties of such an approach would be that evidence of birth in Australia would no longer be satisfactory proof of one's being an Australian citizen. Further documentation showing the citizenship or resident status of one's parents would be necessary and this would impose an unreasonable burden on those Australians who for a variety of reasons are called upon from time to time to provide evidence of their citizenship.
There is a compromise which would eliminate most of the anomalies while avoiding inconvenience to the Australian population at large. This would be to require that where a child was born in Australia to parents, neither of whom was an Australian citizen or legal permanent resident, Australian citizenship would be lost if the child left Australia within five years of birth and did not return to Australia for a total of 12 months in the five-year period following that departure. In this way children who are born in Australia to parents who subsequently secure permanent resident status and remain in this country, would be deemed to have been citizens from birth. At the same time, we would avoid automatically bestowing Australian citizenship on the significant number of children whose families have no plan to continue residence in this country and, in many cases, no wish to see Australian citizenship thrust onto their children simply because of an accident of birth.
A similar issue arises in regard to the acquisition of citizenship through descent. With increasing international travel, more and more Australians are spending periods overseas. It is therefore not surprising that substantial numbers of Australian citizens have children while abroad. Quite properly, most of these parents wish to see their children acquire citizenship of Australia and the consequent right to come back here and to exercise the rights and obligations of citizenship.
In a small minority of cases, citizenship is being passed down through generations by families who

2358 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

have severed their historical ties with Australia and have no intention of returning. If, as it should, citizenship implies a clear mutual commitment between Australia and its citizens, this situation is anomalous. One approach to eliminating this anomaly would be to confine to one generation the passing on of citizenship by descent to the overseas born children of Australian citizens. This would mean that an Australian who had left Australia and settled permanently overseas could pass on his citizenship without further ado to his overseas born children. But those children could not pass it on further to their offspring. While such a principle appears reasonable, it would produce some unfair consequences in some cases unless there are saving provisions governing it.
Such cases would include those families where several generations had travelled overseas and lived abroad in the service of their country so that despite each generation spending a substantial proportion of its time in Australia, several generations of children had actually been born abroad. We could overcome such anomalies by limiting transmission of citizenship by descent to just the first overseas born generation, except where an overseas born Australian parent had spent a period of his life back in Australia-say, three years or more-prior to applying to register his overseas born child as an Australian citizen.
I now wish to turn to an issue which I believe has been troubling many settlers in Australia and which may be contributing to lower numbers of applications for citizenship than might be expected. I referred earlier to 1,200,000 people being in that category. I refer to the oath and affirmation of Australian citizenship. The difficulties which many people have with the oath and affirmation stem from what appears to be a misunderstanding of the concept of Australian sovereignty. People who have grown up in Australia are usually quite familiar with the concept that Her Majesty the Queen while Head of State of the United Kingdom is-quite separately-the Australian Head of State. Some people, particularly new settlers, find the concept quite confusing. Citizens of the United Kingdom often question the need to swear allegiance to the Queen again on becoming an Australian citizen in view of the fact that they already owe their allegiance to Her Majesty albeit as the Head of State of the United Kingdom. Other settlers find difficulty in swearing their new allegiance to a figure whom they identify as being the Queen of the United Kingdom and contend that their allegiance should be to Australia. Of course, in contending that, they overlook the clear constitutional fact that Her Majesty is quite separately Queen of Australia.

Additionally, the current wording of the renunciation has aroused criticism because of a misunderstanding over its meaning. The references it contains to renouncing all other allegiances is often regarded as meaning abandoning one's own cultural heritage when, in fact, this is not the case.
Any change of wording to the oath and affirmation is likely to lead to debate. One option would be a rephrasing giving primary emphasis to the responsibilities of the new citizenship to Australia while clarifying that allegiance to a foreign state or sovereign is only being renounced and not allegiance to cultural heritage. Australia is now the only country in the world to continue to use the concept of British subject status in preference to its own nationality. The United Kingdom itself has moved away from the use of the term 'British subject'. The British Nationality Act of 1981 no longer retains the imperial notion of a British subject. The term will be used to denote principally those people who remain British subjects only because they have no other citizenship. If Australia were to retain its present law, we would be bestowing British subject status on people who would not be considered British subjects even under the law of the United Kingdom. I am sure that no thoughtful Australian would advocate that.
Honourable members will recall that, in the previous parliamentary session, legislation was enacted which provides that, in future, the right to enrol as a Commonwealth elector and to nominate for election to the Commonwealth Parliament, will be restricted to Australian citizens; and that the requirement that British subjects be required to enrol and vote after six months residence in Australia be discontinued. Persons on the electoral rolls at the time the legislation is proclaimed will continue to be entitled to vote. The legislation will be proclaimed as soon as State governments pass similar legislation to enable a uniform, Australia-wide commencement date. As has been agreed before in this Parliament, Australian citizenship should be the basic qualification for voting and parliamentary office. In the light of the recent developments both in Australia and Britain, it is anomalous that the Australian Citizenship Act provides for a status of British subject for Australian purposes, including for the purpose of a range of Commonwealth and State Acts. While we all understand and respect the reasons for the origin and continuation of the term 'British subject', I am sure that the Parliament would agree that there is a strong case for removal of the term from Australian citizenship legislation. However, because of the widespread

Australian Citizenship

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2359

use of the term in other legislation, both Commonwealth and State, which depends on the Citizenship Act definition, removal of the concept from the Citizenship Act should be timed to ensure that no undue adverse implications arise for the operation of affected legislation.
The current Citizenship Act also contains a number of provisions which enabled British subjects to acquire also automatically, Australian citizenship in the past. These provisions were necessary in 1949 when the Citizenship Act came into force, creating the new status of Australian citizenship. They were always intended to be transitional provisions to enable automatic acquisition of Australian citizenship by British subjects who had a connection with Australia at the time when the Act came into force. They also deal with the question of loss and resumption of British subject status in the context of the transitional provisions. These provisions are now 33 years old. They are no longer required and their retention in the Act can no longer be justified. In removing them, however, provision should, of course, be made to protect the existing rights of citizenship and ensure that all persons who became or were deemed to be citizens under the provisions of previous Acts will continue to be citizens. I emphasise that with such changes there would be no adverse effect on British subjects now in Australia.
A final point in respect of the British subject provisions is that the existing Act provides that female British subjects ordinarily resident in Australia who give birth to a child out of wedlock outside Australia may register that child as an Australian citizen. The Act makes no such provision for non-British women, nor for men, who father a child out of wedlock when abroad. Accordingly, it discriminates against all migrant women who are not British and against all migrant men. I am advised that there have been only two such registrations since 1949 when the Act came into force. I believe that this archaic provision should be repealed.
It is also important to recognise that these proposals do not prejudice the interests of British settlers in Australia. On the contrary, they consolidate, on an equal basis, the rights of all groups, mindful of developments overseas and the significant changes in Australian society since the Citizenship Act was first introduced in 1949.
The principal requirements which applicants for citizenship must satisfy are the requirement to be of good character, adequate knowledge of English, residential requirements and a knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. Certain categories of applicants, such as

the spouses of Australian citizens and the aged, are exempted or given concession in regard to some of these requirements. Good character is currently assessed on the basis of a clear criminal record and favourable security assessment although there is no specification of this in the existing Act. I believe that the Act should be amended to reflect the nature of the good character requirement. Additionally, there is a good case for arguing that persons who have been convicted of serious crimes-for instance, sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more-should be ineligible for the grant of citizenship for a specified period, following release from prison while they prove that they have been successfully rehabilitated. This provision, including the relevant period could usefully be written into the Act.
The requirement that an applicant possess an adequate knowledge of English is a controversial issue but should not be so. The Government believes that a basic proficiency in English is necessary to fulfil the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Included in these rights and responsibilities are jury service, the right to stand for elective office and the right to vote. It is surely incontestable that these rights can only be exercised and the responsibilities discharged when an effective knowledge of English is possessed.
It is evident that there are strong views in the community supporting the retention of English language as a requirement of citizenship. English is Australia's national language and therefore the essential language of communication in our multicultural society. It is the language of our parliamentary and judicial institutions. To eliminate the English language as a requirement would result in significant numbers of non-English speaking citizens who would not be able to understand the proceedings of parliament or consider the diverse arguments which often occur regarding national and political issues presented via the English language media. Were this otherwise it could foster the growth of a 'second class citizenship' whose members remained isolated from the general Australian community. If it is accepted that the English language must be maintained as a requirement for citizenship, the issue then becomes the level of proficiency required.
In the early stages of the review, consideration was given to using an independent assessment procedure, possibly administered through schools, whereby applicants would submit a statutory declaration endorsed by appropriate authorities to the effect that a requisite standard of English had

2360 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

been reached. To require such additional documentation would be an onerous burden on applicants. What is required is a minimum established standard, easily measured and tested, whereby those whose ability to speak English is in doubt, can be assessed in a simple way.
The Australian second language proficiency rating scale developed for the Adult Migrant Education Program offers a simple method of conducting such assessments. It would be a relatively simple matter to specify that a particular speaking and listening level will be a minimum requirement to be achieved. This level could well be the minimum proficiency level at which a person may operate as an individual, without day to day language support, in an English speaking community. By using the ASLPR, we would help to ensure a uniform minimum standard for all applicants.
Notwithstanding the importance of a knowledge of English, I do recognise that beyond a certain age many persons find it difficult if not impossible to learn a new language. An exemption from the language requirement is currently offered to persons 60 years of age and over. I believe that there should be provision for lowering the age of exemption to 55 years. In cases of hardship, for persons who have resided in Australia for 20 years or more and who, through time, have thus acquired a reasonable understanding of Australia and its institutions despite their lack of English, a further option would be tQ lower the minimum age for exemption to 50 years.
The residence requirement for citizenship reflects the view that the applicant should have spent sufficient time in Australia to develop an understanding of its institutions, parliamentary and legal systems, language, culture and traditions so that he or she can demonstrate a commitment to, and an association with, the nation. A period of three years has been considered as the minimum requirement for these purposes. That was an enactment of the previous Government and is one which the present Government supports. No country has a shorter residential requirement. Australia's requirement of three years' residence is quite generous in comparison with other countries. For example, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Italy require applicants to have residence totalling at least five years prior to application and in Greece the period is eight years. The previous Government reduced the period from five years to three years in Australia and I would suggest that the three-year residence requirement be retained.

Related to the period of residence is the question of the nature of that residence. There are strong grounds for requiring that residence for citizenship eligibility purposes should be legal, permanent residence. At present any type of residence, even as a prohibited immigrant, can count towards citizenship under the Act. There is a need to revise our definition of residence in order to relate it more clearly to that period which Australian citizens themselves would believe to be necessary to qualify for citizenship. Further, the residential requirements under the current Act are ambiguous. The ambiguity centres on the interpretation of the legislation in regard to the 12-month period of continuous residence which is required prior to the grant of citizenship. The words 'continuous residence' have allowed subjectivity to enter into the interpretation of whether or not the requirement has been met. For example, it can be reasonably argued that it is not necessary for a person to have been continuously present in Australia in order to be considered to have continuously resided in Australia. There are strong reasons for that definition to be tightened up. I would favour that the term 'physically present' be written into the Act.
I appreciate that in these days of high mobility, especially where the applicant's occupation calls for frequent travel abroad, it would be unrealistic for legislation to stipulate that the whole 12 months previous to the grant of citizenship be physically spent in Australia. A possibility is for the legislation to specify that an aggregate period of three years would need to have been spent in Australia over a period of, say, five years, but including a period of 12 months in the two years preceding the grant of citizenship. This would provide both a degree of flexibility and an unambiguous statement of requirements.
Some people do not quite meet one or more of the requirements for citizenship although it is apparent that they will do so within a reasonable time. It has been of concern to me for some time that under the present Act the Minister is unable to defer decisions in such cases. Under the Act, as it is at present, I am required to reject applicants in this situation thereby requiring them to reapply and go through the normal procedure once again. It would be more reasonable from the applicant's viewpoint, and certainly more sensible administratively, to permit deferral of a decision when it is clear that outstanding requirements could be met with the passage of time.
Since 1930 Australia has continuously maintained the view that dual nationality should be

Australian Citizenship

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2361

kept to a minimum. There are international obligations on the Government to maintain this policy. Section 17 of the present Act provides that Australian citizenship is lost if a person, while outside Australia, acquires by some voluntary and formal act other than marriage, the nationality of another country. No substantial case exists for continuing to maintain a difference in whether or not citizenship may be lost for persons who acquire citizenship of another country either outside or inside Australia. Accordingly, a more consistent approach would be for legislation to provide that Australian citizenship is lost if another citizenship is acquired by some voluntary and formal act anywhere in the world, including within Australia. Such loss of citizenship, as at present, should be automatic. However, to cover those cases where citizenship of another country may have been acquired under duress or unwittingly, it is desirable to have a provision in the Act giving discretion to approve the resumption of Australian citizenship to former Australian citizens, in circumstances where they obtained their non-Australian citizenship under duress or unwittingly. The Government will be particularly interested in community views on these issues.
In recent months there has been some debate about the notion that Australian citizenship might be lost if persons are convicted of various offences committed after the grant of citizenship. Such proposals have been criticised as introducing a second class citizenship. It has been argued that, once having accepted someone for citizenship, Australia should not withdraw it unless there were some irregularity in the application, or in the evidence submitted in support of the application, prior to the grant of citizenship. Provisions such as exist in the United Kingdom legislation providing for deprivation of citizenship in the event of conviction within a period of five years from the grant of citizenship of an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than 12 months, appear to me to be alien to the philosophy of Australian citizenship. There is a case, however, for depriving a person of citizenship if he or she has committed a serious offence before the grant of citizenship even though the conviction occurs after the grant.
Deprivation of Australian citizenship under such a proposed amendment would not constitute an additional penalty to that imposed by a court on the conviction of the person concerned. The deprivation powers should be invoked only if an applicant has obtained citizenship by false pretences; in other words, where he has obtained something he was not entitled to. Deprivation is

not automatic under any circumstances. The Minister must consider the full facts of the case and be satisfied that it would be in the public interest to deprive a person of citizenship before he orders deprivation.
The Government recognises the need for avenues ofreview for people who are affected by decisions of a final and binding nature which affect them. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Act, when amended, will confer jurisdiction on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review, on application, decisions to refuse the grant of citizenship, other than on security grounds for which separate review arrangements already exist, and decisions to deprive a person of citizenship. This would be an important new area of jurisdiction for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. At this stage it is proposed that the powers of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be recommendatory, consistent with its existing powers in deportation matters. This would strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the need for review of the exercise of ministerial discretion on individual cases and, on the other hand, the desirability of retaining effective ministerial control over this sensitive area. However, the majority of adverse decisions under the Citizenship Act are not of a permanent nature and in future can be expected to lead to deferral rather than rejection of applications.
Where conditions for the grant of citizenship cannot be met at a particular time, they can often be met subsequently. For example, the failure of an applicant to satisfy the requirement that he has an adequate knowledge of the English language, or that he has an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship, is often followed by a reassessment of his ability to meet those requirements at a subsequent interview. In the case of an inability to meet the residential requirements, a period of further residence will satisfy those requirements. It is not proposed that there be formal review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of deferred decisions. I would propose that decisions to defer applications under the Act will be subject to review, on application, by the Immigration Review Panel which I established earlier this year to provide for the review of a wide range of decisions within the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs portfolio. There will be further Government consideration of these matters following the current examination by the Administrative Review Council of the need for external review under the Migration Act and other legislation administered by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

Australian Citizenship

Another aspect of the Act requiring revision is the definition of 'responsible parent'. The Act currently provides that:
In this Act, unless the contrary appears-
"responsible parent" in relation to a child, means the father of that child or where the father is dead or the mother has been given the custody of the child by order of a court or the child was born out of wedlock and resides with the mother, means the mother of that child.
This is clearly discriminatory and I suggest needs to be removed from the Act. I know that many members of this House share that view. Many women would be alarmed to know that the Act does not allow them as mothers the same rights as fathers in respect of their children's citizenship. I expect that the amended Act will have the term 'responsible parent' replaced simply by the term 'parent' thus placing the mother on an equal footing with the father. Another rigidity in the Act relates to amendment of citizenship certification. Once a citizenship certificate has been granted to an applicant no further certificates may be granted despite clerical errors or errors of fact that may be contained in the original certificate. This has caused embarrassment to a number of our new citizens but, despite this, endorsement of the correct details on the original certificate is the only course open at present. Obviously there is a clear need to rectify this in amending the Act.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have addressed the main issues which need to be faced in the amendment of citizenship legislation and the context in which proposals have been developed. There are, in addition, a number of technical and other amendments which should be included in any Bill to amend this legislation. I seek leave to have a document incorporated in Hansard which itemises all of the suggested amendments for the information of the Parliament and of the public.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows~
REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT 1948
PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE
I.-Citizenship by Birth (a) The child of a temporary resident or prohibited immigrant should automatically lose citizenship if that child departs Australia before 5 years of age and does not resume residence (defined as an aggregate of 12 months physical presence) in Australia in the five years immediately following departure, provided that the parent has not become an Australian citizen or a permanent resident in the meantime, with the proviso that no child should lose citizenship if this would render that child a stateless person. (b) A child born in Australia to a mother who is an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia and a father who is entitled to diplomatic status in Australia is not an Australian by birth. Such a child

should acquire citizenship at birth. This and other discrimination on grounds of sex and marital status should be removed from the Act.
2.-Citizenship by DescentChildren born overseas should acquire Australian citizen-
ship by descent by registration. (a) if they are born to a parent who acquired Australian citizenship otherwise than by descent; or (b) if the parent acquired Australian citizenship by descent, provided the parent has resided in Australia for a total of at least 3 years prior to lodging the application for registration. (c) Registration of citizenship by descent to be effected within eighteen years of the child's birth. Otherwise, such children may only acquire citizenship by grant after meeting the residence and other requirements of the Act.
3.-Registration of Citizenship (a) Section II should specify that citizenship by descent is acquired by registration of citizenship, not birth, at an Australian Consulate within a specified period of time. Registration of birth should be seen as separate from the acquisition of citizenship. (b) A period of 2 years should be set as a transitional period in which those currently eligible over 18 years may be registered as citizens.
4.-Citizenship by Grant-Residence (a) 3 years should be the residence eligibility period for
citizenship. (b) The Act should be changed to specify that the appli-
cant must have been physically present in Australia for 12 months out of the 2 years immediately preceding the grant of citizenship and 3 years physical presence out of the 5 years immediately preceding the grant of citizenship. (c) The Minister should have discretion to count towards residence eligibility for citizenship periods spent overseas or periods of residence in another country in the course of service of benefits to or furthering the interests of Australia. (d) The Minister should have discretion to allow periods of residence before the 5 years period to be reckoned for the purposes of this section.
Type of Residence (a) The current wording of section 38 should be amended by replacing the term 'hospital for the insane' by any period spent confined in an institution whilst declared criminally insane. Additionally, it should be specified that any periods as an escapee from such an institution shall not count towards residence eligibility for citizenship. (b) Section 38 should be incorporated into section 14, which should also specify that the applicant must be a person whose continued presence in Australia is not subject to any limitation as to time imposed by law and that residence for the purpose of section 14 of the Act should commence from the time of issue of an entry permit, unrestricted as to time. (c) In exceptional cases, including significant hardship and disadvantage, the Minister should have discretion to accept periods of legal residence on other than a permanent basis as counting towards residence eligibility for citizenship purposes.
Future Residence Paragraph 14 (I) (h) should be amended to provide for the
intention to reside or continue to reside or otherwise maintain a close and continuing association with Australia.
5.-Character

Australian Citizenship

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2363

(a) The current provision that the applicant be of good character should remain, but a clause should be included in the legislation to the effect that anyone who has been convicted of an offence for which the sentence was 12 months or more imprisonment may not be considered for citizenship until the applicant has spent 3 years outside gaol not as an escapee or on a bond or parole.
(b) A new section should be included in the legislation to specify that the grant of citizenship will be deferred or rejected: (i) where a person is under a probation order, on parole, under periodic detention, released on licence; (ii) while a person is in prison, reform institution or in an institution while declared criminally insane OR while he is an escapee from any of these institutions; (iii) while a person is on trial for, subject to or party to an appeal relating to a criminal offence, except where the sentence has been served.
(c) A new section should be added specifying that 'A person shall not be granted citizenship if, in the opinion of the Minister, to do so would be prejudicial to the security of Australia or contrary to public order in Australia'.
6.~Language Requirements~English is Australia's national language and should be retained as a citizenship requirement. Citizenship Regulations under the Act should include a definition of the English language level required to meet the 'adequate English standard'. This should be judged according to standards set by the Australian Second Language
Proficiency Ratings. Levell + is considered the minimum de-
sirable level for these purposes, i.e. able to satisfy all survival needs and limited social demands. Details of the standard are attached.
7.~Exemptions
(a) Former Australians~Former citizens should be required to meet all statutory requirements other than the length of residence requirement. Rather than a total of 3 years, legislation should provide such persons must have 12 months' physical presence in Australia out of the 2 years immediately preceding grant of citizenship.
(b) Minors~Sub-section 14 (8) should be changed to include only people under the age of 18 years, as 18 years is now the age of majority under Australian law.
(c) Aged Persons (i) the age limit should be reduced to 55 years and people 55 years and over should be exempted only from the English language requirement; and (ii) in cases of hardship the Minister should be given discretion to waive the English language requirement for persons 50 or more if they have 20 years residence in Australia
(d) Mentally Handicapped~Sub-section 14 (2) should be amended to restrict its applicability only to those for whom it was originally intended, i.e. mentally handicapped persons.
8.~Oath of Aliegiance (a) The oath/affirmation should be re-worded. (b) The Minister should be given the appropriate auth-
ority to administer the oath or affirmation of allegiance. Only people who are Australian citizens should have the authority to administer the oath/affirmation of allegiance.
9.~Loss and Reacquisition of Citizenship~under the loss of citizenship provisions:
(a) the words "whilst outside Australia" should be deleted from section 17; and

(b) the Minister should be given discretion to approve resumption of citizenship to former Australian citizens, notwithstanding their inability to meet requirements for grant of citizenship, in circumstances where they satisfy the Minister they obtained their non-Australian citizenship under duress or unwittingly.
10.~Deprivation
(a) Legislation should provide for deprivation of citizenship if the applicant commits an offence before the grant of citizenship for which a conviction occurs after the grant of citizenship and the conviction results in a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more, with the proviso that no person should lose citizenship if this would render that person stateless.
(b) Existing deprivation provisions should remain, and (c) Sub-section 50 (I) should stipulate that the conceal-
ment of a conviction which occurred at any time and in any country is an offence.
11.~Adoption~section 10 of the Citizenship Act should be amended to allow a child resident in and adopted in Australia by an Australian citizen to acquire Australian citizenship automatically upon granting of the adoption order by a court.
12.~Renunciation~Any Australian citizen of full age who wishes to renounce Australian citizenship should be permitted to do so, provided that person has a foreign citizenship or nationality at the time of registration of the renunciation and provided it is not in the national interest to refuse such a renunciation.
\3.~Responsible Parent (a) The definition of 'responsible parent' should be re-
moved from the Act and where this term occurs in the Act it be replaced by the term parent. (b) Section 23 should be amended to ensure that a child is not deprived of Australian citizenship if that child has one parent who remains an Australian citizen.
14.~Section 40~Section 40 which allows the Minister to grant or refuse an application for citizenship without assigning any reason should be repealed. Section 4 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act overrides all other legislation, this rendering Section 40 redundant.
15.~Section 39~Section 39 which allows the Minister to determine finally whether a person was ordinarily resident in Australia should be repealed. This Section is also overridden by Section 4 of the A.D. (J.R.) Act.
16.~Deferral of Decisions~A provision should be included in Section 14 to allow the Minister to defer a decision on an application for any period considered necessary for the applicant to be able to meet the necessary requirements.
17.~Renunciation~Sections 23A and 238 require the Secretary to register all declarations of resumption personally. Where these two section reads 'the Secretary shall' they should read an officer authorised by the Secretary shall.
18.~Gazettal~Sub-section 42 (e) of the Act which requires the publication of the names and addresses of persons who have been granted citizenship, or who have been deprived of citizenship, should be repealed. (Publication in the Commonwealth Gazette can be replaced by a computer printout or microfiche).
19 .~Section 41 ~Section 41 should be corrected~where it refers to Section 16 it should refer to Section 15.
20.~Representations by Statutory Declaration~Sub section 37 (I) should be repealed. This sub-section allows a person to make representations to the Minister in respect of a person who has applied for a certificate of Australian citizenship. The representations are to be supported by a statutory declaration. This provision is superfluous and is not currently used.

21.-Declaration of Intention to Apply-Sub-section 13 (I) should be repealed. This sub-section allows a person to make a declaration of intention to apply for the grant of Australian citizenship. Such declarations impose no obligation on the declarant to apply for Australian citizenship and are now obsolete.
22.-Certificates (a) The legislation and regulations should be amended to
enable the Minister to issue :l new correct certificate, including retrospectively. (b) Section 15 should be amended to provide for the certificate to be issued either before or after the oath is taken.
23.-Name of the Department-Reference to the Department of Immigration should be amended to read Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs whenever the name appears in the Act.
24.-Sub-section 14 (3)-Sub-section 14 (3) should be redrafted to exempt the category of people who have completed a period of National Service, at present unable to take advantage of this sub-section, from the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Sub-section 14 (I).
25.-Power of the Minister under the Act-A provision should be included in the Act to the effect that the Minister may exercise any of the powers or undertake any of the functions included in the Australian Citizenship Act.
26.-Registration of Deaths Overseas-Sub-section 53 (e) should be replaced to allow regulations to be made to cover the proposed new registration of citizenship procedures.
27.-Penalties-The penalties under the Act and the penalties imposed by Regulation, should be revised in line with penalties imposed in comparable legislation.
(To be determined at the time legislation is drafted).
28. - Definition of British subject (a) A decision be made "in principle" to repeal Section 7
which defines the status of all Commonwealth citizens as British subjects. No other country (including Britain) retains, or intends to retain, such a definition of British Subjects or to define its own citizens as British Subjects. (b) Sections 8 and 9, which allow certain Irish citizens to claim British subject status, (but not Australian citizenship) should be repealed when Section 7 is repealed. (c) Section 24, which extends the meaning of British subject to include people who, before 1949, had the rights of British Subjects in Australia but were not British Subjects, should be repealed when Section 7 is repealed.
29.-Expired provisions (a) Section 8A, which was automatically repealed on
December 1975, provided for citizens of Pakistan and of the Republic of South Africa to obtain British subject status. Because this section has no applicability now it is no longer necessary to retain it in the Act. (b) Sub-sections 14 (5) and (6), are expired transitional provisions which permitted British subjects to be granted Australian citizenship without meeting the normal residential requirements of the Act. They ceased to be in operation on I June 1976 and should be repealed.
30.-Transitional provisions (a) Section 25, which specified transitional provisions for British subjects to automatically acquire Australian citizenship at the time the Act commenced in 1949, should be repealed and a new clause inserted protecting the rights to Australian citizenship of all persons

who became or were deemed citizens under the provisions of this section. This will not affect the status of any person in Australia. (b) Section 26, which specified transitional provisions for British subjects without any citizenship, was relevant in 1949 but as all Commonwealth countries now have their own citizenship provisions Section 26 is anachronistic and should be repealed. (c) Sections 27 and 28 which deal with the loss of British subject status, and the consequential status of such persons in 1949 for the purposes of the Act should be repealed or changed when Section 25 is repealed or changed. (d) Sections 29 and 30 which deal with the loss and resumption of British subject status before the commencement of the Act in 1949 should be repealed and a new clause inserted protecting the existing rights of citizenship in that all persons who became or were deemed citizens under these provisions shall continue to be citizens.
31.-Discriminatory provision-Paragraph II (I) (b) (ii) provides for a woman who is a British subject ordinarily resident in Australia, who has a child out of wedlock overseas, to register that child as an Australian citizen even though she (the mother) is not herself an Australian citizen. This provision which discriminates against residents of Australia who are not female Britis~ subjects should be repealed.
ATTACHMENT
REQUIREMENTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SECOND LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY RATING-SPEAKING AND LISTENING (LEVEL 1+)
The ASLPR specifications relating to the above mentioned are set out below:
Speaking and Listening (Levell + )
That level is selected because:
it represents the minimum proficiency level at which a person may operate as an individual without day to day language support in an English-speaking community;
it represents the first level (particularly in the case of speaking and listening) at which a person may exercise limited autonomy and flexibility in the use of English;
it is the first level at which persons may use English as a lingua franca with any real change of communicating;
it is the first level of language use beyond those which can only be used with hesitancy and error in simple, familiar, predictable, routine and commonplace circumstances and situations.
Below the I + level recommended for speaking and listen-
ing there is no autonomy of expression. While the subject can respond, for example, to simple and frequently used instructions in the work situation at level I, he cannot cope with verbal number operations and has great difficulty in using a telephone or understanding radio or television.
Above level 1+ the social use of listening and speaking
skills develop and inter alia persons are able to express feelings, ideas, relationships, etc. with growing precision.
Some key factors that illustrate level I + are listed below:
Speaking
Can cope with less routine situations in shops, post office, bank (e.g. asking for a larger size, returning an unsatisfactory purchase).
Can explain some symptoms to a doctor but with limited precision.
Can initiate an enquiry and can ask for directions or advice.

In the work situation can communicate most routine needs not requiring special technical language and can communicate basic details on an unpredictable occurrence such as an accident.
Listening
Can understand in all situations relevant to survival needs but comprehension is still significantly assisted by face-ta-face contact, careful articulation and slow rate of utterance. Misinterpretations are frequent and in less familiar situations may require repetition, paraphrase or explanation.
Can comprehend only isolated words or phrases in a conversation between native speakers and will fail to understand the subsumed cultural knowledge.
Mr MACPHEE-I thank the House. I hope that there will be an enlightened debate on these proposals in the community and that the debate will serve to focus attention anew on the very nature and meaning of Australian citizenship. I hope that people will forward their views to me so that they may be taken into account. The present review is a substantive attempt to affirm once more the importance of citizenship. Once we have reached general agreement on the question of citizenship, we have progressed significantly in achieving a better understanding of ourselves and of our multicultural society. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the courtesies of the House and for leave to incorporate in Hansard that important summary of proposals.
Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2 p.m.
Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide)-by leave-The Opposition welcomes the opportunity that it has been given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) to consider the Government's thinking in relation to citizenship. This information is contained in the ministerial statement which he made to the House about proposed alterations to the Australian Citizenship Act which the Government proposes to introduce in the Budget session. I welcome the way in which this procedure has been carried out. I am sure that a similar procedure could be followed for many other important issues and that the Parliament could have a great deal more time to look at important business that will come before it so that there can be some sort of public debate on measures before they are introduced into the Parliament. In this case we are dealing with an area that is extremely sensitive. It is one in which people have a wide variety of views and one that has not all that often been the subject of debate in the national parliament.
When the Minister informed me of his intention of bringing this statement before the House today, I took the opportunity of reading through the debates of previous parliaments. I went back to the introduction of the original Nationality and

Citizenship Bill in 1948 by the late Arthur Calwell. That Bill was the forerunner of today's Australian Citizenship Act and it was a very big break with what had been the tradition in Australia for bestowing citizenship on people. It would not be unusual in 1948 for the Parliament to think that Australia would change quite dramatically as a result of the intake of migrants and refugees following the Second World War. It seems to me that in view of our continuation as a country of high migrant intake, and following upon the report tabled in the Parliament on Tuesday which gives us some idea of the demographic changes which may take place in Australia as a result of maintaining a medium to high intake of migrants over the next 20 years, that again we should look at the way in which these people have to abide by the law when seeking citizenship of this country.
No parliament has ever treated this subject lightly. No member of any parliament, since the days of the Calwell legislation, has treated the subject lightly. But we must take into consideration, of course, the massive changes that have taken place in our society as a result of migration. I think the figure given was that something like 38 per cent of people living in Australia now either were born overseas or are the children of people who were born overseas. So the pressures on the laws that affect migrants, of course, come under greater scrutiny today as a result of that raw figure. The migrant communities are far better organised now than they have ever been in Australia's history. They do not want to face the same sorts of hurdles or perhaps the discrimination which has existed in previous legislation which may have favoured one migrant against another. It is to this extent that we can make some comment.
There has always been great difficulty, in the debates on this subject when parliaments have had to consider the way in which we treat people from overseas, because the tradition and history of Australia is that we treated British subjects on a more favoured basis than a person migrating from any other country. I know that the Minister has referred to this. But when one picks up the existing Australian Citizenship Act one sees that any person who migrates here must have a certain status-I am sure that not many do read it but they would get a shock if they were to read about the status of British subjects and the list of countries that we refer to as those countries from which British subjects migrate to Australia. These countries include the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Botswana, Canada, Cyprus, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi,

2366 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, and so on. So it has been a rather ironic feature about traditional migration policies that these countries have all been included in a favoured status section.
To be perfectly honest, we have not treated all migrants equally. For a long time in Australia we had a situation, which does not exist today, in which there was collective support for a White Australia policy. No one desires that to be the case today or to see that policy reintroduced. Nonetheless, although we had this attitude towards British subjects, it was really only towards British subjects who were white. So we are maturing in our attitude towards the peoples of the world and I think in the last few years we have graduated to the extent that we are fast reaching the situation of treating everybody on equal terms.
I must say in relation to the original Nationality and Citizenship Bill 1948 that Mr Calwell made it clear that the Bill was breaking with the tradition of what had been accepted as the common code of migration laws that had existed between Commonwealth countries. When I read the speeches of the conservative members of those days, for instance, the honourable member for Wentworth, Mr Harrison, or the comments made by Sir Robert Menzies, I can understand how difficult it was for the conservatives to come to grips with what was being attempted in Australia in order to give some sort of individual identity to the laws being made in Australia as best suited Australia. From my reading of the debates of the 1950s and the 1960s and even the latest major amendments to the Act by the Whitlam Government in 1973, there is no doubt that there were still people in Australia who were afraid that some attempt was being made to tear us away from the cover or protection or relationship with the Crown. A great deal of attention has been paid to that aspect over the years gone by. I will refer to that specifically during the course of this discussion.
Attitudes are changing quite dramatically in that field as well. The Australian Labor Party, at its last national conference, adopted a policy of seeking that, in the long run, Australia should be a republic. There were many references to the Crown and to the Queen and whether we call Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I or Queen Elizabeth II because she is the first Queen Elizabeth for Australia but the second Queen Elizabeth for the United Kingdom. That is how the debate has gone on. Be that as it may, I believe that the tendency and the momentum for Australia to be a republic will continue to build up. I think even the Young

Liberals adopted a policy of an Australian republic. So the idea is not all that radical. Nonetheless, if those things were to come to pass, there would be radical changes in the words used in those Acts of parliament affecting the people.
There is one thing about citizenship which some people do not seem to understand. I know that many of us who are mixed up with migrant communities tend to believe that we are concerned solely about how they feel about seeking citizenship, about how we lay down the laws and how they react to the laws. But there is another aspect that is equally important and that is, what is the reaction of the migrant community already in Australia as to how those laws will affect incoming settlers. From discussions with the Minister I know that one of the reasons he has introduced this matter so early is in order to give the major migrant communities the opportunity to discuss these measures. But this matter should be open for discussion by the Australian community. There are many people in the Australian community who in their day to day lives have nothing to do with migrant communities but would hold very strong views on citizenship laws. For instance, there are people in the community who advocate that citizenship should not be the basis for enrolling on the electoral rolls. That is not a view that I hold. There are other people who hold the view very strongly that three years is too long to wait to be granted citizenship in Australia, that it should be one year. That, again, is not a view that I hold. Nonetheless, there are many people in the community who would wish to comment on some of the measures that have been mentioned by the Minister in the statement.
The significant feature of the discussion on this subject is that the Parliament tries to have a common aim in seeking out what is best for the incoming settlers and migrants. This matter has had a great deal of discussion and a great deal of debate but it is not something which has tended to divide the Parliament and that has been a good thing. But it has also been very difficult for many members of Parliament and for some people in the community to understand that what we are doing is not necessarily of great offence to Her Majesty in that we are changing a few words to bring ourselves up to date in regard to the way in which laws affecting new settlers ought to operate. I think we have to recognise that in 1982 the swearing of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth from the United Kingdom seems extremely strange to many new settlers from the Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Italy and perhaps even the United States

Australian Citizenship

of America. They find it very difficult to understand that in this great independent nation of Australia they all have to hold up their hands and swear allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I would like to make comments on some of those matters.
Although we consider citizenship to be enormously important and we think a person is extremely fortunate in gaining citizenship of this country, we are faced with the unique situation that hundreds of thousands of people who are granted residence in Australia do not bother to take out citizenship. One wonders why this is the case. People who come from the United Kingdom make up the largest number of settlers who do not take out citizenship. In 1973 we amended the legislation and reduced the period of residence for citizenship from five years to three years in the hope that this would overcome the problem, but it does not appear that time is the hurdle. It appears that the views held by people who do not take out citizenship are a bit more complex than that. I know that my friend the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), with whom I am sharing the time available to the Opposition in this debate, will talk about the hurdle of the English language being a pre-requisite for citizenship. This may be a major barrier.
In the 18 years between 1962 and 1980 2,416,844 permanent settlers came to Australia and 392,000 or 16 per cent of them returned to their homes, leaving a gain to Australia of slightly over .two million people. During the same period 1.4 million of those people took out citizenship, leaving 600,000 who did not. Today, as the Minister said in his statement, there are 1.2 million people who have the residential qualifications to take out citizenship and who have not done so. We do not have any problem with refugees taking out citizenship because they take the view that there is nowhere else for them to go-they are here permanently. My experience, especially in my own electorate of Port Adelaide, which has a high level of Indo-Chinese refugees, is that these people take out citizenship as soon as they are eligible. But for some people who perhaps have the view that they can return to their homeland the need to do so does not seem so urgent. However, 800,000 of the 1.2 million people who have not taken out citizenship are British subjects. These people from the United Kingdom have not bothered to take out citizenship in this country. I think that point has also to be taken into consideration when we talk about how successful we have been and what a great honour it is for people to have citizenship of this country.

Another matter to which I would like to refer is the oath of allegiance. This matter has been discussed over a long time. Conservative people, and I respect their views, think it is very important that we continue to regard Queen Elizabeth as the sovereign of Australia and make sure that we pay due notice to the role she plays in the Constitution of this country. In 1973 Labor tried to change the legislation. However, the Senate rejected Labor's proposition. It would still be my view that allegiance in terms of citizenship should be to Australia. I give notice that when legislation on this subject is brought before the House during the Budget session I will be endeavouring to persuade enough people in this Parliament to accept that it is not necessary to insist on all the words that have been used since 1948 and were insisted upon by the Senate in 1973. Perhaps the process could be made a little simpler. It would be a lot more attractive to people if they merely could swear allegiance to the Constitution of Australia, which is really what they would be doing.
It is very difficult for people to cast off all their allegiances to or relationships with their home countries. A lot of people in the community object to the words that are used in the citizenship ceremony in that they consider we may be attempting to make them break off the relationships that they have with their home countries. It is impossible for us to attempt to do that. I want to give three classic examples which illustrate to everybody in Australia the way in which these communities maintain their very strong relationships with their own countries. The first concerns the recent visit of the Greek President. Although the Greek President is looked upon politically as being very much a conservative and not part of the new wave of radicalism which has come to Greece with the election of the PASOK party of Mr Papandreou, nonetheless the Greek people of Australia turned out in their tens of thousands to welcome him, to listen to his speeches and to show solidarity. Irrespective of what words we use in a citizenship ceremony, there is no doubt that the Greek Government takes a different attitude to Greek nationals who migrate to other countries. Therefore, we should not attempt to try to cut off the links that Greek people may have with their own country or anybody else. That is one example.
Another example is the recent earthquake in Italy. Again we saw a massive demonstration of the Italian community of this country coming to the aid of people who had been affected by that terrible earthquake just out of Solaro in southern Italy. Again, this is a reflection of how close the people of the Italian community are to their own

2368 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

people. The third example, which is still relevant in terms of the statement we. are discussing, is the solidarity of the Polish communities in Australia with what is happening in Poland. No one can say that when a Polish person takes out citizenship of Australia he is renouncing all sorts of allegiances to Poland. Many people of Polish descent in Australia are taking a very keen interest in what is happening in Poland and are trying to assist the restoration of some of the democratic procedures that were adopted by Solidarity during its very short lifetime in Poland.
I do not think we should make it appear as if by trying to bestow something on them we are asking them to break off their relationship with their home countries. In fact, in the case of the Greek people, I am continually told at functions which I attend that perhaps more is being done by the Greek people in Australia to retain their culture than is being done in most of the major centres in Greece itself. People who visit Australia from Greece are amazed at the way in which Greek culture is being retained by the major Greek community of this country. I think that is a very important aspect of what we are doing. I think that the words that are to be used in the ceremonies must be examined extremely closely. I know that, in the time between now and when the Act is introduced, there will be many comments on this sort ofthing.
Another matter that I wish to raise in relation to the review of the Australian Citizenship Act and what a person inherits by virtue of taking out citizenship is the question of deportation. From time to time, there are cases in which people have had long periods of residence here. Permanent residence has been granted. They have been here for a long time, have raised their families, have paid taxes and perhaps have voted in local government elections, as they can do whether or not they are citizens, but yet they fall foul of the law and are subject to deportation. I find it very difficult to believe that a person who has been here for 10, 20 or 30 years, playing the role of a citizen although not having been through the formal ceremony of citizenship, can still be subjected to deportation.
It seems that we will have to sort out our attitude to people to whom we give permanent residence because, as I said earlier, the ramifications of such a penalty apply in Autralian now to 1.2 million people who have not taken out citizenship. If we are to maintain a very high migrant intake, that number is likely to grow very quickly. It underestimates the role that has been played by the person until he has, perhaps, committed an offence and received the penalty. In some cases it

can prove to be a double penalty, because the person can receive a civil penalty in the form of gaol or a fine, and then face deportation on top of it.
This is not a problem that is being faced just by Australia. It is faced by all countries that have a high migrant intake. The Supreme Court in the United States has pondered at length about what recognition ought to be given to a person who remains a long term resident of that couf'try without taking out citizenship, in relation to the desire of a government at any given time to deport that person. That is also something which ought to be part of the discussion while we are going through an overview of the Australian Citizensip Act.
On the question of discrimination, we talked about the British terminology earlier, and I have no doubt that we have reached a stage at which everybody, by and large, believes that all migrants should be treated equally. I would not expect that we shall face too much trouble about that, with the complementary legislation which will be required in the various States to see that we have uniform terminology in all of the Acts necessary not only in this Parliament but also in the other parliaments of Australia. On the question of areas of discrimination on grounds of sex in the current Act, to which the Minister has referred, there are a couple of other areas which should be looked at. Section 10 subsections (2) and (3) discriminate against mothers. Section 11 subsection (6) discriminates against fathers. Subsection (3) also discriminates against fathers. Perhaps the common use of the term 'parent' could be inserted in those areas.
Another matter which is always the subject of great controversy concerns the taking out of citizenship. It is the question of the person's ability to speak the English language. I do not think that anyone here who has been through any of the material that has been made available to us, particularly during the review of NUMAS-the numerical multifactor assessment system-would have any doubt as to the benefits that a person has as a result of having a grasp of the English language. It is not just in terms of being able to communicate in day to day matters with other people in the community, but it is a question of education, of seeking jobs and of job mobility. There is a whole range of absolutely essential requirements which will be based upon a person's ability to speak English.
No one should underestimate our desire to see that everybody has a grasp of the English language. But I do not think that we can boast about what was done in the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s about making facilities available for

Australian Citizenship

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2369

people to speak English. I do not think that we led the world in setting up crash courses in English for people who arrived here during those years, in their hundreds of thousands, to make them sufficiently capable in English to do the sorts of things to which I have referred. So we have here now many people of various ages who find the English language very difficult. Even today there are those who are prepared to criticise the present arrangements for people to learn the English language, but by any standards the facilities made available today are light years ahead of what was available in years gone by.
So I think that we shall have to look closely at the problems and at what we sayan adequate grasp of English is for people taking out citizenship. I do not believe that it is a question of just looking at the raw figures. I believe from the department that last year about 1,100 people out of 60,000 were refused citizenship on the basis of not having sufficient knowledge of the English language, which means that it is about 2 per cent, but there may be thousands of others among the 1.2 million who have not taken out citizenship who feel inhibited and embarrassed about applying for it because they do not believe that they have reached the level of knowledge of the English language which would get them through the necessary test.
I welcome the opportunity of commenting on this matter. We will treat it as enormously important. On this side of the House, we are commited to a review of the Australian Citizenship Act as soon as w!! come to government later this year. We would have done this anyhow. This is a good opportunity for members of parliament to go back to their own migrant communities and discuss the matter with them.
Dr THEOPHANOUS (Burke)-by leave-I wish to thank the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) for giving me an opportunity to speak briefly on this important statement. In the statement, the Minister points out that acquiring citizenship is, and ought to be:
a solemn undertaking involving a major change in their obligations and sense of identity.
I think that it is true to say that most migrants share that view. It is quite often a moving experience, even a traumatic experience, to relinquish one's former national loyalties and embrace those of a new nation. We can assure the Minister that we share his desire to sustain the value of citizenship and the serious commitment which it involves. We also welcome the Minister's expressed

desire to ensure that citizenship is granted within the context of the understanding that Australia is a multicultural society. However, there are certain aspects of the Minister's suggestions which, in my view, are likely to frustrate the achievement of that general goal, and other aspects which require more critical analysis.
I begin with the criteria for citizenship. The most controversial of the four criteria, in our view, concerns that called 'adequate knowledge of English'. The Minister is right in emphasising that this criterion has been applied subjectively in the past. But the situation was worse than that. This criterion was misused in the past to deny citizenship to persons whose political views were not acceptable to the Government. This is a major reason why most ethnic communities have adopted a hostile attitude to this provision.
Another reason, however, has been the failure of the Government actively to support programs to teach migrants English, so that they could achieve the level required. Although the situation has improved after the Galbally report, there are still only about 2,000 people a year, throughout Australia, in full-time English courses; yet a conservative estimate of the number of people badly in need of these courses is half a million. To give the House an idea of the dimensions of the problem, if immigration stopped tomorrow, it would take 20 years for us to put all the eligible people through that program-and that is only if we increased the program ten-fold to 25,000 people a year.
In this context, it is wrong for the Government to insist on the English requirement. Let it improve its services in this area and its good will will be more likely to be accepted. It is the policy of the Australian Labor Party to remove the English language requirement for citizenship. The Minister says:
To eliminate the English language as a requirement would result in significant numbers of non-English speaking citizens who would not be able to understand the proceedings of parliament or consider the diverse arguments which often occur regarding national and political issues presented via the English language media.
This comment is, in my view, based on ignorance. The Minister is aware of the existence of the ethnic media. Newspapers such as Neos Kosmos, El G/oho, the Hellenic Herald, La Fiamma and many others have comprehensive coverage of news and political affairs. There is also the important role of ethnic radio in this matter. I challenge the Minister to produce evidence that after three years of arrival migrants with little English have less knowledge of political processes than those for example from the United Kingdom.

2370 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Australian Citizenship

Surely interest is relevant here. Most non-English migrants come from countries where political knowledge and involvement is much higher than in Australia itself. This is born out by the increasing role of the ethnic communities in the Australian political processes. All this is not to deny that English is Australia's national language. It is simply to deny that achieving quick knowledge of it is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for an understanding of the obligations of citizenship.
I turn to the other criterion which concerns the length of stay in Australia to be eligible for citizenship. This is an area about which there can be considerable debate and genuine disagreement, and no one view is infallible. Nevertheless, I think there is a good case for reducing the period to two years. One pragmatic reason is simply that it takes at least six months and up to 18 months for an application to be processed, especially now that the razor gang cuts have limited the capacities of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. So that, even if people can apply after two years, many will not receive their citizenship until the three years are up anyway. A further reason for changing the criterion to two years is, in my view, because it is a fair compromise between the view of the Ethnic Community Councils, which seek to reduce the period to six months or 12 months, and the view of those who want to keep the three-year period because they believe that somehow a three year period is required for people to learn about the obligations of citizenship. I believe two years is more than adequate for a basic understanding to be achieved by those who are keen to become citizens.
A further criterion is that of criminal record and security assessment. Whilst we on the Opposition side have no objection to the provisions relating to criminal records, we are concerned about the rejection of citizenship on the basis of security recommendations. Such provisions can often be abused for political reasons, and there is no doubt that they have been so abused by some previous Liberal-National Country Party governments.
Mr Donald Cameron-When?
Dr THEOPHANOUS-I will give examples later. When Labor comes to power we will seek to review these security provisions and the appeals available in relation to them.
The honourable member for Port Adelaide has also referred to the situation in which the Minister has power to deport permanent residents of long standing who have been convicted of offences and who have served their sentences. This situation could in fact backfire. The Minister may find that many persons will apply for citizenship precisely

to avoid such deportation contingencies and this surely would be the most unacceptable reason for applying for citizenship. We believe people who have been here for many years as permanent residents should not be penalised in that way. Once they have been punished for their crimes, that should be the end of the matter.
The Minister mentioned a fourth criterion, that is, the knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. But there is nothing in the statement as to how we might enhance that knowledge. It seems to me that we ought to be thinking about an education program not only for people of migrant origin but also for the children in our schools to ensure they become more aware of the responsibilities of citizenship. In fact, such programs have been implemented in many other countries.
I want to say something about the question of immigration ceremonies. The Minister mentioned the important role of local government. Local governments are important in the role they play in the performance of immigration ceremonies. But what has this Government done in relation to this matter? It has cut the funds to local government to enable them to perform these ceremonies. The Minister has told us about the importance of citizenship and that it should be taken seriously. He has told us about the importance of citizenship ceremonies. But what does the Federal Government do? It cuts off funds. I know that many councils are now in a position in which they completely resent this cut-off of funds. In fact, they have written to the Minister and to the Government complaining in the strongest terms about this cut-off.
I just want to say one final word and it relates to the oath of citizenship. This matter has been discussed quite a bit by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Let me say that we believe the form of words put forward by the Australian Labor Party when it was in government, but which was rejected by the Senate, and which called for an oath of allegiance to the Australian Constitution would be an excellent way of resolving the kind of problem referred to by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, that is, the difficulty that people have in expressing loyalty to the Queen. This is the sort of approach that is taken in the United States where people make an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. I believe if we adopted this practice in Australia it would strengthen the respect that we have for the Australian Constitution.
With those points in mind, I welcome the statement of the Minister. In particular I welcome the

Standing Committee on Road Safety

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2371

opportunity for debate on this matter. I am sure it will be extensively debated by the ethnic communities in particular and by many Australians of Anglo-Saxon origin. I hope we will be able to reach a bipartisan position on this matter. I have been informed that it is likely that the present Minister will be leaving us as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and I can only say that is a matter of regret.
Mr DONALD CAMERON (Fadden)-by leave-I simply want to observe that the views espoused by the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), who has the credentials of being born on the other side of the globe, are not necessarily the views of all the people who have come to this country from across the ocean. In relation to the point raised by the honourable member for Burke concerning people taking out citizenship to avoid deportation, if my memory serves me correctly, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) made some reference to revocation in his statement. I suggest that the Minister should be empowered to revoke Australian citizenship if within, say, 10 years, somebody has committed and continues to commit major crimes because Australia would be far better off without these people regardless of whether they want to parade under the--
Mr Young-But they cannot get their own citizenship back. Where would you put them?
Mr DONALD CAMERON-Many people who renounce their citizenship at our ceremonies are regarded by their country of origin as still being citizens of that country.
Mr Young-Not the United States.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-No, not the United States.
STANDING COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY
Mr KATTER (Kennedy)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Road Safety, I present the report of the Committee on education, training and licensing of drivers, including the special needs of disabled drivers, together with the transcipt of evidence and extracts from the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
Mr KATTER-by leave-I speak to this report with a little consternation because I believe that the time to debate this terribly important and vital subject has been cut down, and I resent it strongly. Before I proceed with the more formal part of my statement, I would like to highlight one or two points. I do not do this in the usual manner in which a committee chairman thanks the

members of his committee, his secretariat and his consultants. I do so in a very special way because there is not a member of that group I have just mentioned who does not carry a very serious sense of responsibility. When anyone has to deal with measures that may in some way counter the 10 deaths a day on the roads, the matter must be taken very seriously. I am proud to say that the members of the group I have around me do just that. Hence, if I appear to be a little upset about a further limitation of time, I can assure honourable members than I am.
I will briefly refer to the history of this whole operation. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety commenced some time ago as a select committee but it was found that its work had to continue; so it became a standing committee. The Committee, in subsequent references, has dealt with various aspects of road safety, including the passenger vehicle, the heavy vehicle-road-trains and so on-the motorcycle, the bicycle and eventually we graduated to human behaviour in various phases.
This report which has just been tabled was produced as part of a general investigation of the influence of human behaviour on road accidents. The behaviour of road users is one of the major factors contributing to road crashes. Although road accidents are rarely caused by a single factor, it is usually the behaviour of the driver that is the final link in the causes of a crash. The Committee attempted to determine why drivers behave recklessly and to see it any changes in methods of education, training and licensing could improve driving attitudes and behaviour.
The inquiry brought to light some surprising information. For example, there is a widely held misconception that it is a lack of driving skill which causes most crashes when, in fact, evidence shows it is bad attitudes to driving rather than a lack of skills. This is the human reaction-the attitude to the whole matter of driving a motor car; the acceleration; on many occasions the emotion which goes with getting into a motor car and burning it up because a person has had a row with someone, lost his money at the races, or for some other reason.
Different forms of training appear to have little influence on driving skills or subsequent accident involvement. Although there is often a call for better training for drivers, the experts believe this would not achieve much. In fact, there is evidence which indicates that drivers who have undertaken advanced driving courses may be more likely to have a crash as they often become over-confident

2372 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Standing Committee on Road Safety

and believe their skills will protect them. As a result, the trend is not to drive defensively, and that is regrettable. However, is it a different story for motor-cyclists. The chance of being involved in a crash is seven times higher for motor-cyclists than drivers. Almost 30 per cent of motor-cyclists killed are riding with learner's permits. Studies have shown that many young motor-cyclists do not even know how to stop a bike effectively. Manipulative skill has been shown to be far more important as a cause of crashes for motor-cyclists than drivers. The Committee has therefore recommended making successful completion of a course of basic riding skills a condition for obtaining a motor-cycle learner's permit.
The Committee also believes experience is worth a great deal to novice drivers. Given the fact that young drivers are involved in many more crashes than drivers of older age groups, the basic aim of licensing should be to allow new drivers to gain driving experience as safely as possible. Although it is not possible to put an old head on young shoulders, the Committee believes one way of easing young drivers on to the road would be through a graduated system of licensing. Rather than give a novice driver a full licence after passing the licence test, under a graded system the licence would still have certain conditions on it. For example, although permitted to drive alone during daylight hours, the new driver may still need to be accompanied by a fully licensed driver at night when the risk of crash is greatest. Progress to the next phase would be dependent on the driver having a clean driving record. The novice driver may not be permitted to drive with any measurable blood alcohol level until one year after obtaining a full licence, and how important that would be if applied. The Committee has recommended that a pilot study of graduated licensing be undertaken.
The Committee also found that road safety education must begin at a very early age, before a child goes to school. Parents must take a greater responsibility for teaching their children road safety. Parents must also be made aware of the importance of setting a good example. Even very young children imitate parents' road crossing behaviour, attitudes to police and other drivers. We heard some very telling evidence in that matter. For road safety education in schools to be effective, research has shown that it must be integrated into the school curricula, and not presented in isolated sessions. Several States are moving in this direction with promising results.
The Committee is also convinced of the importance of first aid training. The first people on the scene of an accident are often other drivers. If

these people had a knowledge of basic first aid, in many cases injuries could be minimised. Manyaccident victims die from lack of oxygen simply because onlookers do not know how to clear breathing passages. There is another widely held misconception that accident victims should be left where they are until medical help arrives. This is not true. A few very simple measures are often all that is needed to sustain life until experts arrive. The Committee has recommended first aid education be given in schools, and that new licence applicants be required to produce evidence of first aid training.
The Committee has been constantly hampered by a lack of basic research findings. At present traffic violations are kept on a driver's record, but not accident involvement. It is not possible to assess the effects of policies designed to reduce road accidents if the driving history of those who have had accidents is unknown. For example, we cannot be sure of the effects of certain education or training programs because there is no way of monitoring the accident involvement of those taking part in special programs over a number of years. Accidents are still comparatively rare events for individuals, and records may need to be kept for 10 years or more before a correlation becomes clear. This is not possible at present. The Committee has forcefully recommended the introduction of compatible driver records systems, incorporating accident involvement, in each State and Territory as a top priority. This is perhaps the most important recommendation this Committee has ever made in this classification. The implications of this recommendation go far beyond this current inquiry, and have ramifications for all research attempting to cut the road toll.
The Committee would also like to see a common standard of licensing applying Australia wide-that is very important-which would eventually give rise to a uniform Australian licence, with the States maintaining responsibility for administrative control.
During this inquiry the Committee considered the special needs of disabled drivers. The Committee was indeed fortunate to receive so much help from many groups representing the disabled and from disabled people themselves. It was quite remarkable to see the courage, the independence and the desire of these people to remain mobile and to do all they could for themselves. Their evidence provided Committee members with valuable insights into the particular difficulties encountered by the disabled. It became clear early in the inquiry that disabled people wishing to learn to drive in country areas do not have easy access to special facilities located in the major

Standing Committee on Road Safety

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2373

centres. In fact, what facilities do people in country areas have in regard to anything? The Committee has recommended that regional rehabilitation units in additional country centres be provided as a matter of priority. The Committee was also concerned to learn that there are no acknowledged standards of safety and quality for driving aids for the disabled, and has recommended that the feasibility of introducing such standards be assessed, together with procedures for checking that such aids are installed in vehicles safely.
Many disabled drivers do not know where to go for help and advice. Many may not be aware of new engineering developments which may assist their mobility in dramatic ways. The Committee has suggested that a manual of information and advice be developed by the Commonwealth for disabled motorists, including details of vehicle modifications and aids available both in Australia and overseas. I would like to stress that the recommendations I have highlighted plus all the others in the report not only take into account the short term benefits but also are directed towards continued improvement in road safety in the future.
Before sitting down I make two points. The first is in regard to the States. An impression may have been given recently that the Committee was critical of action either taken or not taken by State governments. I place on record, as one who has chaired the Committee for a number of years and who has been on it for an even greater number of years, that the States have given great cooperation. The Committee is concerned about particular aspects, for example, random breath testing. I could name many others. We want a much greater exchange of information. The other point is that I hope that even at this very late stage the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and the Government Whip will reconsider confining this debate to a very limited time, especially after one honourable member from the other side of the House spoke for half an hour on a subject that I think should be secondary to the matter of 10 good Australians being killed each and every day of the week.
Mr CHARLES JONES (Newcastle)-by leave-I support the remarks of the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), and support the recommendations of the Committee, which total 34. In my opinion the Committee has done a very good job. All of these recommendations were carried unanimously by the Committee after a considerable amount of thought and discussion. The

Committee has brought to the Parliament and to the community a report that has been adopted unanimously by both sides of the Parliament. This is unique as far as parliamentary reports are concerned.
One of the issues on which I want to place emphasis is the fact that today members of Parliament have to accept full responsibility for the tragic road toll. When some members of Parliament talk about introducing random breath testing and similar measures we hear a lot about the infringements of and great instrusions into civil liberties that those measures will bring about. All I say on behalf of the people who advocate random breath testing is that it is a hell of an intrusion into my civil liberties if some drunken clown ploughs into my car or that of some of my family or friends. We must have the guts in this place to stand up and advocate it, and to hell with the drunks and the breweries in the community. I support the words uttered by the Chairman of the Committee relating to so many people being killed on the roads over the Easter period. Something like 57 per cent of all road fatalities involve alcohol; so somebody has to take the intiative. I am very proud to express my view in this place as strongly as I can in support of random breath testing or anything else that will reduce the road fatalities with which we have to contend today. As far as the Victorian Parliament is concerned, the then Government and the then Opposition-it is now the Government-both supported this proposition and today 800 to 1,000 people in Victoria are still alive who would have been dead had those parliamentarians not had the courage to get on with the job. I strongly support that proposition.
I refer to the fifth recommendation in the Committee's report, although I do not have time to read it. I believe all these issues, including education and how we should licence people, are useless unless there is a central body to evaluate these things as well as the recommendations being made and all the results. Even though the Commonwealth has only a second rate Office of Road Safety-the original Road Safety and Standards Authority should never have been disbanded-I hope that that body, under the direction of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), will carry out the necessary research to test not only all of the various schemes introduced by recommendations of this Parliament but also the various methods of education, licensing and the like that are introduced by State governments which, let us face it, have the responsibility of legislating for the vast majority of people in this country. I believe it is an excellent idea to carry out an evaluation of

2374 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Standing Committee on Road Safety

the things being done. The same thing can be said in regard to determining the effect on people of the advertising programs of, for example, breweries. Although they advertise, they say, only their brand of alcohol, the effects on people cannot be separated. We cannot just say that they are trying to influence people to drink a particular beer as against another beer. It is not on. It all has an adverse effect.
One could go through the whole of this report and commend it paragraph by paragraph. The Government has imposed a time limit on the debate; so we have to keep to some of the major issues. Recommendation 11 suggests that people enter into apprenticeships to drive heavy vehicles. I thought the submission made to the Committee in this regard was excellent. It is something that should be pressed for because there is not a shadow of doubt that behind the wheels of some of those heavy vehicles today are some first class murderers. I say that because of the way they drive. They drive juggernauts that weigh 20 to 30 tonnes and they take right of way whether they have it or not. One has only to look at the way they career around the roads of this nation to know that many of the people driving them are irresponsible and have no consideration for anyone else. They have hellish debts hanging over their heads, having committed themselves to the purchase of these juggernauts. The result is that they do things in an endeavour to get the necessary finance to keep themselves in business and they do not give a damn about anyone else on the road. If this proposition is feasible, practical and will produce better drivers-according to the company that put it forward, that is the case-then I think it should be given a go. One could go on and on.
Mr Bourchier-You are finished.
Mr CHARLES JONES-I am advised that I am finished. I briefly make some comment on the last four or five recommendations which deal with the physically handicapped people of the community. These people made submissions to the Committee in which they were obviously seeking the assistance of government. I believe the recommendations of the Committee should be given heed to and wherever the Government can do something about it, through the Minister for Transport, then it should be done to assist these people. They have a difficult enough life to live with the disadvantages they have and therefore we should do all that we can to assist them. I strongly recommend to the Minister, to the Parliament and to the community that the recommendations of the Committee be put into effect as quickly as possible.

Mr GOODLUCK (Franklin)-by leave-I would like first to support the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. There have been no political intrusions into the Committee, and no political point scoring at all. I am sorry I have to speak on behalf of my colleagues who probably will not have time to say what they would like to say.
Mr Groom-Blame the Whip.
Mr GOODLUCK-No. I will not blame the Whip. We worked in a constructive way with the sole purpose of endeavouring to reduce the road toll in Australia. Ten people die on the roads every day. One in ten, or 10 per cent is invariably a young motor cyclist under the age of 21 years. Pandemonium ensues and a hue an cry is raised when we hear of 30 people dying as a result of war. But every weekend 20 to 30 people die on the roads and we take it for granted. Of course, we worry about the aftermath. We know that there will be a flow-through effect on the family and that untold misery will be created, but such tragedies occur day after day.
This Committee has been established for seven years. I agree with the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), when he says that all of a sudden we are beginning to repeat some of the things that we have said and done, because the situation changes daily. Big trucks are getting faster and wider; roads probably are not as good as they were; and we now find we have something new to look at-the terrible tragedy that is occurring in Queensland as a result of the use of large trucks. The circumstances are changing and governments, both Federal and State, must change with them. Our Chairman is kind and polite to all but I believe that the States indulge in petty jealousies. If one State thinks it can outscore the other it is sometimes afraid to bite the bullet and do the right thing in the interests of road safety because another State perhaps Victoria or Tasmania may already be doing it. We have to forget about such pettiness. More money is required at the national level. More advertising and more effort should be put into road safety. We all know it. We sit here week after week and talk about the facts about the number of young people who die. We pay good lip service to the problem, but unfortunately that does not reduce the road toll; it is going up. The graph is rising not heading down, so we need to do more about it.
I commend the Chairman of the Committee and his staff, who have done such wonderful work. We need to do more and I hope that we can

Standing Committee on Road Safety

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2375

continue our efforts. Incidentally, I get a bit sick of some of the committees on which I serve, but this Committee is worthwhile. There is no point scoring. We all forget about silly politics and get down to the main task of working in the interests of the country.
Mr MILTON (La Trobe)-by leave-I believe I have just three minutes in which to say a few words in relation to the report of the Standing Committee on Road Safety entitled 'Education, training and licensing of drivers'. I express my regret that so little time has been made available for the discussion of this most important report. I understand that Committee members have not been able to speak, and that is deplorable. I thank the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), who has given up his own time to allow me to say a few words. He too fully endorses the recommendations of the Committee. I commend the Committee on the comprehensiveness of its report and the positive recommendations which are contained therein. There is amongst honourable members on both sides of this House a great concern regarding the high incidence of death and serious injury arising from automobile accidents. Congratulations are due to the Committee for aiming, in the recommendations, to alleviate this most serious problem.
However, I have one reservation about the section in the report headed 'Advanced Driver Training'. As I have been granted only a few minutes to make my comments and an even shorter time to read the report, I will be brief. My concern relates to the last sentence of paragraph 156, which concludes with the following words:
. . . advanced driving courses are not considered as valuable in improving road safety as defensive driving courses.
I caution the Committee regarding the apparent arbitrary nature of the evidence that it evaluated in coming to its conclusion about advanced driving schools. I am aware of one such school which has received a number of commendations from major commercial companies in relation to the considerable improvement in the driving techniques of their employee drivers and the consequent reduction in accidents following completion of the course. Collision costs were reduced dramatically-by between 400 per cent and 500 per cent in some cases-as a result of participation in the course. The testimonial to which I refer makes it clear that the major companies concerned would not agree with the critical comments of the Committee. In fact, my analysis of the course provides proof of the truth of the statement in the brochure of the school that the course is one which covers tuition in defensive driving and vehicle constraint in an emergency situation,

that is, collision avoidance. I make the point that in view of the difficulties involved in the evaluation of advanced driving training courses-as was admitted in the report-the Committee should reconsider its critical comments in relation to such courses.
JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE
Mr DOBIE (Cook)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I present the Committee's report on The Gulf and Australia.
Ordered that the report be printed.
Mr DOBIE-by leave-This report represents a continuing interest in the Middle East region by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Being conscious of the work done by previous committees, this report refers to and attempts to provide some continuity with those other reports. However, it focuses on the countries on the Gulf littoral-Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The political situation in the Gulf is complex. The Gulf is a region of dynamic change and uncertainty. Factors outside the immediate Gulf region having a strong bearing on political developments to which the Committee had to address its attention include the Arab-Israel dispute and the Palestinian question. Further afield, the economic importance of the Gulf to the industrialised world means that it has become a region where the West in general, and the United States in particular, is keen to secure access to oil, and secure a favourable strategic position for this access to continue. Against this background, Australia's relations with the Gulf are considered. It is also against this background that the report has been organised.
The Sub-committee has been charged by the full Committee to 'monitor' the situation in the Middle East. The Sub-committee held its first public hearing with this reference on 12 February 1980. Its most recent public hearing was held on 14 April 1982. During that time it received 64 submissions, heard 55 witnesses, and took 1,100 pages of public evidence. In addition a great deal of evidence has been heard in camera.
During the inquiry the Sub-committee focused its attention on the unfolding situation in the Gulf. It was decided that it would be topical to proceed with this report because of reports of increasing internal instability in the major oil producing countries throughout 1980 and 1981; the war between Iraq and Iran; increased fears in the

2376 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence

West that its access to Gulf oil might be in jeopardy; and Australia's expanding trade with the region. The Committee was advantaged in its deliberations by visits to the region by some members of the Sub-committee. Much of the material in the report benefited through the first hand knowledge gained there. These trips were not undertaken by the members in their capacity as members of the Sub-committee per se. Three Opposition members of the Sub-committee accompanied a parliamentary delegation which visited the Gulf region in January 1982, while the Chairman of the Sub-committee undertook a visit in a private capacity in the middle of 1981. The value of the contributions made by these members underlines the need for a committee on foreign affairs to be given the facilities to travel overseas to collect evidence.
Mr Deputy Speaker, in view of the shortness of time, I ask that the next two pages of my speech be incorporated in Hansard. The request is made in an endeavour to save time, which we seem to be losing right now.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Giles)-I draw the attention of the Opposition spokesman to this matter. Is leave granted for the remaining portion of the honourable member's speech to be incorporated in Hansard?
Mr Uren-This is unprecedented, is it not?
Mr DOBIE-In that case I will keep reading.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is a matter of whether leave is granted or not. Is leave granted?
Mr Uren-It is not.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Leave is not granted.
Mr DOBIE-I do not thank the House. I point out that this important debate concerning the report on the Gulf and Australia is being minimised by time restrictions. I think it is a very sorry commentary that a report on such an important foreign affairs subject has such limitations placed on it. I hope it will be recorded in Hansard that I endeavoured to shorten my speech, for the convenience of all honourable members of this House, by having it incorporated in Hansard.
Mr Charles Jones-I raise a point of order. The honourable member knows that there is a procedure to be followed when one wants to incorporate a document in Hansard. The procedure is that a member of the Opposition discusses the matter with the Minister who is in charge of the matter and a member on the Government side discusses it with the Opposition shadow minister who is in charge. It is obvious that the honourable member has not adopted such a course. Surely to

God, this Parliament will not reach the stage of incorporating speeches.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Giles)-What the honourable member said is quite true, except that it does not really apply to the incorporation in Hansard of portions of speeches. I think that on balance the Chair probably was incorrect in putting the proposition to the Opposition. I should have ruled that this course of action was not allowed. I now do so.
Mr DOBIE-It is becoming clear that the strategic significance of the Gulf, not only to the industrial non-communist countries, but also to the world economy as a whole, cannot simply be measured in terms of uninterrupted access to oil. It must also be measured in terms of its increasingly broad economic importance as a very large exporter of capital, as an importer and as a significant donor of aid. The Committee believes that the threat of the oil weapon should not be overstated given the increasing interdependence of Middle East and Western economies and the Western response to that threat. As would be expected in a report of this nature, the Subcommittee devoted considerable attention to identifying Australia's interests in the Gulf, and also how events are likely to affect us.
Australian trade with the region has increased dramatically. Our exports to the Gulf rose from $87m in 1972-73 to $915m in 1980-81, an increase of 950 per cent. On the other hand, imports from the Gulf, principally crude oil and petroleum products, stood at $1,808m in 1980-81. That represents an increase of 1,297 per cent over 1972-73. The Committee considers that in general terms the Government is making adequate efforts to ensure the continued increase of Australian exports to Gulf countries. Although ministerial visits to promote Australian products have been well received, there are certain deficiencies in our ability to follow up opportunities arising from them, including access to high government officials, knowledge of local business practices and language. The Committee acknowledges that these problems are due in part to the newness of the market.
The Sub-committee became aware of difficulties in trans-shipping air freighted goods from Bahrain into Saudi Arabia and to other destinations in the Gulf. I believe that our national carrier must apply itself to this particular issue. In addition, not enough personnel at either overseas posts or at head office in Canberra, write and speak Arabic adequately. The difficulty in recruiting and training adequate numbers of personnel fluent in Arabic is acknowledged. Nevertheless,

Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2377

the Committee believes that much more business could be successfully negotiated if more Australian trade personnel were to have a greater knowledge of Arabic and of local business practices. The Committee urges the Department to give this matter greater attention.
During its inquiry the Sub-committee became aware of difficulties in the administration of Halal certification of meat for Muslim markets. While the Sub-committee was assured by the Department of Trade and Resources in April 1982 that agreement had been reached in principle to resolve this dispute, our Committee will nevertheless keep the matter under review until there has been a demonstrable resolution of the problem in practice. The Committee considers that such an important market for meat as the Gulf, which has grown dramatically over the last five years, should not be prejudiced because of an inability to resolve the matter of Halal meat certification.
It is worth noting that Arab policy makers perceive Australia in the same light as the United States of America on the question of food embargoes, regardless of Australia's intended view or policy. This was made clear to members of the Sub-committee who accompanied the parliamentary delegation which travelled to the Middle East during January and February 1982. As an independent country, and because we are not a super-power, Arab countries look to Australia as a potentially reliable source of food supplies free of political strings. To protect access to its current and potential market for agricultural products in the Middle East, Australia must continue to make it clear that denial of food is not a weapon it will use in its relations with other countries.
Obviously, Mr Deputy Speaker, time does not permit me or other members in the House to traverse all subjects covered by this report or to list all the areas in the report on which the Committee has made recommendations and drawn conclusions. Furthermore, in the report the Committee has made a conscious decision not to extract the conclusions and recommendations in the report into a separate chapter. Neither has the Committee summarised those recommendations and conclusions. Therefore, the Committee hopes that each recommendation and conclusion will be read in the context of the sections where they appear. Many of the issues are complex and it is hoped that this process will obviate misinterpretation and misunderstanding by readers of the report.
The Committee did note that Australia will be in a different situation in respect of fuel oil requirements if fuel supplies from the Gulf are

disrupted. It did not go on to investigate or comment upon matters of domestic political policy regarding oil and energy pricing policies. It did note that reporting on energy information by overseas posts and assessment of such information by Canberra-based personnel should be such as to enable the Government to be adequately informed to make important decisions on energy policy matters to assure Australia's economic well-being.
Strategically, Australia has no direct interest in the Gulf. It does, however, have a common concern with other non-communist industrialised countries to secure a continued supply of oil and protect its economic viability to enable the continued export of goods and services. The Committee noted that there have been many developments in United States military and strategic policy which may well involve Australia. These include the establishment of a rapid deployment force, RDF, a general increase in the ability of the United States to protect power into the Gulf from the Indian Ocean, the upgrading of air and port facilities at Diego Garcia, the establishment of transit rights at Darwin Airport for B52 bombers en route to Diego Garcia, the stationing of marines aboard ship in the Indian Ocean, et cetera. All these matters will affect Australia and Australia's region. The report, therefore, analyses the developments in United States strategic and military policy in the area in considerable detail.
The Committee concluded that there was little likelihood of the Indian Ocean being proclaimed as a zone of peace despite the majority wish of the 46 member states of the United Nations which are members of the discussion group on the topic. The Committee believes more courses which deal with the modern history, politics and religion of Muslim countries at tertiary institutions, would create greater Australian understanding of a region which is of vital political, economic and strategic importance to Australia.
Although the report does not state it explicitly, the need for well researched and up to date information on a region which is of vital political, economic and strategic importance to Australia suggests that a centre of excellence on the Middle East and Islamic studies should be developed at an Australian university. Given that there would be close liaison between such a centre and the relevant government departments. I believe it is logical for such a centre to be established in Canberra.
I would end my remarks by thanking all who have assisted in the presentation of this report to the Parliament. The degree to which witnesses have come forward to present oral and/or written

2378 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

evidence or by producing documentary source material, is appreciated. The efforts of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the staff of the Parliamentary Library and the outstanding efforts of the Committee secretariat-Mr Ron Wider, the secretary, and Ms Maureen Weeks, the research officer-are acknowledged. I pay tribute to them all. We would also like to thank our Committee stenographer, Ms Anne Mari Poirrier, and the Committee secretariat word processor operators, Ms Linda Rutter and Ms Robyn Graham, for facilitating the bringing of this report to the House before the conclusion of the parliamentary session. These people played a very important role in getting the report to the House. It is a shame that the House does not give us time to debate it.
As Chairman of the Sub-committee on Middle Eastern and African Affairs, I would report back to the Parliament that all members of the Subcommittee bring to these deliberations not only a dedicated sense of duty but a wide range of individual expertise and scholarship on matters relating to the Middle East. I pay my personal tribute and thanks to them as members of the Committee. I hope this report will stimulate public discussion.
Mr BEAZLEY (Swan)-by leave-I would like to join with the Chairman of the Subcommittee in thanking Ron Wiber and Maureen Weeks for the effort that they put into this report. It is a contribution to our understanding of the politics of the Gulf, the role it plays in the international political system and its economic and strategic significance to Australia. It deals in detail with threats to the area's security, the significance of the oil produced in the area and the Soviet and American policies. One point I would wish to emphasise is the question of the linkage between the Arab-Israeli question and the politics and stability of the Gulf area.
If I have any criticism of the report, it is that it underestimates the significance in destabilising the area of the Arab-Israeli dispute, particularly that aspect of it which relates to the Palestinian question. It points out that this is not the only source of division in the area and in the Arab world. I agree with that. Nevertheless, the Palestinians are a significant component of the work force throughout the Gulf area and all the conservative oil states fear the destabilisation of their domestic politics brought about not only by the sense of injustice felt by the Palestinians who work within those areas, but also as a result of the radicalisation of Arab politics generally associated with the sense of Arab injustice on the ArabIsraeli question. This has implications for

Australia and it is recognised by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which, in one of its recommendations, states:
The question of a political linkage between Australia's policy towards the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Palestinian question on one hand, and the willingness of Arab countries to accept greater or lesser levels of Australian imports on the other has fortunately not been a significant feature of Australian trade relations with the region. While not wishing to engage in selffulfilling prophecy, the Committee is aware that this issue may be raised in the future. It is therefore something about which the Government must remain constantly aware if Australia's interests are to be properly protected.
I think that was a sensible recommendation and a cautious one by the Committee. The report also deals in detail with the question of a Soviet threat. It examines the implications for the rest of the Gulf of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and it looks at the Soviet requirement for oil. It concludes that whilst the Soviets seek to minimise Western influence in the region:
It cannot be said with certainty, however, that the invasion of Afghanistan is directly related to Soviet strategy in relation to the Gulf.
We found in our deliberations on Afghanistan that Soviet intervention was primarily related to discrete aspects of Soviet-Afghanistan relations. One aspect related to Soviet concerns for the destabilisation of the Islamic section of Soviet society that a victory by Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan might influence and the other was of a history of Soviet involvement in the country, which in a manner not dissimilar to the United States experience in Vietnam, was causing the Soviets to be increasingly drawn into the area. We noted that the result of the Soviet intervention had been a considerable lowering of the Soviet Union's reputation and regard in the rest of the Arab community of the Gulf and that the Soviets had suffered considerable damage thereby. We noted too that the Soviet Union did not necessarily gain substantially in its capacity to deploy military forces as a result of its having obtained positions in Afghanistan. The Committee looked at United States policy in the area and particularly the rapid deployment force. The Chairman referred to this so I will not go into it in any detail. Suffice it to say that the Committee pointed out that there were substantial links between Australia and the capacity of the United States to deploy in the area:
. . . by allowing the operation of United States defence facilities at North West Cape and elsewhere. These facilities allow aircraft and satellite surveillance and intelligence gathering, support for naval (including submarine) communications, signals and monitoring of Soviet naval movements. The United States Navy also has access to victualling, restocking and refuelling facilities and rest and recreational zones for personnel.

Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence

In addition the Committee pointed out the significance to American deployment in the area of the availability of Darwin for the use of American B52 surveillance aircraft.
The Committee Chairman also pointed out the significance that Australia has in relation to its food exports to the Gulf and pointed out too the importance to Australia of its being seen in the area as a reliable supplier. I conclude on this note. If there has been any aspect of our commitment to the Sinai peacekeeping force which has had any real impact on our relations with the Gulf, it is that it has raised the profile of Australia as an ally of the United States in the region. Accordingly, it has caused some of the Arab states, particularly those states that import food products from us, to believe that we may well be a party to all aspects of American policy in the region and, in that process, an unreliable supplier of food in certain circumstances should that reputation be permitted to permeate the Gulf and that Australia should be seen as a reliable supplier. I think that is a very worthwhile recommendation of the Committee in what is a useful report.
Mr McLEAN (Perth)-by leave-The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has come to a view on several issues which have long been of importance in the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Western world's response to it, and issues which have often been publicly aired but on which no official assessment has been made. For example, I cite the often stated myth of something called Arab unity. This argument has generally gone along the lines that the Palestinian problem is the barrier to the integration of the Arab world and that it is only the presence of Israel which stands in the way of achieving this unity, peace and stability in the Middle East. That position ignores certain facts. In particular, it ignores the fact that Arab nations have long been in conflict between themselves on issues not related to the Palestinian question, and that remains the case today. It also ignores the fact that the Arab nations individually do not warmly embrace large Palestinian populations. When they had the opportunity until 1967 to provide them with a homeland, they failed, by conscious decision and notwithstanding United Nations pressures, to do so. The report cites a number of authorities on this very matter. It is high time that this myth was exposed and I am pleased that in chapter 3 of the report the Committee stated:
. . . being aware of the importance of the Palestinian issue for the domestic politics of many Arab states, the Committee does not accept that the solution to these problems will necesarily of itself unify the Arab world, and neither does the Committee share the concomitant view that the existence of

Israel is the major, or only, obstacle preventing Arab unity and peace and stability in the Middle East.
In the whole context of the Arab-Israeli dispute and the international debate on this subject, that is indeed a very signifcant conclusion of the Committee. I was going to say a few words on the so called oil weapon. The Chairman of the Committee embraced this subject in his opening remarks. I say simply that I was pleased also that this Committee recognised the danger of overstating the importance of the oil weapon in possibly compromising future Western attitudes towards Israel. I thought that was also a realistic and important assessment by this Committee.
One other point of significance relates to the Fahd Plan. Many have said that this plan means that the Saudis recognise the right of Israel to exist. In fact, the Saudi representative at the United Nations was publicly rebuked by his Government when he said that the Fahd Plan did mean just that. Publicly therefore, Saudi Arabia, by the public statement of its own government, continues to refuse to acknowledge the right of Israel to exist. For that reason, in the context of this plan, the Committee was quite right in concluding:
. . . any formula capable of reducing tensions between the States of the Gulf and Israel must involve a recognition of both Israel's right to exist and the establishment of a Palestinian homeland.
I think it is a pity that we have to keep reiterating this point. I think it is an insult to Israel that we have to keep saying it. But we must, given the hedging on this issue by even the moderate Arab states. I say it is an insult because I would be offended if others around the world felt compelled to say that Australia has a right to exist. Of course we have, and we do. So does Israel. It is just not good enough to say: 'Forget it'. Privately, these nations accept the existence of Israel even if they say the opposite publicly. In my opinion, we cannot proceed in our policy making on the basis of private guarantees given by nations which are allies with other more radical Arab nations openly seeking to destroy Israel.
If the Fahd Plan publicly fails to reach even this basic position, we must publicly rebuke that plan. Countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia may well privately support Israel's right to exist and may well understand Western governments' concerns to uphold their public stands on such basic matters as the right of Israel to exist. It has long been recognised by those of us who deal with Middle East issues that there is often a great deal of differen(;~ between the private and public views of Middle East nations on matters of great importance in the region. The point has to be made

that, although this may be an acceptable form of diplomacy in the Middle East and perhaps elsewhere it does create difficulties not only for the direct' participants in major issues such as the Arab-Israeli dispute but also for other nations required to make decisions and adopt diplomatic positions in such matters.
It may be easy for many Arab nations to stress the importance of their private perceptions on matters such as the right of Israel to exist. But they are not democracies. They can do and say whatever they like, knowing that their private perceptions can become official policy in a de facto manner over time because they will probably remain in power, having no democratic constraints on their continued existence. What they do not understand is that in democratic nations such as Israel and many of her allies, leaders are accountable to and answerable to their people. In a democracy, it is simply not possible to do a secret deal on any matters, no matter how important or unimportant, on behalf of the people represented.
It is impossible for countries such as Israel and other democracies to make concessions on behalf of privately stated views. Some Arab governments do not appreciate this although they do seem to appreciate the need for their own public statements on such issues to accord with the popular opinion in their own country, even if they are not as directly accountable to their populations as democracies are to their electors. That is a code of practice which thankfully is n~t available .to democratic nations. The people III democracies need to see a clear official public position on which to discharge their democratic voting rights. That public position, for the democratic government, has to be the only position in all matters, let alone matters of national survival, defence and foreign affairs.
Israel and countries such as Australia which are required to adopt official positions on all issues, including this dispute, do not have the luxury enjoyed in non-democratic nations, including most Arab nations, of holding a public view whilst expressing a contrary private view which they hope will prevail but for which they are not accountable to their people and from which they can easily extricate themselves when it is convenient to do so. For that reason I believe that the Committee's comments on the Fahd Plan are most significant.

TAXATION
Discussion of Matter of Public Importance
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Giles)-Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:
The need for substantial tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget.
I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.
More than the number o/members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-
Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (3.32)-The Opposition raises this matter today because it is basic to the living standards of all income earners in Australia, especially those on low and middle incomes and because it goes to the heart of economic policy in this country. Today, of course, is the last chance for the House of Representatives to discuss this matter before the Government brings down the next Budget. This Government is closing down the Parliament. This Government is running scared. It is wracked by leadership challenges, ministerial scandals and policy dissension, with day after day being spent debating economic policy. We are giving honourable members opposite a chance to do some of the discussion in this House instead of in the privacy of the party room. What this Government is doing, 'of course, is closing down the Parliament for an incredible three and a half months in the winter recess. That must be just about the longest recess on record. It is doing this because it is scared to face the people and face the Opposition in this House. This Government knows it is going down the shute and the best thing it can do is try to deny this forum to the Opposition and to try to hide from the Opposition and the people of Australia for as long as possible. That is why it is closing down the. Parliament. This is therefore the last opportumty that we have to discuss this matter before the Budget session.
Mr N. A. Brown-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order, in effect, is to inquire of you whether the requisite number of honourable members stood in their places when you called the matter of public importance: Could you advise me how many there were III that count?
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Giles)-There were 11.
Mr N. A. Brown-Thank you.

Taxation

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2381

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I call the honourable member for Gellibrand.
Mr WILLIS-It was a frivolous point of order. It was taken to interrupt my flow of thought. The need for tax cuts is, firstly, because of the substantial increase in the tax burden which has occurred under the Fraser Government, despite the continued low tax rhetoric which we still hear from this Government, and doubtless will hear from the honourable member who responds to me in this debate. In previous speeches I have amply demonstrated this point. It is demonstrated particularly in my speech of 17 February this year in which I gave many illustrations of the way in which the tax burden has increased. I mention the overall figure. In the last year of the Labor Government, 23.3 per cent of the gross domestic product was taken up with Commonwealth tax revenue. This year the figure will be about 25.5 per cent, a very significant increase indeed. That higher percentage represents an extra $3,200m in taxes which this Government is gathering which would not have been gathered if the same percentage collection had applied as applied in the last year of the Labor Government. It represents an additional $13.60 more tax for every Australian household.
How has this increase in the tax burden occurred? It has occurred in a variety of ways. It has occurred, firstly, because of the reduction, suspension and eventual abandonment of tax indexation. Tax indexation, of course, is that process which is introduced to prevent automatic increases in the tax burden occurring as a result of inflation. With a progressive income tax system, as people's incomes move up in line with inflation, if there is no adjustment of the tax scales, the proportion of income that they pay in tax automatically increases.
This Government introduced, in 1976, a system of tax indexation which it said was required to keep the Government honest. It has gradually whittled down that tax indexation by excluding certain price rises from the tax indexation factor, by reducing from supposed full tax indexation to half tax indexation in 1978, by suspending tax indexation altogether for a year in 1979, byapplying only half indexation in the following two years and, finally, by abandoning tax indexation altogether for this coming financial year. The average indexation over the last six years has been less than half-47.5 per cent. If full indexation had applied to the 1977 tax scales, all taxpayers earning up to $17,894 annually would be paying $7.50 a week less tax than they are paying at present. The 46c in the dollar tax bracket would not be met until one had an income of $444 a week as against $344 a week as is now the case. So

the changes on the indexation front have had a dramatic effect on the imposition of taxation in this country.
The second way in which the Government has increased this tax burden was by the introduction of the tax surcharge of Itc in the dollar in the 1978 Budget, originally to apply from 1 November 1978 to the end of that financial year, but extended for a further five months. Thirdly, the Government has increased the tax burden through the massive increase in the crude oil levy-by the change in policy in 1978 leading to an eight-fold increase in the amount gathered by the crude oil levy between 1977-78 and 1981-82 -and, finally, by an increase in other indirect taxes. For example, in the last Budget sales tax collections were increased by several hundred million dollars and at the same time there were attempts to increase the range of goods taxed. A variety of measures has been used to raise tax levels considerably.
With regard to this point, I should like to note two things. Firstly, these developments have occurred almost wholly since the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) became Treasurer of this nation at the end of 1977. Despite his love of low tax rhetoric, he is far and away the highest taxing Treasurer ever in our history. No wonder he is going to squib this debate and leave it to the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) to make the reply. Secondly, because of the Treasurer's embarrassment about this matter, he continually makes reference to a statement made by me in 1978 to the effect that if Labor did not win the election in 1980, it would face the need by 1983 to raise taxes if it were to maintain a viable public sector. I made that statement in mid-I978 when the 1977 tax cuts were applied. Since then, as I have mentioned, there has been this whole battery of measures brought in to increase taxes by the now Treasurer and a totally different situation applies now to that which applied when I made that statement. Despite the overall rise in the tax burden, not all taxpayers are paying more of their income in tax. The top 2 per cent of taxpayers-presuming they pay their tax-are paying a lesser percentage of income in tax now than when Labor was in office. This position has eventuated because of the deliberate change in the tax scales in their favour and also because of the explosion of tax avoidance and evasion which has meant that the equity of the tax system has been destroyed.
This position is shown simply by comparing taxes paid ty pay-as-you-earn tax payers and provisional taxpayers. Between 1975-76 and 1979-80, the last years for which there are comprehensive

2382 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Taxation

figures, the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers overall had their percentage of income paid in tax increased from 19 per cent to 21 per cent; that is an average rise from 19 per cent for the first year, 1975-76, to 21 per cent in 1979-80. For provisional taxpayers, the figure was 2S.4 per cent in 1975-76 but only 23.8 per cent in 1979-80. For pay-as-you-earn taxpayers the percentage went up and for non-payas-you-earn taxpayers it went down. In 1975-76, the ratio of average tax paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and provisional taxpayers was 1.6: 1; that is, the provisional taxpayers on average had a tax bill 1.6 times that of the average pay-as-youearn taxpayers bill in 1975-76. By 1979-80 the ratio was only 1.2: 1 and it would be even less now. So the equity of the tax system is clearly being destroyed while this Government remains in office.
There will be a further severe increase in the tax burden next year if there are no tax cuts forthcoming in the next Budget. Assuming that income and employment growth in 1982-83 are the same as they were in last year's Budget-that is not likely to be right because employment growth is likely to be less but wages growth higher; but assuming overall it is much the same-the total personal income tax revenue will rise by $S,OOOm next financial year. That is a rise of 23 per cent compared with a rise in total incomes of 1St per cent. That is what will apply if there is no change to the tax scales. So clearly there would be a very considerable increase in the tax burden. This is because of the Government's abandonment of tax indexation.
Normally at this time of the year the Government would introduce a Bill to amend the tax scales from 1 July by indexing them to some degree. This year there is no such Bill because the Government has abandoned tax indexation. So after I July the current income tax scales continue to apply and if they are not adjusted in the Budget all taxpayers will automatically suffer an increased tax burden next financial year as incomes increase with inflation. Thus, taxpayers on average weekly earnings will enter the 46c in the dollar bracket next financial year if there is no adjustment to the tax scales. Average weekly earnings for the December quarter 1981 were $303. If they rise by 13+ per cent during 1982 they will rise to $344 by December of this year, which is exactly at the level of the 46c in the dollar bracket where that level of tax cuts in. After that, any increases which they obtain will be taxed at 46c in the dollar rather than 32c. One can imagine the likely impact of that on wage claims which will be made by trade unions around the country if they know that their members are going to pay

an additional 14c in the dollar out of every additional dollar of wage increase they get. Automatically the wage claims are going to go up to compensate for that.
It is quite clear that pensions are moving very close to the taxable income bracket. The tax-free threshold at present is $80.67 a week. The single pension, as of this month, is $74.1S a week. So it is getting very close. A rise of only 8.8 per cent in the pension-less than the inflation rate-will mean that pensioners with no other income will be in the taxable income bracket by the end of the forthcoming financial year. Of course, as most pensioners do have some additional income, they are rapidly falling into the taxable income bracket already. Any single pensioner with more than $6.S2 a week of additional income is now already in a taxable income bracket.
If the Government is to avoid a rise in the income tax burden overall in 1982-83, it will need to have an income tax cut of $1,SOOm. That is what we will need to have as a nominal tax cut for there to be no increase in the tax burden. This means that the Government would be reducing the amount of money which it would otherwise collect by that $1,SOOm. So it is just a nominal tax cut, not a real tax cut. It is just forgoing increased tax revenue that would otherwise automatically apply without the adjustment of the tax scales. So the starting point for a real tax cut is $1 ,SOOm, and that is something which everyone in Australia has to bear in mind. The starting point for tax cuts is a nominal tax cut of $1 + billion because it needs that kind of tax cut before a real tax cut can apply in the next financial year. The Government will most likely bring in some adjustment to the tax scales in the forthcoming Budget, but unless that involves forgoing revenue of $1.S billion, the claims that the Government will undoubtedly make about big tax cuts will just be so much hot air-there will be no effective tax cut at all.
I turn to the form and extent of tax cuts. Firstly, in regard to form, the pseudo tax cuts being proposed by many honourable members opposite, according to reports of their party debate, are totally unacceptable to us. That is, they are advocating at least a nominal cut in income tax to be made up by increased indirect taxes. So what they want to do is to give with the one hand and then take back with the other. Indeed, ifthere was only a nominal income tax cut rather than a real tax cut and if they also increased indirect taxes to make up for that nominal tax cut they are going to be taking with both hands because there will not be a real income tax cut but rather they will be applying an indirect tax increase to make up for the supposed tax cut they are giving. So in effect they

Taxation

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2383

will be taking with both hands. So much for tax cuts on that basis.
Also, any tax cuts should be given in such a way as to provide the greatest benefit to people on low and middle incomes. That is because these are people who have borne the burden of this Government's increases in taxation. The lower the income the greater has been the increase in the proportion of income paid in tax, both because of changes to the tax scales and because of increases in indirect taxes that have borne most heavily on lower income earners. Across the board adjustment to the income tax scales would not be the most equitable or desirable way to introduce tax cuts. They should be focused on lower and middle income earners.
The extent of tax cuts will be determined by two factors: Firstly, the degree to which the Government is able to make room for tax cuts on individuals by either increasing tax collections in other areas or reducing government expenditure; and secondly, its overall budgetary policy. In regard to the first point, the Opposition would strongly oppose making room for tax cuts by cutting government expenditure. It has already been cut in many needy areas to the bone-indeed, in some cases, through the bone-with the result that social problems are emerging in many areas. Responsible and compassionate government requires some increase in government expenditure in areas of undeniable need not further reductions, as many members opposite seem to advocate. The Opposition would support, however, measures to increase tax collections in areas where a fair share of tax is not being applied at present. A major area where this can be done is by knocking off tax avoidance and evasion so far as is humanly possible. The Opposition has proposed many measures in this regard which would considerably increase tax revenues and increase the equity of the tax system.
Budgetary policy currently is completely unsuited to economic conditions. It is contractionary at a time when the economy is sliding into a very deep recession. Tax cuts can form part of a package to bring the economy out of that recession by providing stimulus to the economy rather than a sedative which this Government's budgetary and monetary policies are applying to economic activity at the present time. Tax cuts are justified economically and socially and should be there in substantial measure in the forthcoming Budget.
Mr McLEAN (Perth) (3.47)-1 welcome the opportunity to enter this debate. I think there is not a person in this House who would not agree that we would all like tax cuts in the next Budget.

I think it is a pity, however, that all we have heard from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has been a highly critical brief economic history of this Government rather than a constructive debate on the subject of taxation let alone any alternative and constructive policy. I think it is interesting, to say the least, that it is the Opposition which raised this matter of public importance on the need for substantial tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget. It is interesting for a number of reasons, not the least being that as the socialist party in this country the Opposition seems to be at odds with its fundamental philosophy-a philosophy which it is proud to espouse when there is no election in the air and when its members address Labor Party conferences or gatherings of Labor economists. The honourable member for Gellibrand has referred to a speech he made in 1978 in which he said that should Labor gain office in 1983 it would face a mammoth task of rebuilding the public sector and an equally mammoth task in convincing the Australian people that they should accept higher taxes to allow that to happen. He says today that is not relevant in the current circumstances. Yet he is highly critical of the fact that we have been trying to dismantle the public sector. So I would suggest that his speech in 1978 is still quite relevant to his perceptions of government policy. I think that his statement at that time was quite a proper one for a socialist because socialists believe in big government and higher taxes but do not philosophically believe in a greater private sector or in allowing individuals in society to have an even greater say in their own affairs. For that reason I find it is interesting that the Opposition should raise this matter today.
I can only conclude that if the honourable member is to remain true to both his philosophy and support a larger public sector and if he remains true to this matter of public importance and supports lower taxes, he is quite prepared to blowout the deficit and finance his proposals by higher interest rates and higher inflation, notwithstanding the fact that these financing mechanisms will add to the problems of home buyers, stifle economic growth and increase unemployment. The Labor Party has done this before. Are we now to assume that it will do that again if it gets into office? The people of this country have a right to know. The honourable member for Gellibrand today completely ruled out the idea of financing the tax cuts by any reduction in public sector spending. So, if this is not his intention, he should not come to the House and parade what is basically a motherhood proposition without in any way suggesting what he would do, if in

2384 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

government, in making the difficult decisions and establishing the difficult priorities involved in writing a Budget. We want facts and figures and concrete proposals from the Opposition if it is to discuss such matters as an alternative government--
Mr Willis-How about defending your own record?
Mr McLEAN-I shall return to that matter shortly. But I find the matter of public importance interesting in view of the Opposition's record in such matters. I am not one who believes in constantly referring back to the Opposition's days in office. That was a long while ago. But if the Opposition refuses to state how it would finance tax cuts or where it would cut expenditure, or even if it would have tax cuts if in office, the Opposition's period of office is the only tangible reference point for such a debate. In all forms of taxation the Opposition's performance was dismal, to say the least, and in office it was, in terms of real annual tax increases, a higher tax government than the present Government. In the years between 1972 and 1975-76, when the Opposition was in office, revenue from sales tax, for example, was increased on average at over three times the rate it has since risen under the years of this Government. In percentage terms that is a 7.3 per cent increase as compared with a 2.3 per cent average increase per year in real terms.
Revenue from all indirect taxes under the Labor Government increased on average more than 1f times the rate it has since risen under the years of the Liberal Government. In percentage terms, again, that was an 8.1 per cent increase as compared with a 4.6 per cent average increase per year in real terms under this Government. Revenue from pay-as-you-earn taxes was increased when the Opposition was in government on average more than 2t times the rate it has since grown under the years of the Liberal Government. Again, in percentage terms, that is a 14.3 per cent increase as compared with a 5.3 per cent average increase per year in real terms under this Government.
Although I am correct in stating those figures, which are not debatable, I do not take pleasure in quoting those statistics because both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in office have failed to achieve the sentiments expressed in this motion. The Labor Party is excused to some extent because, as socialists, by definition it has to finance an ever-growing public sector and therefore is either a high tax, high interest rate or high inflation party. But the present Government, however, can at least live philosophically with this

matter of public importance because it is consistent with its view about what governments ought to take out of the community and what people ought to retain from their own earnings. Even if we have not achieved in absolute terms the kind of tax relief I expected in the past and certainly expect in the future, I believe that we, philosophically, have a proper commitment to that.
So the matter of public importance is interesting in terms of how the major parties have performed when in office. At present the level of taxation in Australia as a percentage of gross domestic product, as I understand the latest situation, is lower than that in 17 of the other nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and higher than that of only five of such countries. But I return to the point made earlier. What is the Opposition suggesting as an alternative Budget strategy?
When we know that a Ic reduction if the taxation scales costs about $700m and a 10 per cent reduction, therefore, costs about $2,000m, why will the honourable member for Gellibrand not tell the House where he intends to find that money? Does he intend to find it at all? He said today that he would not find it by cutting expenditure, so where does that leave us? Is he aware, for example, that to reduce the burden on pensioners and increase the minimum tax threshold by just $100 would cost $2IOm? Is he aware that to increase the allowable income limits for pensioners-limits which have not been adjusted for 10 years-would also cost $140m, just to double those rates? These are all desirable social objectives deserving of support.
I have mentioned only a few of those items .to show that in budgetary matters even relatively small adjustments to existing rates of tax or income support involve very large sums of money, which simply means that in government one has to establish priorities because not all the interests can be satisfied at once. I agree that taxes ought to be substantially reduced in the coming Budget, and there is hardly a soul in the country who would not agree with me on that subject. But I have also had representations from almost every possible interest group-from opera companies to tobacco companies, from welfare groups to defence groups, and from beer makers to book sellers-saying 'spend more on us', 'reduce our tax imposts', or both. It is just not possible to do all these things, on the one hand, and to reduce taxes, on the other hand. If we did, as a nation we would go stone broke.

Taxation

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2385

The fact is that only some of these things are possible to achieve in the short term, and priorities must be established. Everyone in the community agrees with responsible budgetary management, lowering the inflation rate, reducing the deficit and so forth. But everyone in the single issue lobby world that we face today believes that these noble objectives should not be achieved at his expense but, rather, at the expense of some other organisation in our society. It is just not that simple when one is sitting in the Treasurer's chair, and the honourable member for Gellibrand ought to acknowledge that.
Take the Labor Party, for example. In recent times the Labor Party, abandoning its political philosophy for political pragmatism, has said: 'We shall reduce all the taxes. We will not have a capital gains tax or a wealth tax. We will not concentrate welfare just on the neediest.' Then it opposes almost any expenditure reductions or deferrals proposed by this Government-for example, the razor gang proposals and, more recently, the defence statement. In other words, to date the Labor Party has eradicated nearly all of its revenue options and placed no limit on its expenditure claims. There has been no restriction on expenditure-only on revenue.
When the honourable member for Gellibrand brings a popular subject such as this before the House, he is under a very heavy obligation to say how he will achieve his tax cuts, where his expenditure reductions will lie-he has at least told us there will not be any expenditure reductionsand where his taxation relief priorities lie. Is he, for example, simply going to cut PAYE tax levels, or is he going to do something directed specifically and largely to pensioner tax problems, which are a very pressing area? Will he reduce industry tax concessions at a time when unemployment is becoming an increasing problem, or will this be only a secondary consideration to expenditure cuts or PAYE cuts? Will he concentrate his tax relief on the individual or on family units, another area of pressing need?
Mr Willis-What are you going to do?
Mr McLEAN-I shall come to that matter in a minute and I will let the honourable member know. As the alternative Treasurer in an alternative government party, the honourable member must, in bringing these matters before the House, at least spell out his priorities and how they will be ordered and financed, rather than just making bold popular pronouncements.
My personal priorities are clear. In the welfare area the pensioner tax and allowable income problems are a major priority, as is the necessity

to provide a redistribution of resources and increased assistance to the anti-poverty components of the welfare appropriation. In the taxation relief area my top priority, as it has always been, is to provide relief to the lower and middle income family unit, in an endeavour to remove the present tax bias which favours the individual against the family unit. Such measures should be financed primarily by expenditure cuts in order to prevent a deficit blowout.
But what are the priorities of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand? I can only conclude that, based on this matter of public importance and based on his party's rhetoric in recent times, they propose to finance their tax cuts by blowing out the deficit, which they have done in the past to a level of about $4,OOOm a year and which we are still financing. If that happens, and it is financed by printing money, inflation will rocket from its present low level, investment will dry up from its present high level, Australia will become less competitive internationally, and unemployment will increase under both domestic and external pressures.
The economic history of the early and mid-1970s shows this to be the case. If the Labor Party finances its deficit by increased public sector borrowing, it will be competing for funds against more productive users of the nation's resources, thus slowing down and possibly stopping altogether our potential for economic growth and increased employment. It will be competing for money and therefore increasing interest rates further at a time when home buyers have already been hit too hard. It would also be borrowing on a scale which will place the next generation of taxpayers in hock, with an increasing percentage of the next generation's taxes going to finance our debts rather than its own living standards.
Is that what the Opposition is proposing? How will the Opposition finance the tax cuts referred to in this proposition? If, as appears likely, the Opposition will not reduce but will increase government expenditure at the same time as it proposes to reduce government revenue, obviously the scenario of high borrowing and high rates of interest, inflation and unemployment will be its financing mechanism. That is a very deceptive ploy indeed. At least taxes, which we all agree are too high, form an honest mode of financing. The present generation pays for the services it demands of government. Taxes do provide a redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor, whereas inflation and high interest rates are an indiscriminat::: form of financing which always seems to hit the poorest the most. But I raise these matters simply because in national economics,

2386 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Petitions

whilst it is important to know how much money is transferred from the household sector to the public sector, it is equally important to analyse how this transfer is going to be financed.
The present Government, in seeking to reduce taxes within the context of lower expenditure, reduced deficits and responsible budgetary management, can achieve the objective proposed for discussion in this matter of public importance without the nation experiencing the economic and social disasters of the Opposition's financing proposals which the honourable member for Gellibrand has put in some wierd form today. On the other hand, the Opposition, in putting forward its proposals today, judging from its record, is to say the least slightly hypocritical. Regrettably that is the only way the Opposition can be judged because, on the basis of the recent rhetoric of Opposition supporters in opposing nearly all forms of expenditure reduction and supporting all forms of reduced revenue, they have again resorted to the only remaining options of either printing money or borrowing more and pushing up interest rates with all the problems these policies involve for economic growth, employment, home buyers and welfare recipients. Certainly I support-and I would imagine that all members on the Government side would support-the need for substantial tax cuts. But it is only if they are achieved within the expressed budgetary policy of this Government that such cuts can be economically and sociably acceptable to the best long term interests of this country.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Drummond)- Order! The discussion is concluded.
PETITIONS
The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:
Broadcasting Licences
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That Family Radio Ltd represents the largest single interest group in the community-ie, Christians-who do not have a voice in public broadcasting commensurate with their representation.
That prime time access to existing broadcasts by Christian groups is virtually non-existent, and access at other times is fast disappearing.
That, by comparison with other capitals, Brisbane is entitled to at least one more category'S' FM broadcasting licence.
That there appears to be no prospect of the release of further category'S' FM licences in the near future for Brisbane.

That satisfactory fulfillment of the aims of Family Radio and its expansion can only be achieved by broadcasting in its own right under licence.
That Family Radio has a responsibility to the large support groups which have contributed substantially to its development, to achieve the aims in broadcasting and community work for which it was established.
That there is an urgent need for the kind of service and support that Family Radio can provide to other community groups through the particular type of integrated programming proposed by the company under a full-time licence.
And that pruned Government resources are obviously insufficient to advance the development of public broadcasting as originally intended.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will support Family Radio's application for a broadcasting licence and will enable more category'S' FM licences to be made available in Brisbane.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Petitions received.
National Estate Areas
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That your petitioners are gravely concerned at the lack of effective Federal environmental protection legislation and urge that suitable legislation be enacted immediately.
Your petitioners are concerned that National Estate areas such as South West Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Western Australian Jarrah Forests cannot be fully protected until adequate legislation exists and is enforced. Your humble petitioners therefore call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that all provisions of the Heritage Act and the Environment Impact of Proposals Act are fully complied with in respect of National Estate Areas. In particular your petitioners call upon you to adopt the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment on South West Tasmania. Your petitioners believe that this is a national issue and must be resolved by the action of the Federal Parliament.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Carlton, Mr Connolly, Mr Maher and Mr Uren.

I. The loss of a local emergency '000' service being given to non-metropolitan telephone users in emergency conditions.
2. The loss of any local knowledge of the town and district being available to telephone users if this service is moved to a distant centre.
3. The loss of a local and personalised service provided especially to elderly and handicapped people.
We the undersigned believe that Telecom Australia should be instructed to seek the views of country telephone subscribers before proceeding with the closure of the manual assistance telephone exchange.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will call on the Government to halt the closure pending a full and open parliamentary inquiry into the needs and desires of affected subscribers and the full economic and social effects of the closure on this district, rural telephone subscribers and Telecom Australia employees.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Theatre in Australia
To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That your petitioners are gravely concerned by a proposed reduction in funds to Theatre in Australia. This will result in the reduction of the Theatre's contribution to the quality of civilised life, refinement and projection of national identity, and its contribution to tourism; and the reduction of employment opportunities in the Arts.

Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should:
Support Theatre in Australia by increasing grants to a realistic level.

Interest Rates
To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:
Many tens of thousands of Australians are unable to purchase their own home because of high interest rates and the inability to bridge the deposit gap between the maximum loans of many Institutions and current building costs.
The Government's failure to reduce inflation has incurred high interest rates and the Government's new proposals have caused those interest rates to rise even higher.
The introduction of the means test to the new proposed housing grants scheme has disadvantaged many thousands of people who were saving under the previous scheme. The introduction of a means test means that assistance is given on the basis of a combined income when both spouses are working and ought to be based on the income of the single income family following the birth of the first child.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will request the Government to reintroduce the scheme whereby interest on home loan repayments is a tax deduction for people on average incomes and further that the Government will do everything possible to reduce interest rates.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Funding of Children's Services
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Australian Parliament assembled:
Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Parliament Assembled take action as it deems appropriate to ensure that the present Federal Government children's services programme is maintained and improved, and the Child Care Act is retained as a legislative base for this important program.
In considering the recommendations of the Spender report, no recommendations put forward should be implemented without full consultation with community groups.
The present subsidy system to Child Care Centres should be retained. The proposal that monies be made available to subsidise child care in commercial centres is viewed with grave concern. The proposal to alter the present guidelines for subsidy in different programmes and introduce a common means test is also viewed with grave concern, as the present arrangements are effective.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action on the above mentioned issues.

(b) That this portion of the Great Northern Highway is the last portion which is unsealed and which does not provide an all weather link and we are, therefore, the only residents of Australia who are on a major highway system which is regularly inundated.
(c) Current allocations and plans do not provide for the upgrading of this highway to be completed in under six years.

TARIFF PROPOSALS
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond ValleyMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (4.8)-1 move:
Customs Tariff Proposals No. 12 (1982).
The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. These Proposals, which operate from tomorrow, contain changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on Ethylene, Diethylene and Triethylene Glycols, Developing Country Preferences. In its report the lAC recommended that the developing country margin of preference accorded China, Taiwan Province and Korea be reduced to 10 per cent for ethylene glycol, be withdrawn for diethylene glycol, and remain unchanged for triethylene glycol.
In view of changes in the market situation since the lAC completed its inquiry, the Government has decided to depart from the recommendations of the lAC. The effect of the Government's decision is that in respect of ethylene, diethylene and triethylene glycols the developing country rate of duty will be increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent; and Taiwan province will be excluded from the developing country scheme.
Also contained in the Proposals is an alteration to correct an anomaly in relation to the minimum rates of duty for certain foodstuffs. The effect of this change is to reduce the rate of duty from 5 per cent to 2 per cent for syrups, sweetening preparations and certain produce of vegetable origin. This is consistent with the Government's previous decision in relation to the lAC report on miscellaneous edible foodstuffs.

A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House.
Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned.

Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond ValleyMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs)- For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on Ethylene, Diethylene and Triethylene Glycols, Developing Country Preferences.
RECORDS OF THE PARLIAMENT: COURT PROCEEDINGS
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the House) (4.9)-1 move:
That, in response to the petition of MacPhillamy Cummins and Gibson presented to the House on 5 May 1982, this House grants leave-
(I) to the Petitioner and to Mr Christopher John Hurford to issue and serve subpoenae for the production of the relevant official records of the proceedings of the House as described in the Second Schedule of the petition, and of relevant documents tabled in the House as described in the Third Schedule of the petition;
(2) to the Petitioner and to Mr Christopher John Hurford to adduce the said official records of the proceedings as evidence of what was in fact said, and of the presentation of the said documents, in the House;
(3) to the Petitioner and to Mr Christopher John Hurford to interview and obtain proofs of the evidence from the relevant officers of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and
(4) to an appropriate officer or officers of the House to attend in Court and to produce the said official records of proceedings and to give evidence in relation to the recording of proceedings of the tabling of documents provided that such officer or officers shall not be required to attend at any time which would prevent the performance of their duties in the Parliament.
Honourable members will note that this motion relates to a petition of Messrs MacPhillamy Cummins and Gibson relating to the requirement of their client, Mr Christopher John Hurford, whom we know by other titles in this place, who seeks the production of certain Hansard records and other documents and requires the leave of officers of the House to attend in court to attest to the nature of those documents in the course of proceedings on his behalf in the courts of this land. The Government accepts the petition of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and I recommend to honourable members that they also support it.
I think it is worth commenting that in general the Government believes that, where members

Wildlife Protection Bill.

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2391

seek the production of records or require the attendance of appropriate officers of this place in this manner, the Parliament should agree to that course of action. It is, after all, because of the requirements of parliamentary privilege, which benefit us all, that these documents are not normally available. However, the character of the presentation in no way adds any greater weight to the proceedings than they have in the Hansard record, of which they form part. It does not give them any greater validity and it does not give them any greater substance than the documents themselves. It is only for the purpose of the proceedings and the waiving of privilege that this motion is necessary. The Government believes that in the normal course of events it is desirable for us in the Parliament to support our colleagues in any such proceedings, and I so recommend.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith)-I would like to make a few remarks in support of what has been said. As the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has indicated, it is important that, when members of parliament have to undergo litigation as to what they have said or not said, in certain circumstances the House is entitled to look at the merits of the case. My colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who is sitting here, is able to inform all of us that the reason why he needs the production of this Hansard is to prove that certain things which were alleged to have been said in the House were not said. So it is a case of reverse privilege which needs to be cleared from the point of view of evidence.
I want to thank the Government for its cooperation. At the same time, we clearly understand that the privileges of the House are retained. There may be other occasions in the future when somebody else might want to seek information from Hansard, and the petition may not be acceded to. But in these circumstances there is every justification for agreeing to it, and I welcome the Government's action.
Mr HURFORD (Adelaide)-I want to thank the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), other Government members, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the House generally for facilitating this matter. Naturally, I am sorry to put the House and the Clerks and others to this trouble, but it is the only way I can pursue what I believe to be a just cause.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

WILDLIFE PROTECTION (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND
IMPORTS) BILL 1982
Bill presented by Mr Wilson, and read a first time.
Second Reading
Mr WILSON (Sturt-Minister for Home Affairs and Environment) (4.13) - I move:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants, and world wildlife generally, by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls. The uniqueness of Australia's flora and fauna places a special responsibility on all of us to ensure that we do our utmost to avoid species becoming extinct. Regrettably, many species of our flora and fauna have become extinct in recent times. The causes include thoughtlessness, overexploitation and simple lack of knowledge and understanding. Possibly the most devastating impact has been through the destruction of natural habitat, which for many species has made survival impossible. Over the years there has been a steadily increasing public concern about wildlife protection. Governments have responded with a range of legislative and administrative measures. Australia has traditionally set high standards of protection, and in some respects we have provided world leadership. Nonetheless the Government believes that continuing vigilance is necessary, particularly to strengthen existing arrangements wherever possible.
The actions of non-government organisations and individual Australians obviously are most important in protecting our wildlife. Governments must also help by providing factual information in educational activities and in developing and implementing appropriate legislation. In this context I would like to refer to some recent initiatives.
Commonwealth Nature Conservation Activities
We are supporting the Australian Biological Resources Study which will ultimately provide full descriptions and classifications of Australian plants and animals, as well as identifying their distributions. The Bureau of Flora and Fauna within my Department has completed the first three volumes of the Flora of Australia. It is well advanced with the Australian Plant Name Index. The first volume of the Zoological Catalogue of Australia has also been completed. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service continues to provide the Government with advice relating to wildlife and nature protection. The

2392 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Wildlife Protection Bill.

Service participates in planning the implementation of wildlife protection measures in cooperation with relevant State, Territorial and Commonwealth authorities. It supports an extensive program of research about Australian wildlife, and contributes significantly to conservation awareness through its publication program.
The Great Barrier Reef region contains an enormous variety of living species. Three sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have now been declared. Work is proceeding systematically towards the progressive declaration of further sections. Park management work has commenced in the Capricornia section, with full collaboration between the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service. The public has been invited to participate in the preparation of the zoning plans for the Cairns and Cormorant Pass sections.
Important nature conservation areas throughout Australia have been entered on the Register of the National Estate, which is maintained by the Australian Heritage Commission. Recently the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and the Willandra Lakes region were entered on the World Heritage List. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation plays a vital role in the protection of our wildlife through the wide-ranging research activities of the Biological Institute and the Earth Resources Institute. A particularly significant legislative achievement in 1980 was the enactment of the Whale Protection Act, which prohibits the taking of cetaceans in Australian waters or by Australians elsewhere. At meetings of the International Whaling Commission, Australia continues to play a most significant role in reducing the catch quotas, and in arguing for a complete moratorium on harvesting. Whilst I have outlined some Commonwealth activities on nature conservation, honourable members will be well aware of the many important activities of the States and Territories in the protection of wildlife, and the strong collaboration between all governments through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers.
International Trade
The protection of wildlife has a dimension which extends beyond our own shores. In recognition of its international obligations, Australia is party to a number of nature conservation treaties and agreements. One is the Migratory Birds Agreement with Japan which provides for the protection of many species of migratory birds and for associated research. Australia was the first nation to accede to the Convention on Wetlands

of International Importance, under which Kakadu National Park is listed. We were also the first to ratify the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
Despite the efforts of nations upholding the provisions of international conventions, there is a flourishing illicit trade in wildlife. This trade contributes considerably towards the extinction of numerous species. Some idea of the commercial pressures may be gained from the payments involved. An amount of $50,000 may be paid for a coat from the skin of the ocelot, or the rare snow leopard. Pairs of live Australian parrots have been sold for up to $10,000 overseas. In 1979,900 Australian birds valued at more than $2m overseas, were seized in Cairns by the Queensland police immediately prior to shipment.
Another dimension to this illegal trade is the appalling cruelty and wildlife losses involved. The extraordinary measures taken by smugglers to conceal wildlife in transit impose much suffering and injury to the creatures involved. The actual death rate among smuggled birds can be as high as 90 per cent. Nonetheless, the ease of international travel and the lure of high profits provides a strong temptation to many people to participate in this most distasteful trade. The uniqueness of Australian wildlife continues to provide ready markets overseas.
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
In 1973, Australia and about 70 countries negotiated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Convention is commonly known as CITES. It arose from world wide concern about the adverse effects of unregulated trade on the world's wildlife. Australia ratified CITES in 1976, upon promulgation of the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations. These regulations and the Prohibited Imports and Prohibited Exports Regulations under the Customs Act, and various Acts and ordinances relating to Australia's external territories, provide the present legislative basis for the control of overseas trade in wildlife.
The New Legislation
The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill consolidates wildlife controls into a single Act, and allows the Commonwealth to implement the objects of CITES more effectively. The Bill is structured around seven schedules of species in which trade is prohibited or regulated. A permit system will be used to impose conditions appropriate to the status of the species being traded. The Bill provides for maximum penalties of $100,000 or five

Wildlife Protection Bill.

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2393

years' imprisonment, plus forfeiture of goods and equipment involved in the case of individuals. The maximum penalty is $200,000 plus forfeiture in the case of organisations. These penalties are appropriate to the high potential rewards involved, and to indications of organised criminal activity in wildlife trafficking. The possibility of a jail sentence is a necessary deterrent, as illegal traffickers customarily offer to pay fines and all other expenses for couriers.
The House of Representative Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation found, in its 1976 report on trafficking in fauna, that wildlife smuggling occurs in remote areas of Australia. As it is extremely difficult to apprehend persons in the act of illegal smuggling in remote areas, and because it is not possible to prevent all illegal imports through points of entry to Australia, the Bill provides for possession of illegally imported wildlife to be an offence. Similarly, the Bill provides for enforcement officers to have powers of arrest, search and seizure appropriate to the difficult circumstances and isolated areas in which the Bill must be enforced.
State and Territory Consultation
During preparation of the legislation detailed discussions were held with the relevant State and Territory authorities. These discussions have been particularly helpful in improving the drafting of the Bill. I note also that there has been widespread support by State Conservation Ministers for the Commonwealth to legislate so as to improve the regulation of international trade in wildlife and wildlife products. Under the Bill, the Minister is required to ensure that the States and Territories continue to be properly consulted on a range of matters where they would have a particular interest-for example, in relation to any amendment to the schedules which could affect Australian wildlife. It is noteworthy that consultation through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and other bodies will be necessary for proper implementation of various parts of the legislation.
Strict Controls
I believe it is important to note that the Bill does not lessen in any way the stance Australia has taken in the past on wildlife protection, either in Australia or overseas. Regarding Australian wildlife and related products, the Bill is based on the premise that commercial trade will only be permitted if it has been conclusively established that such trade will not adversely affect Australian wildlife. There will be no weakening of the strict controls that Australia has traditionally maintained on the export of native fauna. The Bill

further extends this protection to our unique native flora.
It is also important to emphasise that normal commercial trade in agricultural, forestry and fisheries products will not be affected by the Bill. There will be no barrier to the import of presently permitted live aquarium fish. The Bill permits trade between bona-fide zoos and scientific institutions. There is also provision for individuals to become affiliated with scientific institutions for the purposes of research.
Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill protect endangered wildlife and wildlife that would be threatened by continuation of unregulated trade. The listings of species and populations of species in these two schedules are derived mainly from Appendices I and II to CITES. Further Australian species that are considered to be threatened with extinction have been added to Schedule 1. Trade in Schedule 1 species is limited to that undertaken for scientific purposes, by bona-fide zoos or for commercial trade in captive bred or artificially propagated specimens. Schedule 2 is less stringent in that specimens taken from the wild can be traded commercially if they are taken under an approved management program.
Schedule 3 allows for the regulation of trade in wildlife requiring special protection on grounds such as animal welfare, or to reflect other needs for stringent controls, including those applied by other countries. Trade in Schedule 3 species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances by bona-fide zoos or for scientific purposes. Schedule 4 lists those commercial species of Australian flora and fauna that are currently exported and for which a permit will not be required.
Schedules 5 and 6 provide for the import of live animals and plants such as farm animals, table birds and fish. These schedules enable Australian wildlife and its habitat to be protected by preventing the introduction of live animals and plants that could adversely affect the Australian natural environment. Examples of species which have been introduced in the past, and have seriously affected the Australian environment, include rabbits and lantana. Schedule 7 lists those species of native animals eligible to be treated as household pets for export under strict conditions. Schedule 8 is the text of CITES.
Administration
The Bill places responsibility for the policy aspects of regulation of trade in wildlife with the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Administration of the Bill will be undertaken by the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and enforcement will continue to be by

2394 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Wildlife Protection Bill.

the Bureau of Customs and the Australian Federal Police. In line with current practice, the Minister will be able to make arrangements with the States and Territories on various aspects of the Bill, including enforcement by State police forces and wildlife officers.
While there are people who argue that nature conservation is a lost cause, beaten by our uncaring and greedy world, I believe it is a cause we can win and are winning. This Bill is a major piece of legislation reinforcing other Government measures developed to conserve Australian fauna and flora, and to ensure that international trade in threatened wildlife is responsibly controlled. It implements a number of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation which reported in 1976 on trafficking in fauna. The Bill does not interfere with legitimate commercial trade and it provides for the specialised requirements of science. It provides appropriate penalties to deter those who would profit by illegal trafficking in wildlife.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the officers of my Department for the long and painstaking work they have undertaken to bring this important legislation to the stage where it can be introduced into this House. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

DELAY IN TABLING THE ANNUAL REPORT 1980-81 OF THE AUSTRALIAN
WAR MEMORIAL
Ministerial Statement
Mr WILSON (Sturt-Minister for Home Affairs and Environment)-by leave-Section 36 of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 requires that the first report to be prepared by the Memorial shall be prepared as soon as practicable after 30 June 1981. I am aware of the interests of reports from departments and Commonwealth authorities and instrumentalities.
The text of the report has been prepared. However, I am informed that technical questions raised by the Auditor-General's Office on the form of the accounts approved by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), and difficulty caused by a change to accrual accounting procedures introduced during the period covered by the report, have delayed the finalisation of the financial statements which form part of the report. I am further informed that the report will be available for tabling during the first week of the Budget session.

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford Smith)-by leave-The Opposition notes the circumstances and has nothing further to add. We await with interest the report that will be tabled in the next session.
INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BILL
1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 29 April, on motion by MrStreet:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (4.32)-This is a Bill which authorises a further payment of $8,965,000 to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The Opposition supports it. Briefly, it was due to the initiative of my former colleague, Ken Wriedt as the then Minister for Primary Industry, who led the Australian delegation to the 1974 World Food Conference, and others such as the Canadians, that an organisation such as this was founded in order to respond to the needs of the least developed countries. IFAD is a United Nations-related fund and is based in Rome. It is unique in its tripartite system of voting. The developed contries, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the developing countries have an equal voice in management.
In the past doubts have been expressed about the efficiency of the Fund's management. They would not apply at present. A Saudi now heads the fund and some Australians have been involved in its management. I am advised that at present the Treasurer of the Fund is an Australian, Mr Alan Molineaux. Other Australians also are working for the organisation. In Australia, the policy aspects of the Fund, such as its place in regard to the North-South issue, are handled by the economic division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The mechanics of the Fund are handled by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. There is reasonable co-operation between the two. The Department of the Treasury has not always looked favourably on the Fund because of what it considered to be its poor management. In United Nations terms, the management appears to be reasonable but the Fund has taken some time to get started.
There was a problem with the United Stdtes over the Fund's replenishment. Originally, it was envisaged that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and the OPEC countries would each contribute 50 per cent of the Fund's requirement. It was agreed

International Agricultural Development BIll

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2395

eventually that the contribution would be more in the order of 54 per cent by the developed countries and 46 per cent by OPEC although on replenishment OPEC would increase its contribution or drop part of its voting strength. Unfortunately, the United States has not seen its way clear to increase its contribution on replenishment. Therefore, other countries have had to fill the gap. France, the Netherlands and Canada have borne the main burden of the rescue operation. Australia has also come to the party by increasing its contribution from $8m to $8.965m although, again, Treasury was opposed to the increase, believing that we should follow the American line. The shortfall has been made up by France contributing $8.3m, Italy $4.2m, Japan $2.5m and the Netherlands $12.5m.
IFAD does not represent a duplication of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, which does not get involved with major project work, but in some senses it cuts across World Bank operations. IFAD is particularly sympathetic to the needs of the least developed countries and provides funds in the form of grant aid to such countries as Chad.
One other aspect of IFAD's structure which is worth noting is that some interest has been shown in duplicating the tripartite voting system if an energy affiliate of the World Bank should ever be set up. Again, the United States is not prepared to support such an affiliate as it feels that it might squeeze out what it calls the private enterprise sector, namely, the large oil companies. The least developed countries want an affiliate, as they cannot at present deal satisfactorily with the oil companies. In the past, Australia has spoken in favour of the energy affiliate. Its establishment was also supported at the Cancun summit of October 1981. It is significant that at Cancun even the Saudis were prepared to give support. Although perhaps not strong support. I add that the energy affiliate was mentioned favourably in the recent communique of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.
In regard to IFAD replenishment we note with some surprise that the United States is moving away from multilateral aid. It appears to have made no commitment in the North-South dialogue, in regard to either agriculture or energy. Problems arise for the OPEC countries in terms of providing aid. Only three, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates-possibly a fourth, Libya-now have a balance of trade surplus. However, OPEC exists as more than a commercial entity. It is a political grouping as well and ought to be encouraged to participate in ventures such as IFAD. We applaud its members for the efforts that they have made. I have nothing

further to add. The Opposition wishes the Bill a speedy passage.

TOBACCO CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 5 May,. on motion by Mr Nixon:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr KERIN (Werriwa) (4.38)-The Opposition will not take up much of the time of the House in debating this measure. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) indicated in his speech yesterday, the Bill simply picks up an amendment, carried successfully in the Senate, which puts an upper limit on the rate of charge to be paid for the purpose of meeting the costs of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board and providing funds for research. The Opposition offers no objection to that.
However, I take the opportunity of saying that since this matter was debated in the House I have had quite a bit of correspondence with people who wondered why we did not somehow take the opportunity to pass more comments on the wickedness of the tobacco industry. I simply make the point again that there are two issues-the agricultural issue and the health issue. If people want to address the health aspect the time to do so is not during a debate on the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill which simply levies the industry to meet the operational costs of the Australian Tobacco Board and to provide funds for research purposes. Some of those research funds are spent in aspects of the industry which potentially, or supposedly, may make the smoking of tobacco a little safer. Two quite clear issues are involved. The Opposition offers no objection to this amendment.
Mr ADERMANN (Fisher) (4.39)-1 am conscious of the very heavy program of the Parliament today so I propose to address myself only briefly to supporting this Bill. But I think we ought to say that tobacco growers have had to face many severe strictures. In many ways they have been unfairly singled out for treatment of a discriminatory nature. in general, manufacturers

2396 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill

have acted very responsibly in regard to the content of Australian leaf which is used in tobacco and cigarette products. Indeed, they have voluntarily used a greater percentage of Australian leaf than has been required by legislation. Governments have, using a number of excuses, put repressively high excise on tobacco and tobacco products. Indeed, with excise and costs of manufacture, the tobacco grower ruefully contemplates that on every packet of cigarettes costing the consumer over a dollar only a few cents is received by the tobacco grower.
As the speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), said, this Bill deals with maximisation of a charge to meet the costs of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board and to provide funds for research. I want to comment briefly on the latter aspect. There has been, and I suppose there always will be, a debate on the possible harmful effects of tobacco on human health. I do not enter that debate, but I do observe that there are eminent protagonists with medical and scientific standing on both sides of the debate. Governments have seized on this and, in increasing the heavy excise load on tobacco, have sought to invoke health and welfare as justification, when in all probability revenue raising was at least as much in the mind of governments. I do not for one moment condemn government action to protect the health of the community and restrain unnecessary charges on public health expenditure. However, I do ask: Why just the tobacco industry? As well as being heavily taxed, the electronic media advertising blanket is total. Yet in all charity, and without suggesting attacking them by imposing an excise or advertising prohibition, no such limitation is placed on alcohol products. Indeed, some alcohol products are as yet virtually excise free. Yet on our roads, in rehabilitation centres and in the gutters we see the results of alcohol. But advertising prohibition is not applied to these products.
I suppose that in almost every area of our diet there are those who attribute harmful health effects to the products we consume. Some years ago the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) was most critical of what he called the poison of sugar. Dairy products have produced debate as to whether they contribute to heart complaints. There are those who claim that beef is either carcinogenic or raises the blood pressure. Each such debate has its protagonists. I mention also the addition of fluoride to water, about which many consumers have no choice. Yet tobacco alone is singled out as the villain to be taxed and its advertising is restrained. If we do it

to tobacco, why do we not do it to alcohol, fluoride, and virtually every article of food and drink? We read that even fruit juices are overloaded with excessive sugar. Without commenting on the great tobacco debate, I merely say that no product has been treated so discriminately and its producers so penalised.
This Bill provides a maximum charge for, among other things, research. That research is not merely to produce tobacco yield, to bring about economies in its cultivation or the like. As the honourable member for Werriwa has said, it also directs itself, for example, to the reduction of tar in tobacco leaf, which is cited by some authorities as the carcinogenic villain. We know that climatic conditions, as well as tobacco variety, are factors affecting tar content. Thus in research on variety, cultivation methods and manufacture, efforts are directed at the reduction of the alleged harmful components of tobacco for smoking. The fact that the industry has accepted charges and levies for research shows that, despite the severe economic difficulties it endures and the weight of the exercise and the sanctions that are laid upon it, the industry is responsible and is concerned to minimise any possible health harming component.
It is so easy to generalise and say that tobacco growers ought to diversify into some other area of primary production. That, of course, is not always practical or possible. Sometimes it is a matter of climate and soil type which makes tobacco the only real option for agriculturists in a certain area. In north Queensland we have a highly disciplined and regulated sugar industry. We know the restrictions of the International Sugar Agreement. If the tobacco growers were to go into sugar production-if that were possible-it would merely aggravate the problems of the sugar industry, which is already worried about rumbles from the Ord. In my own area the pineapple growers who are besieged by problems, imports and even dumping would not be very enthusiastic about a great movement of tobacco growers into pineapple growing.
Research is extremely important to the tobacco industry. It will bring about needed economies in tobacco farming costs, research into plant disease control, research into the most suitable variety types for the diverse areas where tobacco is grown in Australia, and research into aspects of health, in developing both varieties ofless tar content and methods of processing which control and minimise the tar content. This Bill prescribes the maximum rate of charge at 6c per kilogram. At present the operative rate is 2.5c per kilogram. So there is a capacity for an increase, but there is also a ceiling, or a lid, that is being placed on the charge

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2397

which can be made without changing the legislation. I know that primary producers are faced with many vicissitudes and extra charges do pose an additional burden, but I know that the tobacco industry will not abrogate its responsibilities. It never has. It is an important industry. It provides livelihood and employment to many people. It has been singled out for discriminatory treatment, which has concerned the embattled growers. It is an industry of value and merits government consideration equally as is accorded to other producers, such as sugar growers, grape growers and spirits and beer manufacturers.
With further proposals in train, such as controls on the tar content of cigarettes, the threat that sponsorship of tobacco firms will be further restricted and the threat that all government support should be removed from the tobacco industry, the tobacco growers know that they will be further barraged and bombarded. So research is of high priority. It can provide probably the only solutions which will save the industry and make it respectable in the eyes of many people. I hope that the industry can be sustained, that it can come through for the sake of many farmers and workers, and that some of the alleged health hazards-I say 'alleged' only because the debate is not yet resolved-can, with research, be alleviated and overcome. I support the measure.

PUBLIC SERVICE ACTS AMENDMENT BILL 1981
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 29 October 1981, on motion by Mr Viner:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr VINER (Stirling-Minister for Industrial Relations)-Before the second reading debate on this Bill is resumed, I seek leave to make a short statement on foreshadowed amendments to be moved by the Government at the Committee stage.
Leave granted.
Mr VINER-I wish to take a little time of the House to foreshadow the amendments which have been circulated on behalf of the Government and which will be moved in the Committee

stage of this Bill. There are three particular aspects which I should draw to the attention of the House. The first relates to the amendment to that part of the Public Service Act covering the staffing of the parliamentary departments. These amendments reflect the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Jessop Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which have been announced by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). Briefly, the changes will enhance the autonomy of the parliamentary departments by empowering the Presiding Officers to create or abolish offices and to promote officers. The present provisions of the Public Service Act require these matters to be submitted to the Governor-General in Council for approval.
The second group of amendments relates to the requirement to give reports to officers who are aggrieved by decisions made in relation to promotions, transfers and temporary performance of higher duties. These amendments are contained in the proposed sections 53L to 53N and the transitional provisions in the proposed sections 77A to 77c. These provisions reflect the Government's recognition of the recent developments in administrative law; however, they are quite distinct from the proposed amendments to the promotions appeal arrangements in proposed section 50D. The provisions of that section deal with the procedures which are to apply to the hearing of an appeal by a promotions appeal committee. The provisions to be introduced by the amendments, sections 53L to 53N, deal with the requirement to give an explanation, on request, of decisions in the promotions processes including decisions by promotions appeal committees. Each provision is the complement of the other but they apply to different aspects of the decision making process.
The Government has a clearly stated policy that persons affected by decisions made under statute should have the right to seek a statement of reasons. The proposed sections 53L to 53N introduce provisions to give effect to this policy in terms which are specifically tailored to the needs and requirements of the Public Service promotions process. They permit a person aggrieved by a promotion decision, being decisions to transfer, promote or direct an officer to perform temporarily the duties of an office and the associated decisions of appeal committees, to request a statement which explains the basis for that decision. This statement will enable the officer to understand why the decision was made and will provide a proper basis for him to consider whether that decision should be further challenged. The provisions will require that the statement in relation

2398 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

to a decision to promote another officer must contain a copy of the relevant duty statement, the criteria that were used in selecting the successful person, the procedures which followed and an assessment of the officer seeking the statement against the criteria which were used. These specific requirements will be in substitution for the more general requirements of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.
The proposed provisions are intended to strike a balance between conflicting elements which arise in the promotion process. There is a need to consider the privacy of those who were applicants for promotion. It is an important element of personnel management that individual staff members should have information on themselves protected from unwarranted disclosure. On the other hand, there is the right of an officer to know and understand decisions which have been made about him or her. The proposed amendments provide, however, for the continuation of the application of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in all other respects and, in addition, provide that statements under these provisions will be handled in the same manner as statements under section 13 of that Act so that, firstly, reports can be the basis of legal action under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, secondly, reports can be reviewed by a Federal Court as to their adequacy, and, thirdly, an officer refused a report on the basis that he or she is not entitled to it can seek a review by a Federal Court. Time limits on the making of requests and the supplying of reports are similar to those in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act as are other technical provisions relating to the exercise of decisions by delegates. In the light of the special provisions that will be made in the Public Service Act, the relevant decisions defined in the proposed section 53L will be exempted from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.
Proposed sections 77A to 77C are transitional provisions which will apply similar requirements to those in the proposed section 53L to decisions made under the principal Act before the amendments made by this Bill are proclaimed to come into operation. There have been consultations on the proposals for reporting on reasons for decisions with representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Professional Associations. The amended provisions now to be introduced include some of the proposals made by these representatives although the Government was unable to accept all the proposals made.
The third group of amendments will insert a new section 38A into the Act which will enable

dual appointments of permanent heads. By virtue of this provision a person who is already a permanent head can be appointed to hold simultaneously another office of permanent head. A person holding two offices of permanent head will be paid only salary and allowances appropriate to this original office. Proposed section 770 is a transitional provision which will enable dual appointment to occur prior to the revised arrangements for the appointment of permanent heads being proclaimed to come into operation. The Government considers that such flexibility is desirable. I commend the amendments to the House.
Mr HAWKE (Wills) (4.57)-The legislation which is proposed by the Government and which the House is now being asked to consider is extremely complex, as I think the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) will agree. I say at the outset that the complexity of this legislation is compounded by the fact that the House now has before it the original Bill, which is the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981, and a further document of 26 pages setting out additional amendments and new clauses to be moved on behalf of the Government. To put it another way round, what we have now is the document containing the further amendments and new clauses which in part amend the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981 the purpose of which, in turn, is to amend the Public Service Act 1922 and numerous other Acts. If I may put it as politely as possible, it is rather a case of not knowing who is in what position at the zoo.
The Government has been thoroughly slipshod in its technical approach to this matter. The House should not have been presented with this confusion of legislation to which I have referred. It would have been appropriate and, indeed, highly desirable for the Government to have presented to the Parliament a Bill consolidating all the proposed changes rather than the dog's breakfast that we have before us. Further, I make this point: If in fact there had been full, detailed and realistic consultation with the Public Service unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, very much of the confusion and indeed the need for argument in the House this day could have been avoided. Having said those things, as it is necessary for me to put them to the House, I make it quite clear that there is very much in these Bills which the Opposition finds acceptable. Indeed, I put it more strongly than that: Much of what is proposed is eminently sensible and is positively welcomed by us.
The major purposes of the amending legislation are, firstly, to abolish the divisional structure of the Australian Public Service and to implement

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2399

changes to the promotion, selection and appeal processes within the Service. The Opposition supports the proposal to abolish the divisional structure. To some, the proposal may appear radical but it should be understood that it is a proposal which has broad support. It has the support of the unions immediately concerned, of the ACTU and the Public Service Board. This is a matter which was specifically considered and in regard to which recommendations were made by the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. It is useful, therefore, I believe, to refer to the relevant and relatively brief section of the 1976 report on Australian Government Administration, where this matter is specifically dealt with, so that we can see the base upon which there is common ground on this matter. The Royal Commission addressed itself to this matter at pages 248 and 249 of its report. It had this to say:
The present divisional structure is hierarchial; it consists of:
(a) the first division, including the heads of the ministerial departments; the heads of the departments of the Parliament; and, on occasions, other very senior positions, as determined by the Governor-General;
(b) the second division, including top administrative and management staff below the department heads, for example, deputy secretary, first assistant secretary, assistant secretary, and heads of certain 'outrider' units of departments;
(c) the third division, including specialist, administrative and clerical staff, entry to which is controlled byexamination at the end of secondary schooling or by special qualifications in some instances;
(d) the fourth division, including the rest of the staff, entry to which depends on the requirements of the job ranging from no specific qualifications for laboratory work, to requirements relating to education, training or experience for other work.
Most of the government's workforce is in the fourth division. At June 1975,70.5 per cent of permanent, temporary and exempt staff (including those in the PMG's Department) were in the fourth division, compared with 29 per cent in the third division and 0.5 per cent in the second division. The ratio of staff between the third and fourth divisions has changed only marginally in the last 25 years.
In 1920 Commissioner McLachlan expected that this division of the service would 'secure a more desirable uniformity in classification and scales of pay, and remove claims for preferential treatment and an irritating distinction of 'caste'--
As he put it-
based only upon nomenclature'. McLachlan's concern at the time was with distinctions in status which were developing between 'professional' work and clerical or administrative work. At the same time it was thought necessary to differentiate the broad categories of work being performed and to ensure that an adequate supply of administrative potential was maintained. While some of the problems which concerned Commissioner McLachlan have been eliminated there can be little doubt that the divisional structure itself is a source of caste and status, for instance, in the relationship between the third and fourth divisions. Widespread doubts have been expressed

as to the usefulness of the structure and as to whether the restraints on mobility within the Service it imposes serve any valuable purpose.
Criticisms of the divisional structure include the following:
(a) It has inhibited an objective assessment of the working requirements of lower third division positions;
(b) It precludes the promotion to third division positions of officers of the fourth division of proven capacity; it attaches disproportionate value to formal qualifications which may be irrelevant to the work to be performed.
Having instanced those very basic considerations against the continuation of this caste system which it said was enshrined in the divisional structure, the Royal Commission said:
The validity of these criticisms is accepted by most departments and staff associations and by the Public Service Board which proposes the abolition of the divisions and their replacement by a series of occupational groups.
The Public Service Board's suggestion, which was put and which was quoted by the Commission, was in these terms:
The occupational group would serve as a primary vehicle for determination of entry standards, recruitment processes, design and application of training and developmental programs, staff deployment, manpower planning and establishment and classification processes. Each occupational group would generally have its own pay and grading structure and its own entry qualifications. However, in some cases an occupational group would be one of a number of groups attached to a large pay and grading structure, or one of a number of groups with the same basic entry qualifications. Conversely, an occupational group could consist of a number of occupations with differing pay scales, or differing entry qualifications.
That was the end of the quote by the Royal Commission of the submission on this point made to it by the Public Service Board. The Royal Commission, very significantly, having itself noted as I say the caste and status implications of the divisional structure and having quoted the submission put to it by the Public Service Board, then said:
The commission supports these proposals and we recommend that:
(a) provisions for divisions be removed from the Public Service Act;
From those relatively brief references to the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which was presented in 1976, I believe I have established the breadth of the agreement that exists among those directly concerned, the unions and the Public Service Board, as to why it does make sense to abolish this divisional structure within the Act. It clearly was the case in 1976 and it remains the case now that there is common ground between the unions and the Board and it is, as I have said, eminently sensible at this late stage to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission made as

2400 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

long ago as 1976. I trust that I have, without question, made it quite clear that in respect of this basic thrust of the first part of the Bill which relates to the elimination of the divisional structure, the Opposition supports that approach.
Unfortunately, one is not able to speak with such unqualified enthusiasm in respect of the other major area of the Bill, that is, the proposed changes to the promotion, selection and appeal processes. Let me say at the outset, however, in this respect, that some of the matters dealt with in this section of the Bill have been the subject of various degrees of consultation within the Joint Council processes, some consultations having taken place as far back as 1974. Progress was made earlier in those discussions and many of the matters now introduced are of a completely non-contentious, common-sense nature. However, other matters contained in the proposed amending legislation do not reflect consensus or even, I am sorry to say, an attempt to reach consensus. Indeed, there are several departures from policies which the Public Service Board, by specific correspondence of 19 September 1979 to the unions had conveyed as representing the outcome of discussions between the Board and the unions covering several years. No explanation has been offered to this House in the second reading speech of the Minister and no explanation has been offered to the staff organisations as to why this has happened. In other words, having spent that long period in discussion with the staff organisations and confirming by letter of 19 September 1979 that these new policies had been agreed on, there has been no explanation to the House or to the organisations concerned as to why there has now been this departure from what had been agreed at that stage.
Further, a number of the provisions that have now been introduced have been so introduced without any form of consultation at all. Indeed, a specific request was made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in October 1981 that certain portions of the Bill in fact be put aside to allow consultation and detailed examination. That very reasonable request by the unions was not acceded to by this Government. I want to put to the House, as responsibly as I can, that by any reasonable criteria of industrial relations that was a foolish decision on the part of the Government not to accede to the request to have discussions. It is made much worse by the Government's action, through the introduction and passage of the Public Service Arbitration Amendment Act No. 93 of 1978, of removing from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitration Tribunal the power to adjudicate on disputes relating to appointment,

reappointment, employment or promotion in the Public Service. As the staff organisations now rightly point out, that legislation invalidated the assumption of access to that jurisdiction by the unions upon which the major part of the consultative process up to that point had in fact been based.
Having, as it were, put those general and relevant considerations, let me go to some of the particular areas of concern contained in the Bill before this House. Clause 20 of the 1981 amendment Bill, which the House is now considering, seeks to repeal the existing division of the Act dealing with recruitment and promotion and providing the statutory framework of competitive entry to Public Service employment. Proposed new section 33A, which is referred to in clause 20, is not inconsistent with the overall recommendation of the Royal Commission for the details of recruitment procedures to be delegated from the Board to departments with the Board in fact retaining the monitoring role. However, it is important for the House to understand that the Bill fails to take up an important set of recommendations designed to declare in the statute itself a commitment to merit as a determinant to recruitment, selection and promotion. In the view of the Opposition the full scheme proposed by the Royal Commission for enforcing merit selection as an ingredient of the development of a representative bureaucracy should in fact be adopted. As I have indicated in the amendments distributed on behalf of the Opposition, we will be moving at the Committee stage an amendment which will in fact include a provision which was referred to in the report of the Royal Commission calculated to achieve that effect. At this stage I indicate that I will be moving for the inclusion of a section which will be directed towards emphasising this question of merit as the sole determinant in recruitment and promotion. That will require the inclusion of new section 33AA, sub-section (I) of which states:
Powers under this Act in respect of recruitment, appointment, transfer or promotion shall be exercised in a manner consistent with the attainment of recruitment and promotion procedures which rely on a careful assessment of those personal qualifications and capabilities likely to contribute to the efficient working of government administration, and which preclude patronage, favouritism, or unjustified discrimination.
I think the House will appreciate the importance of what I refer to there because the Coombs Royal Commission in its consideration of this matter and in considering the importance of ensuring that merit and nothing but merit be the determinant in creating the sort of Public Service we would all like to see, specifically recommended a provision in a declaratory fashion in the statute itself of the

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2401

kind to which I have just alluded. That is why I say that at the appropriate stage we will be moving for the inclusion of such a provision.
Having referred to that important section I next refer to clause 27 of the 1981 amending Bill before us which seeks to repeal the existing provisions in the legislation and proposes new provisions in regard to promotion and appeals. I wish here to make some broad points about our concern in this regard. I refer first of all to the duty to inquire. This is where we are talking about what goes on in the situation of a promotion appeals committee dealing with an appeal situation. The first point I want to make is that in respect of the existing situation under the duty to inquire, section 50 (8A) of the Public Service Act as it currently stands requires that a promotions appeal committee 'shall make full inquiries into the claims of those parties'. That language has been subject to judicial interpretation. The Bill departs from that language and proposes a substitute duty in the form 'the Committee shall inquire into the claims of each party to the appeal proceedings'.
This change of terminology was not in any way canvassed with staff organisations at any point in the nine years which have elapsed between the first consultation and the introduction of the Bill. I ask the House to consider the enormity of that position. Here we are right in the very heart of how a promotions appeal committee shall go about its duty. The fundamental requirement in the legislation in respect of how the tribunal should go about its duty to inquire is now proposed to be changed and on this fundamental issue there has not been any discussion at all with staff organisations. The reason for the change is not disdosed either in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum. The effect of the change will be to create needlessly a basis for judicial distinction to recent court decisions based on the existing wording of the Act.
Having considered the duty to inquire provision, let us move to the consideration of what happens in regard to the actual procedural requirements. With the exception of a limited number of matters in respect of which no issue arises here, at no stage in the consultative process was there in contemplation any intrusion on the existing discretion of promotions appeal committees to, in the words of the relevant regulation-that is regulation 109F-'make its inquiries without regard to legal forms or solemnity'. That is what the instruction to the appeal committees is as it stands under the existing provisions contained in regulation 109F.

Under proposed new section 500 (2) there is proposed a highly detailed code covering procedural matters which have recently been the subject of judicial interpretation. In Finch's case, Mr Justice Ellicott held that a promotions appeal committee has two basic duties. He said they were 'to make full inquiries into the claims of the parties and to act fairly to the parties in so doing'. Mr Justice Ellicott refused to hold in Finch's case last year that committees were obliged to conduct formal hearings or allow legal representation. In reaching this view he relied on the point that Parliament had left the procedures of the committee to be prescribed by regulations and had not even conferred power to summon witnesses or take evidence on oath. Mr Justice Ellicott went on to determine in the circumstances of the case that the promotions appeal committee had failed in its duty to act fairly.
It is in reaction to that decision of Mr Justice Ellicott in Finch's case that the Bill now proposed to introduce into the Act a resume of procedures to be applied by committees. The Bill seeks to place defined limits on the flexibility of response to particular cases which Mr Justice Ellicott was at such pains to preserve as a discretion of particular committees. I recommend the reading of Finch's case and the reasons for the judgment handed down by Mr Justice Ellicott. As I recall there are some 36 pages in the reasons for judgment. I say without any condescension, that it is a very well reasoned and considered document. One of the things that strikes one when one reads the Finch case reasons for judgment is the stress that Mr Justice Ellicott puts upon ensuring that there is this flexibility of approach in considering matters before a promotions appeal committee and the emphasis he gives that each case will have circumstances of its own which require possibly a different form of approach. What has been done, as I say, is to place defined limits on that flexibility of response which Mr Justice Ellicott emphasised.
The Minister in his second reading speech stated:
Recent court decisions appear to indicate that, as the Public Service Act is presently worded, the promotions appeal system should be conducted within an adversary framework and require a greater degree of legal formality than has in practice applied or is necessary or desirable to see that an appellant's case is fairly and fully heard and determined.
I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House deny the assertions made, explicitly and implicitly in that respect in the Minister's second reading speech, and we contest the conclusions in that passage. We say that Mr Justice Ellicott was explicit in holding that the adversary

2402 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

inquisitorial distinction was not helpful in analysing the function of the committees. Legal formality has not been required by recent decisions; rather, what has been demanded is a higher standard of fairness than had in practice been applied. The Parliament should be wary of accepting modifications to legislation designed to shield the Public Service Board and other personnel administrative institutions from judicial enforcement of the duty on them to act fairly. The Public Service Board in recent times has had a poor record when its own actions have come under scrutiny in the court. Legislation sponsored by the Board warrants close scrutiny against attempts to escape the resented intrusions of administrative law into what was hitherto an exclusively bureaucratic prerogative.
It is interesting to note in this respect, when one understands that these provisions are deliberately brought in by the Government to try to get over the cogent reasoning of Mr Justice Ellicott in Finch's case, that in October 1981 the Board adopted the unusual attitude that this matter could not be processed by the normal consultative Joint Council mechanisms, because, as the Board argued to the staff organisations, if the Ellicott principles-that is, the reasoning handed down by Mr Justice Ellicott in Finch's case-were implemented, it would bring the appeal mechanism to a grinding halt. That was the argument used by the Board in October 1981 to justify the position that it put to the unions that something had to be done to dispose of Ellicott-ifl may put it in that way. It said: 'If we do not do that, the whole appeal mechanisms will come to a grinding halt'. I remind the House that it is now May 1982, so there has been an opportunity to test, by the passage of time, whether that argument put by the Board is valid. The facts are clear, and the attitude put by the Board in October 1981 has been shown by the passage of time to be unduly alarmist, as no undue delays or difficulties have arisen up to this time.
In the brief time left to me, it is logical at this point to refer to the amending provisions which are before us, dealing with the furnishing of reports in cases of transfers, promotions and appeals. The House should understand the background to this matter. In part these proposals deal with the issue which was involved in the disallowance on 23 March of this year by the Senate of Statutory Rule No. 274 of 1981, made under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Let me explain that very briefly. Section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act creates a duty to provide reasons for certain administrative decisions; that is, where people have

been subject to certain administrative decisions, section 13 provides an opportunity for them to be given reasons. Schedule 2 to the Act had exempted from this requirement for a period of 12 months or such longer period as was prescribed, decisions relating to:
Promotions, transfers (being transfers that are subject to appeal) or appeals against promotions or transfers, of individual members of the Australian Public Service or of any other Service established by an enactment or by the staff of a Commonwealth authority.
That initial 12 months exemption of promotion appeal bodies had the support of the public sector unions as it was considered that such a period would be appropriate to allow the development of procedures to accommodate the obligation. The attempt by the Government earlier this year to extend that period of exemption was made without any consultation with the staff organisation involved, and in the circumstances it was little wonder that the Senate disallowed the provision as it did.
What is proposed in this section of the 1982 Bill is a process for providing reasons for not appointing a particular person, but the reasons for appointment in the way that was done. This provision in this section of the legislation provides a significantly less adequate process and protection than is in fact afforded by section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, and that was argued and not accepted by the Board. There are other matters to which we object. I shall deal with those in Committee. I conclude by saying that there is much in the Bill which is sensible and non-contentious. It is a pity that the Government has not had the good sense in respect of all these other matters to have the full consultations with the unions which I believe may well have produced a piece of legislation which could have met with the agreement of all quarters of this House.
Debate (on motion by Mr Connolly) adjourned.
NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM
Ministerial Statement
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Minister for Communications)-by leave-I wish to make a statement, and I table an information paper relating to the establishment of the national communications satellite system and ask for leave to incorporate it in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows-
PROJECT: NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM (NCSS).

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2403

OWNER AND OPERATOR: AUSSAT Pty Ltd, at present 100% owned by the Commonwealth Government. It is intended to convert AUSSAT Pty Ltd into a publicly listed company with up to 49% of the shares being held by the private sector as soon as practical.
PREFERRED TENDERER, SATELLITES/ GROUND CONTROL STATIONS: Hughes Communications International.
EARTH SEGMENT: Negotiations concerning a contract for eight Major City Earth Stations are continuing.
SPACE SEGMENT COST: $166 million (in 1982 dollars) for three satellites, two ground control stations, launch vehicle and launch insurance.
SATELLITES:
Number-Two in geostationary orbit, 36000 km above the Earth, one on ground as a spare. (The Hughes contract includes the option of a fourth satellite should user demand warrant it.)
Class-The satellites have been designated as "D-c1ass spacecraft".
Mass-Initial mass of each satellite is 650 kilograms.
Size-Each satellite will be approximately 6.5 m long in orbit and 2 m in diameter.
Design life-At least seven years.
LAUNCH BOOKINGS: Contingency bookings have been made for launch slots on the Ariane launch vehicle (Europe), the US Space Shuttle and the conventional US Delta rocket.
OPERATIONAL DATE: Mid 1985.
ORBITAL LOCATIONS: 156°E, 1600 E and 164°E, to the east of Australia above the equator.
TRANSPONDER CAPACITY: Each satellite will have a capacity of 15 transponders (4 x 30 watts plus II x 12 watts). Thirty-watt and 12-watt transponder back-up will be available in each satellite in the event oftransponder failure.
USABLE TRANSMISSION POWER: Approximately 250 watts.
FREQUENCY BANDS: The satellites will operate in the 14.0-14.5 GHz frequency band for transmissions from the ground to the satellites (uplink) and in the 12.25-12.75 GHz band for transmissions from the satellites to the ground (downlink).
COVERAGE AREAS: In the uplink direction each satellite will have a national beam capable of receiving signals from anywhere within Australia. Downlink transmissions will be by national beams covering all of Australia and four spot beams covering Western Australia; Queensland; South Australia/Northern Territory; and New South Wales/Victoria- /Tasmania. There is also provision for servicing Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, as well as a spot beam to cover Papua New Guinea, this beam being used for both up and down links. In this configuration it is not intended to use NCSS to communicate between Australia and PNG. The 30-watt transponders will be allocated to the spot beams and the 12-watt transponders to the national beam although some flexibility will be available for switching 12-watt transponders into the spot beams.
SATELLITE CONTROL: Two Tracking, Telemetry, Command and Monitoring Stations (TTC&M) will be built in Sydney and Perth. the Sydney station will have the Satellite Control and Operations Centre.
MAJOR CITY EARTH STATIONS: It is envisaged that there will be eight in number located at Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. They will send and receive signals to and from the satellites.

Proposals for establishing earth stations at other locations including Rockhampton and Townsville will be the responsibility of the ABC. The private sector will be free to establish earth stations to access the satellites on the same basis as AUSSAT.
SATELLITE SERVICES:
Television, radio services for remote and underserved areas;
remote area telephony;
aeronautical, marine and land-based transport communications for the Department of Transport;
a range of services for the National (ABC) broadcasting system and for potential commercial and other public sector users including television and radio relay and program exchange, data, facsimile, videotex facilities;
telecommunications, broadcasting services within Papua New Guinea;
distance education and telemedicine services.
USER REQUIREMENTS: Utilisation of the System by Commonwealth public sector users will be considered in the Budget context for the years concerned.
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION
The ABC will be a major user of the Satellite System with 30-watt transponders being used to distribute radio and television programs to the hundreds of terrestrial transmitters serving the ABC's radio and television networks. Program production and exchange will be greatly improved through the use of the 12-watt transponders which will enable the ABC to develop a new, highly flexible and integrated two-way broadcasting system. This will facilitate program production and exchange at a regional, State and National level.
The availability of the Satellite Systems will facilitate development and services. All non-metropolitan Australians, wherever they live, will receive a better service.
The Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service (HACBSS) will broadcast ABC radio and television programs direct to all those beyond the reach of the terrestrial networks or located in underserved areas or places of difficult reception. HACBSS will be delivered via four 30-watt transponders operating in four contiguous spot beams covering Australia. A basic objective with the Satellite System is to allow reception in most of the coverage areas via small and relatively inexpensive earth stations owned by individual Australians. The typical dish will be 1.2m in diameter and on present information will cost approximately $1000. Reception in some areas will require use of slightly larger dishes at increased cost.
The Department of Communications is planning an extensive program of laboratory and field trials to determine the most appropriate specifications for these small earth stations. It is proposed to buy about 135 prototypes and site them at several widely separate locations chosen for extreme variations in climatic conditions.
Three of these test sites-at Alice Springs, Innisfail and Port Hedland-are noted for high temperatures, strong winds, dust and both high and low rainfall patterns and will help determine the extent of interference it is expected the earth stations will encounter from the weather.
It is proposed to simulate Satellite System transmissions through the use of equipment mounted on special towers which will direct signals to about 40 earth stations at each site. Monitoring controls will be established in three on-site caravans and the whole exercise will be controlled through a master computer located in DOC's Canberra headquarters.
The trials will take about a year and manufacturing and industry bodies will be kept informed of the results.

2404 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

Laboratory tests will look at such matters as the ability of the earth stations to reject signals from satellites adjacent to Australia's and the level of interference between earth stations.
The Satellite System also means that Radio Australia will be able to provide a better service. At present terrestrial bearers carry its programs from Melbourne to transmitters at Shepparton, Darwin and Carnarvon, the latter two across long routes. Use of 12-watt transponder channels on the satellite to replace terrestrial bearers will improve the reliability of Radio Australia's terrestrial transmissions to its overseas audiences.
The Remote Area Television (RATV) Program began in 1980 with ABC television programs being delivered to terrestrial translator stations in remote areas via the INTELSAT IV satellite. Satellite-fed transmitters of the RATV Program will be transferred to the Satellite System when it begins operation in 1985. The RATV earth stations will be modified to accept the Australian satellite transmissions which will be at higher frequencies than INTELSAT IV's.
TELECOM
The types of Telecom services which could be provided by the Satellite System and which would be of benefit to Australians in remote areas include:
standard local automatic telephone service including access to the trunk and international network;
access to the public telegraph and Telex services;
public coin telephone service facilities;
the normal network service facilities such as manual assistance, directory and other information services.
Business users could benefit from:
standard data services over voice lines including the range of speeds from 50 bits per second to 4800 bits per second, and with suitable treatment even higher speeds;
private or leased line service capability by means of priority ranking for such services;
ability to connect a comprehensive range of customer equipment attachments such as facsimile, data modems, automatic answer and recording machines, telewriters and other printing machines;
analogue transmission of voice and sound programmes and video communications channels and various combinations and groups or multiples of these channels;
digital transmission facilities including 4.8 Kbit/s, 64 Kbit/s, 2 Mbit/s, 8 Mbit/s and 34 Mbit/s streams;
video and/or sound conferring services.
Access to the new Austpac and Digital Data services.
The above listening is not exhaustive but indicates the wide scope and possibilities of services which could be provided to anywhere within Australia with the aid of the satellite network envisaged by Telecom.
The services which will be incorporated, the extent and number of stations to be provided and the facilities to be included in these stations will be a function of customer requirements, the ultimate market size for a given service and the availability of funds.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT
To meet its responsibilities for the safe, expeditious and economic conduct of air transport and for the provision of facilities related to safety of life at sea, this Department owns and operates an extensive range of communications and control networks.
It proposes to use the Satellite System to provide a comprehensive network of point-to-point links which will carry voice

and data traffic between its many operational centres throughout Australia. They will also connect a multitude of remotely controlled aeromobile communications outlets to these centres. The design of the Satellite System will enable the Department's network to be serviced so that an alternative connection is continuously available through the second operational satellite via a duplicate ground station.
While major initial use of the Satellite System will be for aeronautical purposes, applications for marine and other transport modes should be implemented in the first few years at only marginal additional cost.
STATE AND TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS
The State and Territory Governments have been consulted throughout the planning for the introduction of NCSS and in developing the system service requirements. Recent discussions with these Governments indicate that the Satellite System can fulfil most of the telecommunications requirements identified in earlier consultations which cannot now be met adequately by terrestrial means.
State and Territory Governments are at various stages of planning for potential use of the Satellite System with most Government departments and organisations currently examining ways of using the flexibility that satellite services provide. Some States and the Northern Territory are giving serious consideration to the possibility of amalgamating individual needs and, for example, hiring half a transponder on a State Government basis.
The biggest demand appears to be for reliable two-way single channel communications-for example, between field headquarters and base stations for public safety and public works uses, using transportable earth stations. The most detailed work in forward planning has been undertaken by an Australia-wide working group of Police Departments.
Other public safety agencies which are preparing detailed plans include the State Emergency Services and Country Fire Authorities in various States and the Northern Territory. A range of potential satellite applications are foreseen including surveying and construction monitoring of automatic electricity generation stations and oil and gas pipelines, and the monitoring of river heights.
The use of the Satellite System for educational uses is under consideration by State and Territory education authorities. Various planning groups have been established and terrestrial trials using various forms of telecommunications are being conducted.
DISTANCE EDUCATION SERVICES
The various educational bodies throughout Australia all have a commitment to provide educational opportunities to all Australians, regardless of their situation. It should be noted, however, that geographic isolation is only one of a number of disadvantages which make distance education an important service for students in both country and metropolitan areas of Australia.
The use of the Satellite System for distance education is most likely to begin with the development of education broadcasting via the satellite of sound ('radio') and some use of selected television programs. These programs would include those produced by education departments and tertiary institutions. The possible availability of broadcast 'teletext' services would also have great potential for education at all levels.
Development of interactive services (by studies and terrestrial trials) for distance education is presently taking place. Extension of the switched telephone network, either by the Satellite System or other means, will allow a number of interactive services to be developed specifically for isolated students. These could include the use of various telephone

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2405

attachments, such as facsimile machines and electronic blackboards, together with specialised learning materials, and a new-look School of the Air. Small stand-alone, single-voicechannel earth stations (with television and radio receiving facilities, if required) will be part of these developments when the satellite is launched.
The work presently taking place is expected to allow State education authorities to quantify the costs and benefits of the various distance education methods, and lead ultimately to their implementation. Educational authorities and institutions around Australia are anxious to participate in the educational opportunities which will be provided by the Satellite System.
COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS USERS
Data transmission is likely to be a major use of the Satellite System by the commercial and business sectors. That portion of the total market which might be carried by satellite depends upon several factors, including the legal framework within which private companies will have to operate their communications systems, and the policies, tariffs and marketing strengths of AUSSAT Pty Ltd and Telecom.
Industry sectors likely to be major users of data services are:
Insurance companies
Banks
Building societies and credit unions
Finance companies
Department stores and supermarkets
Exploration companies
Libraries
Computer service bureaux
Airlines and hotels (reservation systems)
TABs
Newspapers and magazines (for remote printing).
COMMERCIAL BROADCASTERS
Acquiring program material and controlling its scheduling and distribution are key issues in commercial television operations. In many cases, stations acquire program rights under collective purchasing arrangements. With few exceptions, each station controls its own program scheduling and progam presentation.
Existing opportunities for networking may be limited by the capacity of Telecom's facilities. With the Satellite System, program assembly and distribution opportunities will be increased, especially where simultaneous distribution to a number of other stations is desired. Networking arrangements will, however, need to be regulated to preserve local control and origination of programs and advertising.
This should be the major use of the System by broadcasters. Discussions with the broadcasting industry in the latter half of 1981 showed that, subject to acceptable transponder rental charges, at least 9 and up to 22 transponders could be required for broadcasting, including that by the ABC, during the System lifespan.
SATELLITE BROADCASTING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service (HACBSS) has been central to the Satellite System design. In a "two-satellite" configuration, a second set of 3D-watt transponders will be available and will have a limited form of "direct broadcasting" capability.

Direct broadcasting via satellites is a new technology which has major implications for the structure and operation of traditional broadcasting systems. While some countries are committed to the launch of high-power satellite systems specifically designed for direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), no country currently operates a fully operational DBS service.
The Department of Communications has given particular attention to how this second set of 3D-watt transponders might be made available in an orderly and productive manner.
The preferred approach is to combine a range of uses in a developmental phase lasting several years. This will explore the types and range of broadcasting services suitable for remote and underserved communities. It will allow experience in satellite broadcasting to be developed before future policies are finalised. It will also fulfil demonstrated needs for broadcasting services, while providing a suitable environment to identify and develop new and innovative services.
A discussion paper has been circulated for comment, and the broadcasting industry, the public, special interest groups, State and Territory Governments and other parties are being consulted to determine what the implications for the Australian broadcasting system might be and how the Satellite Broadcasting Development Project might make most efficient use of available satellite capacity.
MINOR USERS
There are numerous potential users of the Satellite System who are likely to make only minor demands on capacity. Because they represent a diverse, disaggregated market, it is difficult to estimate the actual demands they are likely to make on the system. These users represent small business, educational institutions, community services such as health, and other non-profit interests.
Their interest is evidenced by the establishment of the Australian Satellite Users' Association to represent minor users. The Association has conducted a well-attended seminar on satellite access policy.
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
Ministerial discussions were held in Port Moresby during early November 1981 and the Australian Government announced that it would welcome an initiative by P,apua New Guinea to seek access to the Satellite System.
The Papua New Guinea Government subsequently announced a decision in principle to use the Satellite System to provide domestic broadcasting, telephony and other telecommunications services within that country. A draft Memorandum of Understanding is being considered by the respective Administrations.
May 1982
Mr SINCLAIR-About 110 years ago people of vision, courage and resourcefulness in this great continent of ours completed the overland telegraph line. It ran between Adelaide and Darwin. It ended the isolation of the Australian colonies from telegraphic communications with the rest of the world. Today I wish to announce that the Government and private enterprise together are embarking on the final stage of another communications endeavour of the utmost significance and importance to the Australian nation, tnat is the implementation of the national communications satellite system.
The two sectors, public and private, are today represented in membership of Aussat Pty Ltd which was incorporated on 6 November 1981,

2406 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

under the Chairmanship of Mr Stan Owens, c'B.E., and was at this stage a fully 100 per cent owned Commonwealth shareholding. While it is intended that up to 49 per cent of the capital of this company will be offered to the public, at present the diversity of the Aussat Board's composition has ensured that it has been able to bring to the appraisal of the preferred satellite system a high level of expertise and range of independent advice as widely based as that of any organisation in Australia. Aussat Pty Ltd has now been authorised to place contracts for three satellites and two ground control stations-one in Sydney, the other in Perth-with Hughes Communications International, of the United States. Another contract is under negotiation by Aussat Pty Ltd for the supply and installation of eight major city earth stations to transmit signals to and from the satellites. Approval for this contract is subject to further Government decision.
It is planned to have the satellite system in operation in mid or late 1985 and undoubtedly this splendid enterprise will have as profound an effect on Australian life then as did that single strand of galvanised iron wire swinging from 40,000 poles between Darwin and Adelaide in 1872. Our own satellites, parked in geostationary orbit 36,000 km above the surface of the earth, will enable a complete range of broadcasting and telecommunications services to be provided to the most remote corners of this vast continent. This is an inspirational undertaking for our nation, comparable to the Snowy Mountains scheme, the Indian Pacific standard gauge trans-Australia railway link and the ANZCAN-Australia-New Zealand-Canada-communications cable project in the vision, engineering ingenuity and dedication displayed by all those who have been connected with it.
Significantly this historic new step in communications and broadcasting links across the continent coincides with the fiftieth year of the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission for it will be one of the prospective major future users of the satellite system. Only about 2t years ago the Government announced that it was in the national interest to establish the satellite system. Honourable members will recall that this decision followed an inquiry by a Commonwealth Government task force headed by Mr Harold White, at that time General Manager of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, (Australia), known as OTC, and a subsequent report by a working party of officials. Since then the Government's investigations into the feasibility of the satellite system have been wide-ranging and

thorough. Literally hundreds of Australiansranging from people living in isolation with their families in the outback to businessmen running some of the nation's biggest companies-and many experts in high technology, both in Australia and overseas, have been engaged in discussions with Government officials concerning the satellite system. Without all this assistance, advice and assessment the Government would have been unable to maintain the momentum of planning and decision-taking that should see the system operational three years from now.
Services in Detail
I should like to explain in some detail what services can be provided via the satellite system. It is intended that these will include the interstate production, distribution and exchange of commercial and national television and radio programs which in policy terms will be subject to the maintenance of local control and origination of programs and advertising; the transmission of ABC television and a minimum of two radio services by relay to regional transmitters and by direct transmission from Aussat satellites to remote homesteads and communities embracing about 300,000 Australians who now receive no television, while a considerably larger number receive only one ABC radio service; the use of a second Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service and the means by which it can best extend services to remote communities, which is now under discussions with broadcasting, viewer and listener groups and special interest groups in Australia; an automatic telephony service to remote Telecom subscribers and the provision for back-up emergency and temporary main trunk route telephony services to assist in reducing congestion in areas of presently overloaded mainline trunk telephone demand or to restore services in an emergency; and aeronautical, maritime and land communications to meet Department of Transport operational and safety requirements. Expenditure by the Government on those services to be provided by the public sector will be considered in the context of annual Commonwealth Budgets. Many of these services are essential and would be prohibitively expensive and seemingly impossible using terrestrial means. All, I am advised, will be more cost effective through the use of the satellite system.
The system also has the capacity to provide improved distance education and telemedicine services; telecommunications services to off-shore islands and the oil and gas rigs, such as those in Bass Strait and on the North West Shelf areas of

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2407

Western Australia; voice and other telecommuni-
cations services to meet the requirements of scientific, commercial and mining interests and various
State and Commonwealth Government departments and authorities; and additional television and radio services providing a range of programs direct to remote and underserved regions of Australia. There is also a facility for teleconferencing, which is a means by which we can all participate in conferences without necessarily having to appear together in the one room.

concerning satellite usage coming from the educational community and State education departments for consideration by my colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). It is the State education authorities which have the prime responsibility for conducting remote area education and it is to be hoped that at an early time they will develop recommendations to ensure that the satellite facilities that are shortly to be available can be used to generate better educational opportunity for young people in remote areas.

The system's design will also permit broadcasting and telephony services to be provided within Papua New Guinea. The PNG Government has announced an 'in-principle' decision to use the satellite system to provide these services. A memorandum of understanding is being negotiated between our two governments. The system will give additional diversity and resilience to the already extensive terrestrial communications network in Australia, and provide the capability for rapid establishment of essential communications in emergencies, irrespective of where they occur. The satellites will also provide opportunities for establishing private specialised communications networks for organisations throughout Australia. In this way, private industry and research bodies can meet their requirements for voice communications and the transfer of computer data from remote locations or simultaneously to different parts of Australia. These developments are subject to recommendations yet to be made and, of course, considered by the Davidson Committee, but the NCSS has the potential capacity for some competitive telecommunications networks and alternatives to the existing terrestrial communications system.
I would also point out that we expect a number of other public authorities, especially those of the States, such as police and education authorities, to seek access to the system and use it. Satellite transmissions will be capable of being received s;multaneously by people with suitable equipment anywhere in Australia within the coverage area or 'footprint', as it is called, of the transmission. This feature cannot be duplicated in the terrestrial network. It provides a potential for the delivery of services far beyond usual radio and television programming. It could deliver educational courses simultaneously to distant students throughout a State and of course to those in the major capitals. In fact, it can give a whole new definition to the School of the Air and distance education in general. I look forward to some innovative proposals

Space Segment Contract
Honourable members will recall that the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, as the interim owner of the satellite system, was responsible for the major task of preparing a request for tender for the project covering the space segment and the major city earth stations. It did this with its customary efficiency and technical expertise and without this solid contribution by Mr Bob Somervaile and his associates to the project it is doubtful whether it would have proceeded so quickly to the stage that contracts can now be placed with Hughes Communications International. Responsibility for assessing the tenders passed to the wholly-owned Commonwealth company, Aussat Pty Ltd, after it was incorporated, as I mentioned earlier, on 6 November 1981. The company recommended that the preferred tenderer for the space segment should be Hughes, and on 17 December 1981 the Government authorised detailed contractual negotiations with that company. These, of course, have now been concluded. They have been completed to the satisfaction of all parties, and Aussat and Hughes should sign the contracts in the near future. Hughes has a proven track. record in developing satellite systems, its offer met the demanding requirements of the request for tender, and it was also the lowest priced tender.
Securing a launch vehicle was, of course, one of the more important requirements of the satellite project and to ensure that momentum would be maintained we have made three separate arrangements for such vehicles to ensure that our satellites can be placed in orbit on schedule during 1985. We have an option with the European launch authority, Arianespace, for two launches on the Ariane rocket during April-December 1985. These options were secured by reservation payments of $US200,000. The Ariane reservations were made to ensure maximum flexibility as additional launch reservation payments totalling a further $US200,000 had previously been made to the United States space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,

2408 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

for launching our satellites on either the conventional Delta rocket or the re-usable space shuttle. Choice of launch vehicle will be announced in due course by Aussat Pty Ltd.
Aussat seeks to establish major city earth stations at Brisbane, Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. These important stations it sees as providing public access to the satellites for television and radio program distribution and business and other communications services. The cost of the Hughes contracts for the three satellites and the two ground control stations, plus the cost of the launch vehicle and insurance is $A166m in 1982 terms. The Hughes contracts are fixed price and are not subject to inflation. In addition, of course, expenditure will be incurred in whatever contracts are accepted for the major city earth stations, the acquiring of land for them and the construction of necessary buildings. Subject to approval by the Government, details of these will be announced in due course by Aussat Pty Ltd. In view of the present nature of Aussat and the fact that it does not yet enjoy any quantifiable income, the Government has agreed that the capital expenditure on the satellite system and the initial operating costs of Aussat will be financed by a mix of commercial loans and an estimated $75m in equity contribution from the Commonwealth over the next five years. These bridging financial arrangements have been negotiated so that they will continue until December 1985, although I would expect permanent arrangements to be concluded once shares in Aussat have been issued to the public, and significantly earlier than that date. Payment under the Hughes contracts will be spread over almost 3t years from the date of signing. Having regard to this and the fact that Aussat has had offers from local and overseas lead banks which will ensure favourable bridging loans for the project pending long term funding arrangements, the call on the Federal Budget and initial expenditure will be kept to a minimum. Aussat will operate from the start as a fully commercial tax-paying body which in time will return dividends to its shareholders.
Other Tenders
Tenders for the supply of a large number of other earth stations are still being evaluated by Telecom and the Departments of Transport and Communications. Many of these earth stations are for inclusion in the new Australia-wide air traffic services and safety communications network for the Department of Transport while others will allow the Australian Broadcasting Commission to establish radio and television

links. Telecom will use its stations to provide telecommunications services in remote areas amongst other uses.
Ownership Provisions, Major City Earth Stations
The Government has decided that Aussat should be able to establish and own major city earth stations. It is the appropriate organisation to do so with assured resources and the responsibility of establishing a system in which all the major cities will be linked to the satellite system by mid-1985, the planned operational date. The importance of easy access by all users, and especially the ABC which is expected to be the major user, will be a prime consideration in the siting of these stations.
I should emphasise that private sector organisations will be free to establish their own earth stations to access the satellite system on exactly the same basis as Aussat. These will, of course, require radiocommunications licences and will need to meet established technical specifications. The arrangements will include access by the private sector to the satellite system on exactly the same terms and conditions as the earth stations available through Aussat. The company will not be permitted to cross-subsidise its earth stations from operations of the space segment. The ABC and other Commonwealth users will be able to submit proposals to establish their own earth stations where they consider these are necessary for their reasonable operational needs. In the instance of the ABC this will certainly include those at Rockhampton and Townsville.
Public Interest
I wish to stress that whilst we are anxious that Aussat proceed in a professional and competent way to establish and operate the satellite system, we are mindful of the wider interest of the community in this enterprise. We have a heavy responsibility under international treaty to ensure the most efficient use of the scarce and limited geostationary orbital positions and the use made of satellites, particularly in respect of avoiding the beaming of unwanted signals to neighbouring countries.
Also to be considered is the massive Telecom investment in the telecommunications infrastructure and the similar investment in the provision of broadcasting services. While it is in everyone's interests that the technical capability of the satellite system be translate!'! into community services, we, as a Government, cannot abrogate our responsibilities with respect to the broader policy

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2409

issues in the provision of broadcasts and telecommunication services to Australians. The current inquiries into cable and subscription television, Australia Post and telecommunications illustrate the importance of these issues to us. The recommendations of these inquiries will be taken into consideration in the detailed examination now under way concerning the public interest and legislative implications of the satellite system and our proposal to allow private equity capital participation. Today in this respect I would like to reconfirm the Government's decision to convert Aussat from a wholly Commonwealth-owned proprietary company to a publicly listed company with up to 49 per cent of the shares being held by the private sector as soon as practicable.
Consultation with Unions: Job Opportunities The Government is fully aware of the opportunities as well as the dislocations which can flow from the introduction of major new communications technologies.
My Department has consulted with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and these discussions have been of benefit to both parties. Similarly, Telecom and the Department of Transport have kept their staff associations and unions informed of the anticipated impact on staff levels, skill mix, probable timing and other key parameters. The ABC, also, has kept staff informed of the implications of the introduction of the Satellite System into its network. There is, and always has been, a rapid rate of technological change in the aviation industry, as honourable members will know, and staff employed at the Department of Transport have become accustomed to technological advance. This Department sees the Satellite System as presenting an opportunity to improve and expand important services it must provide to the aviation surface transport and maritime industries, and at a significantly lower cost than would be possible under any other system. It confidently predicts that the level of employment within these industries will not fall as a result of the introduction of the Satellite System. It will continue to ensure that plans are known and understood by staff and unions.
Orders worth more than $40m could flow to Australian firms from the space segment alone while there are excellent prospects for large-scale participation in the earth segment, with resultant job expectations. It is estimated that Australian industry could benefit by up to $80m worth of orders resulting from earth station equipment contracts. The Department of Transport, for example, in planning its Australia-wide air safety network based on the satellite system intends

using some 400 earth stations at over 200 different locations.
Telecom Australia envisages buying initially some 60 earth stations to provide remote telecommunications services and in the long term has a proposal for a further 440 earth stations. The estimated cost of these 500 installations over the years is about $60m. In addition, there is further employment potential in the manufacture of the small, receive-only earth stations for use by householders. These are technically less complex and have a potential market of over 20,000 units.
It is reasonable to assume that over the years Aussat itself will offer jobs to people such as engineers, technicians, marketers, economists and general administrators. Furthermore, satellite communications is a growth area around the world and there is a very real prospect of expansion in Australia and for export. I should emphasise that what I am announcing today is only the first generation of the Australian Satellite System. Our satellites have been designed to operate for at least seven years and during this period more employment opportunities should open up as planning proceeds on second and later generations of satellites. I might add that in the contract there is a guarantee of an effective life of at least seven years.
The Government has declared several times that Australian involvement in all stages of the satellite system will be maximised. Our preference and offset policies have been clearly stated and are directed at creating opportunities for Australian industry in terms of transferring technology to Australian firms, developing new techniques and processes, and thus enhancing job opportunities in these areas. The Hughes tender includes an offer of $5.1m Australian content which, honourable members will appreciate, is significant having in mind the high technology involved in the manufacture of the space components of satellite systems and the lack of existing Australian capability in the satellite field. Hughes Communications International has also provided a number of alternative offset offers involving part production and indirect offsets. These include work in relation to spacecraft elements and wiring harnesses, electronics subsystems for the two ground stations, and engineering support services. Hughes, in fact, has given a firm commitment to provide direct or indirect offsets to the value of about 30 per cent of the contract value of the equipment offered.
Changing Attitudes The brief examples I have spoken about in this speech give some indication of the effect that the

2410 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

new telecommunications technologies are having on our perceptions of communications and employment and on our attitudes to traditional ways of doing things. Australia has been well served by governments providing all of our telecommunications needs. The Postmaster-General's Department from the earliest days of Federation worked hard to establish a basic telephone network around Australia. There were major milestones in the development of that telecommunications network which attracted widespread public attention because of the benefits that people saw in expanding the nation's telecommunications facilities and in bringing our peoples closer together.
However, there has been an inevitable unevenness in the coverage and quality of the services delivered. There always seem to be people on the fringe of the coverage of terrestrial services, whether they live in the outer parameters of our major megalopolises or whether they live in the more remote areas of Australia. It is fair to say that our satellites will give us much more flexibility in meeting the national demand for broadcasting and general communications services. This is because we are now at the stage with terrestrial telecommunications of reaching out to fewer and fewer Australians across longer and longer distances. Additionally, we are encountering restraints on our ability to increase the capacity of the terrestrial network to cope with every demand. Longer term demands might be within our scope, but short-term demands and peak loads sometimes have to be forgone in the interests of running the terrestrial network economically. Satellite communications do not suffer in the same way from these problems. There is no heavy investment in constructing lines from one user to another. The link can be made by two earth stations and some channel capacity on a satellite. It is a link which can be made for an hour, a day or a year; and of course, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Papua New Guinea Involvement
I have been talking about the Australian situation, but I want honourable members to recall also our special relationship with Papua New Guinea. That country faces just as many problems in its own way as we do in establishing a total national broadcasting and telecommunications system. When I visited Port Moresby last November I had the opportunity to discuss the future development of communication services with Ministers of the Papua New Guinea Government.
More than 70 per cent of the people of that country live outside the main cities and towns.

For many communities the basic telephone system cannot be provided by terrestrial means because of the mountainous terrain and the difficulty of moving through the jungle-like vegetation. I was pleased to be able to say then that Australia could make available to Papua New Guinea sufficient transponder capacity to meet the special needs of that country. The Government there has responded favourably to this offer and has decided 'in principle' to use the satellite system to provide domestic broadcasting, telephony and other telecommunications services.
We would have liked to offer similar arrangements to other South Pacific nations, but design and capacity constraints have precluded us from doing so on this, the first generation of Australian satellites. We are, however, participating in a study to examine the telecommunications needs of South Pacific island countries over the next decade, with special emphasis on rural areas. This study was formally requested last year by the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. Australia is contributing to the cost of the study and providing technical experts.
The Changing Communications Environment
On the domestic front we are hoping also that ways can be found to help Australians develop a variety of new applications of satellite communications during the initial years of the national communications satellite system. My Department has put forward one imaginative proposal that could give people some access to satellite capacity for developmental purposes. It is known as the Satellite Broadcasting Development Project, but considerable legislative and technical planning has yet to be done before the Government can decide how a range of new types of services can be provided on a national and/or regional basis.
Satellites have changed our way of thinking about telecommunications and also our notions of the organisational structure of the business of providing telecommunications services. The freedom which satellite communication gives us, makes it technically possible for private telecommunications firms to provide services alongside government telecommunications facilities. Advancing technology with its potential to expand such facilities was one of the reasons we established the inquiry into telecommunications services in Australia, headed by one of Australia's most prominent businessmen, Mr Jim Davidson. One of the issues to be considered by this inquiry is the extent to which private enterprise can be involved in those areas of Telecom's activities, not subject to competition, to bring a more efficient and economical service to the public.

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2411

Conclusion
By our decisions in regard to the national communications satellite system, the Government is making opportunities available to many Australians to participate in the construction of the system. Some high technology will be transferred to Australian industry by the American contractor. Other Australians will be engaged in installing and maintaining earth stations all over the country. Still more Australians will be preparing the information and programs for transmission via the satellite system. The system itself, of course, costs a great deal of money. The facilities that will be extended to it will cost even larger sums of money. But I stress that those facilities, were they to be provided by terrestrial means, would cost significantly more and in that case it would mean that Australians in some instances may not enjoy those facilities for many years to come.
The Government earnestly hopes that as we get closer and closer to the launch date in 1985 more and more Australians will show an entrepreneurial zeal in helping to establish our satellite system as a truly important national project of benefit to all the people of this country.
I present the following paper:
National Communications Satellite System~Ministerial Statement, 6 May 1982.
Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed:
That the House take note of the papers.
Debate (on motion by Mr Dawkins) adjourned.
PUBLIC SERVICE ACTS AMENDMENT BILL 1981
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 29 October 1981, on motion by Mr Viner:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr CONNOLLY (Bradfield) (5.54)-The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981 contains a range of very significant amendments to the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth. Along with earlier amendments which have been introduced in recent years by the present Government in an effort to update the whole basis of the Australian Public Service, we see this as an attempt by the Government-and a successful one-to give the Australian people the highest standard of public administration which can be provided. By international standards the Australian Public Service is one of the most efficient in the world. While there is a tendency for many

people to decry various aspects of public administration it would be worth the while of those people to compare the administrative systems of other countries with those of Australia before
they make such comments.
The legislation before the House contains a number of very significant amendments. For example, we are discussing the abolition of divisional structures in the Australian Public Service which were originally recommended by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, known as the Coombs inquiry. In addition, we have further revised procedures for promotions and transfers arising from Joint Council recommendations-that is, agreement between the Public Service Board, the Government and the trade unions involved. Furthermore, we see here examples of provisions to establish non-adversary promotion appeal processes, having regard to recent judgments such as the Finch v. Goldstein case, which was adjudicated by Mr Justice Ellicott. Furthermore, we see provisions for the giving of reports to
officers aggrieved by promotion or transfer decisions arising as a result of those legal decisions. There are further amendments on other various matters.
However, the overall arrangements must be seen in the context of what the Public Service needs to be able to achieve in the 1980s and beyond. Quite obviously, along with the private sector the public sector must be sufficiently staffed and manned at all levels to be able to give to governments and to the Australian people the highest standard of advice and public administration that can be achieved. For that reason it has been decided to do away with the old structure which has been in position since 1901; namely, that there should be four divisions within the Public Service. The traditional view was that these four divisions represented the skills, the experience and the educational requirements for various elements of the total spectrum of Public Service activity. Thus we saw that in the First Division we had the permanent heads of departments and in the Second Division, senior executive elements of the public sector; the Third Division was made up of clerical and professional positions; and, of course, the Fourth Divsion contained the remaining members of the Public Service.
Because of very significant changes in the requirements of manpower within the public sector over recent years it has been decided to do away with these divisions. One of the principal reasons was that with the high level of technology coming into the service and the greater number of professional people being recruited-whether they be

2412 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

lawyers, scientists or engineers-it was no longer relevant to regard them all as some form of quasiclerks and it was decided that their salaries and the other elements of their service conditions should be ranged on that basis. For this reason it has been decided, and rightly so, that, for example, the previous 60 separate pay groupings contained in the Third Division alone should be done away with. In future they will be based on the criteria of special training or qualifications for personnel in those specific salary bands. That is a very significant alteration and it simply means that we will now have a more cohesive public sector in terms of administration of personnel than we have had in recent years.
The proposed arrangements have also enabled the design of occupational requirements of each individual department within the public sector. These occupational groups will have their own salary structures and appropriate qualifications will be required for people entering those areas. In view of the lateness of the hour I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour this evening.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.
Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m.
NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEM
Ministerial Statement
Debate resumed.
Mr DAWKINS (Fremantle) (8.0)-Just before the suspension of the sitting for dinner the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) presented the House with an information paper and a statement concerning Government decisions in relation to the domestic satellite for Australia. I want to respond on behalf of the Opposition. In commencing my remarks I indicate that I will share this task with two of my colleagues, the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), both of whom have very large electorates, spreading in the one case throughout most of South Australia and in the other throughout most of Western Australia. They will be making some remarks on this matter as well. The Opposition of course welcomes the statement because it comes at the end of a long period during which the Government has been extraordinarily and unnecessarily coy about the whole issue of a domestic satellite. The original decision to have such a satellite was made a long time ago and we have waited months-indeed, years-for a statement of this kind, which goes into some detail about what the satellite will do and about the sorts of

objectives of the whole satellite policy. Regrettably, the statement by the Minister remains pretty deficient in terms of detail of the proposal.
The first matter to which I wish to refer is that of cost. The great issue which divided the White committee, which first considered the question of a domestic satellite, was that of cost. On the one hand, those who were in favour of the satellite made estimates about its cost and on the other hand the Department of Finance made entirely different estimates about its cost. Needless to say, the Department's estimates were higher. One is forced to conclude, as a result of the statement that the Minsiter has made tonight, that the Government is still not very much further advanced in terms of telling us what the total cost of the proposal will be. The Government makes a statement about what a part of the contracted cost will be. It is a very vague statement indeed because it purports to suggest that the cost includes the cost of launching. But in an earlier paragraph of the statement the Government indicates that it has three possible means of launching the satellite. The Government does not say that those various options come in at the same price and one would be very surprised if, in fact, that was the case. That remains a major component of the overall cost of having the satellite. Therefore, I believe that-the figure which the Government now says represents the final cost of the satellite communications system has to be considered somewhat suspect. It is true that that part of the contract which deals with the provision of the satellite itself-the Hughes Communications International part of the contract-is a fixed cost contract but there are very many other components of the total cost on which the Government has not yet come clean. So we are alarmed at the prospect that this might be the sort of project the cost of which will escalate alarmingly between now and the time when the system will actually become operational. We are concerned about that mainly because of the effects it might have either on the cost to the user or on the cost to the taxpayer if, as a result of a vast escalation in the cost of getting the satellite, the taxpayer is left picking up part of the bill.
Let us look at the matter of telephone services to remote communities. The Government has always made great play of the fact that one of the major objectives of the satellite would be to provide improved, indeed superb, telephone services to remote communities throughout Australia. That is terrific. Of course, we welcome the prospect that remote communities in Australia, which at the moment have no telephones or have inadequate telephone systems, may as a result of

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2413

this satellite have greatly improved telecommunications systems. If there is to be a vast increase in the overall cost of the system then either those remote users will have to pay much more or else, in order to keep the cost to them at something like a reasonable level, the rest of Australia will be paying vastly to subsidise that cost.
The Government says that something like 300,000 remote-dwelling Australians will benefit as a result of this satellite. I suspect that it would be unnecessary for me to remind the Government that a large proportion of those remote dwelling Australians are unlikely to make use of this satellite. A large component of the people who live in remote areas in the Australian community is Aboriginal. They do not have telephones or television sets. Indeed, they would be very grateful to have fresh running water. That is just one of the things which they are desperately in need of. That is not to mention decent education, health, transport services and so on. Whilst it might sound terrific for the Government to say that 300,000 people in remote parts of Australia will benefit, one has to look a little bit more carefully at who these people are and whether they are likely to benefit from it.
The Minister indicated throughout his statement that the satellite will open up the possibility of alternate telecommunications systems. He was very imprecise about this. It is the nature of this Minister to let out information bit by bit. We have to be content with the clues which he tends to drop from time to time to give us an indication of his real purpose. Is the Minister saying that as a result of a telecommunications satellite we will be able to divide the telecommunications system in Australia between the highly profitable areas and the much less profitable areas? Everybody knows that to provide telecommunications between two vast communities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, is a relatively inexpensive activity. It is relative in terms of the cost of providing telecommunications between, say, Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs where two much smaller communities are separated by a much greater distance. Indeed, they are also separated from other population centres by vast distances.
If what the Minister is telling us is that as a result of the existence of a satellite we will be able to have a low cost telecommunications system via the satellite which services, say, Sydney and Melbourne and also some other large population centres, then what that necessarily means is that other smaller population centres throughout Australia will suffer very greatly. Either the people in those communities will have to pay very much more for the cost of their telephones and so

on or, alternatively, the taxpayers generally will have to subsidise the cost of this telecommunications system. It seems to me that at a time when the Government-the Minister particularly-is saying that the satellite opens up the possibility of alternative telecommunications systems it ought to come clean and say what the implications are for the rest of Australia as a result of such a decision. It is not enough simply to say that a satellite represents an opportunity for remote-dwelling Australians to have-in many cases for the first time-a decent telephone system, which is something that we all must welcome, unless the Minister then goes on to say what the cost will be to those people and, just as importantly, what the cost will be to the rest of Australia to provide that system.
That raises another question. Telecom, which has been recognised in Australia and supported by governments of both sides either in its existing form or its previous form as a publicly owned telecommunications monopoly, is now to have a rival. In a country such as Australia with such a sparsely settled population, as it is overall, one is forced to question whether it is a sensible decision to have our telecommunications divided between Telecom on the one hand and Aussat Pty Ltd on the other hand, both to a large extent publicly controlled organisations. Aussat is not publicly owned entirely but is publicly controlled. What is the sense in having the telecommunications system in Australia divided in that way? Is that an effective way of providing telecommunications systems throughout Australia? If so, where is the justification for it? Currently an inquiry is being conducted by the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia. Yet long before the Davidson Committee is able to make its report on these questions we have this important decision which means that Aussat will be in a position to provide an alternative form of communications, not only to remote dwelling Australians but also to a whole range of other telecommunications users.
Mr Tuckey-The Telecom unions might--
Mr DAWKINS-Need I remind even the idiotic member for O'Connor--
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.
Mr DAWKINS-I withdraw. Not all Western Australians are the same, thank God. Some of us are at least partly decent. The point is that what we are being offered is a dual system of publicly controlled telecommunications. Of course, the honourable member for O'Connor would think it

2414 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

National Communications Satellite System

was terrific if there was a wayof getting around the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. But it is very much more important than that. What I am really asking is whether, in a country such as Australia in which it is a vastly complex task to try to provide telecommunications systems throughout the country for everyone in the country, there is any sense in having two organisations trying to fulfil that particular task. I need not remind the House that Telecom is not represented on the Aussat consortium. Although Aussat will be 51 per cent controlled by the Commonwealth, Telecom has no direct representation on it. It seems to me that that is fairly ludicrous if the Government's overall objective is to provide a sensible, effective and efficient telecommunications system throughout the country.
There are other matters which, of course, are of concern to us. The 49 per cent of Aussat which will be in private hands will be very largely in the hands of those people who use the satellite. The Minister spent a couple of pages of his statement talking about the public interest, but the real question about the public interest is whether the private interests-the users who are involved in Aussat and who represent nearly 50 per cent of Aussat-will really have the public interest in mind or their own interests in mind when they make decisions on matters such as pricing of the services which the satellite provides. I think the statement is inordinately inadequate in terms of addressing this sort of question just as it is inadequate in terms of safeguarding regional television interests.
Mr Tuckey-No, he said that.
Mr DAWKINS-It has not been said. The point is that, if we have an alternative form of television via the satellite as opposed to that provided by regional television stations-
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
(Extension oftime granted).
Mr DAWKINS-I thank the House and I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Safeguards need to be built in to ensure that we do not have a system whereby the major national networks, which appear to be the major beneficiaries of this particular proposal, are able to undercut and in fact make irrelevant the regional television stations throughout Australia. Those regional television stations provide an important service to the communities that they serve and their interests ought to be safeguarded in the context of this proposal.

I have indicated that there are other speakers on this side of the House who want to address this question. I do not intend to go much further. I cannot, however, resist the temptation to observe that the Minister, in his statement, has revealed the breathtaking news that this satellite will benefit off-shore islands. I am not sure what islands there are around Australia other than offshore islands, but one off-shore island which comes readily to mind is Lord Howe Island. Important relatives of the Minister for Communications reside on Lord Howe Island. What has been indicated in the Minister's statement is that the vast expense which he is now requiring Telecom to undertake in order to provide improved telecommunications systems for his important relatives will in fact be rendered completely irrelevant as a result of this proposal. One of the main claims of the Government and the Minister is that this satellite will provide telecommunications services to 'off-shore islands in Australia'. Therefore, we are again forced to question the real motives of the Minister for Communications in standing over Telecom in order that he can provide a service for his father-in-law to ensure that he can ring up the golf club to find out whether he is right for a game at the local golf course on Lord Howe Island.
This is an important statement. The Opposition welcomes it. We are in favour of this sort of telecommunications advance. As I have indicated, it is deficient in a number of important areas. Those are matters which we will take up in due course.
Mr WALLIS (Grey) (8.19)-I rise to speak for a few minutes on the statement by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). As a representative of a large country electorate, I welcome the statement. I hope that the domestic satellite will help to overcome many of the problems faced by people in country areas. The Minister in his statement mentioned some of the uses which could be made of the satellite. The three which are probably most important in those large country areas are the telephone services, the television services and the Australian Broadcasting Commission and radio services generally. I realise that there are many other uses for the satellite but I think those are the three important services in respect of which country people are most disadvantaged at the present time. All of the large country areas will be advantaged by the establishment of the satellite. My colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) will be following me in this debate. Between us he and I represent approximately 42 per cent to 43 per cent of Australia, and we probably have in our

National Communications Satellite System

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2415

electorates some of the most remote areas which can be served by this satellite.
The people on Eyre Peninsula will be pleased to hear that a satellite will be going up in three years' time. They probably will be disappointed to learn they will have to wait another three years before television services are provided. The provision of television services to this area has a pretty sick and sorry history. The people of this area have felt absolutely frustrated. They have been given various information at various times about plans which have never come to fruition or which have been implemented in a very small way. As a result, they have felt very frustrated about the whole thing. I remember that when there was first talk of a domestic satellite I asked the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether it would make any difference to the announced terrestrial program. He said that it would make no difference whatsoever and that the program would go ahead. The people on Eyre Peninsula in particular have abandoned any faith in the Government on this matter because apart from a small satellite station at Streaky Bay the terrestrial program has not gone ahead at all. The only hope they have is to remain patient and hope that the services will be provided by the domestic satellite, which of course they will. .
This whole frustrating exercise commenced possibly about 1976-77. I remember criticising the program in 1976-77 just prior to the election. A South Australian senator made a statement that he had just received a definite undertaking from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that a satisfactory television service would be operating on Eyre Peninsula and the west coast within the next 12 months. The Senator said it was not possible to give a firm date when the service would commence but it would be within the new year. He said that specific details were in the final stages of preparation and included the location of the installations. He also said that this was a definite public undertaking and that provided the then Government was returned, the people of Eyre Peninsula would be able to enjoy a decent television service at last. That statemnt was made on 2 December 1977. As I said, the only progress that has been made in the provision of these services is the establishment of a small station at Streaky Bay which utilises Intelsat.
Many statements have been made since then that have increased the frustration of the people. In 1980 the then Minister wrote to the Acting General Manager of Telecom Australia which acted as agent for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in respect of installation and so forth. He stated in his letter:

The particular project is to extend and upgrade national television services in the Eyre Peninsula region of South Australia. This has had a most unfortunate history of unmet commitments, and I am determined to commence actual installation of these facilities as a matter of urgency.
The Minister was honest enough to admit that there were unfulfilled commitments. He went on to say:
I have given a personal commitment to the residents of these areas to complete this part of the overall project as quickly as possible. My specific undertaking was to commence installation of these sites before the end of this year so that the actual transmission could begin early next year.
That is, early 1981. Again, I point out that the only thing that has happened is that a satellite station has been established at Streaky Bay. However, the Minister was at least honest enough to say that there were unfulfilled commitments. He mentioned the unhappy incidents that had taken place. However, further statements indicate that very few of the Government's promises and statements have been carried out. That is why I feel that the people of this area have been frustrated. When one talks about the provision of television on the west coast the people laugh in one's face. Promises have been made to these people in the past but those promises have been unfulfilled. However, if they are patient we hope they will be able to obtain these facilities in the next three years when the domestic satellite is launched. Of course, the satellite will not only be used for television purposes. Many people in the outback have problems in regard to telephones and radios. We hope that the people in the outback areas who rely on the ABC will have the choice of at least more than one radio channel for their enjoyment.
Mr CAMPBELL (Kalgoorlie) (8.25)-Like my colleagues, I welcome the announcement today by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). There are some areas of concern which worry me. The 49 per cent of capital that it is intended to sell to the private sector is a matter of concern. The return on capital for Telecom Australia is extremely small. Telecom works under a particularly difficult charter by which it is required to be largdy self-financing and to operate at full cost recovery. Yet it is expected to provide services to remote areas. These aspects of its charter are simply incompatible. Obviously, public ownership of a satellite will require a far higher return on capital than that which accrues to Telecom, and this will be to the disadvantage of country areas.
The Minister mentioned that a considerable number of people have radio reception for only one radio station in Australia. I am glad about the satellite because it will bring radio broadcasts to a considerable number of people in my electorate

2416 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

who can receive no radio station broadcasts whatsoever at the present time. I refer to people living north and east of Kalgoorlie, and north and east of places such as Geraldton, not to mention the Kimberleys, where daylight reception is almost impossible.
One of the things that worry me is the oversell of this system by the Minister. The Minister told us about some of its capabilities. He says that it will have the capability to handle the School of the Air. Frankly, I doubt very much whether the first satellite, certainly, will have the transponder capacity to deliver School of the Air-type services. It will certainly not have any up-leg on it. It is misleading of the Minister to imply that it has. I do not blame the Minister, because there is much in the Minister's speech that one could have read in Hughes company propaganda or heard if one had attended the various seminars sponsored by the Hughes company in 1980. So in this case I do not blame the Minister.
I also query whether we should not have looked further at the European technology. I think that the European satellite has a more advanced transponder system and it seems to be able to accommodate more channels by some sort of channel splitting device, which is technically beyond me to understand. I should like to comment on the local offset program. The sum of $5m seems to me to involve a very small local offset. The Minister said-rather condescendingly, I thought-that this is because of the high technology involved. I suggest that we have people in Australia with the necessary technological skills. Certainly we have them within Telecom. I thought that there would have been an excellent chance to get offset arrangements for Telecom itself to be involved in the manufacture of this satellite to a far greater degree than we see here.
As I say, it is most welcome that we are to get this satellite. Telecom has already said that a very large number of people will already be accommodated by the terrestrial system. Although the Minister said that the satellite will extend computer facilities to mining towns, I think that that is also most unlikely. Most mining areas are already, or planned to be, on a m ..:rowave system, and it is well known that the microwave is far better and far more efficient for transmission of computer data. Due to limited time available, that is all I have to say at present.

CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by MrHunt:
That the BiJI be now read a second time.
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Minister for Communications)-Perhaps I may have your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill and the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability Amendment) Bill 1982 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? I shall allow that course to be adopted.
(Quorum formed).
MrMORRIS (Shortland) (8.31)-Mr Deputy Speaker,-
Mr Hodgman-You have not got much support. There are only six of your colleagues here.
Mr MORRIS-One on this side is equal to 40 on that side, my friend, so do not worry about it.
Mr Hodgman-Six little Nazis.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The Minister for the Capital Territory will remain silent.
Mr MORRIS-Mr Deputy Speaker, I find the Minister's reference to the Opposition as Nazis objectionable. I demand that it be withdrawn.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The Chair did not hear the remark to which-
Mr MORRIS-It was heard clearly, Mr Deputy Speaker, on this side of the chamber.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member must appreciate that quite often the Chair, under the crossfire interjection, is somewhat disadvantaged. However, if the Minister for the Capital Territory made the alleged remark I ask him to withdraw.
Mr Hodgman-I said exactly what he said about me last week and I was sat down.
Mr Dawkins-You are an outrage. Why don't you stand up and withdraw.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Fremantle will resume his seat. The Minister will not trifle with the Chair. When he is requested to withdraw he will simply and directly do that without qualification.
Mr Hodgman-I withdraw.

Mr MORRIS-The purpose of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill is to amend Part IV of the principal Act, the Civil Aviation (Carriers'Liability) Act 1959, to raise the limitation on damages for personal injury suffered in a commercial air accident from $45,000 to $100,000 operative from dates to be proclaimed. The Bill also provides for the limit on liability for damage to registered baggage to be raised from the existing $300 to $900, and in respect of hand baggage from $30 to $90. Clause 3 of the Bill widens the definitions of airline licence and charter licence to ensure that carriage by operators following the introduction of the new air service licence classifications later this year will be covered by the provisions of the principal Act. The Bill empowers the Minister to make future adjustments to the limits of compensation by regulations in lieu of amendments to the principal Act, as has been the practice in the past. The increased limits of compensation provided in the Bill, are in the view of the Australian Labor Party inadequate and long overdue.
Although the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in his second reading speech adverted to the absence of compulsory third party insurance to protect passengers on aircraft not covered by the existing legislation, he gave no indication of the Government's intention or timetable to remedy this serious deficiency. Despite the inadequacies and shortcomings of the Bill, the Opposition will not oppose it only because it makes some improvement on existing air compensation limits. However, at a later stage, I will move a second reading amendment calling for the introduction of third party personal injury insurance in respect of passengers on all aircraft operated in Australia, and which are not covered by this Bill and the principal Act. In the Committee stage of this Bill and its companion measure, the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill 1982, I will move amendments to provide for automatic biennial adjustments in personal injury compensation limits based on movements in average weekly earnings in the preceding period. I will return to those matters later in the debate.
I point out that Parts I to IlIA of the principal Act apply the provisions of given international conventions to situations of international air travel involving questions of liability for damages. The current limit on compensation for personal injury suffered in an accident occurring in the course of an international flight is $US75,000. However, the limit of compensation prescribed in international conventions has no bearing on the limit to be determined for injury or death arising

from domestic air travel excepting in cases where the domestic travel sector is part of an international flight. It is therefore irrelevant for the Government to attempt to relate the limit of compensation set out in international conventions to that of domestic air travel. The limit of compensation for injury or death suffered in domestic air accidents is solely a decision for the Australian government of the day.
The Minister, in his second reading speech of 24 March 1982, misled the House when he said the $45,000 limit on compensation set in 1976 reflected the levels that generally applied to international operations. The facts are that the limit under the Warsaw Convention at that time was $58,000. In addition, the United States of America, which has the largest air travel market in the world, has always been opposed to the limits set by the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol. As I said in 1976, dissatisfaction with those limits had resulted in the United States, certain European governments and the International Air Transport Association working out the Montreal Agreement under the terms of which carriers serving the United States accepted a limit of liability of $US75,000. Also in his second reading speech the Minister made slight reference to the need to amend the liability limits set under the Warsaw Convention and to associated instruments. He mentioned the protocols developed at the 1975 international conference in Montreal. Now, some seven years later, all he saw fit to advise the House was that the Government is examining possible interim arrangements in respect of limits on airline liability for international carriage until the date on which the protocols operate.
This incompetent Government and this incompetent Minister owe it to the Australian public to give a full account of the proposed changes in airline liability and to report on what action is proposed and when it is expected to be taken. The six-year delay in introducing this legislation is the latest evidence of this scandal-ridden Government's irresponsible and uncaring attitude to the critical issue of air accident compensation.
The essence of the principal Act is that the question of negligence by an air service operator in the event of an accident is not contested by the operators, excepting where the claimant party is shown to have contributed to the cause of the accident. In return, a limit is applied to the amount of damages that can be awarded to a claimant or claimants by the court. In effect, it constitutes a trade off, an admission of liability, in return for a limit on the operator's liability. It thus

2418 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

constitutes a form of no-fault insurance, with resultant savings in litigation costs for both parties. In such a system, it is essential that the limit of compensation be adequate and subject to regular review in light of changes in money values and personal earning capacity as measured by movements in average weekly earnings. It is in this area that this divided and discredited conservative Government has acted both irresponsibly and uncaringly.
The original legislation of 1959 set a compensation limit of $15,000. This was doubled to $30,000 in 1970 with the then Minister for Civil Aviation, Senator Sir Robert Cotton, referring in his second reading speech to the increase in average weekly earnings as a basis for the lifting of the limit to $30,000. When the limit was increased to $45,000 in 1976, this basis for the establishment of the limit was abandoned by the then Minister for Transport, who is now the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon. No reason for the selection of $45,000 as an appropriate limit was given by the then Minister other than a comment that the increase was acceptable to air service operators. Based on movements in average weekly earnings between 1959 and 1976, the limit should have been raised to $67,000. Regrettably, for dependents of victims of the tragic Advance Airlines crash of 21 February 1980, the Opposition's amendment designed to achieve this was rejected by the Government in the Senate in November 1976. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in rejecting the Opposition's amendment to increase the domestic limit from $45,000 to $67,000, revealed the true background to the $45,000 limit when she said it was a considered judgment of the Government.
Similarly, the present Minister for Transport has given no valid reason for the selection of the limit of $100,000 now proposed in this Bill. Why has he not given such a reason? There is no responsible rationale for the figure of $100,000. The Government's concern at the adequacy of domestic liability levels mentioned in his second reading speech has not been supported by his actions or the Government's actions to date. It was a mock concern for the interests of air travellers.
The new limit is also seriously deficient because, again using movements in average weekly earnings between 1959 and 31 December 1981 as a basis for calculation, it is clear that the limit on compensation should be raised to $130,000. I will deal with this matter further in the Committee stages of the Bill.
Although the provisions of the principal Act are designed to minimise litigation costs and

delays, dependent families of air accident victims have been disadvantaged in that they have been forced to wait, in some cases, for a number of years for settlement of compensation claims. The callous and negligent attitude of the Fraser Government has been dramatically illustrated by events related to the tragic Advance Airlines crashof21 February 1980.
Three major factors are involved: The irresponsibly inadequate limit of air accident compensation; operational practices within the general aviation industry; and the standard of supervision of air safety procedures by the Department of Transport. Dependants of victims of the tragic crash are entitled to a maximum compensation of $45,000 including medical and hospital costs. If the Government had acted responsibly in 1976 or at any time in the following period to 21 February 1980, their maximum compensation would have been almost double that amount.
Because of the long delay in investigating the causal factors of the crash, and the subsequent board of inquiry proceedings now in progress, compensation claims have not been settled. On 7 October 1981, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that families bereaved by the light plane crash of 21 February 1980 were running out of time to make claims against the airline. It quoted Mr Daryl Goode, the solicitor representing seven of the thirteen victims' families, telling the City Coroners Court that claims under the Civil Aviation (Carrier's Liability) Act had to be lodged within 2 years under the Statute of Limitations. Mr Goode said:
Bereaved families were concerned that inquiries into the disaster had already taken 19 months.
In later hearings the problem of lodgment of claims was overcome, but the Sydney Morning Herald report shows the delays and real difficulties that arise for claimants following an air crash. Honourable members will recall the Government's shameful attempt last September to cover up the circumstances of the Advance Airlines crash. It was only after pressure from the Opposition that the Minister for Transport was forced to reverse his earlier decision and establish a board of inquiry into the crash. Even then, the terms of reference were unjustifiably restricted in our view by the Minister for Transport.
Establishment of appropriate air safety standards and their proper supervision are the responsibilities of the Department of Transport and the Government. Full investigation of all matters associated with, or possibly contributing to, an air crash is essential if those responsibilities are to be

carried out satisfactorily and public air safety ensured.
In my Press statement of 14 October 1981, I set out the matters the Opposition believed ought to be investigated and reported on by the board of inquiry. I seek leave to incorporate a copy of that statement. I have not had a chance to show it to the Minister for Transport but it is with Hansard and I will show it to him a little later.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows-
STATEMENT BY PETER MORRIS
Shadow Minister for Transport Canberra
14 October 1981
ADVANCE AIRLINES CRASH INQUIRY TOO NARROW
Having initially decided against a public inquiry into the Advance Airlines crash of 21 February 1980, the Minister for Transport has limited its Terms of Reference to avoid any embarrassment to his Department.
He has rejected the powers available to him under Air Navigation Regulations to empower the Board to inquire into the conclusions in the Air Safety Investigation Branch report that:
'Officers of the Department of Transport were aware of the unapproved practices in respect of standard passenger weights and reduced power take-offs but action had not been taken to regularise the company's operations.'
Only 3 months before the tragic crash occurred, his predecessor told the Parliament:
'Action is continually being taken to ensure that the required standard of maintenance in general aviation is adequate and is being observed by the industry.'
The report shows that Mr Nixon's assurance on air safety was meaningless.
Unless the Board's Terms of Reference are extended to require it to inquire into and report upon:
I. The extent to which Advance Airlines engaged in any unapproved practices at the time of the fatal crash at Sydney Airport on 21 February, 1980 and the extent to which unapproved practices (ifany) contributed to that crash.
2. The eXlent to which any other aviation operator within Australia has engaged in unauthorised practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines.
3. The officers of the Department of Transport who
(i) were aware;
(ii) should have been aware;
of unapproved practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines.
4. The extent to which
(i) The Minister for Transport and/or
(ii) The Secretary of the Department of Transport
(a) was aware;
(b) should have been aware;
of unapproved practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines.

5. The extent of Ministerial and Permanent Head control of the Department of Transport as it affects air safety.
6. The experience and level of competence and expertise of departmental officers employed with responsibilities relating to air safety.
7. The degree of scrutiny by the Department of Transport of the standards of operation of Advance Airlines during the two years prior to the crash of 21 February, 1980.
8. The extent of engineering surveillance by the Department of Transport of Advance Airlines' workshop during the two years prior to the crash of 21 February, 1980.
9. The measures necessary to ensure the discontinuation of unauthorised practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines or other aviation operators.
10. The efficiency and propriety of the methods of investigation and report (including any allegations of premature disclosure) by the Air Safety Investigation Branch.
II. The staffing structure and morale within the Department of Transport as it affects air safety issues.
12. Any question of conflict of interest relating to, or affecting, the Department of Transport in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to air safety.
Lingering doubts about the way air safety surveillance is conducted in this country will remain.
The provisions of the Instrument of appointment of the Board of Inquiry, unless extended, could well result in the Inquiry being seen as a blatant cover-up of ministerial incompetence and failures of the Department of Transport to carry out its statutory responsibilities in respect of air safety.
Mr MORRIS-In that statement. I referred to several points that ought to have been fully investigated. I will pick out several at random because the statement is too long to make reference to all of it. The second item on that list is:
The extent to which any other aviation operator within Australia has engaged in unauthorised practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines.
Item 7 states:
The degree of scrutiny by the Department of Transport of the standards of operation of Advance Airlines during the two years prior to the crash of 21 February, 1980.
Item 9 states:
The measures necessary to ensure the discontinuation of unauthorised practices (if any) adopted by Advance Airlines or other aviation operators.
Item 12 states:
Any question of conflict of interest relating to, or affecting, the Department of Transport in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to air safety.
Under the terms of Air Navigation Regulation 287, section 1, the Board of Accident Inquiry into this crash is charged with the responsibility of inquiring into the causes of the accident. The Minister has refused repeatedly to widen the terms of that inquiry to embrace the matters to which I have referred. He has power to do so under the regulation to which I have just referred. There is no doubt in my mind that in general aviation all

2420 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

air safety practices and regulations are not complied with. Extensive private evidence of this is available from operators, pilots and ground staff within the industry, all of whom are afraid to speak out publicly because of a lack of protection from litigation, from fear of losing their jobs, or from fear of being victimised. Further evidence is available from published sources. I quote from a report of 26 September 1981 by John Mu1cair, a respected aviation writer with the Australian newspaper. In that report-the evidence that I have privately supports what he has written-he wrote:
Many Australian commuter airlines are flouting rules on aircraft maintenance. pilot flying hours and safe flying weights, according to a senior pilot.
The report continues:
The commuter pilot . . . wished to remain anonymous because of the possibility of being charged by the Department of Transport for breaking safety regulations.
The report goes on:
The commuter pilot has been flying commercially since 1971 and has more than 17,000 hours flying experience in commuter airlines.
One Sydney company operating highly sophisticated equipment has its pilots flying 15-18 hours a day in some instances, the pilot said.
The article concludes with the comment by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which represents more than 1,000 general aviation pilots, that:
. . . it continuously receives complaints of the type made by the commuter pilot.
That statement and its contents are in accord with the information that people within the industry provide to me on a private basis but, as I have said, they are afraid to say it publicly. I turn now to two other reports. I wish to quote from the winter 1980 issue of the Australian Air Pilot magazine, a letter which refers to the supervision of air safety by the Department of Transport. The writer states:
The point is, policing of air safety regulations by the DOT is left up to the pilot threatened, with the loss of his hard won very expensive licence and career. It is the pilot in these circumstances who has the least power to open his mouth for fear of losing his job, however dubious it may be. Unscrupulous operators have every incentive to overload or stretch the regulations for economics or greed and easily get away with it.
He continues:
The Department knows about such operations and seems unable or reluctant to bring pressure to bear, possibly due to lack of staff or funds, certainly not lack of regulations.
Mr Deputy Speaker, as a pilot yourself you would be aware of the stature of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. It is an organisation that is professional and well respected in this nation. The letter I have read from was signed, 'Charter

Pilot-Moorabbin, Name withheld for obvious reasons by request'. That letter was followed up in the next edition by a further letter from another pilot, who congratulated the writer of the first letter and went on to say that the first writer had crystallised the fundamental and serious problems that confront the general aviation pilot. He added:
The frequency with which illegal flying operations are endured within this section of the industry is widely known. However, it seems that provided a company can show on paper (despite direct evidence to the contrary) that the company operations comply with DOT requirements, the Department-for reasons known only to itself-has little concern for the realities until a serious accident happens.
Tragically, that serious accident did happen on 21 February 1980. If the terms of the board of accident inquiry were widened, all of the matters which were published in that very reputable magazine by very responsible people could be examined, along with matters reported by Mr John Mu1cair. The pressure to take short cuts in safety practices has been accentuated by the rapid cost increases that have been brought about by this Government's mismanagement of the economy. It is not generally realised that passengers travelling by air in other than airline and charter aircraft covered by this legislation do not have automatic protection in the event of an accident. This particularly applies to business and recreational flying for it is in this area of general aviation that the accident rate is rising.
In five years, 1976-80, private and business flying was involved in 52 per cent of the 1,209 general aviation accidents that occurred. Yet private and business flying hours comprised only 33 per cent of the total hours flown by general aviation. The absence of automatic third party personal injury insurance coverage can cause financial ruin for pilots and for passengers who are unfortunate enough to be involved in an air crash. Pilots and passengers who travel on a private hire aircraft should always ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage. Many non-owner pilots rely on assurances from aircraft owners that they are insured under a policy covering aircraft. However, there is a wide variety of insurance policies for aircraft and for passenger coverage. Whilst the aircraft owner might be adequately insured, not all policies cover the non-owner pilot against third party and passenger liability and few policies cover the pilot for loss or damage to the aircraft.
Having paid a claim to the aircraft owner there is nothing to stop an insurance company from invoking its legal subrogation rights against a negligent non-owner pilot or his family-nothing, that is, unless the pilot has taken care to obtain a waiver of the subrogation clause in the insurance

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

policy. Non-owner pilots need to understand that if they borrow or hire someone else's aircraft they automatically assume a legal responsibility for injury to passengers and members of the public as well as damage to third party property and damage to or loss of aircraft. From the passenger's point of view, if the pilot or aircraft owner does not carry appropriate insurance cover, then the passengers or their dependants could be faced with suing the pilot and/or the aircraft owner. If neither has assets of magnitude then the passengers themselves or the dependants of deceased passengers could suffer financial ruin. The Australian Labor Party believes that a system of compulsory third party personal insurance with limited liability attaching to the aircraft should be introduced without delay. It is for these reasons that I will later move the second reading stage amendment which has been circulated in my name.
I turn now to the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill 1982, which is a companion Bill to the Bill which I have just discussed. In line with that Bill's provision, this Bill raises the limit of compensation for personal injury from $45,000 to $100,000. The principal Act applies to Commonwealth employees, people on Commonwealth business and certain situations where the Commonwealth may be operating an aircraft and non-Commonwealth personnel are injured, such as cases where the Commonwealth has chartered a plane for Commonwealth purposes but the plane is also carrying people who are not engaged on government business.
Clause 3 of the Bill extends the definition of 'passenger' so as to widen the group of Commonwealth employees covered by the principal Act. These are people such as aircrew, airborne workers-including aerial photographers, instrument fitters and so on. The Bill also provides for removal of the bar on persons with concurrent repatriation pension rights arising from air accidents during peacetime service claiming damages under the principal Act. The proposed exclusion provisions mean that where concurrent entitlement to a repatriation pension arises during peacetime service a member of the defence forces or his dependants will also have a cause of action under the Act. Any damages awarded as a result of a claim will be taken into account to reduce the concurrent repatriation entitlements so as to avoid any double benefit occurring in respect of the one accident.
The Bill also provides for the limit of liability to be adjusted in future in a similar manner to that set out in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability)

Amendment Bill. The same arguments apply against the inadequacy of the proposed limit on compensation of $100,000 as I put earlier in respect of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill. Similarly the Opposition's 1976 amendment to raise the limit in the corresponding 1976 Bill from $45,000 to $67,000 was rejected by the Government at the time. In the Committee stage of this Bill, as with its companion Bill, I will move amendments to increase the limit of liability to $130,000 and to provide for automatic biennial adjustments of the limit of liability based on movements in the level of average weekly earnings during the preceding period.
Before moving the amendment that I foreshadowed to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill, I conclude by referring to a speech by the now Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) in this place on 6 April 1978. The Minister in that speech, referring to the absence of compulsory third party personal injury insurance, said that there was an urgent need to provide that compulsory third party liability insurance be taken out by all airline and aircraft operators and owners. He went on to refer to the inadequacy of the limit of $45,000 which operated at that time-some two years after the amending legislation raising it from $30,000 to $45,000 had passed through this place, and almost two years after it had been rejected by his Government in the Senate. I think these words best describe the situation. He said:
In this day and age it is anomalous that passengers travelling in light aircraft do not have the same protection as passengers travelling in motor vehicles. There is an urgent need for the law to provide that it be compulsory that third party personal injury liability insurance be taken out by all people who own the aircraft.
In the second reading amendment that I shall move, it is the intention that such legislation that we propose would provide for a limit of liability in respect of third party personal injury insurance and, as is the case with the motor vehicle, that the cover apply to the aircraft. In that way there is no manner by which insurance coverage could be evaded. As an addendum to that, we suggest-we would propose to do this when in governmentthat there be a requirement for the insurance coverage which I have outlined to be needed prior to registration of the aircraft and prior to each renewal of registration of the aircraft. Even if costs are involved, we believe that people travelling in light aircraft not covered by the provisions of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill or the companion legislation will be entitled to have automatic cover. They are entitled to the assurance that if someone is injured, irrespective

2422 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

of who is responsible, there will be adequate compensation available to themselves, if it is partial injury, or to their next of kin if they suffer death. For all those reasons, and supported by the words of the now Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, I move:
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
'whilst not declining to give the Billa second reading, the House is of the opinion that provision should be made for the introduction of third party personal injury insurance in respect of all aircraft operated in Australia and which are not covered by this Bill and the Principal Act'.
The Australian Labor Party believes that that is a responsible and very much needed amendment, an addition, to aviation law in this country. In that spirit, I commend it to those opposite for their support.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Is the amendment seconded?
Mr HUMPHREYS (Griffith) (8.58)-1 second the amendment. I certainly hope that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) will take note of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) on behalf of the Opposition. As he has pointed out-quite rightly so-the Opposition would have liked the legislation to go further and be far more comprehensive. It would have liked to have seen the victims of aircraft accidents taken into account.
Motion (by Mr Steele Hall) proposed:
That the honourable member be not further heard.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The question is: That the honourable member for Griffith be not further heard. Those of that opinion say 'aye': to the contrary 'no'. I think the ayes have it.
Mr Morris-The noes have it. The honourable member seconded the amendment and is entitled to speak.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Shortland is aware that the matter is not one for the Chair to resolve.
Mr Morris-I am conveying a message to the other side of the House. Are they out of control again?
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The question is resolved. The ayes have it.
Mr Morris-I think that we called for a division. We said that the noes have it.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Shortland was in dispute with other members of the House. The Chair put the question and determined that the ayes had it. There was one solitary voice calling for a division,

whereas in actual fact the Standing Orders require two voices or more for a division. The Chair therefore declared the matter resolved.

Mr Morris-With all respect, I take a point of order. I always wait, because of the more deliberate manner in which you speak, unlike some of the other Deputy Speakers. When you put the question and said that the ayes had it I said that the noes had it, I turned to my colleagues and then the matter was raised in discussion. Because of your silence at the time, I understood you were waiting for some confirmation from the other side. I ask, with respect, that it be recommitted.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The Chair, having heard the honourable member for Shortland, will put the question. The question is: That the
honourable member for Griffith be not further heard.

The House divided.

Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (9.20)-1 mentioned earlier, in my speech in the second reading debate the delays and inadequacies of the limit of liability on compensation for victims of aircraft accidents and/or their dependants, From 1976 there have been repeated calls from the Opposition and from members of the Government for the limit of compensation to be raised to a realistic level We could say that the costs of the increased limit the Opposition is proposing is minimal to the airlines and to the charter aircraft operators, It would be a far wiser expenditure of moneys if the airlines were to take out greater insurance coverage and provide a higher level of limit of compensation for the victims of aircraft accidents than to be squandering it in the front of the aircraft on free alcohol and speciality foods which are being subsidised by the people at the back of the aircraft.
It is a very strange sense of financial priorities and humanities that this Government has when it sees the provision of alcohol and free speciality foods to passengers in airline services to be of greater importance than to ensure that passengers in domestic airline services are provided with an adequate and appropriate level of compensation should they be unfortunate enough to be the victims of an aircraft accident. But this Government has always traded on the good luck of the airline industry. Good luck is all about yesterday and eventually everybody's good luck runs out. The Government and the Parliament have a responsibility to ensure that in this area of public transport, should someone be injured in the use of

2424 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

that service, there is a proper and an adequate level of compensation.
It might be said by honourable members on the other side-I have heard this argument beforethat the passengers can take out additional insurance themselves such as private insurance or whole of life insurance. That proposal can be looked at in two ways. Firstly, it is a deliberate intent on the part of the Government irresponsibly to keep down the limit of air accident compensation and so create a market for its friends in the insurance corporations. Secondly, the Government and the Parliament have a responsibility to ensure that when the passengers use public transport, as I mentioned earlier, they have an automatic cover of an appropriate limit of compensation.
The fact is the limit being provided in this legislation of $100,000 is some $30,000 less than that put by the Minister for Civil Aviation-a conservative Minister-in 1970, when for the first time an adjustment was made to the principal Act. When he adjusted that limit and spoke in the Senate, he made the point that in doubling the limit from $15,000 to $30,000 the Government was taking into account movements in average weekly earnings between 1959 and 1970.
In the amendment before the Committee, we are putting to the Government and to those on the other side who have a conscience and a sense of responsibility that we should use that same measure that the previous conservative Minister for Civil Aviation defined-movements in average weekly earnings. Using 1959 as a base, the appropriate level for compensation is $130,000. Added to that, to ensure that this problem does not arise again and to ensure that there are no future cases such as those of the dependants of the victims of the Advance Airlines crash who will receive a totally inadequate level of compensation for the loss of their loved ones and breadwinners, we are proposing also in the amendment that there be an automatic biennial adjustment of the limit of compensation. That adjustment, as it is speJt out in the amendment I have circulated in my name, would be governed by movements in average weekly earnings for the two years preceding. So every two years there would be an adjustment of the limit and that limit is directly related to movements in average weekly earnings in the preceeding two years.
The first foreshadowed amendment omits the section that was intended to replace section 31 of the principal Act, and replaces it with two new sections, 31 and 31 A. Proposed new section 31 now deals only with the limits of liability for personal injury or death. Proposed new sub-section

31 (1) provides that the limit of a carrier's liability in respect of the death or injury of a person is the applicable amount at the time of the relevant accident, which is determined in accordance with proposed new sub-section 31 (2), unless the carrier has agreed that the limit of his liability should be a greater amount, in which case the carrier is bound by his agreement and the limit of his liability is that greater amount.
Proposed new sub-section 31 (2) provides for the ascertainment of the applicable amount. The applicable amount from the date of commencement of the amending Act will be $130,000 and it will increase on 1 July 1984 and every two years thereafter in line with increases in average weekly earnings in the preceding two years. Proposed sub-section 31 (3) deals with the possibility of a decline in average weekly earnings. Where average weekly earnings decrease over a relevant twoyear period, the applicable amount will not be reduced, but it will not increase again until average weekly earnings exceed their previous maximum level.
Proposed new sub-section 31 (4) requires the Minister to gazette each new applicable amount at least a month before it becomes effective. However, this provision is intended only for the convenience of the airline operators and a failure by the Minister to comply with his obligation would not affect the automatic increase in the applicable amount.
Proposed new sub-section 31 (5) contains definitions of expressions used in the preceding provisions of the section, including a definition of 'weekly earnings amount' that refers to the estimates of average weekly earnings per employed male unit that are published by the Australian Statistician. These estimates are the figures on which increases in the applicable amount will be based. Proposed new section 31A relates to limits of liability in relation to damage to baggage. Proposed new sub-sections 31A (1) and (2) are identical with proposed sub-sections 31 (2) and (3) that are presently included in the amendment Bill.
The amendment the Opposition proposes is designed to make sure that air travellers are properly cared for in the event of the unthinkable occurring. For those reasons and for the reasons I outlined in my earlier comments, I commend the amendment to the Committee. I formally move:
, ( I) Clause 4, page 2, lines 10 to 42 and page 3, lines I to 24, ,omit sub-clause (I), substitute the following sub-clause:
I "(I) Section 31 of the Principal Act is repealed and the following sections are substituted:

Proposed new clauses 5 and 6,

Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (9.35)-by leaveThe second amendment circulated inmy name adds two new clauses at the end of the amertding Bill. The proposed new clauses 5 and 6 make amendments to the principal Act that are consequential upon the insertion of two sectionssections 31 and 31A-in substitution for one section which was the old section 31. I move:

(2) After clause 4, page 3, add the following new clauses:

Servants and agents of carrier

"5. Section 33 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in sub-section (I) 'or 31 A' after '31 '.

Regulations relating to passenger tickets and baggage checks

"6. Section 40 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in paragraph (c) 'or 31A' after '31'."

Mr HUMPHREYS (Griffith) (9.36)-As I was saying earlier before I was rudely interrupted by the Government Whip, we on this side believe

this legislation does not go far enough. If the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) would listen to me for a short time, I will point out why. On 5 January this year five men died when a light aircraft crashed in close proximity to the Brisbane Archerfield Airport. Four of the dead were neither passengers nor crew of the aircraft, This is why we say that this legislation--
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Jarman)- Order! There is too much audible conversation on the Government benches. I ask Government members to allow me to hear what the honourable member for Griffith is saying.
Mr HUMPHREYS-Mr Deputy Chairman, I do not think they :'re interested in the public of Australia or in this legislation. We are all having such a good time; it is like having a merry Christmas.
Honourable members interjecting-
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order!
Mr HUMPHREYS-Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. I know you are trying your best but unfortunately, with circumstances the way they are, nobody is interested in listening this evening. I think members have been partaking of the nectar of the gods instead of being present in this chamber. I say once again that the Opposition believes the legislation does not go far enough. If the Minister will listen to me for a while I am sure I can make it quite clear why the legislation does not go far enough.
The workmen to whom I referred earlier were employed by Thiess Brothers Pty Ltd and were working in a panel beating shop which was situated about 400 metres from the Archerfield Airport in Brisbane. The other fatality in the accident was the pilot of the aircraft. The police said that the twin-engined Cessna 411 took off just after mid-day. Apparently the plane lost power and the pilot was attempting to turn the aircraft back to the airstrip when it plunged into the annexe at the rear of the Thiess workshop. Inside the annexe four men-the youngest being 20 years of agewere engaged in an innocent game of cards, as they had often done during their lunch break. None of them would have suspected his imminent fate. The youngest man was to have become engaged the following month and another was planning to cash in his superannuation payments of 11 years and start his own panel beating business. Unfortunately their plans were tragically ended on that day.
In a situation such as this workers compensation is swiftly paid to the families of the victims. At the most the amount of compensation can be

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2427

$42,000. The amount depends on the relationship of the recipients to the victim-how dependent they were and the number and age of any children. A totally dependent widow could receive about $34,000. She would also receive from $620 to $2,500 for each child up to the age of 16 years, depending on the age of the child. With three children she could receive a maximum of $42,000. A totally dependent widow would get an immediate lump sum payment of at least one-third of the total amount-that is, around $14,000. The remainder would be paid by arrangement with the widow and usually would be managed by the Workers Compensation Board until the child reached the age of 16 years. During that time the widow would receive part of the principal plus interest every three months. That is why we say that the amount that the Government is proposing tonight is not enough. We hoped that it would be at least $130,000, as is the case in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris).
Mr DONALD CAMERON (Fadden) (9.41 )-Mr Deputy Chairman-
Motion (by Mr Tuckey) negatived:
That the question be now put.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Jarman)-I call the honourable member for Fadden.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-I simply want to support the previous speaker from the Opposition, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys)--
Mr Jacobi-I hope you will do that for me when I want to have something to say.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-If the honourable member does not mind, 1 would like to support the remarks of an honourable member from his side of the House. 1 appreciate that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) who is at the table is now listening to me. The accident referred to by the honourable member for Griffith happened in my electorate and there is a very real case for ensuring that people who are innocently killed as a result of an aircraft falling out of the sky are afforded the type of protection as elucidated by the honourable member for Griffith.
If this legislation is not such as to include a provision to cover incidents such as this, I strongly recommend to the Minister here and now that he read very carefully what the honourable member for Griffith said and listen very carefully to what 1 have to say. One day it could be the Minister's family that could be sitting in a shed having lunch when a plane falls out of the sky. They could all be wiped out as those four men were. He would

find that there is hardly any cover for those people who were absolutely no part of the accident. 1 notice that the Minister is making notes and I hope that that is an indication that he will respond to what is a very real need for attention.
Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (9.43)-We have five highly paid officers of the Department of Transport present to analyse the contributions in this debate. Other than that of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron), there has been no contribution by any member of the Government to this very serious debate. It is a matter of critical importance to travellers. Anybody may be injured in an aircraft accident, as in the case pointed out by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) and the honourable member for Fadden. 1 want to note that the Opposition deplores the failure of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and honourable members opposite to take this debate seriously. 1 suggest to the Minister that he send home those five highly paid officers-they are all on overtime-and let them have an early night's sleep rather than waste their time sitting here for a Government that is not interested in seeing that air travellers are properly cared for.
Mr HUNT (Gwydir-Minister for Transport) (9.44)-1 would like to respond briefly to the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) and to the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) who raised a very important point in regard to the accident that occurred at Archerfield. Four people were killed in a building as a result of an air crash. I have had quite a lot of correspondence with the honourable members on this particular matter. The treatment of accidents which cause death or injury to persons or property on the ground does vary from State to State and in Territories. It is not covered by this carriers' liability legislation. Some States have no fault-no limit liability legislation; others leave the matter to common law. However, 1take on board the plea that was made by the honourable member for Fadden and also by the honourable member for Griffith. No doubt this matter will be considered when this legislation is given further consideration. I might say that in general the legislation does attempt to update the situation with respect to the liability payment to those people who could be involved in an accident. The Government has moved to ensure that more regular reviews of the liability limits applying to domestic air carriers are undertaken by making provision for variation to the limits made by regulation. The proposed amendments do not include the provisions of indexation as was speJt out by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr

2428 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Civil Aviation Amendment Bill

Morris). I think he sought to get limits according to increases in the average weekly earnings. There are some inherent difficulties in tying limits to such a rigid structure. Firstly, average weekly earnings are not necessarily the best or only guideline to use. Increases in the past and those proposed in this Bill generally take account of across the board movements in the consumer price index. Average weekly earnings and movements in the international limits are not just average weekly earnings alone.
There has been a general acceptance that some sort of nexus between domestic and international limits is appropriate. If the domestic limits were tied to average weekly earnings while international limits were tied by treaty obligations, this would no longer be the case and significant distortions would be introduced. The introduction of indexation would also have implications for State and the Northern Territory governments as they have complementary legislation which adopts the terms of Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959.
Although it is not considered appropriate to index these liability limits I am of the view, and I share the view of the honourable member for Shortland, that they should be reviewed regularly, taking into account the movement in prices, wages and international limits. To this end the legislation contains provisions for the amendment of the limits by regulation in future. I think it would be far easier for governments in future to make the necessary adjustments than it has been in the past because it has necessitated special legislation and the passage of that legislation through this Parliament and the Senate, to make adjustments from time to time. The regulation provision will make it far easier to make adjustments on a fairly regular basis.
I thank those people who have made a contribution to this debate. The honourable member for Shortland certainly made some very useful contributions to the debate. I thank my friend the honourable member for Fadden for his concern and compassion about the relatives of those people who were killed near the Archerfield Aerodrome.

In Committee
Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to.
Clause 5 (Limitation of amount recoverable under this Part).
Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (9.53)-1 move:
(I) Clause 5, page 2, lines 34 to 37 and page 3, lines I to 4, omit proposed sub-section (I), substitute the following sub-section:
"( I) The maximum liability of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under this Part in respect of any one person, by reason of his death or injury resulting from an accident, is the amount that is, for the purposes of section 31 of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the applicable amount in relation to the period during which the accident took place".
Clause 5 deals with the limitation on compensation and is consequential upon the amendments that were proposed to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill which has just been dealt with. The limits provided in that Bill are inadequate. The same arguments of inadequacy and of insufficient protection for victims or dependants of victims of air crashes also apply. We heard the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) speak a few moments ago about the limit of compensation and attempt to justify the unjustifiable. In doing so he gave the plaintive explanation that this legislation does attempt to update the present limit of compensation. It could barely be called an attempt because he knows, those who sit opposite know and the industry knows that the limit proposed in the Bill before us is at least some $30,000 below what it should be.

Air Accidents Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2429

In an attempt to justify this the Minister referred to earning capacity as being an element in determining the level of compensation. I draw the House's attention to other areas of activity, such as workers compensation and third party motor vehicle insurance, where major consideration is given to the potential earning capacity of the person concerned. It is completely incorrect to claim, as the Minister claimed, that the consumer price index is the index for adjusting the limit of compensation. It is quite false to suggest, as the Minister has just done and as he did in his second reading speech, that there is some sort of nexus between international conventions covering aviation operations and/or treaty obligations. That is an utter falsehood.
I made it clear in my speech at the second reading stage of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill that any country is free to legislate to determine any limit it so desires on compensation for domestic air accident victims. So the only point made by the Minister that has credence is that about earning capacity. We want Commonwealth employees to be put on a similar basis to other employees in the community. If they are injured or lose their lives in an accident in the service of their employer, we ask that compensation be assessed on a similar basis to that in respect of other employees in the community; that is, we want earning capacity to be a major component.
I conclude by saying that the formula that we are proposing is the formula set down by an earlier but more responsible conservative government. That formula directly relates the limit of compensation to movements in average weekly earnings in the preceding period. In this case the effect of the amendment would be to provide for automatic biennial adjustments based upon movements of average weekly earnings in the previous two year periods. These amendments are consequential upon proposed amendments, that were defeated, to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill, which would provide for an automatic increase in the limit of carriers'liability in line with increases in average weekly earnings.
The amendment replaces the proposed subsection 8 (1) of the principal Act with a new subsection (1). Like the proposed subsection 8 (l) included in the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amehdment Bill 1982, proposed new subsection 8 (1) ensures that the limits of Commonwealth liability are the same as the limits of liability of carriers under the Civil Aviation (Carriers'Liability) Act 1959 but, since

regulations will not be made under that Act in relation to liability for death or injury, the references to regulations made under that Act have been replaced with references to the applicable amounts ascertained under that Act.
I have simply gone through the form because the earlier amendments on which this amendment was based have been defeated, but I believe the information should be on record in the interests of the community.
Mr HUMPHREYS (Griffith) (9.57)-1 should like to enter the debate for a short time.
Motion (by Mr Tuckey) agreed to:
That the question be now put.
Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6 and 7-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 8 (Limitation of amount recoverable under this Part). Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (9.58)-1 move:
Clause 8, page 3, lines 37 to 40 and page 4, lines I to 4, omit proposed sub-section (I), substitute the following sub-section:
...(I) The maximum liability of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under this Part in respect of anyone person, by reason of his death or injury resulting from an accident, is the amount that is, for the purposes of section 31 of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the applicable amount in relation to the period during which the accident took place.".'
The effect of the amendment is to make an identical amendment of sub-section 14 (1) of the principal Act as amended by clause 8 of the Bill. That amendment is a similar amendment to that moved to the same Bill, the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill 1978, by the now Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), and again he made the points that the Opposition made earlier this evening. That is, that the limit needs to be realistic, and there needs to be a proper and adequate level of compensation to victims of aircraft accidents. At that time the present Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) said-and this is another version-in rejecting the proposed amendment of his own colleague, as reported at page 3061 of Hansard:
The Government will consider increasing the limit under the Australian aviation legislation in accordance with any further possible increases in the level of cover provided under the international agreements. Therefore, the Government does not accept the amendment at this stage.
That statement was erroneous at the time. This legislation has no relationship whatsoever to international agreements.

2430 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Air Accidents Amendment Bill

This Government is the master of its own destiny in respect of setting limits of compensation. At that time the now Minister for Home Affairs and Environment moved that the limit be raised from $45,000 to $250,000. That was the limit that he thought appropriate in 1978. Now, four years later, the Minister for Transport has put the same argument-that we are in some way related to international agreements. It is the same utter falsehood. We refute that claim. We want to see the responsibility left with the Government for not raising the limit to a proper, responsible and adequate level. The amendment makes provision for that.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Armitage)-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection, 1will allow that course to be followed.
Mr DAWKINS (Fremantle) (10.4)-1 must say that the way in which these Bills are being processed through the House is a clear indication of the incompetence, particularly the legislative incompetence, of this Government. What these Bills intend to respond to are the protests about the Government's decisions last year in relation to the increase in fees under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. It has taken months and months for the Government to bring in legislation in respect of those complaints. The legislation was introduced on Tuesday and now, two days later, it is being rammed through this House. This is not the way in which to proceed with matters of any importance at all; and this is an important matter because if it does not raise new principles at least it confirms in legislative form new principles as far as the imposition of these kinds of fees is concerned.
There has always been some suggestion that the power under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 in relation to the imposition of these fees has been suspect. Although it has never been challenged, there has always been the suggestion that it might be successfully challenged. As 1 understand it, the fact that the Government adopted the new proposal for the year 1981-82 that fees should be imposed on a user-pays principle, increased the possibility of some challenge under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Hence we have a Bill for a new Act to impose the fees which were previously imposed and collected under the Wireless Telegraphy Act.
What is being proposed under this new legislation is that instead of the fee simply being related to covering the costs of administering this

Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2431

part of government operations-that is, that part which is involved with the allocation and policing of frequencies-we now have a new proposal which intends that the fee should be related in some way to the value of the access to the spectrum. That is, the value is dependent on which part of the spectrum one receives or how well one gets access to it. Different values attach to those aspects. This proposal intends that the Government can impose a fee which equates in some way to that value, rather than simply to the cost recovery questions which previously applied.
I remind the House again that we have had only a very brief opportunity to look at this proposal as it was introduced at 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday of this week. It is now nearly 10.10 p.m. on Thursday and we have not had the opportunity that we normally require and, indeed, are normally granted to examine carefully these sorts of proposals. Indeed it has been suggested in some quarters that this new proposal represents a position in which, rather than the Government having the power to impose a fee-that is, a fee to cover the costs of its administration in this area-we are in fact being invited to legislate for a tax which in many cases might be quite unrelated to the costs of the administration and allocation of the radiocommunications spectrum. That, of course, is a very real departure from what has been the practice since 1905, I think it was, when the Wireless Telegraphy Act was enacted. There may be arguments in favour of the public as a whole receiving some benefit commensurate with the value of a benefit which is granted by way of licence to a particular licence holder. But on the other hand, on this occasion we are being invited to give the Government a completely open cheque. As a result of this Bill before the House, we have no idea what the Government intends in relation to the level of fees which it will impose. The fees are to be imposed by way of regulations under this proposed Act. So far the Government has not come clean and demonstrated to the House at what level it intends to impose those fees. So, of course, to some extent we are reticent about the prospect of giving the Government by way of this legislation, the power to impose fees at whatever level it likes.
The major problem that the Government is responding to, if the Minister's second reading speech is anything to go by, is that in the year 19812-82 it embarked upon a program of cost recovery. The Government decided under the Wireless Telegraphy Act that it would collect by way of those fees an amount equal to the cost to it of

administering that legislation; that is, costs in relation to allocating the parts of the radiocommunications spectrum and of course in relation to policing the observance of those licences which were granted. Whereas the Government, as a result of that change and as a result of those increases, imposed an overall increase of 12 per cent, some licence holders experienced increases of amounts very much greater than 12 per cent. In some cases those increases were very substantial indeed. Of course all honourable members are conscious of the reaction which we all heard as a result of those changes. So what the Government is doing tonight is giving itself the opportunity to reduce those fees retrospectively in order to respond to the criticisms which have been made by those people who have experienced the largest of the increases which, as far as they are concerned and presumably as far as the Government is concerned, are not justified.
One cannot resist the opportunity to reflect on the alacrity with which the Government bestows a retrospective benefit in relation to these fees, because these reductions are to apply as from July 1981, and to contrast this with the Government's great resistance to impose penalties retrospectively in relation to the blatant tax dodging which is engaged in by many of the Government's friends. We take the view in relation to avoidance of taxation that there ought to be the opportunity for the Government to legislate retrospectively in respect of quite blatant taxation avoidance schemes to ensure that adequate discouragement exists to the continuation of that sort of practice. Whilst the Government has resolutely set its face against that sort of legislative option, on this occasion, as on other occasions, it has been prepared to bestow retrospectively benefits in relation to people whom it thinks have paid too much.
We will not cavil with the Government's sentiments in relation to this legislation; that is, we are not opposed to the application of this retrospective benefit because we have acknowledged that the Government's decision to apply in an across the board way this cost recovery program has resulted in severe penalties for some licence holders. We must contrast that approach with the reluctance of the Government to apply retrospectivity when it comes to the question of tax avoidance and the need to impose additional taxation retrospectively when taxpayers or would be taxpayers have engaged in blatantly dishonest and artificial schemes in order to avoid their legitimate taxation liabilities.

2432 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill

As I have said, this Bill introduces quite new principles as far as the application of fees is concerned. We are not saying that there may not be some reasonable justification for this new approach. However, we are concerned about the way in which the proposal has been brought into the House so rapidly with the opportunity for so little consideration, at least on the part of the Opposition and one might say on the part of the industry itself, because I am not sure that the industry has woken up to what the Government is really on about. As I mentioned earlier, once this legislation has been passed the Government will have been given a very wide power by way of regulation to impose fees on an entirely new basis compared with that to which the industry has been accustomed. The industry might be quite happy with the decisions which the Government makes on this occasion, but one has to be alert to the fact that the legislation empowers governments of the future, in a sense, to capitalise by way of the fees imposed the value to the licence holder of the benefit derived therefrom. That is a new principle, one which really deserves very much more consideration. This indicates yet again the sort of ad hockery to which we have become used under this Government in relation to telecommunications.
We have had a whole array of inquiries: We have had an inquiry into Telecom Australia and one into Australia Post-although simultaneously the Government has been making important decisions in relation to the operations, in particular, of Telecom concerning such matters as its request to get involved in the teletext area. I refer, for instance, to the Government's stamping on that ambition of Telecom. Of course, on the other hand we have had the Government's decision, announced only today, to go ahead with a domestic satellite system. All these new adventures which are possible as a result of the application of new telecommunications technology cannot be considered in this sort of ad hoc way. We cannot on the one hand establish an inquiry which is designed to consider the role of Telecom, in particular public involvement or-to put it in the Government's terms, the opportunities for private involvement in Telecom-and, on the other hand, make important decisions regarding Telecom's involvement in the future in crucial areas of telecommunications.
We understand that the Government has in train an inquiry-perhaps an internal inquiryin relation to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, yet at the same time we are being invited to legislate in respect of a very important area which, presumably, is being considered by that inquiry. This raises a

matter which was raised on an earlier occasion, shortly after the presentation of the last Budget, when the Government made a number of decisions about licences for broadcasting and television which had the effect of imposing very greatly increases in imposts on some television licence holders. The Government was extraordinarily prompt to respond to the criticism which came from that quarter at the time. One cannot help but note that this Government, in particular, has a very great tendency to respond quickly to the sorts of criticisms which come from its powerful and very close friends, whereas in this case it has taken very much longer to respond to equally vocal but, one might say, less powerful criticism.
There is very little else that one can say about this matter, not because one is unsure of the Opposition's position on the question but rather because one is unsure of the Government's position. The Government is now enacting legislation which will give it very wide and sweeping powers in relation to the determination and the collection of fees in relation to radio communications. We will have to wait and observe the way in which the Government determines to use that power. At the time when the Government does attempt to invoke regulations under this Act we will have an opportunity to see whether it is achieving the stated objectives of this legislation. Having said that, I indicate that the Opposition will not oppose the passage of these two Bills.

Question so resolved in the affirmative,

INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1982
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 5 May, on motion by Mr Howard:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr Leo McLeay-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order and seek your indulgence for one moment. I understood that to suspend Standing Orders under Standing Order 399, an absolute majority of the House was needed. I do not think the resolution just passed was passed with an absolute majority,
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Armitage)-I will explain the position to honourable members, The point of order is not valid, If leave had not been granted when the Minister asked for leave to suspend Standing Order 103, then an absolute majority would have been needed. As leave was granted to the Minister to move to suspend Standing Order 103 an absolute majority is not required,
Mr Leo McLeay-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. Why was it necessary to call for a division ifthis was done by leave?
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-There was a division because a division was called for. It is as simple as that,
Mr KERIN (Werriwa) (10.31)-Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No, 3), relates to a rural industry matter and is being handled by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), I guess we cannot hold him entirely to blame for this incredible mess, this incredible blunder, this absolute bloody farce this Bill represents. This Bill represents the most farcical action that this Government has initiated since I have been a member of this place.
Dr Klugman-That is saying something,
Mr KERIN-That is saying something, as the honourable member for Prospect has said. The Bill was handed to the Opposition yesterday, The rush is on. I understand that there are other amendments at the second reading stage to be moved by the Government.
Mr Howard-It is your amendment.
Mr KERIN-I understand there are other amendments from your side,
Mr Howard-No, it is your amendment.
Mr KERIN-That is amazing. The Bill was introduced yesterday at the end of the sitting. This represents the final stage of this massive farce, Last week I made inquiries at the office of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) as to

2434 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Income Tax Amendment Bill

whether this matter would have to come on for debate during this session. I was told that they did not quite know about that. Perhaps I went to the wrong office because the Treasurer is handling the Bill. I understand that he wants to diversify his interests; so I do not really hold it against him that he is responsible for the passage of this Bill.
It is absolutely nonsensical; this matter goes back to a decision of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, the razor gang. It was an incredible blunder. It was symptomatic of many of those razor gang recommendations, some of which have been implemented, many of which have not been implemented because many of them were impossible to implement. Most of them relate to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or the Government was indulging in ideological fantasies rather than realities. As far as this matter was concerned, the Government simply did not know what it was doing. Of course after a while it realised what blunder it had made but it has never said so. All we are engaged in now is an operation to save face. The matter has gone the full circle and it is now a cosmetic operation-simply to save face.
The Opposition does not oppose the legislation outright because all that will happen is that a 'statutory corporation' sign will come down and it will be replaced by a 'Ltd' sign. Instead of having the Australian Wool Testing Authority we will now have the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd. In other words, after wasting an enormous amount of the time of wool industry people, after causing concern to hundreds of employeesemployees never of the Government in fact; but of course the Government thought they wereand after causing real fears as to the international integrity of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, the Government has now changed the letterhead and not much else.
In the last 12 months or so we have gone through a whole range of permutations and actions by the Government. First of all it was going to be a foundation. Then the Minister for Primary Industry introduced a legislative device whereby we can now have this final matter resolved so that the Authority can operate from I July. What that legislation did was create a legal device whereby the Australian Wool Corporation, itself a statutory authority, sets up a body corporate which could be a statutory authority, to purchase the assets and equipment of the Australian Wool Testing Authority which was already a statutory authority and already controlled by the Australian Wool Corporation. It is absolutely nonsensical and farcical. I cannot think of any words to describe it. There are plenty of

British Broadcasting Corporation comedies which would be appropriate by analogy, but I think we should fall back to Alice in Wonderland to describe this position.
Finally to resolve this matter, to go the full circle, to do all this without costing the wool industry a lot more money, the Government has had to give the organisation tax-free status. So because the Fraser Government makes an enormous blunder we have to participate in this farce and go along with the legislation from a supposedly free enterprise Government which is going to give tax-free status to an allegedly private company. How that squares with the free enterprise philosophy or how that allows potential for competition we will never know.
Of course, the Review of Commonwealth Functions did not look at functions at all. It just simply took an accountants' approach at ways and means of cutting spending. That is what the whole thing was about. The Review never understood what the Australian Wool Testing Authority's function was, what it was doing, how it was doing it, how staff were employed or how it was organised under the aegis of the Australian Wool Corporation. It was the blind ideology of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) who headed that committee, the man with the 'guilt-edged investments', who led the Government to declare on 30 April 1981:
We propose to offer for sale the Wool Testing Laboratory and some Commonwealth equity in the Wool Stores.
There is still debate about whether the Commonwealth owns the Wool Stores it wanted to sell. But as far as the Australian Wool Testing Authority is concerned no sale has been made. All that is happening is that a new company is being formed to take over the old company as a going concern and do exactly the same thing in the same way. All that will change is that costs will rise slightly to the wool industry and all that will occur is that the Government will not have to back down and admit its initial blunder.
The Treasurer's tongue-in-cheek speech yesterday stated that members of the new company would be drawn mainly from bodies representing the various sectors of the wool industry. That is fair enough; it is exactly the same. The Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd will own itself. It is going to be a company limited by guarantee. There is no shareholding. It is owned by the wool industry itself and the members, supposedly the owners without shareholdings, become guarantors. Each is to nominate a director. There are four other directors as well. The membership of the company is seven-they are the effective

Income Tax Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2435

owners-and there is a board of 11. The owners are the Australian Council of Wool Buyers, the Federal Council of Private Treaty Wool Merchants, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia, the Wool Council of Australia, the Wool Scourers and Carbonisers Association, the Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation. What the heck is different after all? It is exactly identical to the last set-up. For a while the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation representative was going to be taken off that body but he or she is back on. Yesterday the Treasurer in his speech said:
The exemption will correspondingly apply to income derived by the company from the investment of surplus income from its testing activities or of funds that are to be used in or in connection with its testing operations.
Again, what is different? It is exactly the same. The Australian Wool Testing Authority if it earned funds just simply re-invested them in the following year. It is exactly the same. This is exactly what the Australian Wool Testing Authority used to do. So what we have is somehow a fortuitous end result for a rotten decision. Effectively nothing is different. The Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Council, the International Wool Textile Organisation, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia, the Primary Industry Association of Western Australia-every reputable primary industry organisation and wool spokesman in this country opposes this Government's crazy ill considered, anti-rural decision which was made in ignorance to indulge Prime Minister's Fraser's ideological fantasies. It is absolute nonsense and a farce. It is for those reasons that I move:
That all words after That' be ommitted with a view to substituting the following words:
'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for creating the circumstance whereby tax exemption has to be given to the Australian Wool Testing Authority, now supposedly a private organisation '.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MiIlar)-Is the amendment seconded?
Mr CUNNINGHAM (McMillan) (10.41)-1 second the amendment. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has outlined the Australian Labor Party's approach to the Bill. I take a few minutes of the time of the House tonight to raise a few points which will highlight the absurd situation which has arisen with the Government having to bring in an income tax assessment amendment Bill to give tax exemption to what now is a private company. When the Government brought down the marvellous document entitled

'Ministerial Statement-Review of Commonwealth Functions' on Thursday, 30 April 1981, there was a small piece of it, on page 30, which referred to primary industry. It said that the Australian Wool Testing Authority was to be sold to the private sector. I do not know why the Government bothered to write that it was to be sold to the private sector if it did not intend to do that at the time, but there is not much doubt that the Government was working more to the philosophy of Liberal-Country Party thinking than to common sense and that it was looking for some money from selling off public assets-a typical approach of this Government at present. One needs only to turn to Attachment A of the same document to see that it lists the assets to be sold following the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee. Listed are surplus land, property and storeholdings, Belconnen Mall, and the Mugga quarry and hotmix complex in the Australian Capital Territory. Down the list is the Wool Testing Authority. By the Government's actions and the way in which it put together this document, it is clear that it was expecting to get a return off the capital asset. But what do we have now? We have gone a full 12 months and the position is that the Federal Government's assets have not increased one bit. We have a private company that has been transferred but nothing has been sold. If one goes through the Hansard record of the questions asked of Ministers involved at the time one will see that the intention clearly was to sell off to a private buyer which would raise the capital and make the asset available to the Federal Government. A question was asked of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) on 12 May. He answered:
On all the criteria that are applied to the matter, it cannot be claimed at this point that any real detriment would occur to either the industry or the wool growers if the Wool Testing Authority became a private wool testing house.
He was comparing the situation in Australia to that in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, so there is not much doubt that it was intended to sell it to private interests. He said that on 12 May. On 14 May, in the Senate, a question was asked of Senator Chaney by Senator Tate. Senator Tate said:
Is it a fact that the Government's decision to sell the Wool Testing Authority has been overwhelmingly rejected by wool growers throughout Australia?
The answer to that question was:
I have seen some response to the proposal to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority and some of that response has been in negative terms.
There is no doubt that it was in negative terms. The only thing that we did not see in the House was members of the National Country Party

2436 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Income Tax Amendment Bill

being prepared to say anything about it. It is clear that those on the Government side of the House who supposedly represent the rural industries were very quiet when it came to having anything to say about this matter. They sat back. Twelve months later we have before the House a Bill trying to rectify what has been a drastic approach over the last 12 months. A second question that was asked reads:
What ideological reasons lie behind the Government's dismantling of this profitable public enterprise which has a world-wide reputation . . .
This is what Senator Chaney had to say at the time:
I suppose one of the benefits of the whole exercise has been to disclose the differences between the political parties which are available to the Australian people. While the Opposition is happy to go before the Australian people as a proponent of public enterprise, we are very happy to go before the Australian people as proponents of private enterprise. We make no apology for that.
That is a clear statement given by Senator Chaney. I will come back to that in a moment when I get on to dealing with the Bill that is before the House.
On 19 August 1981, an answer was gi';er:; in the Senate to a question on notice asked by Sen?~or Button on 13 May 1981. The first part of the question reads:
(I) Is the Wool Testing Authority to be sold to the private sector.
The answer once again was 'Yes'. It did not say anything about selling it to the wool industry, that is, to the private sector. The second question reads:
(2) What money is expected to be raised by this decision.
(3) Will the government receive any advice as to when to sell the Wool Testing Authority so as to achieve the best price.
The answer to that question states:
The AWTA will not necessarily be sold to the highest bidder. Consideration will properly be given to aspects such as the acceptability by the trade of certificates issued by the AWTA under new ownership and to the possible effect of the form of ownership on future testing charges. The final purchase consideration will also depend on which of the facilities presently used by the AWTA are actually purchased by private enterprise.
So it was quite clear that the Government did intend to raise some asset money from the decision of the razor gang, as it was then known.
We have to turn to the 1980-81 annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation to see what sort of money was generated by the Wool Testing Authority. We can see from the financial statements the reasons why this private enterprise approach has to be modified now by passing a Bill, that is, so that it will not have to pay any tax. I will

go through little of the report to show what financial results of the Authority were. The report states:
It is important to recognise that the Authority's access to Government funding ceased in the early 1960's.
In accordance with the Wool Industry Act 1972, the ultimate legal responsibility for funding the AWTA rests with the Corporation. However, the corporation has adopted the more pragmatic and commercially realistic policy of requiring the Authority to be accountable for its own viability and to manage its own affairs.
I would say that would be a quite sensible approach. It does not appear to me from this report that there was any need to change the structure of the Authority at all. The report states:
As a result, the Authority aims to operate as a stable, commercially self-supporting organisation by ensuring that its profitability is sufficient to meet the full costs of its activities and to also provide funds to cover its essential capital expenditure and working capital requirements.
This long term funding objective was first fully achieved in 1975-76, when the Authority repaid to the Corporation all previous capital advances. Since that time, the Authority has not drawn upon the Corporation's resources.
SO, before the razor gang even got to work on the Wool Testing Authority it was quite clear that the Authority was working effectively. There is no doubt why the Government copped such a backlash from the rural areas when it decided to sell the Authority. One can easily see why it backed off and found a way out of selling it. It did not sell it. It did not gain any asset. It decided to change the letterhead and call it a private company.
All good private companies are supposed to be able to stand on their own two feet. The big danger was if we were to have a private company it would have to pay tax. That is when the Government really ran into difficulties with its own rural supporters. Here was an organisation that had been working quite effectively, doing very, very well for itself. There was no need to interfere with it at all. All of a sudden a bright move like this was made. We can now see the reason for the urgency wit!]. which this legislation is being brought before the House.
Let me go through the revenue statement for the year ended 30 June 1981. We see that the Authority made a net profit of $1,212,000. The previous year it made a profit of $1,022,000. Of course, as the Wool Testing Authority, is now a private company, the wool growers could very quickly see that this bright move by this Government-supported at the time by the National Country Party-was going to cost the wool industry dearly in tax. How did this privateenterprise Government overcome that? It brought in this Bill to make the Authority exempt from income tax. Previously, as a statutory corporation the Authority did not have to pay tax,

Income Tax Amendment Bill

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2437

but the bright move by the Government of making the Authority a private company created a situation whereby it had to pay tax. So going from an ordinary Bill that was dealt with in the primary industry area, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) now comes in here and puts before the Parliament a Bill to amend the problems that were created by the Government.

We do not condemn the Bill, but I do support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) that is designed to allow this Bill to pass tonight. We condemn the Government for its ridiculous approach in going in a full circle over the last 12 months and then having to bring in legislation which cuts across all private enterprise philosophies to make the Authority tax exempt.

Mr BUNGEY (Canning) (10.52)-1 make it quite clear that I oppose both the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.3) 1982 and the amendment on three grounds. First, I believe tax exemption to a private company is completely undesirable. It sets a precedent which should not be set. I ask both the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to instance other private companies which have similar tax exemptions. My second reason for opposing both the Bill and the amendment is that the present wool testing arrangements are more than satisfactory and no change is required. Thirdly, additional wool testing costs will be imposed on wool growers because of the cosmetic changes proposed by this legislation. I oppose both the legislation and the amendment.

Question put:

That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Kerin's amendment) stand part of the question.

In Committee

Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Treasurer) (ll.l )-by leave-I move:

(I) Clause 2, page I, lines 8 to 10 (inclusive), omit the clause, substitute the following clauses:

Commencement
"2. (I) Subject to sub-section (2), this Act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.

"(2) Section 2A shall come into operation, or shall be deemed to have come into operation, as the case requires, im-
mediately after the commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No.2) 1982.

(2) Page I, after clause 2, insert the following new clause:

Officers to observe secrecy
"2A. Section 16 of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end of paragraph (4A) (b)", being an offence the punishment, or maximum punishment, for which is or includes imprisonment for life or for a period exceeding 6 months. ".

I should explain to the Committee that the proposed amendments arise from amendments proposed last night by the Opposition and put forward by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). In order that they might be passed during this session the Government is proposing that they be incorpated in the Income Tax Assessment Act while the Committee is dealing with the provisions relating to the Wool Testing Authority. Although the subject matter of that legislation is not totally relevant to the subject matter of the proposed amendments, they have in common the fact that they amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. Therefore, the amendments that are being put are relevant.

The purpose of the proposed new clauses is to effect changes to amendments agreed to by the House yesterday to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. They are embodied in Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.2). The further proposed amendments of the secrecy measures follow the raising of certain matters during the Committee debate on that Bill. As I indicated then would be the case, those provisions have been reviewed by the Government. In general terms, the Government will accept the proposed amendments and thanks the Opposition for putting them forward. The new clauses are designed to limit further the circumstances in which a royal commission may communicate taxation

information to the Attorney-General. Those circumstances will be limited to cases where a royal commission is of the opinion that a breach of the Commonwealth law has occurred and that that breach carries with it a penalty on conviction of more than six months in prison. This qualification to the measures is made in recognition of acceptance by the Government that only in cases of some gravity should confidential tax information be capable of being passed to the Attorney General and the police. As this tighter restriction modifies measures contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.2), the proposed new commencement provisions will mean that the change will take effect coincidentally with the taking effect of those measures. I commend the proposed new clauses to the Committee.
Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand)(11.3)-I am pleased indeed that the Government has seen fit to adopt the thrust of the amendments that were moved by me yesterday on behalf of the Opposition. I believe that what is now proposed does improve the Bill. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has indicated, the Opposition had in mind ensuring that tax information should be passed on by the royal commission in the case of a serious offence rather than just any offence against a Commonwealth Act. That would take place upon a supposition or presumption by the royal commissioner that such offence had occurred in respect of the particular taxpayer. The 'serious offence' definition that we thought was appropriate for inclusion was taken from the Government's own Criminal Investigation Bill, which is now before the Senate. That Bill states:
'Serious offence' means an offence punishable, in the case of a person who has not been previously convicted of the offence, by imprisonment for a term exceeding 6 months.
The wording of the amendments now before the Committee is somewhat more convoluted. Why it must include reference to imprisonment for life I find difficult to understand. It seems that the wording the Opposition proposed, taken as it was from the Government's own Criminal Investigation Bill, would have been quite suitable. Nevertheless, the thrust of what we were seeking has been embodied in the proposed amendments. Accordingly, we support them :.'nd thank the Government for accepting our proposal.
Amendments agreed to.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.

Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Howard)-by leaveread a third time.
CONSTRUCfION OF LIVING AND TRAINING ACCOMMODATION AT
RAAF BASE, WAGGA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act
Mr McVEIGH (Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction)(I1.6)-1 move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of living and training accommodation at RAAF Base, Wagga, N.s.W.
The proposal is for the construction of classrooms with ancilliary facilities and sleeping accommodation for 352 airmen and 40 senior non-commissioned officers at the Royal Australian Air Force base. The work will consist of the following elements: A training complex comprising 15 classrooms, student and staff amenities and office accommodation for 23 instructional and administrative staff; two-storey sleeping accommodation units for 352 airmen and 40 senior non-commissioned officers; and associated external engineering services, roads, car park areas and landscaping.
In reporting favourably the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has concluded that if the anticipated growth in trainees and staff at RAAF Wagga is to be met, more accommodation and instructional facilities reflecting present scales and standards will need to be provided. It also concluded that there is an immediate need to improve and replace existing instructural and accommodation facilities on the base. These needs have been recognised and planning provision has been made for such works in the future but the priorities of other defence works preclude their implementation immediately.
The Committee has also raised two issues on which I believe the House would wish to have an indication of the Government's views. Firstly, the Committee has observed that the proposed accommodation for SNCOs and other ranks provides suitable accommodation for female apprentices. Hence the lack of suitable accommodation can no longer be cited as a reason for discouraging their recruitment. The provision of this other ranks' accommodation will be taken into account in any consideration of recruitment of female apprentices. Secondly, the Committee observed that action is necessary to ensure that the level of

required trainee intakes is achieved. This observation arose from a new course introduced this year that did not achieve full capacity. The existing recruitment procedures are considered to be adequate to attract sufficient applicants in the future.
The estimated cost of the work is $7.6m at October 1981 prices. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning may proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.
Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (l1.9)-The Opposition does not object to this work being carried out but I think it should be pointed out that there is a serious problem in relation to defence establishment works and that problem will be exacerbated, especially in the housing area, by recent an~ nouncements of defence program deferments. Facilities programs worth $16m have been dropped and an amount of $lm will not now be spent on Defence Force housing. Later the House will deal with the construction of facilities at the Royal Australian Air Force base in Darwin. I do not wish to talk on that matter when it comes up. Damage which was caused by Cyclone Tracy in that area in 1974 still has not been the subject of permanent repair. Living conditions for persons in that area are less than satisfactory, as they are in an extensive range of defence establishments. The Government is continually deferring those works in a manner which results in living standards for Service personnel and their families which at this stage are very close to substandard. I believe that the Government has a responsibility to Service personnel who have to move constantly. I believe that this continual form of deferment is not in the best interests of the morale of the Services and certainly is not satisfactory to the families of Service personnel who of necessity must live in Service accommodation and whose interests the Government is completely neglecting.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
CONSTRUCfION OF FACILITIES FOR TACTICAL FIGHTER SQUADRON, RAAF
BASE, DARWIN Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act
Mr McVEIGH (Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction) (11.11) - I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following elements of the work known as the construction of facilities for a tactical fighter squadron, RAAF base, Darwin, Northern Territory, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: An operations domestic support building; ground support equipment shelters; refurbishment of hangars and ordnance storage buildings;

2440 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

RAAF Base, Darwin

sleeping quarters for junior officers and other ranks; 83 new married quarters and a car park, security fencing and engineering services.
The Committee has recommended that construction of the proposed engine runup facility should be delayed until problems with noise pollution have been completely resolved. The Government notes the Committee's intention to report further on this element when its siting and design have been re-assessed by the departments involved. This conclusion is acceptable to the Government. Alternative siting and designs for this facility are being actively pursued and additional advice will be provided to the Committee. The Committee has recommended that Northern Territory planning authorities should immediately examine the compatibility of further residential development in areas likely to suffer substantial aircraft noise nuisance. The Government will bring this to the attention of the Northern Territory Government for appropriate action.
The Committee also raised two issues on which I believe the House would wish to have an indication of the Government's views. Firstly, the Committee has recommended that an environmental impact statement should be prepared on Darwin Airport before additional military and civil developments proceed. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) decided in August 1981 that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was not required on the proposal to relocate civil aviation facilities at RAAF Base Darwin. In coming to his decision, the Minister took into account the careful assessment that had been made of the important environmental issues, and the comprehensive public information program conducted by the Departments of Transport and Defence, to ensure full community awareness of the principal issues involved in the relocation proposal. The Minister also sought and received assurances from the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that measures necessary to safeguard the environment in relation to civil aviation activities at RAAF Base Darwin would receive attention through the operation of the environment working group that was set up by the Joint Government Co-ordinating Committee. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of environmental examination of the proposal for RAAF Stage 2 development works, including the need for an environmental impact statement, will be made when the matter has been referred to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in accordance with the procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.

Secondly, the Committee has recommended that urgent attention be given to enhancing recreational facilities at RAAF Darwin and that such facilities, to the level prescribed by scales and standards, be completed by mid-1983 commensurate with the arrival of No. 75 Squadron at Darwin. The Government has noted this recommendation and measures will be taken to provide some additional recreational facilities within this time frame but other defence priorities will preclude the provision of major additional facilities until later. The estimated cost of the work recommended by the Committee is $9.056m at October 1981 prices. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning may proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.
Mr MORRISON (St George) (l1.14)-This apparently innocuous motion has an enormous significance which belies the form of presentation tonight. What the report deals with follows on a Government decision to withdraw the Mirage squadrons from Butterworth and relocate them in Australia. The proposition is that No. 75 Squadron will be transferred to Darwin in mid-1983. Initially, No. 75 Squadron will be equipped with Mirage aircraft but, subsequently, with FA18s. The whole background to this matter is, I think, a monumental criticism of the old forward defence policy under which we had major bases overseas which cost Australian taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. One of those was Butterworth. The others, in former times, were Terendak and of course the bases in Vietnam. At one stage it was not possible for Australia to accommodate within Australia all the Mirage squadrons.
The Opposition does not oppose, in fact we strongly support, the return to Australia of the squadrons in Butterworth. But I have very strong reservations about the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I will quickly relate them. First of all it is proposed that the base will be at the Darwin Airport. The Darwin Airport is a joint airport used by both civil aviation and the Department of Defence. One curious thing about the proposals is that it is proposed to build up the airport at Darwin which was devastated by Cyclone Tracy. Cyclone Tracy demolished the main hangers and wiped out the control and reporting unit 2CRU. Cyclones, unlike the proverbial lightning, have been known to strike twice in the same place. I simply flag that as a reservation. More particularly, I am concerned about the vulnerability of the airport which is in a coastal location. I notice that in the Committee's hearings Group Captain Robertson admitted:
. . . the further you can get away from the coast, the more secure your base will be.

RAAF Base, Darwin

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2441

My major criticism is that we are, under this report and the propositions put by the Public Works Committee, continuing to invest very substantial sums of money in an airport, a military plus civil airport, which is very close to the coast and which can be vulnerable to attack very easily by both sea and air. The other concern I have is in relation to the vulnerability of Darwin, which is only six kilometres away. This base would involve Darwin being a high level target.
The other concerns I have are concerns in relation to base secllrity. The fact that the base will be used jointly with civil aviation makes public access to that base far easier than otherwise would be the case. This would in fact degrade the security of the base. We are talking about a base which will have some of the highest cost assets in the Australian defence forces, when we think of the order of $30m each for FA 18s. All that the report says about security is that a wire fence will be erected. I do not think that provides a very daunting block to anybody, particularly saboteurs.
The other concern I have, and I am just listing them very quickly, is in relation to public safety risk. I refer to the hazard to civil aircraft and passengers through the storage of explosives and ammunition, the arming and loading of weapons and the manoeuvring of fully armed military aircraft. We are talking about a joint facility, a defence and civil aviation establishment. I believe that the public safety risks associated with that are sufficiently large to concern this House and, I am sure, the people of Darwin.
My other reservation is the constraint that this joint civil and defence aviation operation will have on the control and use of air space. The regular passenger transport and general aviation movements will certainly affect and constrain the operations of the Royal Australian Air Force in the area, certainly during the periods when the RAAF is carrying out exercises. I am also concerned, and I would like further information on this matter, that there appear to be no hardened shelters being considered for this base. In modern times and modern war, not to have hardened shelters for the storage of ammunition and certainly for the storage of petrol, oil and lubricants is an absurdity. I would certainly ask that hard storage facilities be provided and certainly that the ammunitions preparations building which has merely been refurbished be placed under hardened shelters.
I have a series of reservations but my basic reservation is that we should not be investing in this area. I understand from consultations that I had

this afternoon that there are further very substantial sums of money proposed to be invested in the air base at Darwin. I have very strong reservations about the airport at Darwin in fact being located in Darwin. I would think that there are great advantages in constructing a major base-after all, we are talking about Australia's securitysomewhat inland, perhaps at Humpty Doo. There have been recommendations for the development of the base at Tindal. But I believe to place the FA 18 RAAF attack squadrons in Darwin, in view of the reservations I have mentioned, is in fact against Australia's security. I believe this matter should be of great concern to the people of Darwin. I know it is of concern to the civil aviation branch of the Department of Transport which has a natural concern about the limitation of civil aviation operations. I know perfectly well it is of great concern to the RAAF which will be constrained in the activities it can undertake.
I believe the Government is following the wrong course in upgrading the airport at Darwin. I believe the only sensible thing for the Government to do is to take a big deep breath and say that the requirements of Australian security are such that we need a substantial base in the north and that that base should not be placed close to the coast and should not be in a major built up area such as Darwin. So I would ask the Government, through the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) who is at the table, to revise its whole approach to a development which is going to cost the Australian taxpayer a lot of money. I believe it is very important that the taxpayer's money be spent to the best effect, and that will not be done through the present proposals.
Mr BEAZLEY (Swan) (11.22)-1 want to add, very briefly, to the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison). We welcome the return of No. 75 Squadron from Butterworth which will be assisted by this motion. However, there are some things that need to be said about the development of the base at Darwin. I have the opportunity while discussing this matter to register an objection about the slowing of the pace of a similar upgrading at Derby, at least its upgrading to the status of a bare base facility, which is still before the Joint Committee on Public Works. Initially that work was going to be completed within four years of their report this year. Now it will not be completed for another six years and only $190,000 of an anticipated $47 m has been spent. This materially affects the developments at Darwin which we are discussing today. The FAl8 aircraft are being given a strike and an interceptor role. They have an effective operational range

2442 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Brisbane International Airport

when fully loaded of about 700 kilometres. This means that without a bare base at Derby they are not going to be effective in deployment from Darwin to conflicts which might emerge, for instance in the Timor Sea. When the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) spoke on the matter last year he said:

The nature of our land is such that wef(ust be able to deploy

our tactical fighter force at short notice over longer distances,

Into bare bases, and to operate there supported by extended

air resupply links.

.

Darwin should be seen not as a base in itself but as an aspect of a total string of defence bases in the north-west. It is an essential one, as are bare bases in the north-west and in the east. Darwin will be ready to take FA 18s by 1985-86 as a result of this decision among others. It will not be at the very least until 1988 before these aircraft are able to deploy to their bare base in Derby. So there will be a hiatus of two to three years which the Government's cutbacks have ensured. If the Government had not made those cutbacks the aircraft would be able to deploy from a bare base in the north-west of Western Australia at Derby at precisely the time when they came into service at Darwin air base.

1 make one final point on Darwin to add to the remarks of the honourable member for St George with which 1 agree wholeheartedly. It relates to the question of the safety of the city. We have to recollect that Darwin is going to be one of those bases like HMAS Stirling which is blessed-it depends on how one wants to look at it-with a regular deployment of American forces through it. We need to take seriously the question of circumstances in which these facilities might be denied us if an enemy of the United States of America decided to destroy them by nuclear attack. 1 was on the Defence sub-committee which looked at the problem of a nuclear attack on Australia. We did note that where there was extensive use of a facility by the United States such an attack on it at least had to be taken as a possibility in certain circumstances. The proximity of Darwin to the base in those circumstances assumes even more importance. 1 would strongly suggest to the Minister that he takes back to his colleagues the suggestions that have been made by the honourable member for St George for the relocation of the base, not only for the very excellent reasons he gave in relation to essentially conventional contingencies, but also the increasingly real and quite significant nuclear contingency which arises from the regular deployment through the area of B52 aircraft.

Question resolved in the affirmative.

REDEVELOPMENT OF BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act
Mr McVEIGH (Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction) (11.25)-1 move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Brisbane international airport, remainder of works of phase 1.
The phase 1 redevelopment of Brisbane Airport has been split into two main stages: The initial works comprising primarily flood diversion works, reclamation of the site with sand dredged from Moreton Bay, the construction of the main runway and associated taxiways and other preparatory site works. These works were examined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1979 and endorsed by Parliament C to proceed in November that year at an estimated cost of $98m at July 1979 prices. The flood diversion works have been completed and the reclamation works are currently in progress. The remainder of works of phase 1 comprising domestic

Of these latter items the Public Works Committee has already separately examined as individual works, a proposal to extend the international terminal building-$2.8m February 1981 prices-and a proposal for further dredging and site reclamation for a cross wind runway for general aviation-$16m February 1981 prices-and Parliament endorsed both these proposals in the same year. These works are also now in progress.
. The Government now desires the remaining Items of phase 1 to be examined by the Public Works Committee and this is the subject of this motion. The main elements of the works include: A common-user domestic passenger terminal complex including aircraft apron and engineering services; buildings and facilities including control tower, administrative area, fire stations, maintenance depot, electricity, water supply and sewerage; general aviation runway and apron pave-

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2443

ADELAIDE AIRPORT
Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act
Mr McVEIGH (Darling Downs-Minister for Housing and Construction) (11.28)-1 move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Adelaide airport-upgrading for international services.
The proposal comprises the following elements: A single storey terminal building including facilities for arriving and departing passengers; an apron to accommodate two Boeing 747 aircraft adjacent to the new terminal; a taxiway to connect the new apron to the existing taxiway system; widening of some runway fillets to allow regular uSe by B747 or other wide-body international jet aircraft; engineering services, access roads, carparking areas; and improvements to the airport electrical reticulation system.
In reporting to Parliament on 5 May 1982 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works made a number of conclusions and recommendations which I will now treat individually. In paragraph 1 the Committee notes that international air travellers to and from Adelaide are penalised by the existing airline arrangements, particularly the lack of an international gateway at Adelaide. The Government agrees with this. In paragraph 2 the Committee accepts that there is marginal justification for providing international airline terminal facilities in Adelaide, provided the Government is convinced that the penalties now being experienced cannot be removed in any other way. The Government accepts this conclusion and has rejected other options for removing any cost penalty now being experienced arising from the present arrangements. In paragraph 3 the Committee supports the construction of a separate international terminal building and associated apron and upgraded electrical services. The Government agrees.
In paragraph 4 the Committee is critical of the fact that a full environmental impact statement was not prepared before the decision to provide international facilities at Adelaide Airport was made. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment had agreed that an environmental impact statement for this project was not required. However, the Department of Transport is aware of the need to fulfil the Environment (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 for any continued developments at Adelaide Airport and will be producing an environmental impact statement as part of the master plan for this airport. In paragraph 5 the Committee notes that the design of

the proposed terminal building is satisfactory with the exception of the stair tower and elevated aerobridge which should not be included. The Government has noted the Committee's recommendation for the deletion of the stair tower and elevated aerobridge and will further examine the requirement for these items.
In paragraph , the Committee recommends that the proposed site for the international terminal building at Adelaide Airport is not suitable and that the international terminal building should be constructed opposite the present domestic terminal. The Government agrees that the proposed site for the international terminal building will cause slight additional noise to the residents adjacent to the airport. It is considered that this small impact does not justify the additional cost that would accrue from relocating the terminal as suggested by the Committee. Apart from the additional costs for construction and possible additional time before international operations could commence it would also involve further costs to rearrange general aviation facilities.
The Committee's alternative site will cause the deletion from the airport master plan of the parallel runway option which has been known since the airport was constructed. It is considered that although construction of this runway is not now envisaged for some time, unforeseen changes could require its development earlier, especially for general aviation. However, the main objection that the Government has to the Committee's recommendation is that it will cause the international terminal always to be remote from the domestic terminals. The Department of Transport's planning envisages that within this decade at least a part of the domestic terminal will be established adjacent to the proposed international terminal building. This will enable certain parts of the facility to serve both requirements-for example, aprons, public areas, concessions, car parks.
For these reasons the Government intends to proceed with the terminal on the original site referred to the Committee. In paragraph 7 the Committee recommends that the Public Service Board should conduct a co-ordinated review of the staffing by Commonwealth departments of the international terminal complex and that this review should include the requirements of all departments, and especially encompass the need for new positions to be created, the need for the level of overtime, the practicalities of using part time staff and the consequences of using, either on a full time or part time basis, redeployed staff. These recommendations will be referred to the Public Service Board and relevant departments for their

2444 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Adelaide Airport

consideration. The staffing of this new facility cannot be finalised until the forthcoming International Air Transport Association Northern Winter Timetable Conference is completed. This conference will consider world-wide aircraft schedules.
In paragraph 8 the Committee recommends that as a matter of urgency relevant departments should ensure that facilities at Adelaide Airport for the disposal of garbage from international aircraft are operational when international flights commence. The Government agrees and action is being taken to ensure that appropriate procedures and facilities will be provided to process international waste products before flights commence. In paragraph 10 the Committee states that with the exception of the stair tower, lift and elevated aerobridge, estimated to cost $500,000, the Committee recommends the construction of work to a maximum of $11.15m at the alternative site. The Government proposes that the construction of these works will proceed at an estimated cost of $1O.9m at January 1982 prices. If the Government's review of the need for the stair tower and elevated aerobridge supports the PWC recommendation that these items should not be included, then this cost will be reduced by $500,000.
In the body of the Committee's report a number of other matters have been raised on which I believe the House would wish to have the Government's views.
In paragraph 10 the Committee notes that it has recommended in an earlier reference that the House of Representatives refer to the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation the matter of aircraft noise and that the Committee understands that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) have that recommendation under consideration. The Minister for Transport has recently announced in the House that he is referring the matter of aircraft noise to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.
In paragraph 16 the Committee notes its earlier view that a set of national priorities for aircraft development .should be determined in place of the current ad hoc approach to airport development. Members will be aware that the interdepartmental committee is actively considering the strategic overview of major airport developments and that part of its task is to report on priority considerations. However, all States have pressed the need for direct access to international air routes to take full advantage of international business and tourist potential. The Government is in agreement

with this concept. The provision of the Hobart and Adelaide international terminal facilities gives each state this capability.
In paragraph 54 the Committee notes that at its request the Department of Transport is carrying out tests under the flight path of the main runway near the airport boundary in order to establish the level of pollution and the source of alleged water contamination. The Government notes that these tasks are being carried out and the results will be forwarded to the Public Works Committee when available.
In paragraph 60 the Committee states that some re-zoning and redevelopment of areas adjacent to the current Adelaide Airport may be necessary. In paragraph 61 the Committee notes that the South Australian Airfields Committee is currently endeavouring to identify possible sites for a new airport for Adelaide as a matter of priority and urges both the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments to react quickly to that Committee's recommendations. In paragraph 82 Senator Foreman states that construction of an international terminal on the present site should be deferred pending the issue of the provisional master plan and draft environmental impact statement, and assessment of public reaction, the completion of a final environmental impact statement and master plan and also until after the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments have taken positive steps for the construction of a new airport for Adelaide.
The Minister for Transport notified the House on 17 February that the South Australia Airfields Committee was considering an alternative airport site in the Two Wells-Virginia area. The question of compatible land use planning surrounding the existing airport is also being pursued by that Committee. As a new airport cannot be provided for at least 12 years, it is the Government's view that suitable international terminal arrangements should be provided at the existing airport.
In paragraph 83 the Committee, when considering the curfew, stated that it believes that aircraft movements should be restricted as far as possible to daylight hours. The Minister for Transport has assured me that international flights will not be permitted in curfewed hours.
In paragraph 84 the Committee states that it believes both international distance measuring equipment and a category one instrument landing system on runway 05 should be operational when regular international flights commence. The Department of Transport will expedite the provision of international distance measuring equipment and a category one instrument landing system on

runway 05. As these cannot be made available for the initial flights, other aids and procedures will be available that will enable safe operations to proceed. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning may proceed in accordance with the above decisions.
Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (11.37)-This is but the latest example of the arrogant manner in which the Executive overrules the wishes of the Parliament. Here again we see the recommendation of the Joint Standing Parliamentary Committee on Public Works being thrown out, not by the Parliament but by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Executive. The Committee's recommendation that the new terminal be constructed opposite the existing domestic terminal is, in our view, a wise one. But, as was the case with the Public Works Committee's recommendation in respect of Brisbane Airport and the $100m for the prepared monument that is the Casey University, and now this project, this Prime Minister and this Government have made the Committee system a travesty, a farce. Under this Government all that the committees have become is some sort of activity to keep Government members busy.
I do not want to delay the House because I will try to ensure that I leave sufficient time for my colleagues from South Australia to speak on the matter. So, the brevity of my remarks is not a measure of my concern at the Government's action.
In paragraph 81 of the report, the Committee's conclusion in relation to the Government's site choice for the international terminal is that it is not suitable. It states that the international terminal building should be constructed opposite the present domestic terminal. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and the Government have chosen by this motion this evening to ignore the Committee's conclusion and recommendation after due consideration of all available public information. The Prime Minister condones this cavalier treatment of the parliamentary committees. In a letter to the Minister for Housing and Construction on 18 December 1981 he told the Minister, who is at the table, that any delay in the interim works in relation to the domestic terminal at Adelaide Airport was unacceptable.
So, irrespective of what committees, the Parliament or anybody else thought or determined, in his view it was unacceptable. The delay was caused because the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works had not brought down its report on the domestic terminal interim works.

The Prime Minister in effect was ordering his Minister to ignore the Public Works Committee because the domestic terminal interim works would not be completed in time for the introduction of wide-bodied jets around June 1982 for Trans Australia Airlines and November 1982 for Ansett Airlines of Australia. Was the Public Works Committee to blame or was there some poor planning in relation to time factors by the Department of Transport? The lamentable lack of a national airport planning program in this country is the real problem. We have had 30 years of conservative government since the last war and in those 30 years those governments still have not been able to develop a national airport program. Tonight we are told the Government will look at developing one but it will make all the decisions first and talk about the plan later. That is the problem-not the Public Works COIPmittee and its proper consideration of its responsibilities. The Committee has become the whipping boy for the Prime Minister. Why did he interfere in a matter that would normally come within the responsibilities of the Minister for Housing and Construction and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt)? Did the Prime Minister receive representations from his captors, the Abeles-Murdoch axis, or was it just that he wanted to offer a carrot for the South Australian election later this year?
What if there is a delay in the introduction of international air services to Adelaide? We should provide the best available site for such services. South Australians should not have to accept a quick second best, a quick fix, nor should the residents around the airport have to put up with the level of intrusion which this Government describes as a slight increase in noise. It may be inconvenient at the moment to handle international air flights at Adelaide Airport but the existing international air services can be handled. The airlines have told me that the decision of the Government in respect of Adelaide Airport was not a commercial decision; it was a political decision. They are the people who have to use the airport and pay for it, and who will incur the losses that will flow if it is not utilised at a sufficient rate to cover its costs. Yet we have a Prime Minister and another compliant National Country Party Minister, who is now at the table, another dodo who does what he is told without thought--
Mr Porter-Why do you hate South Australia?
Mr MORRIS-The honourable member should go back to sleep; he makes more sense that way. The Minister is abrograting any recommendations of the report of the Public Works Committee on domestic interim works and proposed

2446 REPRESENTATIVES 6 May 1982

Adelaide Airport

works for an international terminal. We in this Parliament and especially the members of the standing committees should be asking ourselves: What is the point of standing cOJ;nmittees? They do not count any more under this Government. We do not want rule by Executive and honourable members on that side of the House were not elected to condone rule by the Executive. That is what is happening here. As I have said, it is the third occasion in a few months that this has happened.
I finish on these two points. The Minister for Housing and Construction has used the description 'slight additional noise'. He should go to Adelaide and tell that to the people who will live 350 metres from this terminal and from the auxiliary power units. The recommendation of the Committee is that the distance from the domestic terminal be 650 metres. There is a considerable difference in the level of noise intrusion. The Government's main objection is the remoteness of the international terminal from the domestic terminal. I wonder whether members of the Government have ever visited Sydney and had a look at where the international and domestic terminals are, how long they have been there and how long they are likely to be there. If that is not a problem then I suggest that they convince the Parliament in some other way that the location of the terminal at the site recommended by the Committee is a problem.
The other point is that the Government intends to expand Adelaide Airport if it gets the chance. That is really the effect of the second runway. But the Committee points out in paragraph 75 of the report that the existing capacity of the airport using known forecasts of traffic is sufficient for the next 28 years. So this decision is not a decision based on common sense or on wise use of public moneys; it is a political decision, a desperate effort to wave a carrot in front of the electors of South Australia to try to save the doomed Tonkin Government. Because the Opposition supports the Committee's recommendation on the site of the terminal, I formally move:
That the following words be added to the motion:
"provided that the international terminal is located at the site recommended by the Public Works Committee".
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Is the amendment seconded?
Mr SCOTT (Hindmarsh) (11.46)-1 second the amendment. The saga of the proposed international airport for Adelaide, and of the widebodied jets project has been a lengthy one. As I have done continually, I wish to make my position

quite clear. Constantly I have opposed the extension of Adelaide Airport, for both the widebodied jets and the international terminal. I believe that the State and Federal governments have an obligation to declare where the new international airport will be located and when it will commence to operate. Contrary to what the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), who is at the table, has said, at the recent hearing of the Joint Committee on Public Works it was stated that the airfields committee was within four weeks of making a decision on the matter and declaring a new site. That four-week period has elapsed but we still have not been advised of the new site.
As I said when this report was brought in, the Public Works Committee and its Chairman gave the residents of Adelaide a good hearing. I went on to say that I hoped the views of the residents would be reflected in the report and recommendations that would come from the Committee. Apart from the proposal that the matter should be delayed until the new site is declared, I take my hat off to the Committee, which I believe responded to the fears and concerns of residents.
The situation that now confronts us is one about which we should be very concerned. The Public Works Committee has done its job but the Executive has, by its rejection of the proposition concerning the location of the international terminal, has made a complete mockery of the parliamentary system. How can anyone any longer have faith in the reports of the Public Works Committee? It is made up of very hard working members from both sides of both the Houses of the Parliament. I have seen them in operation and I take my hat off to them-certainly in regard to the hearing in Adelaide on the proposed international airport. I do so although previously I have made critical comments about the Committee. The Government's rejection of this critical part of the Committee's report represents a denial of the democratic process. All of the worries and fears of the residents, of representative associations, of State and Federal members of parliament-in some cases from both of the major parties-are being realised. At the public hearing in Adelaide, one group after another expressed the fear that the Government had already made up its mind concerning the international terminal; that the Committee's hearings were a waste of time. I repeat, the Government's decision has made a mockery of the Committee and its reports. If the residents who live around the Adelaide Airport resolve to take direct action, as I believe they should in an attempt to turn around this Cabinet

Adelaide Airport

6 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2447

decision, which flies in the face of the Committee's recommendations, I will consider it a privilege to join them in such actions as may be necessary.
The Committee conducted hearings in Adelaide over the three days, 31 March, 1 April and 2 April. It heard 42 witnesses and received written submissions from a number of others. Volumes of evidence were taken. The Public Works Committee listened to these witnesses over a period of three days. The Committee closely examined all of the witnesses and their submissions. The arguments for and against the upgrading of the airport to an international standard were fully canvassed. The Chairman, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), even arranged to take a tour around some residents' homes during a lunch break of the Committee. I spoke to the residents afterwards. They were impressed that the Chairman was genuine and sincere in listening to their complaints.
It is very important to establish that the Public Works Committee has made a very well considered report. It made a report after examining 42 witnesses, receiving volumes of submissions, holding a three-day hearing and conducting onsite inspections. If we compare that with the decision brought down tonight by the Cabinet we will see that it is ill-informed, prejudged, political and totally selfish. If we compare the two decisions-that of the Committee which visited the location and talked to the witnesses, and that brought down by the Cabinet, which overruled the Committee's recommendation-one can see that the decision can only be described as ill informed, prejudged, political and totally selfish.
If the residents are determined to take action on this question I will be privileged to join with them. The decision of the Cabinet, is about to be forced on the Government and on Government members, including Liberal Party members and senators who are members of the Public Works Committee. I hope that some of them will seriously consider the proposition that we are moving in the form of an amendment. As I have said, Cabinet prejudged the matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had made up his mind, just as his mind was made up in relation to a previous Public Works Committee matter. Mr Heini Becker, a Liberal State member for Hanson, whose electorate adjoins the airport, appeared before the Committee. In making representations at the Public Works Committee hearing into the international terminal for Adelaide, he stated:
A long past experience has persuaded me that these public hearings are little more than a public relations exercise.

He was reluctant to appear before the Committee and went on to say that he believed he could not let the opportunity pass without making representations on behalf of the people in the area. He went on to provide his reasons for being sceptical about the public hearing. He referred to a communication from the Prime Minister to the Minister for Housing and Construction regarding Adelaide Airport. The Prime Minister had complained that the Public Works Committee was proceeding far too slowly. In the letter the Prime Minister stated:
The delay in the interim works is unacceptable.
I ask: Unacceptable to whom? The Prime Minister told the Department of Housing and Construction to seek to prepare documentation for the calling of tenders in anticipation of parliamentary endorsement. Never mind about the recommendation of the Committee. Here was the Prime Minister saying that things were moving too slowly and that he wanted the Department to go ahead, get the documentation ready and call the tenders. He was saying that he was quite sure that Parliament would endorse it anyhow. He said that the delays were unacceptable and that the work should go ahead and tenders should be called. The Public Works Committee was still taking evidence at that time and still had another public hearing to go dealing with that project. Witnesses still had to appear before the Committee. The Prime Minister was making a farce of the parliamentary system.
Let us look at what he said in that communication to the Minister for Housing and Construction. The letter states:
My dear Minister,
Our colleague the Minister for Transport has written to me (copy attached) concerning interim works to enable the introduction of domestic wide body jet services at Adelaide Airport.
The Minister has advised that because the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has not completed its consideration of the Adelaide proposal, the p,t)posed works will not be available to meet TAA's scheduled wide body jet introduction date for Adelaide of I June 1982 and are unlikely to meet Ansett's date of 1 November 1982.
The delay in the interim works is unacceptable. Every possible effort should be made to have the facilities operational as close as possible to the airlines' scheduled introduction dates. Your Department should seek the Parliamentary Standing Committee's approval to complete documentation of the project, including the calling of tenders, in anticipation of Parliamentary endorsement.
I am writing to the Minister for Transport advising him of this course of action.
The Chairman of the Public Works Committee must feel extremely hostile. Two Ministers and a Prime Minister were giving him the hurry up. How could the Chairman do his job properly

2448 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Adelaide Airport

when that kind of pressure was being applied to him? Democracy is thrown out the window and the parliamentary system is no longer to work because the Prime Minister says so.
Mr Kent-He is a bully.
Mr SCOTT-He is a bully and a thug and that is well known. He is called other names, including a liar.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member offends. He will withdraw that remark.
Mr SCOTT-Mr Deputy Speaker, I could give you the reference in Hansard.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member will withdraw.
Mr SCOTTI made the reference to Hansard that described the Prime Minister as a liar. I say that he is a thug, a bully, and a stand-over merchant.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member compounds his offence. He will withdraw.
Mr McVeigh-Mr Deputy Speaker--
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The Minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Hindmarsh will withdraw without qualification.
Mr SCOTTI withdraw.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I warn the honourable member for Hindmarsh.
MrSCOTT-I said that I withdraw.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is essential that the honourable member address the Chair in such manner that the Chair is aware of what the honourable member is doing. The honourable member may proceed.
Mr SCOTT-He is a bully, a thug and a standover merchant.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I think the honourable member should be a little more selective with his language. I find it difficult to accept that describing an honourable member as a thug comes within parliamentary parameters. I will allow the honourable member's earlier withdrawal to prevail. I exhort him now to proceed with parliamentary language.
Mr SCOTT-I will try to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to refer quickly to some matters in the report to which I have given qualified support-in particular, the statement in the report dealing with the master plan and the environmental impact statement. The Committee reported that the Minister for Transport (Mr

Hunt) and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) had recently announced that a draft environmental impact statement and a provisional master plan would be released for public comment in July 1982. I draw attention to the fact that I asked a question on notice on 24 March-it is still on notice; the Minister still has not replied to it-which reads:
Will he agree to an environmental impact statement in relation to extensions and development of Adelaide Airport; if not, why not.
A statement is presented which reveals that the two Ministers, acting in cahoots, have agreed to the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Yet, I have not even had the courtesy of a reply to my question which has been on notice for some time now. This statement is to be presented by July. That will be after the horse has bolted. That is a typical action by this Government.
Reference has been made to the site being unsuitable. I commend the report by the Public Works Committee. I know the site. I lived there. The site has been moved from the present proposal where it is bordered on at least two sides by residential development to another area where there is one beach road and one other road with houses some considerable distance--
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Friday, 7 May 1982
Mr CHAPMAN (Kingston) (12.1 a.m.)-I welcome the decision by the Federal Government to proceed immediately with the construction of the international passenger terminal at Adelaide Airport, at the site originally proposed. I know that this decision will be especially welcome to the large number of British migrants who live in the southern part of the Kingston electorate and who have, over the last six and a half years that I have represented it, strongly urged that provision be made for international flights out of Adelaide Airport.
Mr Porter-And the people at Elizabeth also.
Mr CHAPMAN-I am sure that the people living at Elizabeth on the northern side of the city equally will be pleased with this decision. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) have indicated by their reaction to this decision that they hate South Australia. The reason for that attitude is the progress that has been made in that State--
Mr Morris-I take a point of order. That is infantile of the honourable member. It is a lie. I ask

Adelaide Airport

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2449

that the honourable member withdraw the statement.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order!
Mr Morris-It is a straight out lie.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Shortland compounds the offence. The term that he uses is unparliamentary. I will deal with the original comment after the honourable member for Shortland has withdrawn his unparliamentary expression.
Mr Morris-I withdraw.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Kingston conducts himself in less than a parliamentary fashion by making a broad and, if the Chair may be excused for saying so, a somewhat inane comment. I call the honourable member for Kingston to continue--
Mr Morris-Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that he withdraw.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The offence does not demand withdrawal.
Mr CHAPMAN-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Both Opposition speakers tonight have accused the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of being arrogant, of behaving like thugs and of making a mockery of the processes of the investigation by the Public Works Committee. They asserted that Cabinet had overruled the recommendations of the Public Works Committee. Cabinet or the Prime Minister has not done so in any dictatorial fashion at all. A minor part of the recommendations from this inquiry has been overruled. The Government has acted, I believe, with the full support of a large majority of the people of South Australia. If this project was not proceeded with as from today, the growth prospects which it offers to South Australia would be sabotaged. The decision was not, as the honourable member for Shortland claimed, a political rather than a commercial one.
Mr Morris-Ask the airlines.
Mr CHAPMAN-I suggest to the honourable member for Shortland that he sould read the submissions that were made to the Public Works Committee by the representatives of the various commercial sectors in Adelaide. Those submissions were strongly in support of this proposal. He also raised the matter of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I suggest that the analogy is in no way applicable to the situation at Adelaide Airport. I note that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is encouraging people to engage in direct action. I am not quite sure what he means by that. If he means some sort of sit down strike or

demonstration, I guess that that is the kind of encouragement to mob rule that we can expect from the Australian Labor Party.
The honourable member for Hindmarsh also referred to statements by the Prime Minister that any delay in commencing work on this project was unacceptable. The honourable member for Hindmar~h asked: 'Unacceptable to whom?' The delays that would occur in this project would be quite unacceptable, as I have already indicated, to the people of South Australia.
The pr0ject will bring a significant number of advantages to South Australia. In terms of economic growth, it will provide a major boost for South Australian business. It will also give South Australia the full status required to trade efficiently on an international scale. In South Australia, international travel requirements for small and medium business executives are increasing. I will give just one example. I refer to the firm of Sola Optical Australia Pty Ltd, a renowned manufacturer of optical lenses. It is located at Lonsdale in my electorate. It is a firm which has developed an impressive export performance. In recent times, that firm has averaged about 75 overseas trips a year by various members of its executive. Currently each trip by an executive of that firm costs $500 extra by having to use interstate connections to link with international carriers. That cost will now be obviated by proceeding with this project. The project also will fulfil the need for efficient intrastate transfers within South Australia to resource projects such as the Moomba oil and gas fields or fishing fields such as those adjacent to Port Lincoln.
The need for international freight facilities out of Adelaide is an important aspect of this proposal and will add to its value as far as businesses are concerned. The Public Works Committee discounted freight as a factor causing the need for an international terminal in Adelaide. I suspect this discounting of the importance of freight has contributed to the conclusion of the Public Works Committee that the justification for the terminal was marginal. I reject this discounting of the importance of freight. I cite again the example of Sola which is currently spending about $750,000 per year in air freight to ship about 50 per cent of its export products.
Mr Porter-And that is only one company.
Mr CHAPMAN-That is only one company, as the honourable member for Barker advises. Ten per cent of that $750,000 represents the cost of the movement of the company's freight interstate before it can be transhipped for transport overseas. This, of course, has a severely detrimental

2450 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Adelaide Airport

impact on the competitiveness of that firm and therefore on its capacity for market growth overseas. There are many other examples that I could give which back up the example of Sola.
Another important aspect of this proposal is its benefit to tourism. In 1979-80 South Australia attracted 103,000 overseas visitors. This represented 13.2 per cent of total visitors to Australia. It is a remarkable performance considering that South Australia has less than 10 per cent of the total Australian population. So South Australia is attracting more overseas visitors than its relative proportion of the Australian population. In the six years between 1973-74 and 1979-80 the number of overseas visitors to South Australia increased by 56 per cent. That is twice the increase over the the same period in New South Wales, which was 28 per cent.
Mr McVeigh-it will be a lot better with these new facilities.
Mr CHAPMAN-As the Minister interjects, of course with the provision of these facilities that increase will develop even further. Ayers Rock and the Australian outback are two of the six primary interests expressed by visitors coming to Australia. Adelaide is the city best placed as a jumping off point for these two attractions. Therefore, that is an additional significant reason for the importance of this project. Tourism is currently worth $300m per year to the South Australian economy and with the increased number of visitors who will be attracted as a result of this facility that amount will escalate over the next five years. It is envisaged that over the next five years this project will provide another 2,500 jobs in South Australia to supplement those jobs that have been created by the Tonkin Government over the last couple of years.
The absence of international flights currently into Adelaide is costing South Australians $llm per year in making connections interstate to travel overseas. Under the policies of the Tonkin Government South Australia is poised on the threshold of an economic upsurge based on energy and minerals. All of these factors-business travel, freight, tourism and economic development-more than justify an international terminal being established at Adelaide. I believe that justification is well above a marginal justification which the Public Works Committee indicated was its conclusion.
The Federal Government is also to be commended for rejecting the Public Works Committee's recommendation to change the location of the terminal. It is essential that the terminal be

ready for use by October to take advantage of international flights already scheduled for then. Changing the terminal's location would prevent these flights beginning probably at least until April 1983, a delay which cannot be accepted. Combined with the extra cost involved and the conflict with the long term master plan for the airport, this more than offsets the very slight noise reduction which would be offered by the alternative site. I am disappointed that the Government has accepted-at least to the extent of agreeing to review it-the Public Works Committee's recommendation that the aerobridge be deleted from the proposed facility.
The aerobridge is an accepted part of international airport facilities. I believe that it should remain part of the project. Therefore, I strongly urge the Government to proceed with the construction of the aerobridge as part of the total terminal project.
Mr Scott-You haven't even read the report.
Mr CHAPMAN-I have read the report in considerable detail.
Mr Scott-If you had, you would know the answer.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! I ask honourable members on my left to remain silent.
Mr CHAPMAN-The main objections to the international terminal are based on the noise impact on residents near to the airport and near to the flight path. But as the report admits, the Boeing 747 aircraft is no more noisy than the smaller DC9 domestic aircraft and, indeed, they are quieter than the Boeing 727 domestic aircraft. Furthermore, the nearest houses are 350 metres from the proposed terminal. A bund and a blast deflection barrier are being constructed as part of the project near to these houses to minimise the noise nuisance.
It should be remembered that the location of the present Adelaide Airport at West Beach preceded the construction of most of those houses. Of those houses which were built prior to the construction of the airport at its present location, a high proportion of the present residents would have moved to the area since the airport was constructed. One benefit that they have obtained is that housing is cheaper as a consequence of its proximity to the airport. I sympathise with the plight of those who live near the airport and those who live under its flight path. But we must accept the airport as a fact of life and the overall advantages that its location gives both to

Adelaide Airport

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2451

South Australia as a whole and particularly to Adelaide.
I believe that the present Adelaide Airport is the best long term location for both domestic and international flights. It is within about 10 minutes driving time of the city and 20 minutes driving time of all but the distant suburbs of Adelaide. This adds to the value to be derived from it now having an international terminal. I believe that its remaining in its present location is far preferable to proposals for a new airport in the Two WellsVirginia area. That proposal has the disadvantage of a very high cost, long travel time and, of course, the inevitable loss of life through increased traffic accidents on that long travel route to the airport. It would also be a considerable disadvantage to the residents of the outer southern suburbs within the electorate of Kingston. As I mentioned earlier, a large proportion of them are British migrants who, I believe, would be heavy users of this international facility. I therefore urge the South Australian Airfields Committee to recognise the advantages of the existing location and not to recommend a new location. I believe the advantages of the present location will become more and more evident as the years go by.
But, in co-operation, the Commonwealth and State governments should consider the future of those houses that are under the flight path and near to the airport and should, over a period, provide the opportunity for those areas to become industrial. The houses should be bought out by industrial complexes so that factories and other business activities can be located there. Over a period, we could overcome the marginal disadvantage of the noise factor for people living in that area by converting it to industrial use. There would also be the considerable advantage of having those industrial areas located very close to an international airport for freight purposes.
In conclusion, I congratulate the Federal Government on its initiative in providing an international terminal for Adelaide at a cost of about $lOm. I believe that provision of this facility is a tribute to the farsightedness and persistence of the Tonkin Liberal Government in South Australia in meeting the needs of the people in my home State.
Mr Porter-The Texas of the south.
Mr CHAPMAN-It will become the Texas of the south. This is in marked contrast to the situation in South Australia under the previous State Labor Government. As a result of this farsightedness and persistence, South Australia is set to reap substantial tangible and intangible benefits from this facility as from October of this year.

Mr MORRIS (Shortland)-Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilIar)-Does the honourable member for Shortland claim to have been misrepresented?
Mr MORRIS-Yes. The honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) made the comment at the beginning of his remarks that the honourble member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) and I hated South Australia. He knows that to be false. We have the same regrard for South Australia as all honourable members have. We do detest the inanity and the humbug that come from the honourable member.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member has gone far enough.
Mr LES McMAHON (Sydney) (12.16 a.m.)-As Deputy Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I would like to make a few remarks. As the House is aware, the Committee comprises three senators and six members of the House of Representatives. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), who is present in the House, is Chairman of the Committee. I think he would have some sympathy for what I am about to say because apart from the minority report there was almost a unanimous decision not to spend $llm. Instead the recommendation was that we should put the money into an international airport at a later date. But after discussing this matter in South Australia for three days and within the Committee we came down with a recommendation to spend the $11 m to improve the Adelaide Airport so that everyone would like to go to South Australia.
I am disappointed that the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) said that the employees, the employers and the people who worry about unemployment-we on this side worry about this too-want the airport completed by October. I am a bit worried about this matter too. We all know that there will be a State election in South Australia in October or November of this year.
Mr Morris-But it will not save him.
Mr LES McMAHON-That is right. The point is that we were after a consensus so that we would be looking after the people. The injustice of the situation is that if our proposal that the new terminal be located in another positions were agreed to, this would cost the Government a maximum of three quarters of a million dollarshalf a million dollars to three quarters of a million dollars. The Government proposes to spend

2452 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Adelaide Airport

$llm, but what about the people in South Australia? What about the three days we spent in South Australia from 8.30 in the morning to 7.30 or 8 o'clock at night listening to the little people, members of parliament and business peoplepeople who live under the flight path. I am copping this sort of thing in Sydney too. People are phoning me at approximately one o'clock in the moring saying: 'Did you hear it come past?'
Mr Porter-Did you?
Mr LES McMAHONYes, when they woke me up. But I live in Glebe. These people live in MarrickviIle, Redfern and Lilyfield. It depends on the flight path. Tonight we are discussing the recommendation on this project. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), who is in the chamber, is a very capable person. The decision he has announced to the House this evening is not his decision. It is a Cabinet decision. I repeat that there is to be a State election probably in October or November.
Mr Morris-It will not save him. Kevin Cairns lost his seat.
Mr LES McMAHON-That is right. The Government is trying to save certain people. Does the Government understand what it is doing by taking this decision? The members of the Committee travel all over Australia. We also have to look after our electorates. We are away from our electorates so many days in every month in order to do our committee work. We are getting respect from the rank and file, the little people, the people who believe in us. Does the Government know what it is doing? It is killing what we all believe in. The people were starting to believe that we were fair dinkum. But the Government has done it again. It is getting to the stage where we believe what the Government is telling us. It is in the transcript. It is coming down the line. The Government wants to save half a million dollars by building this year not next year. The people are worried about safety, and rightly so. They are worried about pollution, and rightly so. They are worried about noise, and rightly so. How can we go back to these people and ask them to believe in us? How can we say to them that we are members of Parliament and that we are not playing politics? As I said, there are three senators and six members of the House of Representatives on the committee. We are all starting to play politics and over what? It is half a million dollars. Over three days almost 50 witnesses said: 'Do not build it now. Discuss it and build it in another place'. We said: 'In fairness to the business community, in fairness to the people in the area and in fairness to you, we will listen to you. But we disagree with

what you are telling us. We will build an international airport'. In other words-

In divisionMr Scholes-Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Ringing the bells for one minute applies only when no business intervenes between divisions. In this case there was an attempt to move a motion to suspend Standing Orders and the time involved between the divisions was in excess of one minute. Therefore, an honourable member could have been sufficiently far away from the chamber not to have been able to return. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I accept what the honourable member for Corio says, but the honourable member for Shortland was out of order-the fault was mine-and the decision was made to ring the bells for one minute. Question resolved in the negative. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Mr MORRIS (Shortland) (12.35 a.m.)-I move:

That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Canning making a statement forthwith relating to international flight facilities at the Adelaide Airport.

The reason for the motion is that this Government--

Motion (by Mr Sinclair) agreed to:

That the honourable member be not further heard.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Giles)-Is the motion of the honourable member for Shortland seconded?

Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (12.37 a.m.)-Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a disgrace when the chairman of a committee whose report is rejected is not allowed to address the Parliament. It is an absolute disgrace. It is the sign of a government which is in disarray. The Government is incapable of mana~ing its own affairs.

For the remaining stages, until 1,30 a.m, this day,

PUBLIC SERVICE ACTS AMENDMENT BILL 1981
Second Reading
Debate resumed.
Mrs KELLY (Canberra) (1.2 a.m.)-This is the first time in seven years of this Fraser Administration that it has begun to look seriously at the issue of reform in the Public Service. Yet the Government is seeking to rush this Bill through the House at this very late hour on the last sitting day. This Bill looks at two aspects of reform of the Public Service. One is the merit principle of selection and recruitment and the other is the abolition of divisional structures within the Public Service. I am sure all honourable members in this House will agree that both those aspects will benefit the efficient administration of the Public Service. Yet this Government does not want to discuss them in detail at all. These proposals came about as a result of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration report in 1976-I repeat, in 1976. Yet seven years later this legislation is being rushed through this House with only half an hour being given for the entire debate on it, even though it has been under discussion for seven years. This is absolutely appalling and it shows what the Government thinks of the Public Service of this country. There is talk about morale being low in the Public Service. Is there any reason why morale is low? Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) suddenly discovered that morale is low; so he decided to set up a little subcommittee under the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) to ascertain why morale is low. The honourable member for Mackellar can start his report to the Prime Minister by describing the sort of procedure that we have witnessed in this House tonight.
The two aspects of this legislation which the Opposition does support, as I have said, are the proposals for the abolition of the divisional strl,lcture and the merit selection principle. But the most disturbing aspect of the abolition of the divisional structure is that we have not really had any explanation from the Minister as to what he is putting in its place. In the Coombs Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, a recommendation was made that we substitute the divisional structure for a concentration on occupational categories. I would like to hear from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner)-if he bothers to take the time to reply-exactly how this will work in practice because I know that many people in the Public

2456 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

Service will be interested to hear what their Minister has to say about this. It does surprise me that after seven years' discussion we have not yet heard from the Minister exactly how that recommendation is to be put into practice.
When we look at the legislative record of this Government we find that it has dealt with several pieces of legislation in relation to the Public Service, but almost all of them have concentrated on the organisation of the Public Service or on industrial relations matters. This is the very first time that the Government has looked at reform, and look what has happened tonight. What is needed in this country is a much more constructive attitude to the Public Service, not just from this side of the House but from every member of the House, because whatever Government is in power it needs to have the support and the enthusiasm of the Public Service. The Government needs to look constructively at how the Public Service is run. That has not been done over the last seven years. What we have seen is a constant stress on the reduction of numbers. There is never discussion about how we will make the Public Service run more efficiently. The Government always talks about cutting the numbers, not about how to cut functions. No, instead of that we find that on the one hand we have the rhetoric about cutting numbers and on the other hand we find that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) puts greater stress and strain on the Public Service than any Prime Minister in the history of this country.
Why do honourable members think that Public Service morale is low? Then, of course, one can ask: Does the Government use the resources it has very efficiently when it is talking about cutting numbers? Where does it cut them? It does not cut them in the First Division. It has not cut them in the Second Division or the Third Division. They no longer exist any more. The numbers have been cut from the Fourth Division. Is it good management to have a situation where people work below their capacities, and where people who are, say, class nine-that does not exist any more-in the Public Service do the filing and photocopying? No wonder morale is low, when people are not being used to their full capacity because there is no proper balance or organisation within the Public Service.
The Government's approach to industrial relations has been confrontationist. It has used its treatment of the Public Service as an example to the private sector of how to deal with employees. The Government has wanted a redistribution of power from unions to employees and has used changes in the law to bring this about. This is the

whole philosophy behind the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act and also the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. It is also the philosophy behind the third aspect of the legislation that we are discussing tonight-the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill-which deals with promotional appeals.
The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has already explained the Opposition's view in considerable detail and I am sure he will follo.w it through when I have finished speaking. I will not follow my debate through any further except to say that I would like the opportunity to speak to several clauses later on. I conclude by saying how appalling this is, but I am not surprised that this Government does not take the time to look seriously at reform. I was hoping that tonight, for the first time in the history of the Fraser Administration, this Parliament would be able to have a constructive debate about reform in the Public Service. Unfortunately I have been disappointed about that and the 150,000 Commonwealth employees will, I am sure, also be disappointed.
Mr VINER (Stirling-Minister for Industrial Relations) (1.9 a.m.)-in reply-I wish to make some short comments in response to remarks made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), in which he suggested a lack of consultation by the Public Service Board and by the Government in relation to these measures. Let me say at the outset that we have seen another example of the Opposition's definition of consultation. It seems that whenever the Australian Labor Party or the unions-in this case the Public Service staff associations-disagree with a proposal by the Government, then it accuses the Government of lack of consultation. If that is their definition, it is doing more to the language than even Alice in Wonderland.
Against that observation, I think we need to appreciate that the history of the review of the promotion process within the Public Service goes back to December of 1973 and the fiftieth meeting of the Joint Council; that is, between the Public Service Board and the staff associations. The Council established a sub-committee to examine the promotions appeal system. That was known as the Thorley committee. It was followed in February and March of 1974 by the Moffatt committee report. The consultation went on through November 1974 and December 1974, at the fiftysecond meeting of the Joint Council, to early 1975 when the Public Service Board distributed a report to staff associations and departments.

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2457

In November 1975 the Board's office issued a discussion paper on the promotions appeal system which suggested it was necessary to look at the total promotion process. In December 1975 the fifty-fourth meeting of the Joint Council agreed to the Board's suggestion and reconvened the promotions appeal sub-committee. In June 1976 the sub-committee reported to Joint Council, which referred the report to the Board for further work. In late 1976 the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration reported. In June 1977 the Public Service Board's discussion paper entitled 'The promotion process' was distributed to Joint Council members and within the Board's office for comment. In November 1977 a discussion paper was circulated to all departments. In December 1978, following review of comments received, a revised version of the promotion process paper was distributed to staff associations.
In April and May 1979 discussion took place with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which was an organisation mentioned by the honourable member for Wills when he asserted that neither the Public Service Board nor the Government consulted with staff associations or the ACTU. In April and May 1979 there were discussions with the ACTU and the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations concerning outstanding areas of disagreement. In August 1979 there was the submission to Cabinet and in September 1979 the Government approved the proposals for review of the promotion process. A public statement was issued by me in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. Thereafter there was extensive work done by the Public Service Board in the preparation of the appropriate legislation. Prior to the Bill being introduced into this House on 29 October, 1981, I am advised that there was some further discussion with representatives of the staff associations. As I have said, the Bill was introduced on 29 October 1981 and it has lain on the table since then. The staff associations have had plenty of time in which to consider the provisions of the Bill. The Opposition also has had ample time to consider its provisions.
Mr Hawke~Rubbish.
Mr VINER~It has been on the table from October 29 1981 to now, 6 May. The first Bill dealt with, amongst other things, the promotion process itself, the constitution of the appeal committees and the operation of those committees. So there it was in front of the Opposition and in front of the staff associations to consider. If they had wished they could have made representations to the Government. That is an opportunity for consideration which is not unknown in the practices

and procedures of this Parliament. Then meetings
wereheld~~
Mrs Kelly~1 raise a point of order. Members of the Opposition want some opportunity to discuss their amendments. This is a great travesty.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER~Order! There is no point of order.
Mr VINER~It is important to explode the myth propounded by the honourable member for Wills that there was a lack of consultation. It is important on behalf of the Government to demonstrate the falsity of that accusation. Meetings were held on 1 April, 14 April and 15 April between senior officers of the Public Service, senior officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, of the Professional Officers Association, the Australian Public Service Association and the Council of Professional Associations. Some of the recommendations made by the staff associations and the ACTU at that meeting were accepted and are reflected in the second Bill, the amending legislation, recently introduced. As I have said, some of the recommendations made were not accepted. I wished simply to demonstrate that the accusations of the honourable member for Wills that there was a lack of consultation were completely without foundation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
In Committee
Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)~ls it the wish of the Committee that the Bill be considered as a whole?
Mr Hawke~Given the travesty that you have made of the whole thing, we may as well do it that way.
Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! That is not the business of the Chair.
Mr Hawke~It is our business, though.
The Bill.
Mr HAWKE (Wills) (1.18 a.m.)~ln the very short time that is left to me, as a result of the absolute travesty that has been inflicted upon this Parliament by the callous attitude of this Government, one's observations must be extremely truncated.
I wish first to indicate that there was an additional amendment that I would have moved if time had permitted and I shall place it on record. In addition to those amendments that have been circulated in my name, I would have moved that the Bill be amended by deleting from proposed

It is first necessary to refute the statements just made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) which purport to be in response to something that I said earlier in the debate. One must say in the Minister's favour that in his last appearance as Minister for this area of affairs he has exhibited the consistency that has marked his tenure of that portfolio.
Mr Young-Every portfolio.
Mr HAWKE-I can speak with authority only about this one.
Mr Young-I will tell you about the others.
Mr HAWKE-I ask the honourable member not to take up my precious time by telling me how the Minister mucked up the Aboriginal affairs portfolio and every other portfolio that he has held. I will just say that in the dying stages of his tenure of this portfolio he gets 100 per cent for consistency in that he has an innate, intrinsic incapacity to represent the position accurately before this chamber. Every time he opens his mouth there is a deliberate misrepresentation of the issue before the chamber.
Mr Viner-Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. I object to the remarks made by the honourable gentleman. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a tabulation of the consultation by the Public Service Board to which I shortly referred in my earlier remarks.
Mr HAWKE-That is not a point of order.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)- No, it is not a point of order.

6 and 7 May 1982REPRESENTATIVES 2459

Mr Viner-Is leave granted?
Mr HAWKE-It is not a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman.
Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-Is leave granted?
Mr HAWKE-The Minister should have sought leave to incorporate the document when he spoke earlier. Once again, he is abusing the forms of this chamber.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-Leave is not granted?
Mr HAWKENot in these circumstances; no. I repeat that in respect of this issue the Minister got up and again attempted to mislead this chamber, as is his wont, by putting in my mouth an accusation that I did not make. If he had had the decency to listen and the intelligence to understand-in respect of each capacity there is serious doubt that he possesses either-he would have known that I made it quite clear in my speech that of course there had been consultation. I pointed out that those processes of consultation had gone back to the year 1973. I made the point that in respect of certain and very important new measures that have been brought in and included in the two pieces of amending legislation, the last of which we have had no chance to consider because it was made available this week and not in October or December 1981, as he sought to make the charge in this chamber-
Mr Viner-Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. The honourable gentleman has misrepresented what I said. I referred to the Bill which I introduced on 29 October 1981.
Mr HAWKE-That is not a point of order.
Mr Viner-That is a fact. It is on the record of the House.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-There is no point of order.
Mr HAWKE-It is not a point of order. Again, I give the Minister full marks for consistency. He cannot get anything right. Not only can he not get anything right but also he always-even in the last seven minutes of his tenure as a Minister in this area-misrepresents the position. I made it perfectly clear in my speech that in respect of significant areas contained in the two pieces of amending legislation there had been no consultation. That is not the same thing as trying to say that I had made the charge that in respect of a general area there had been no consultation. Of course, there has been. It is the last pathetic mark of this pathetic departing Minister that he has again misrepresented the position.

Mr Viner-I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Wills has again misrepresented the statement which I made.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)- Order! The Minister will resume his seat. He should know that that is not a point of order.
Mr HAWKE-In a sense we are indebted to the Minister because he is absolutely convinced that he must, as I say, to the last dying six minutes 'of his ministry in this area continue to show that he is consistent; that he cannot be accurate, he cannot be honest, and he does not have the intelligence to understand what is being said. Let me make clear the travesty which has been inflicted on this country in this last half an hour or so in the Parliament. We have had brought into this chamber two pieces of amending legislation, one which was introduced in the latter part of last year and another which was made available to honourable members this week. That legislation is very extensive, very complex, and is directed, allegedly, to trying to establish within the Australian Public Service a system which will ensure that at each stage of people's involvement in the Public Service there will be applied principles, the application of which will ensure the most efficient Public Service that this country can have. The principles involved are directed in the first place to what criteria shall be applied in the question of recruitment to the Public Service. The proposition is that the major and overwhelming criterion applied shall be the criterion of merit. We on this side of the House, of course, are committed to that principle. It is sensible and it is one which, if properly applied, would produce the result to which we all, certainly on this side of the House in fact are committed, but apparently on the other side of the House only in form are committed.
One of the amendments which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition seeks to include in the legislation a new section 33AA. As I have said, it would have picked up the very specific recommendation of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which reported in 1976. The Royal Commission recommended strongly and unanimously that the inclusion of those provisions, which would have emphasised merit and the elimination of any suggestion of patronage or favouritism, would have enshrined in the statute and not left to the question of some regulations that might subsequently have been formulated the statutory principle of merit. As I have said, the provisions would have ensured the elimination of any suggestion or possibility of patronage or favouritism.

2460 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Public Service Acts Amendment Bill

In respect of this basic issue of how shall members of the Public Service be recruited, we sought constructively and helpfully by way of amendment to ensure that this legislation would contain that point. But what has happened? Because of the attempt of this Government to gag this Parliament, this very important legislation dealing with the structure and the very essence of the Public Service has been made a mockery. There is absolutely no chance of rational, intelligent or prolonged discussion on the issue. Of course, after the point of recruitment the questions then arise of transfer and promotion and the processes which shall be applied within the Public Service to ensure that, when people are to be moved upwards to positions of greater responsibility, the best person gets the job; that there will be a process of appeal which will ensure that the considerations will apply which will lead to a position in which the person with the greatest capacity will get the job. That is the second important issue which is involved.
In respect of that, we believe that any reasonable person in this country would take the point that there should be serious discussions as to whether the House should easily accept an attitude on behalf of this Government which sought to circumvent the very specific reasons for judgment handed down, by whom? They were handed down by Mr Justice Ellicott. In the Finch case at the end of 1981 Mr Justice Ellicott, in a very reasonable, considered, and, I think, eloquent judgment considered the issues which had arisen in the Finch case. They were more disturbing issues which had arisen. In the 36-page reasons for judgment Mr Justice Ellicott had pointed out the sorts of considerations which should be available to ensure that in the processes of appeal the right person or the best person got the job. He said that these sorts of things should be done. The Government is concerned. It is saying: 'No, we will not accept the Ellicott judgment'. Why? It is because it opens up the possibility to people of ensuring that there shall be the full applications of the principles of natural justice, that there shall be a full inquiry into the claims of the applicants and that justice shall be done. That is the essence of the Ellicott reasons for judgment. This amending legislation is calculated deliberately to overthrow the Ellicott decision.
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr Hawke-So has the Minister's. The Minister's time has expired.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.

Mr Hawke-The Minister's time has expired. This is the last time we will hear him as Minister in this House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member will resume his seat. It might be the last time. I hear him for a while, too.

Mr VINER (Stirling-Minister for Industrial Relations) (1.28 a.m.)-I want to point out that, in addition to the consultation I referred to, on the first Bill the Public Service Board met with the--

Mr Maher-Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

Mr Hawke-What is this? I am not allowed to talk because the time has expired but he is now taking up the time.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! I am hearing the honourable member for Lowe on a point of order.

Mr Maher-According to the clock in the chamber that I am looking at, it is only 28 minutes past one.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member is incorrect. The point was that the honourable member's time of I/) minutes had expired.

Answers to Questions

The following answers to questions were circulated:

Canberra: Public Transport Corridors
(Question No. 94)
Mr Innes asked the Minister of the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 26 November 1980:
(I) Have any corridors of land been reserved in Canberra for the future provision of tracked or otherwise separate public transport systems either as a result of the 1976 Interdepartmental Task Force or otherwise; if so, what are the details.
(2) What segments of possible public transport corridors, (a) have yet to be reserved or (b) are within a built-up (i) public or (ii) private environment.
(3) Are any segments of possible corridors currently subject to private lease; ifso, (a) what are they, (b) to whom are they leased, (c) when do current leases expire, (d) will any of these leases be considered for the new 99-year leasing arrangements and (e) does provision exist for the Commonwealth to resume them.
(4) Was reference made on 1927 maps of Canberra to plans for a heavy rail link through North Canberra from Kingston via the Causeway to Civic and thence to Yass, New South Wales; if so, what (a) land along that proposed transport corridor has been ceded to other uses and (b) buildings have constructed on it.
Mr Hodgman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes, through Florey and part of Belconnen Town Centre.
(2) All other segments of possible public transport corridors have yet to be formally reserved. However, the importance of facilitating public transport has been recognised in city design and future corridors could include Barry Drive, Northbourne Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Adelaide Avenue and Athllon Drive. It is not possible to indicate segments that may be within a built-up, public or private environment, but as a general rule development in and around these corridors has acknowledged their potential use.
(3) See answer to (2). If a corridor was identified in a location that made resumption necessary, land could be resumed under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act.
(4) Yes.
(a) All land along the 1927 corridor is now used for other purposes.
(b) Houses and roads in Campbell, Reid, Braddon, Dickson, Downer and City are built on the original corridor.
Sporting Groups in the Australian Capital Territory
(Question No. 1058)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 2 April 1981:
(I) What funds have been made available for the provision of funds to sporting groups in the Australian Capital Territory in each year since 1972 and what sum is available in 1981.
(2) How much of this is applied to coaching.
(3) By what criteria are the funds distributed.
(4) What is the source of these funds.

Mr Hodgman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) No funds were made available in 1972 and 1973.
Grants to sporting groups in the Australian Capital Territory commenced in 1974 and the amounts provided have been:

The Sports Development Program commenced in 1980 and $200,000 was made available for distribution. $222,000 was available under the programme in 1981 and $243,000 has been provided for 1982.
Australian Capital Territory sporting groups also received grants under the Australian Capital Territory Capital and Equipment Grants Scheme. In 1980-81, the first year of the scheme, a total of$125,295 for capital projects and/or equipment purchases was made available to sporting groups. The figure for 1981-82 was $189,993.
(2) No figures are available to show what proportion of the grants are applied to coaching from 1976 to 1979.
In 1980 under the Sports Development Program $56,180 or 29.7 per cent of funds allocated were applied to coaching. In 1981, $57,090 or 30.7 per cent of funds initially allocated, has been applied to coaching.
For 1982 from the total amount allocated to date, $66,401 or 31.5 per cent was for coaching purposes.
(3) Grants are made under the Sports Development Program following recommendations of the Australian Capital Territory Sports and Fitness Committee. This Committee was appointed by the Minister for the Capital Territory to advise on matters concerning sport and fitness within the Australian Capital Territory.
Applications are accepted from the parent bodies of the sports active within the Australian Capital Territory and funding may be offered for up to 50 per cent of the eligible costs of the project to assist with the conduct of championships, travel to championships, administration, travel to meetings, coaching and special projects. The applicants list their own priorities for these categories.
In assessing applications cognizance is taken of development potential, membership participation, financial overheads compared to income, past record of management, and evidence of need of the various applicants.
As the primary objective of the Program is to stimulate the development of sport in the Australian Capital Territory, not to finance it, grant applications are favourably considered where the sporting organisation will contribute a substantial proportion of the necessary funds.
Similar criteria are applied to the Australian Capital Territory Capital and Equipment Grants Scheme, with the exception that funding is not limited to the parent bodies for each sport, that is, individual clubs may apply. Recommendations

for assistance for Capital/Equipment purposes are made to the Minister by the Capital and Equipment Grants Advisory Committee.
(4) Funding for the Sports Development Program and the Capital and Equipment Grants Scheme, is made available from the Australian Capital Territory Community Development Fund which incorporates funds from levies on gambling revenue.
Visits Abroad by Members of Parliament
(Question No. 2205)

(I) What specific circumstances led to the discontinuation of publication of the calendar of visits overseas in his Department's publication 'Backgrounder'.
(2) What visits abroad (a) have been made or (b) are proposed to be made by members of Parliament in each month from January to July 1981.

(3) What were or are the (a) destinations and (b) duration of each visit referred to in part (2).
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Publication in 'Backgrounder' of a calendar of visits overseas was discontinued because of the difficulty, with reduced staff, of compiling complete information and publishing it in time for it to be of practical use to readers.
(2) and (3) While my Department assists members of Parliament travelling overseas if requested, it is not my responsibility to provide details of travel by private members of Parliament. Nor is complete or authoritative information available on travel undertaken by senators or members using private or other means, since senators and members are under no obligation to inform me or my Department of their travel plans.
Members study grant entitlements to overseas travel are administered by the Department of Administrative Services.
I am able to provide details of overseas visits undertaken by Ministers from January to July 1981. These were as follows:

Stockpiling of Warheads
(Question No. 3332)
Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 15 October 1981:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to scenarios for World War III being presented in all leading Western nations during 1981 in learned documentaries, science fiction, authoritative survival advice and increasing promotion of sales of shelters.
(2) Has he received the text of a proposal by President Brezhnev for a world conference of leading experts to present a realistic scenario to the public.
(3) Can he say whether the superpowers have stockpiled 1,000,000 times the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb and whether 17,000 more warheads are planned by the United States of America by 1991.
(4) Is he also able to say whether 200 of the 50,000 warheads would be sufficient to reduce the main cities of the earth to radioactive ash.
(5) Has Australia indicated to the superpowers that these activities are not acceptable and sane alternatives to detailed, broad, intensive and continuous communications at every level including the top level till the race to the brink is decisively reversed; if so, why has this declaration not been published.
(6) Can he also say whether President Reagan is the first US. President since World War II who has not warned the world of the impossibility of winning World War III.
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

whole, the Government can confirm that it, too, views the global arms race with deepest concern. It is very conscious of the dangers and likely appalling consequences of nuclear war. For this reason it has sought and obtained for Australia membership of every major multilateral deliberative and negotiating forum in the arms control and disarmament fields.
Within those forums Australian representatives are instructed to make every effort to support the negotiation of balanced and verifiable agreements for arms control and disarmament.

Aboriginal Development Commission: Farm Management Consultants

(Question No. 3374)

Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 20 October 1981:

(I) How many farm management consultants were
employed in 1980-81 through the Aboriginal Development Commission.

(2) What sum was each paid in that year.

(3) What sum are they estimated to receive in 1981-82.

(4) In respect of how many farms did each consultant advise.

(5) How many farms in each State receive advice through the Aboriginal Development Commission.

Mr Viner-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

(I) The Aboriginal Development Commission is empowered under its Act to make loans or grants to enable
Aboriginals to engage in business enterprises, or to occupy land, and to make payments in respect to related investigations, inquiries and supervision, etc.. . . (sec. 23 (I) and
sec. 24 (I».

In 1980-81, the ADC made direct payments to nine farm management consultants. In addition 10 Aboriginal organis-
ations received a total of $61,648 in that year to help them obtain advice of an agricultural or pastoral nature.

(2) The details of payments made to each consultant during 1980-81 were:

ment Commission does not involve charges. A high degree of co-operation has been developed in most States, with the rel-
evant State and Territory Departments of Primary Industry or Agriculture providing advice to Aboriginal ventures of this type at no charge. It is only in those few cases where such advice is not available that the Commission, either directly or
by way of grant to the venture, engages paid consultants.

An estimate of the Aboriginal individuals and organisations which receive such advice on agricultural or pastoral matters would be:

(Question No. 3409)
Mr Adermann asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 October 1981:
(I) Will the Minister, before the International Year of Disabled Persons ceases, ensure that, at the very least, in each State office of the Minister's Department, and the central Canberra office, a Porta Printer type telephone receiver to communicate with the profoundly deaf is installed.
(2) Does the Minister understand the impediment facing profoundly deaf persons unable to use a standard telephone receiver, who need urgently to contact the Minister's Department on matters of concern, distress, or difficulty.
(3) Will the Minister ensure by this means that the profoundly deaf are not denied telephonic access to the Department which all other sections of the community enjoy.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
I refer the honourable member to the answer provided by the Prime Minister to House of Representatives Question No. 3406 (Hansard, 25 March 1982, page 1494).

Commonwealth Office Block, Adelaide
(Question No. 3760)
Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Prior to the General Elections in 1980 did the then Minister for Administrative Services announce the intention of the Commonwealth to construct a Commonwealth Office Block in Adelaide.
(2) Did the Government, in announcing through its ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions that the promised office block would be delayed for several years, give, as its reason for the delay, that with the boom in private investment associated with resource development there was a need to avoid overstretching the capacity of the building and construction industry.
(3) What evidence is he able to point to which would indicate that the building and construction industry in South Australia is overstretched.
(4) For precisely how long does the Government intend to delay work on the construction of the office block.
(5) Has his Department prepared estimates of the additional construction costs in money terms because of the proposed delay; if so, will he make them public.
(6) What portion of the proposed office block would have been used by Commonwealth departments and their employees.
(7) Where are Commonwealth employees who would have been housed in the new office block currently located; are those premises owned by the Commonwealth or are they rented and what is the annual rental bill on these premises to the Commonwealth.
Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes.
(2) and (3) The announcement was made in the context of the likely demands on the building and construction industry throughout Australia. Other Commonwealth construction projects at present being planned will benefit the local building industry.
(4) It has been deferred for several years. A decision has yet to be taken by the Government on a commencement date. However, the aim of the Government to establish a Commonwealth Centre in Adelaide still remains.
(5) No.
(6) The whole would have been used 'to house Commonwealth employees with provision for some members and senators and their staff.
(7) Proposed occupants of the new office block are currently housed in rented accommodation in the Adelaide city area. The annual rental cost is $2,933,617.
Military and Economic Assistance to Indonesia
(Question No. 3761)
Mr Duffy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:

(I) What are the details of all military and economic assistance given to Indonesia by Australia since June 1970.
(2) What steps has the Government taken to ensure that any military equipment given to Indonesia has not been used in East Timor and, if it has been used in that country, what action has the Government taken to prevent continuance of such use.
(3) With reference to resolutions in the United Nations affirming the right of the people of East Timor to self determination, how did Australia vote on each of the resolutions.
(4) What action has he taken to ensure the protection of human rights of the people of East Timor.
(5) What action has the Government taken, or does it propose to take, to give aid to the people of East Timor.
(6) What are the particulars of representation made to the Government by individuals, Australian organisations and associations and corporate bodies, opposing the Government's policy of recognition of Indonesia's incorporation of East Timor.
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
( I) (a) Military assistance
Formal Australian Defence Co-operation Programs (DCP) with Indonesia commenced in July 1972. Before that, beginning in 1968, DCP assistance to Indonesia consisted only of a small amount of training at Australian Defence Force establishments and assistance with survey and mapping work in Kalimantan and Sumatra in 1970 and 1971. Since 1972 a wide range of assistance has been provided including provision of training and technical advisory assistance and joint equipment projects. Major DCP activities have included:
A maritime patrol project including provision of 2 ex-RAN Attack Class patrol boats, 6 Australian designed and built sixteen metre patrol boats, 18 Australian built Nomad aircraft, advisory teams, and training in Australia. This project aims to assist Indonesia to deal with smuggling, illegal entry, protection of fishing rights and search and rescue.
Provision of 16 Sabre Aircraft with associated equipment, training and advisory assistance.
A continuing survey and mapping project in Indonesia, currently directed towards Iranian Jaya.
Provision of 12 ex-Army unarmed Sioux helicopters for basic training.
Provision of 250 minitary Landrover vehicles with two years supply of spare parts.
A training and study visit program.
Other DCP activities undertaken include provision of field radio transceivers, automotive repair workshops and Defence research and development capability; assistance in English Language training; and a CI30 engine overhaul program.
Annual DCP expenditure on Indonesia is as follows:

(b) Economic assistance
Indonesia has been one of the main beneficiaries of Australian aid for many years. In the period I July 1970 to 30 June 1981 Indonesia has received equipment and services in support of development activities, food aid and training worth in all $290.692m.
During the past five years the size and scope of Australian aid projects in Indonesia have been substantially increased. The main emphasis now is on projects which will strengthen the development of infrastructure and public utilities and promote growth, especially in the agricultural sector.
Major current projects include:
Roads in west Kalimantan (40m) Geological Mapping of Irian Jaya Province (8.2m) Assistance to Technical Education (IO.5m) Animal Diseases Research Institute (located in Java) (6.25m) Animal Husbandry Research Centre (located in Java) (32m) Prefabricated Steel Bridges in more remote provinces (24.8m) Prestressed Concrete Bridge Plants in Sumatra and Java (18.5m) Urban Water Supply Projects in Sumatra, Java, Bali and Kalimantan (20m)
There are also a number of small scale technical assistance activities in fields as diverse as pasture research, education, investment services and public health.
(2) The only restriction placed in the use of military equipment provided under DCP to other countries, including Indonesia, is on the scale or disposal to a third country without the prior consent of the Australian Government.
(3) Australia voted in favour of the 1975 resolution, abstained in 1976 and 1977, and has voted against the resolutions since then.
(4) While the Government firmly supports the application of internationally accepted standards of human rights across the broad geographical and political spectrum, including in East Timor, it is of course not in a position to ensure the protection of these rights in any particular foreign country. The Government's position on human rights has been set out clearly in the UN Commission on Human Rights, on which Australia is an active member. It is well known to the Indonesian Government.
(5) The Government has provided relief assistance to the people of East Timor since September 1975. The total value of such assistance is now more than $5.5m. $4.9m of this amount has been contributed since August 1979 to the joint Indonesian Red Cross/International Committee of the Red Cross relief program in East Timor.
In response to a need to upgrade education facilities in East Timor the Australian Government has supplied three prefabricated school buildings. Shipment of the buildings from Jakarta to Dili by the Indonesian authorities is expected shortly.
The Government has indicated that it will give sympathetic consideration to any Indonesian Government request for assistance to East Timor.

(6) While I can confirm that many representations have been made over the years in the terms suggested by the honourable member, I am not prepared to authorise the use of scarce resources to compile the detailed information request.
Poverty Measurement
(Question No. 3768)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Do figures contained in the report of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat on poverty measurement indicate that a (a) single unemployment or sickness beneficiary 18 years of age and over received in household disposable income in 1979-80, the equivalent of 20.8 per cent of average weekly earnings, (b) single unemployment or sickness beneficiary 16 and 17 years old, received in household disposable income in 1979-80 the equivalent of 14.6 per cent of average weekly earnings, (c) married couple, receiving unemployment or sickness benefit with 2 children, received in household disposable income in 1979-80, the equivalent of 47.9 per cent of average weekly earnings, (d) married couple, receiving unemployment or sickness benefit with 4 children, received in household disposable income in 1979-80 the equivalent of 56.6 per cent of average weekly earnings and (e) single unemployment or sickness beneficiary with 2 children received in household disposable income in 1979-80 the equivalent of 30.3 per cent of average weekly earnings, and 41.2 per cent for those beneficiaries with 4 children.
(2) Is it a fact that in each of the cases referred to in part (I) the amount of disposable income, in proportion to the average weekly earnings, fell between 1976-77 and 1979-80, after having risen between 1972-73 and 1976-77; if so, what are the reasons.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
( I) Yes, but it should be noted that the figure of 20.8 per cent of average weekly earnings relates to the disposable income of a single unemployed person aged 18 and over without dependants.
(2) Yes. Between 1972-73apd 1976-77 rates of pension and benefits grew at a rate which was faster than growth in average weekly earnings. The Government's family allowance reform was of particular benefit to pensioner and beneficiary families from June 1976.
Between 1976-77 and 1979-80 most basic pension and benefit rates were increased according to movements in the consumer price index and, in fact, grew over that period at a rate similar to growth in average weekly earnings. Additional pension and benefit rates for children and family allowances were not increased between 1976-77 and 1979-80, the unemployment and sickness benefit rates for single persons aged 16 and 17 were not increased over that period, and the rate of unemployment benefit payable to persons aged 18 years and over without dependants was removed from the automatic indexation provisions of the Social Services Act in November 1978.
Poverty Measurement

Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Do figures contained in the report of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat on poverty measurement indicate that a

2482 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

married couple with (a) 2 children and (b) 4 children receiving a pension had a household disposable income in 1979-80 equivalent to 47.7 per cent and 58.6 per cent of average weekly earnings, respectively.
(2) Does the same table in that report show that a single pensioner or supporting parent with (a) 2 children and (b) 4 children received a household disposable income equivalent in 1979-80 to 34.0 per cent and 44.9 per cent, respectively.
(3) In respect of each of the figures referred to in parts (I) and (2), is the 1979-80 percentage of average weekly earnings less than the 1976-77 percentage of average weekly earnings.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) to (3) Yes.
Poverty Measurement
(Question No. 3770)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Is the Minister able to say whether the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Mr Peter Hollingworth, author of Australians in Poverty, and articles in the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald published in January 1981, estimate the extent of poverty in Australia has increased since 1975. from less than one million people, to approximately 2 million people.
(2) If so, is there any substance to this estimate; if not, on what basis is it inaccurate.
(3) What is the estimate by the Department of Social Security of the extent of poverty in Australia.
(4) If the Department does not have an estimate of the extent of poverty in Australia how is the Department capable of assessing need in the Australian community in respect of welfare services and formulating policy designed to meet that need.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) A number of commentators have suggested that at the end of the 1970s around two million Australians had incomes less than the Henderson poverty line.
(2) The basis of these estimates and the problems to which they give rise are discussed on pages 144 to 147 of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat's Report on Poverty Measurement. In general, these estimates appear to have been based either on the presupposition that all pensioners and beneficiaries must have incomes which are below or just above the Henderson poverty line, which may not be the case, for example, when pensioners share accommodation with other adults, or on an insufficiently thorough examination of the 1978-79 Income Distribution Survey data.
(3) and (4) See my response to Question No. 3716 (Hansard, 18 November 1981, pp 3193-4).
The Department of Social Security participated in the preparation of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat's Report on Poverty Measurement. It has not made a separate assessment of the extent of poverty in Australia.

Planned Parenthood Federation
(Question No. 3778)
Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to a circular letter from 'Women Who Want to be Women' alleging that Australian aid to the Planned Parenthood Federation may be used to support forced contraception programs and to promote the use of the Dalkon shield, Depo-Provera, high-oestrogen contraceptive pills, expired drugs and pharmaceuticals.
(2) If so, will he bring the attention of the Planned Parenthood Federation to these allegations and seek their views on what (a) should be done, (b) has been done and (c) is intended to be done to prevent such practices.
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
( I) Yes, this circular letter has come to my attention.
(2) Because of the importance of population policies and the seriousness of these allegations I have directed that the comments of the International Planned Parenthood Federation be sought.
Health Insurance Advertising
(Question No. 3847)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:

(2) What sum was spent by the Government on (a) television advertisements, (b) radio advertisements and (c) newspaper advertisements to specifically advertise the New Health Care Card for the Disadvantaged.
(3) How many of the pamphlets entitled 'In Sickness and in Health . . . . Better Value for your Dollar' were printed and what was the total cost of the pamphlet.
(4) What advertising agency was commissioned by the Government to handle the campaign.
(5) What was the total overall cost to advertise the latest changes.
Mr Fife-The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) (a) Nil.
(b) $138,178 including time costs, production costs and service fees.
(c) $275,612 including space costs, production costs and service fees.
(2) (a) Nil.

(4) Murray Evans Advertising Pty Ltd and Neville Jeffress Advertising Pty Ltd were appointed by the Australian Government Advertising Service to plan and produce the advertising. Advertisements were placed with the media by Doyle Dane Bernbach Berry Currie Pty Ltd, Neville Jeffress Pty Ltd and Fortune (Aust.) Pty Ltd (Commonwealth Government placing agencies) and associated sub-placing agencies.
(5) Total cost of advertising, printing and distribution was $642,031.
Social Welfare: Spender Report
(Question No. 3888)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) Is the Minister able to say whether the Spender report calls on parents to make a significant contribution according to their means to the full cost of the services provided for their children.
(2) Did the Minister state that parents able to pay the full cost of day care should do so.
(3) Is it the intention of the Government to pursue such objectives; if so, what income limit will the Minister set to determine which parents should pay the full cost.
Mr Hunt~The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) The report to which the honourable member refers is an internal working document of my department, and is part of a general review of the Children's Services Program. The review is intended to ensure that Commonwealth funds appropriated for children's services are used to maximum advantage, while maintaining quality child care.
(2) The Government's overall welfare policy is to direct assistance to those in greatest need. It is consistent with this principle that those who can afford to do so should make a substantial contribution to the cost of the services they use.
(3) This matter is still under examination by the Government. Any recommendations which arise as a result of the review will be considered by the Government in due course.
EI Salvador and Nicaragua
(Question No. 3947)
Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February:
(I) What sources of information does the Government have on developments in (a) EI Salvador and (b) Nicaragua which enable it to formulate its policies toward that region.
(2) Does the Australian Embassy in Mexico have reporting responsibilities for (a) EI Salvador and (b) Nicaragua; if so, (i) when were the last four visits made by a Foreign Affairs officer from the Australian Embassy in Mexico City and (ii) what was the duration of each visit.
Mr Street~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) (a) and (b) Australia has a wide variety of sources of information on EI Salvador and Nicaragua. A considerable amount of this information comes from United States sources

il'cluding the United States media, which is both natural and understandable in view of the close United States interests in developments in immediately neighbouring countries. Information also comes from European and other sources, including our Embassy in Mexico City which reports on the basis of discussions with officials in Mexico and neighbouring countries and other diplomats in Mexico City who are accredited to El Salvador and Nicaragua as well as the Mexican and Central American press.
(2) (a) and (b) Yes.
(i) and (ii) As far as can be ascertained two visits have been made by Foreign Affairs officers to EI Salvador and three to Nicaragua.
(a) El Salvador-First Secretary visited 13-14 June 1978; Third Secretary visited 21-23 March 1978.
There are plans for the Ambassador to visit El Salvador in the near future.
(b) Nicaragua-Ambassador visited 7-14 October 1979; Third Secretary visited 11-15 March 1978; Ambassador visited 6-19 August 1971.
Proposed Sale of Belconnen Mall

Stage 2 requires the consultant to assist in the arrangements for the offer for sale of the Mall and the provision of advice on purchase proposals received, including a recommendation on the preferred purchaser, price and terms and conditions. It is anticipated stage 2 will be completed within five months. Under this arrangement the fee for stage 2 will be $212,000.

(2) What subsidy or assistance is being provided to, or is anticipated towards, the private bus operator involved in the Canberra Explorer service.
(3) On what basis was that private operator selected or invited to participate in the service.
(4) Was the possibility of the ACTION bus network operating Canberra Explorer out of its own resources investigated; if so, what was the result of that investigation.

Answers to Questions

(5) Was more than one private bus operator approached to tender for the Canberra Explorer; if so, which operators were approached.
(6) Was the Government-owned Australian Accommodation and Tours asked to become involved with the Canberra Explorer service.
(7) Were there formal discussions with representatives of the Transport Workers Union before the introduction of the service.
(8) What (a) has been and (b) is the expected patronage of the Canberra Explorer service.
Mr Hodgman-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:
(I) The Canberra Explorer bus routes are provided by a private operator who bears all costs associated with their operation.
(2) A brochure explaining the Canberra Explorer was printed by the Australian Capital Territory Tourist Bureau at an estimated cost of $4,600 which was not recovered. The provision and installation of bus stops was arranged for the operator at a cost of $1,775 which was recovered. No other subsidy or assistance has been provided. Costs related to the provision of the joint tickets valid on both Canberra Explorer bus routes and ACTION scheduled services such as sellers commission are shared equally.
(3) Various private operators including the private operator involved in the Canberra Explorer hold tour licences for the Australian Capital Territory. The operator in question advised the Department of his intention to operate the Canberra Explorer bus routes and subsequently approached the ACTION bus service to participate in an arrangement for marketing joint tickets valid for travel on either the Canberra Explorer bus routes or already scheduled services operated by ACTION. My Department agreed to this arrangement as it saw this as a source of additional revenue for the Canberra bus service achieved at little or no cost. The initiative was with the private operator and not with the Department.
(4) The possibility was investigated and it was concluded that ACTION could not profitably operate an Explorer route on the same basis as that proposed by the private operator. Given existing resources ACTION could operate such a route only during school holidays when drivers are not required for school work.
(5) See (3) above.
(6) No.
(7) The venture was discussed in principle with representatives of the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Transport Workers' Union in July 1981. In October 1981 I wrote to the Secretary of the Branch noting my support for the proposal and assuring the Union that the venture should not be seen as an incursion into areas traditionally the province of the government operated public transport system. Further details were provided to the Union at meetings in early January 1982 prior to the commencement of the service.

National Accounting Practices: Stock Evaluation Adjustment
(Question No. 4049)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 February 1982:
(I) What has been the gross operating surplus of trading companies in each year since 1969-70 (a) excluding and (b) including the stock valuation adjustment.
(2) Has the effect of deducting the stock valuation adjustment from the gross operating surplus of trading companies been to reduce significantly the official estimates of business profits in each year during the last decade.
(3) Why is only a partial adjustment for inflation made by excluding the stock valuation adjustment but failing to make an allowance for the effects of inflation on monetary assets and liabilities.
(4) Is the method of inflation accounting used by the Statistician for the national accounts supported by the majority of accountants or by the Commissioner of Taxation; if not, what is their approach to inflation accounting.
(5) Is the effect of the current national accounting practice to reduce significantly the apparent profit share of national income, and therefore to reduce the ratio of business income to private salaries and wages.

- The stock valuation adjustment is deducted to obtain gross operating surplus.
Note: Definitions and an outline of sources and methods of estimation are set out in 'Australian National Accounts, Concepts, Sources and Methods' (5216.0).
(2) No. The stock valuation adjustment is deducted from estimates of the gross trading surplus of trading enterprise companies (i.e. before allowance is made for interest, land rent and royalty receipts or payments and before allowances for depreciation or income tax) to obtain the national accounting aggregate 'gross operating surplus of trading enterprise companies'. 'Business profits' is not a concept used in the national accounts. However, the ABS does publish estimates for gross operating surplus, net operating surplus, and company income defined in national accounting terms. The definitions of these aggregates are as far as possible identical to those recommended in the United Nations publication 'A System of National Accounts' (SNA) which is the internationally accepted standard for national accounting statistics.
(3) The measurement of factor incomes within the domestic production account allows for the effects of inflation by deducting the stock valuation adjustment. This is done to avoid the overstatement of national income and related aggregates that would result if a concept of income were used which did not allow for the maintenance of capital. The concept of capital maintenance underlying the SNA is widely known and accepted by national accountants and economists. The effects of inflation on domestic monetary assets and liabilities are not relevant to the measurement of factor incomes generated by production. They may be considered to be relevant, however, to the measurement of transfer incomes. Appropriate ways for measuring these effects are currently under discussion by agencies involved in revising national accounting standards, viz UN Statistical Office, the OECD, and the Conference of European Statisticians. At this time there is no agreement on an appropriate basis of measurement.
(4) The term 'inflation accounting' can be used to embrace two quite distinct aspects of accounting for inflation. National accountants adjust the expenditure side of the domestic production account for successive periods of account so as to express estimates for each period of account in terms of the prices prevailing in one (base year) period of account.

Accounts adjusted in this way are termed constant price estimates and are generally not of relevance to taxation or business accounting. The other form of inflation accounting relates to the adjustment of estimates for individual periods of account so that they reflect the prices prevailing during the period of account rather than historical costs which relate to earlier periods.
Two adjustments are required to be made to historical cost valuations to derive the national accounting aggregate net operating surplus, viz the stock valuation adjustment and a 'depreciation at current cost' adjustment. Because of lack of adequate data only historical cost estimates of depreciation allowances have been used in the Australian National Accounts.
Analogous adjustments to the national accounting depreciation and stock valuation adjustments are widely endorsed by accountants responsible for putting forward inflation accounting proposals to their profession. In addition, many maintain that in the measurement of the 'current cost' (operating) profit of individual enterprises (a more narrowly defined concept than the national accounting concept of gross operating surplus) some adjustment is required for gains and losses on monetary items. However, accountants in Australia and overseas are experiencing great difficulty in reaching a consensus on how and to what extent such adjustments should be made.
(5) No. The national accounts concept of national income is defined as 'the net income accruing within a given period to Australian residents from their services in supplying factors of production (labour, land, capital and enterprise) in Australia or overseas plus indirect taxes less subsidies'. This concept of income relates to direct income from current production and excludes capital gains or losses.
(6) The estimated ratios are as follows:

(a)
Gross operating surplus of trading
enterprise companies/private
wages, salaries and supplements

(b) Gross operating
surplus plus
stock valuation
adjustment of trading enterprise
companies/private wages, salaries
and supplements

Companies Code
(Question No. 4075)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 25 February 1982:
(I) In view of the forthcoming amendments to the Companies Code, will he, as a matter of urgency, refer parts (12). (13), (14), (15), (16), (18), (21), (23), (26), (32), (48), (52), (53) and (54) of my Question No. 3213, together with his answers (Hansard, 18 November 1981, pages 3173-8) to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for reconsideration and adoption.
(2) Is it a fact that these matters require reconsideration if the Act is to be effective and if all sections of the industry are to receive the protection they deserve.
Mr N. A. Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) The following action has already been taken in relation to the matters raised by the honourable member:
(a) Parts (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16) of Question No. 3213. The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities decided at its meeting in Sydney on 12 February 1982 that the matters raised by the honourable member in parts (12) to (16) inclusive of Question No. 3213 should be examined further with a view to preparing appropriate provisions, if these seem necessary, for consideration by Ministers for inclusion in the exposure draft of the proposed Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983.
(b) Parts (18) and (21) of Question No. 3213. I refer to my answer to parts (17) to (22) of Question No. 3213 (Hansard, 18 November 1981, page 3176). Following the enactment of sections 35 to 37 of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1981, the effect of sub-sections 73 (2) and (5) of the Companies Act 1981, when read with subsections 125 (9). 126 (9) and 127 (8) of the Companies Act, will be to ensure that any proposed variation or abrogation of class rights attached to shares are dealt with in accordance with the special rules contained in sections 125, 126 and 127 of the Companies Act 1981. The matters raised by the honourable member in parts (18) to (22) of Question No. 3213 have been referred to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities which has decided that no further action should be taken at this stage in respect of these matters.
(c) Part (23) of Question No. 3213. The matters raised in part (23) of Question No. 3213 in relation to sections 129 and 130 of the Companies Act 1981 have been referred to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities which has decided that no further action

should be taken at this stage in respect of these matters.
(d) Parts (26) and (32) of Question No. 3213. I refer to my answer to parts (26) and (31) of Question No. 3213 (Hansard, 18 November 1981, page 3177). It has not yet been possible for the Ministerial Council to deal specifically with the question of the possible inclusion of section 391 of the South Australian Companies Act 1962-1979 in the Companies Act 1981. I will, however, ensure that this matter is drawn to the Council's.attention. I note in this regard that the Ministerial Council has decided that there should be a further examination of the question whether there should be a complete reform of the winding up provisions of the Companies Act (referred to in part (60) of Question No. 3213).
(e) Part (48) of Question No. 3213. I refer to my answer to parts (48) and (49) of Question No. 3213 (Hansard, 18 November 1981, page 3177). The Ministerial Council has decided that various matters raised in relation to section 320 of the Companies Act (including the matters raised in parts (48) and (49) of Question No. 3213 and in the report the Ministerial Council has called for from the NCSC on the possible provision of an alternative statutory remedy for shareholders) should be examined further with a view to preparing appropriate provisions, if these seem necessary, for consideration by Ministers for inclusion in the exposure draft of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983.
(f) Parts (52), (53) and (54) of Question No. 3213. The question of a definition of profit (parts (52) and (53) of Question No. 3213) and the question of the distribution of dividends (part (54) of Question No. 3213) have been considered by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities which has decided that no further action should be taken at this stage in respect of these matters.

Tax Avoidance
(Question No. 4121)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
In view of the recent High Court decision in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation of Australia case, in particular the observations Uudgment) of Murphy J. regarding the realities of the manipulation by way of transfer pricing arrangements (structure) by large transnational corporations in their expertise to avoid their tax liability within Australia, will he take action to amend section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to recognise the fact that Australian companies, although in theory controlled by residents, are in fact controlled overseas.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 March 1982 contains amendments proposing to repeal the existing section 136 and to replace it with provisions designed to deal more effectively with the transfer pricing problem, wherever it might arise. Unlike the existing section, the new provisions do not rely upon a control test as a condition of their application. Instead, in broad terms, they will be applicable in circumstances where two or more parties to an international agreement are not dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to a supply or acquisition of property or services and there is a resulting loss to the Australian revenue.
The new provisions will also permit the scrutiny of profit shifting arrangements that may be made by a single taxpayer who has business operations in more than one country, for example, a head office in one country and branch operations in another country.
These new measures will have effect in relation to income derived and expenditure incurred after 27 May 1981-the date on which I announced details of these measures.

2488 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
To the extent that taxpayers, both foreign and Australian, are able to avoid their proper liabilities to Australian tax through transfer pricing and other means, there will be a distortion of the relative burdens of tax that are borne by different sectors of the community, including salary and wage earners.
As I indicated in my answer to question No. 4121, new measures to deal with profit shifting through transfer pricing are contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 March 1982. The proposed provisions to deal with transfer pricing arrangements and other international antiavoidance measures contained in that Bill follow the enactment of the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA and earlier specific anti-avoidance measures, and represent futher evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to legislate to render ineffectual arrangements that are designed to avoid tax which should be paid.

Apprentices Employed by Telecom
(Question No. 4217)
Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 18 March 1982:
( I) Further to his answer to Question No. 3149 (Hansard, 17 November 1981, page 2947), why is the figure for the number of apprentices employed by Telecom Australia per head of State population significantly lower for Western Australia than any other State?
(2) Will he take steps to ensure that this imbalance is corrected by instructing Telecom to employ more apprentices in Western Australia?
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) & (2) In Telecom Australia, apprentice schemes are only one avenue of obtaining trade qualifications. Existing staff may also advance to the same level through in-house bridging training. The current number of apprentices, plus bridging trainees who will obtain the same level of qualifications, is as follows:
New South Wales, 651; Victoria, 480; Queensland, 433; South Australia, 87; Western Australia, 85; Tasmania, 40; Headquarters, I; Total, 1,777.
The number of apprentices and bridging trainees is determined for each State on the basis of projected needs for tradesmen in that State. They are therefore affected by such workload factors as size and growth of the telecommunications network, technological advancements and staff turnover, all of which may differ from State to State. There is not necessarily any relationship between the size of the population and the number of apprentices.

(2) If so will he re-examine staffing levels at the Australian Capital Territory Motor Registries?
Mr Hodgman-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows:
(I) No reliable statistics are available to enable time lost in all industrial disputes in the area to be compared with time spent by motorists waiting to have their cars registered.
(2) Recent delays at the Motor Registries arose from a temporary staff shortage which has now been overcome by the recruitment of staff to normal levels.

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2491

Such transmissions are of two types: high frequency radio transmissions and satellite transmissions.
I. High frequency radio-The only European nation which transmits radio programs to Australia on a regular basis is the United Kingdom. Programs which are received in Australia by means of a high frequency radio interception service operated by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) through their Bringelly NSW Radio Station are as follows:
(i) BBC London for the Australian Broadcasting Commission-Sydney-6.00 am to midnight AEST daily.
(ii) BBC London News Service 2.00 am to 2.15 am and 4.00 am to 1.15 am AEST daily for Radio Station 2GB Sydney.
In respect of stations situated around the Indian Ocean, the only other regular radio transmissions to Australia are as follows:
(iii) Indian Press Service operated by New Delhi Press. This is a news and information service of approximately one to four hours duration directed to the Indian High Commission in Canberra via OTC's Bringelly radio station. The schedule commences at approximately 6.30 pm AEST from Monday to Saturday inclusive and continues for the duration of the program.
(iv) An interception service operated in Perth via OTC's Gnangara radio station from Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean. Through this service, meteorological information for the Weather Bureau in Perth is transmitted from Amsterdam Island. This service is rated by the Weather Bureau as very important as it is the only source of weather information in the Southern Indian Ocean region.
Requests by Australian Broadcasting Stations are made from time to time for the interception by OTC of other radio transmissions such as the Voice of America from the USA.
2. Satellite-Any European nation can transmit commercial radio and TV programs direct via the Indian Ocean Region satellite owned and operated by the INTELSAT organisation. Such transmissions are regularly received by OTC's earth station at Ceduna, South Australia, for landline relay to the ABC and commercial networks.
Scientific Representation Overseas
(Question No. 3748)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Is it a fact that following the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions (known as the Razor Gang), Australian representation in Britain and Europe by a Minister Science and in the United States of America by a Counsellor Science is to be abolished as of 31 December 1981.
(2) Is it also a fact that the High Commission in London and the Embassy in Washington have protested vigorously at the abolition of these important posts and have indicated that they are not able to provide adequate, expert representations to the many international scientific bodies which Australia has been attending.
(3) Is he able to say whether New Zealand is continuing its scientific representation in Britain, Europe and the USA.
(4) Has the New Zealand Government offered to assist Australia by volunteering to cover for Australia and provide

information that it acquiries in vital scientific areas; if so, and in view of the warmth of his relationship with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Muldoon, has the Government accepted Mr Muldoon's generous and disinterested offer of help.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes, the Australian Scientific Liaison Offices in London and Washington closed on 31 December 1981.
(2) No; however the Heads of the two Missions have naturally been concerned about having to absorb responsibilities previously carried out by the Liaison Officers in the face of reductions in their own staff resources. The additional responsibilities have been kept to a minimum.
(3) New Zealand maintains a Minister (Scientific) in London. It has no similar posts in Europe or USA.
(4) No.
CSIRO Energy Research
(Question No. 3774)
Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) For Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation research in (a) solar, (b) wind and (c) biomass energy, what has been the (i) total number of research projects and (ii) funding from (A) CSIRO appropriations and (B) other sources in each of the last five financial years, and what is the estimated expenditure for 1981-82.
(2) Is the CSIRO Executive, with the co-operation of CSIRO Institute Directors, winding down research in those areas; if so, which other Australian organisations will take over research in these areas.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The information is contained in the following table.
(2) In 1981 the CSIRO Executive reassessed its priorities for energy research following some recent changes in the energy scene within Australia and overseas. This review had regard to the Organization's interactions with external bodies and advice from the CSIRO Advisory Council. A document, 'CSIRO Energy Research Planning and Policy' was published in May 1981.
One CSIRO Executive decision was that certain resources devoted to solar energy research and wind energy research could be more effectively deployed elsewhere. Consequently the solar industrial demonstration program carried out by the former Division of Mechanical Engineering is being phased out (having achieved its aims). Similar industrial demonstrations are now being carried out by many State authorities in collaboration with consultants and industry; CSIRO has provided advice on many of these demonstrations. Research on solar energy is continuing in CSIRO and in many universities and institutes of technology.
The wind energy research carried out by the former Division of Mechanical Engineering has been terminated. Similar. research is carried out in several universities, the South Australian Institute of Technology and the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria.
As indicated by the figures in the table, CSIRO's biomass energy research has increased substantially.

Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) What was the total manpower devoted to energy research, development and demonstration by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in each of the past 4 years.
(2) What is the anticipated total manpower to be devoted to energy research, development and demonstration by the CSIROin 1981-82.
(3) Will former Australian Atomic Energy Commission staff recently transferred to the new CSIRO Division of Energy Chemistry make a contribution to the CSIRO's total energy research, development and demonstration manpower; if

so, (a) what are the details and (b) in effect has most of the increase in CSIRO energy research manpower during 1981 been a result of the transfer to the CSIRO of former AAEC staff.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) Manpower is measured as professional and technical support staff man-years directly attributable to the research programs concerned. Total man-years devoted to CSIRO research, development and demonstration primarily directed to energy in the past four financial years, and as estimated for 1981-82, are: 1977-78: 174.6; 1978-79: 232.5; 1979-80: 290.1; 1980-81: 309.5; 1981-82: 320 (estimated).
(3) Yes.
(a) Sixty-two professional and technical AAEC staff have recently transferred to the CSIRO Division of Energy Chemistry. It has also been agreed to transfer from the AAEC to CSIR0 ceiling and salary cover to the extent of 80 positions to provide support to this Division and other CSIRO research activities at Lucas Heights; negotiations are proceeding to identify these positions. In terms of the Division of Energy Chemistry, the estimated equivalent support to be transferred will correspond to 43 positions.
(b) No: staff transfers from the AAEC were not finalised during 1981, but by 30 June 1982 such transfers will account for the bulk of the increase in energy research staff levels over those pertaining at 30 June 1981. The full effect of transfers from the AAEC to CSIRO on CSIRO energy research manpower will not be manifest until the 1982-83 financial year.

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2495

(I) Both the Australian National Railways Commission and myself have received representations on a number of occasions concerning a proposal to operate a tourist passenger train in Tasmania between Launceston and Hobart.
The question of operating a tourist passenger train must be one for the commercial and technical judgment of the Commission. As I advised you on 14 January 1982, the Commission decided that it would not consider the operation of a tourist passenger service at this time.
(2) The basis for the Commission's decision was that the operation of tourist services could not be considered at least until after the completion of the rehabilitation of the track in the proposed operating area. The track is being upgraded under the Commonwealth funded Tasmanian Track Rehabilitation Program. This section of the track is currently not suitable for the operation of passenger services.
I am sure the Commission will be prepared to review this proposal once rehabilitation of the railway line between Launceston and Hobart has been completed. You may rest assured that the Commission is aware of the Commonwealth Government's publicly expressed support for the development of tourism.

Answers to Questions

Marine Oil Pollution
(Question No. 4033)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 24 February 1982:
(I) Is it a fact that the package of laws which received royal assent on 14 April 1981, and which are aimed at providing increased protection to Australia's sea and coastal environment from marine oil pollution, are ineffective in dealing with oil spills which occur within State coastal waters.
(2) It is also a fact that although the new legislation mentioned in part (I) has raised the maximum fine for oil pollution offences from $50,000 to $100,000, no fine will be imposed and no compensation is being sought by the Federal Government in respect of oil spill clean-up measures and assistance provided to the Queensland Government after the recent grounding of the Anro Asia off Caloundra.
(3) Will immediate steps be taken to ensure that the Federal Government is not powerless to intervene in actual or threatened oil pollution offences should a vessel like the Anro Asia endager the Great Barrier Reef or adjacent waters.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The package of laws are not yet in force but are expected to be proclaimed by the end of the year. The laws make provision for civil liability for oil pollution damage, protection of the sea from pollution by oil discharged from ships and will provide wider powers of intervention in threatened or actual cases of ship sourced pollution. The laws have been drafted in accordance with the terms of the offshore constitutional settlement between the Commonwealth and the States and Northern Territory and contain provisions preserving the operation of State law but in the absence of such State or Northern Territory legislation the Commonwealth Acts will apply. The Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960 and Part VilA of the Navigation Act 1912 which currently deal with these matters will be repealed and replaced by the new legislation.
(2) The Anro Asia incident occurred within the limits of the Port of Brisbane and State legislation is applicable. The measures taken to minimise pollution from oil released during the incident were under the direct control of the Port of Brisbane Authority and the decision concerning litigation and the possible imposition of a fine upon the vessel's owners rests with that Authority. Steps have been taken to recover costs incurred by the Commonwealth in providing assistance to the State authority with the clean-up operation.

Defence: Capital Facilities
(Question No. 4070)
Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 February 1982:
(I) What proportion of the $179m to be spent on capital facilities for Defence purposes is proposed for expenditure in (a) Western Australia, (b) Northern Territory and (c) North Queensland.
(2) Within the framework of points IS and 16 of the Department of Defence release of Friday, 19 February, on Defence Expenditure Restraints, which states that commitments are not to be entered into in respect of major capital equipment, and major capital facilities and that only essential minimum expenditure is to be incurred on certain purchases and maintenance works, what reductions in that expenditure are anticipated in (a) the areas named in part (I) and (b) the rest of Australia.
(3) What developments of capital facilities in Western Australia have been delayed or cancelled as a result of the announced defence expenditure restraints or any other recent defence review.
Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The 1981-82 Budget provided for the following expenditure on significant Defence capital facilities in Western Australia, Northern Territory and North Queensland:

(3) Wide power currently exists in Part VilA of the Navi-
gation Act, 1912, for the Minister to intervene in any actual or threatened oil pollution incident which affects or is likely to affect Australian coastal waters, any part of the Australian coast or any Australian reef. The Minister is empowered to
either require action to be taken by the ship-owner which will efectively prevent or minimise further pollution or to arrange for such action to be taken where the owner fails to respond to the Minister's directions. This legislation was specifically introduced as a result of the tanker Oceanic Grandeur grounding in the Torres Strait in 1970 and presenting a pol-
lution threat to the Great Barrier Reef area. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981, when proclaimed, will, to the extent that the State Governments have not legislated on the matter in accordance with the terms of the
offshore constitutional settlement, extend the powers of intervention in any threatened or actual pollution incident to include intervention not only in the case of oil pollution but also pollution by specified noxious liquid substances.

Total

. -.5

(b) A reduction of $19.5m is expected in 1981-82 expenditure on Defence capital facilities in the rest of Australia.

(3) No approved Defence capital facilities in Western Australia have been cancelled as a result of the announced expenditure restraint or other recent defence review. Future
rates of expenditure on Defence capital facilities will depend on funds availiable at the time and other priorities.

Departmental Travel
(Question No. 4100)
Mr Morris asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Is it a fact that, as claimed by the Australian Federation of Travel Agents Ltd in its recent brochure, (a) the Minister

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2497

has stated that the present long standing policy in respect of travel arranged for departmental personnel is working well, (b) departments are allowed to have their own travel sections in which travel expertise is not necessarily the hallmark, (c) one department has 2 sections handling travel arrangements for its personnel and (d) Government travel employees do not always (i) know of the concession fares that are available and (ii) make airline reservations sufficiently in advance to qualify for reduced fares.
(2) Is it also a fact that no Federal agency exists to coordinate group reservations for Federal employees attending conferences or those sharing common departures and destinations to obtain the benefits of group travel concessions.
(3) What information is the Minister able to provide on (a) the accuracy or otherwise of the contents of the brochure being exhibited by AFTA and (b) the additional costs that would be incurred by Government if all departmental travel were to be arranged through members of AFTA.
Mr Howard-The Minister for Finance has provided the following information in answer to the honourable member's question:
(I), (2) and (3) 1 refer the honourable member to the response 1gave to a question without notice on this matter on 24 February 1982 (Senate Hansard, page 393).
Australian National Railways
(Question No. 4101)
Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Further to his answer to Question No. 3599 (Hansard, 16 February 1982, pages 154-5), (a) where in answer to part (I) is there reference to any cuts already made or planned to the tea and sugar services provided by the Australian National Railways Commission, (b) what specific changes have been made or are planned to the tea and sugar services and (c) has there been a full investigation, along the lines of the answers to parts (2) to (5), into the alternative transport services available and social implications of cutting the tea and sugar services to country people along the trans-continental railway.
(2) Will he establish a public investigation into any alterations of the tea and sugar services to allow any interested parties to make submissions and to permit public disclosure and debate of the rationale behind any service alterations.

(3) Will he direct the Australian National Railways Commission to maintain the tea and sugar services if a public investigation considers them socially desirable and consequently fund any associated loss to the Commission as a result of its public service obligations in this regard.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) (a) The Tea and Sugar train is an internal service provided by Australian National Railways for the benefit of its employees. Consequently, it was not mentioned in answer to Question No. 3599 (Hansard, 16 February 1982, pages 154-5).
(b) The Tea and Sugar train originally serviced 29 feUler camps. The number has been reduced to 18. It is anticipated that eventually there will be four such camps situated at Zanthus, Tarcoola, Cook and Rawlinna. The train will continue to service non-employees when it is required to stop for operational reasons.
(c) No. The Tea and Sugar is an internal service provided for the benefit of AN employees. Alternative transport services are available to these people other than AN employees who have in the past been able to avail themselves of the services provided by Tea and Sugar.
(2) No. Such an investigation would not be appropriate.
(3) See answer to (2).
Australian National Railways Passengers
(Question No. 4102)
Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
In respect of each of the following rail services, (a) Indian Pacific (both Sydney-Perth and Perth-Sydney), (b) Trans-Australian (both Adelaide-Perth and Perth-Adelaide, including separate figures for coach class sitting passengers) and (c) The Ghan (both Adelaide-Alice Springs and Alice SpringsAdelaide, including separate figures for the old and new service), (i) how many (A) single train trips were made and (B) passengers were carried and (ii) what was the average (A) number of passenger per trip, (B) capacity utilisation for each trip, (C) number of full fare paying passengers per trip (adults and children) and (0) number of pensioners per trip for each year 1975-76 to 1980-81.

(ii) (C) and (D) These ANRC activities are integrated with those of other railway systems, and the passenger counts include some pass-holders who are unable to be separated from fare-paying passengers. As bookings may be made at places other than ANRC offices, it is not possible to segregate travellers into the categories requested in (ii) (C) and (D).
Equal Employment Opportunities: Department of Education
(Question No. 4136)
Mrs Kelly asked the ~inister for Education, upon notice, on 9 ~arch 1982:
(I) Does the Minister's Department have an equal employment opportunities program; if so, (a) how long has the program been in existence, (b) what are the aims of the program, (c) what is the Department's assessment of the success of the program in achieving its aims, (d) how have, or are, the aims of the program been, or being, met, (e) is the

program aimed at covering the whole Department, or merely a section of it, (f) what are the procedures for union consultation and involvement in the program, (g) what involvement does the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau of the Public Service Board have in the program, and (h) has the program changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.
(2) If there is no program, on what basis was this decision reached.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is a follows:
(I) No.
(2) Although a specific equal opportunity program is not in operation, my Department, in accordance with Government and Public Service Board policies, adheres to a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for all persons employed or seeking employment within the Department.
Rather than directing effort to individual programs or tasks, the approach has been to foster and encourage equal employment opportunity as an important and integral part of the personnel management function. Equitable treatment of individuals and non-discrimination are inherent in my Department's processes of staff recruitment and selection, staff development and application of employment conditions.
In terms of the employment of women, an analysis of Public Service Act staffing statistics contained in the Public Service Board's Annual Report 1980-1981 gives an indication of my Department's commitment to the policy of equal employment opportunity. This analysis shows that my Department compares most favourably with the Australian Public Service (APS) as a whole in the employment of women, in fact, in round figures, 51 per cent of departmental staff are women compared with 35 per cent APS as a whole. A breakdown of these figures within the divisional structure is given below.

In connection with the employment of disabled persons, my Department has taken a substantial number of special placements of disabled persons during 1980 and 1981. In fact, in each of these years, my Department had the second highest total placement rate of any Department when compared with overall departmental staffing numbers.
As part of the Government's National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals within the APS, my Department has identified positions which would best be filled by people who know how to communicate with Aboriginals and have a knowledge of Aboriginal culture. Currently, there are 49 Aboriginals employed against these positions within the Department. The Clerk (Aboriginal Services) Program, which was introduced in 1981, aims to encourage people with these qualities to join the Service and my Department is one of four participating in the program.
My Department is participating in the Ethnic Liason Officer Scheme which was set up to ensure that account is taken of the special needs of migrants.
In conclusion, I can assure the honourable member that my Department has a policy of equal employment opportunity and its principles and practices are widely adopted throughout the Department.

Equal Employment Opportunities: Department of Transport
(Question No. 4137)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Does the Minister's Department have an equal employment opportunities program; if so, (a) how long has the program been in existence, (b) what are the aims of the program, (c) what is the Department's assessment of the success of the program in achieving its aims, (d) how have, or are, the aims of the program been, or being, met, (e) is the program aimed at covering the whole Department, or merely a section of it, (f) what are the procedures for union consultation and involvement in the program, (g) what involvement does the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau of the Public Service Board have in the program and (h) has the program changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.
(2) If there is no program, on what basis was this decision reached.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) My Department does have an equal employment opportunity program:
(a) The program commenced with the appointment of an Executive Officer (EEO) in July 1980.
(b) The aims of the program are to provide equality of employment opportunity and thus facilitate selection of the best person for the job. This program aims to

reflect the changes in educational opportu'nities, community attitudes and general employment patterns and the accompanying increased entry of members of minority groups in the Service.
(c) The Department's assessment is that the program is quite successful. An awareness of EEO principles and practices is spreading throughout the Department, and there is a consistent approach in the areas of recruitment and selection. Since the Secretary's call in 1975 for a study of the position of women in the Department and the subsequent launching of the Women in Transport Project, the concept of EEO in the Department has broadened to cover all aspects.
(d) The initiatives undertaken as part of the EEO program include a departmental statement on EEO, the incorporation of a statement of EEO principles into the departmental selection guidelines, lectures on the subject of EEO to trainees at the department's Central Training College as resources permit, a revision of recruitment literature to encourage both men and women to apply for all positions, the Women in Transport Project, a departmental statement on sexual harassment, the implementation of the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals and the Ethnic Liaison Officer Scheme and departmental participation in the Special Placements Scheme.
(e) The EEO program covers the whole Department. Responsibility for policy analysis and co-ordination rests with Central Office, while the Regions are expected to absorb the resultant practices into their current systems. Staff counsellor positions in Central Office and the Regions will incorporate much of the responsibility for EEO functions. EEO is viewed as a departmental activity relating to all staff and all relevant aspects of departmental functioning.
(f) Little formal requirement has been found for union consultation and involvement in this program, although some matters, such as the Sexual Harassment Statement, have been referred for information to all unions represented in the Department. The Department is also represented on the Joint Council Subcommittee on Women in the Service.
. (g) Close liaison is maintained with the EEO Bureau of the Public Service Board. Officers of this Department have been invited by the PSB to speak at seminars on EEO.
(h) The program has not changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.
Disarmament
(Question No. 4199)
Mr Morris asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 March 1982.
(I) Has he received 5 petitions from women of the Uniting Church, East Lake Macquarie Parish Fellowship and their friends relating to his Government's allocation to disarmament activities.
(2) If so, were 30c stamps to the value of$18.90 attached to the petitions; if so, will he advise the purpose to which the stamps were applied.
(3) What action has his Government initiated (a) for the conduct of a public education program on the dangers of the arms race and (b) to establish a Disarmament Branch in the Department of Foreign Affairs or Peace Studies Institute similar to the Swedish International Peace Research Institute.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

2500 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

(I) Yes. In addition, a sixth petition with stamps to the value of $0.90 was received, sponsored by the same group.
(2) Yes. The six petitions, together with the stamps, were returned to the first signatory of each petition so that the petition could be presented to Parliament by the local member.
(3) See answers to Question Nos. 958 and 1036 in House of Representatives Hansard. 5 May 1981, page 2006-7 and Senate Hansard. 14 October 1981, page 1240 respectively.
Free HeaIth Care
(Question No. 4213)
Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 18 March 1982:
Further to his answer on access to free health care (Hansard. 10 September 1981, pages 1163-4), do ex-servicemen get free health care for all their medical and hospital treatment; if so where.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
Medical and hospital treatment at the expense of the Department of Veterans' Affairs is available to entitled beneficiaries for all conditions accepted as service-related.
Free treatment is also available to entitled beneficiaries through the Department of Veterans' Affairs to~
veterans in receipt of a disability pension at or above the 100 per cent General Rate;
veterans and mariners receiving an addition to pension for amputation or loss of vision;
veterans of the Boer War; veterans and nurses who served in the 1914-18 War; veterans or Australian mariners who were prisoners of war; veterans who were receiving disability pensions for pulmonary tuberculosis prior to 2 November 1978; certain war widows and dependent children; veterans receiving service pensions, provided the veterans' incomes are within the limits imposed for fringe benefits; veterans suffering from a malignant cancer.
Vietnam veterans who are not otherwise entitled under Repatriation provisions or who are non-insured or nondisadvantaged may receive urgent treatment at Repatriation General Hospitals at no cost to them. Vietnam veterans in these categories in country areas can receive urgent treatment in a country hospital and refer the costs to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The wives and children of Vietnam veterans may, on referral from the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, receive urgent treatment in Repatriation General Hospitals, where the hospitals have facilities to treat them.
(a) Orroral Valley~

Repatriation facilities are maintained by the Department of Veterans' Affairs primarily for the treatment of its entitled beneficiaries. These facilities include an acute-care general hospital in each State capital city as well as auxiliary hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, for convalescent care. Treatment may also be obtained by beneficiaries at Departmental expense in certain circumstances in non-departmental institutions including country hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes. Treatment in metropolitan public hospitals requires the prior approval of the Department, except in an emergency.
A full range of medical, dental and allied health treatment is also available to Repatriation patients through community facilities. Entitled beneficiaries may obtain treatment from general practitioners who participate in the Department's Local Medical Officer Scheme. A Local Dental Officer Scheme operates along similar lines. Participants in these Schemes may arrange or recommend referrals for specialised treatment, for example, to a physiotherapist or, to domiciliary nursing services for the provision of a rehabilitation aid such as a wheelchair or surgical appliance.

Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable members's question is as follows:
(I) Two fishing boats, Temptation and Tsarina, where hired on a bare boat charter, for employment by the Orange Maritime Commander as Intelligence Gathering Vessels (AGI). The cost of the charter was $17,000. Both boats were manned by naval personnel.
(2) No.
Defence Force Recruitment of Apprentices
(Question No. 4348)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) Have the RAAF and the Army been unable to recruit the authorised number of apprentices; if so, (a) in what area have recruits not been available and (b) what is the reason for the failure of these Services to fill these positions.
Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) With the exception of electronic trainees, the Army and Air Force have been able to recruit the authorised number of apprentices.
(2) The new Air Force category of Technologist Apprenticeship failed to attract a full quota in its first entry which was January 1982. Some of the shortfall was taken up with addtional trade apprentices.
(3) The problem is one of obtaining a share of the supply relating to a particular trade for which there is high demand throughout the Australian employment market.

CSIRO Review of Water Resources Research
(Question No. 4460)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 27 April 1982:
(I) Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization began an examination of its research role for the Murray-Darling Basin some months prior to the public announcement of the study on 22 March 1982.
(2) Is it also a fact that the final report of the CSIRO Review of Water Resources Research, which he forwarded to me in a letter dated I March 1982, makes no recommendation or any other reference to this examination by the CSIRO of its research role in the Murray-Darling Basin; ifso, why.

(3) Is it a fact that the study team which is examining the CSIRO's research role in the Murray-Darling Basin has undertaken not to cover those aspects presently being examined by other bodies such as the River Murray Commission; if so, has the approval of the relevant State authorities and the River Murray Commission been obtained by the study team for these aspects to be covered in its work.
(4) Has the Government made any commitment to fund CSIRO research into problem areas identified by the study team; if not, why not.
(5) Has he concluded his discussions with the Minister for National Development and Energy referred to in his answer to part (3) of question No. 3833 (Hansard, 18 February 1982, page 412); if so, what decisions have been taken on CSIRO reorganisation referred to in his answer; if not, when will discussions be concluded.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2503

(I) Yes; my announcement described the aims of the study and indicated how interested persons and organisations could contact the study team.
(2) Yes; the report of the CSIRO Review of Water Resources Research identifies priority areas for future CSIRO research, the resources required to undertake this work and organizational and co-ordinator arrangements. These priority areas were listed in the answer to Part 2 of Question on Notice 3833 (Hansard, 18 February 1982, Page 412), namely:
catchment hydrology salinity and other quality aspects, and groundwater
The Murray-Darling Basin Study is expected to yield a framework for possible research in these (and perhaps other) fields in that particular region. Current CSIRO research in the water resources field is detailed in the booklet 'Directory of CSIRO Research Programs'.
(3) Yes; the approval of the relevant State authorities and the River Murray Commission has been obtained by consultation.
(4) No; the study team plans to complete its report by midJuly 1982 and to COnvene a public conference later in the year to discuss its findings. CSIRO will subsequently use the outcome of the study and the conference as an input to its budgetary considerations.
(5) No; discussions are continuing and will be completed as soon as possible.
National Representative Basins Program
(Question No. 4461)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 27 April 1982:
Further to the answer to Question No. 4040 (Hansard, \0 March 1980, page 850) relating to the winding up of the Australian Representative Basins Program, (a) where will the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's funds and members of staff connected with the project now be directed, (b) what was the cost involved in the scheme and (c) what sum has been saved as a consequence of the winding up of the project.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) While the review of the Representative Basins Program recommended that this program be discontinued as a separate exercise, a section of the continuing National Water Resources Assessment Program retains the essential elements of the original Representative Basins Program.
It is CSIRO's intention to continue to undertake research relating to the program and the problems of delineating hydrological provinces. This work will be undertaken in full consultation with the various bodies of the Australian Water Resources Council. The CSIRO commitment also involves the maintenance of a data bank containing information from State water agencies and the Bureau of Meteorology.
(b) The number of scientists involved in the research referred to in (a) varies from time to time. The 1981-82 level of activity involves a commitment in salaries and operating of $260,000. This includes the costs associated with the updating and maintenance of this data bank which are estimated to be $5,000 per annum.
(c) In the light of the answers to (a) and (b) the matter of savings does not arise. Catchment hydrology is a priority area for expansion of CSIRO's water research as indicated in my answer to Parliamentary Question 3822 (Hansard, 18 February 1982, page 412).

Builders Labourers Federation
Mr Viner-On 25 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1400) Mr Birney asked me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following question without notice:
In view of the refusal by a certain Mr Gallagher and other members dof the Builders Labourers Federation to give evidence to the royal commission inquiring into the activities of that union, is the Government considering initiating contempt proceedings against them? If so, in view of the fact that some eight weeks or so have expired since the matter was referred to the Attorney-General by the royal commissioner, when can a decision be expected?
The Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:
On 5 March 1982 the Attorney-General for the State of Victoria instituted proceedings against nine persons (including Mr N. L. Gallagher) for breaches of section 19 of the Evidence Act 1958 of the State of Victoria alleging that each of those persons refused or failed to answer questions touching the subject matter of the inquiry by Mr J. S. Winneke, QC., under his Victorian Letters Patent. On 2 April 1982 each of the defendants was found guilty of the offences charged and was fined a total of $500; in default a day's imprisonment for each fine. For example, Mr Gallagher was fined $100 in respect of each of 5 refusals to answer so that in default he would be liable for up to five days imprisonment. The Court granted a stay until 30 April 1982 because Counsel for the defendants indicated to the Court that the matter would go further. The defendants applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against their convictions. On 28 April 1982, the High Court granted special leave to appeal but dismissed all appeals. It would not be appropriate to take proceedings under Commonwealth law in respect of the same conduct for which the defendants have been convicted under State law (see Crimes Act 1914, s.II).
Review of Commonwealth Functions: Implementation of Decisions
(Question No. 3161)
Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 17 September 1981:
(I) As Chairman of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, has he been overseeing the implementation of the Review's decisions; ifso, is a progress report to be presented by the Government detailing the results of its significant and far reaching undertaking.
(2) Is he able to report on progress to date in implementing the decisions taken by the RCF relating to primary industry; if so, what specific action has been taken towards implementing the 13 decisions listed on pages 30 and 31 of the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions (Hansard, 30 April 1981, page 1847).
(3) What have been the monetary: (a) gains and (b) costs to Government from implementation of the decision listed on pages 30 and 31.
(4) What contribution has implementation of the 13 decisions listed under Primary Industry made to increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need.

(4) The reference in the Prime Minister's Ministerial Statement to establishing conditions under which there could be increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need clearly related to the wider perspective. The Statement made it clear that the immediate aims were to streamline and fine-down Commonwealth operations by withdrawing from functions more appropriately handled by the States or private enterprise and rationalising functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth.
Cash Packaging of Salaries: Department of Social Security
(Question No. 3868)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) What was the cost of cash packaging for salary payments in each of the departments and statutory authorities under the Minister's jurisdiction in each year since 1976-77.
(2) What is the estimated saving on cash packaging charges for salary payments in each department and statutory authority under the Minister's jurisdiction in the 1981-82 financial year due to the elimination of cash payments to staff.
(3) Which industrial payrolls are still being paid by cash in each of the departments and statutory authorities under the Minister's jurisdiction.
(4) What is the charge for cash packaging of these salaries.
(5) How many staff positions in each of the departments and statutory authorities under the Minister's jurisdictions have been abolished due to the elimination of cash payments.
(6) Are any fees paid to (a) building societies, (b) banks and (c) credit unions for carrying out salary transactions by each of the departments and statutory authorities under the Minister's jurisdiction.
(7) Has any study been conducted by any of the departments and statutory authorities under the Minister's jurisdiction as to the effect on private enterprise security organisations and cash packaging organisations of the elimination of cash salary payments; if so, what were the results of each of these studies.
Mr Viner-I refer the honourable member to the answer provided by the Minister for Finance to question No. 3866 (Hansard 9 March 1982, page 739).
Discrimination against Intellectually Handicapped People: Legal Rights
(Question No. 3936)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
Has the Attorney-General caused any research to be carried out on discrimination against intellectually handicapped people in respect of their legal rights; if so, what are the details.
Mr Viner-The Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:
This matter is primarily one of State concern and the honourable member may be aware of recent studies undertaken in a number of States in this area. In addition the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is currently conducting

a study on the problems of intellectually handicapped persons.
In regard to the Commonwealth's own jurisdiction, my Department has undertaken some preliminary research on this matter principally in the course of providing advice and assistance to various Government bodies during the International Year of Disabled Persons. My Department is continuing its work in this area. The honourable member is also no doubt aware that under the Human Rights Commission Act 1981 two of the points of reference for the Commission in the exercise of its functions are the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons.
De Facto Relationships
(Question No. 3941)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the criteria used by the Department of Social Security to determine a de facto relationship when investigating claims for benefits.
(2) If so, why has his Department adopted different criteria for determining de facto relationships when an immigrant applies for either (a) extended stay, (b) permanent residency or (c) citizenship.
(3) What are the details of investigation procedures used to determine whether a couple is living in a de facto relationship.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) The criteria used by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for determining de facto relationships in applications involving (a) extensions of stay and (b) change of status to permanent resident do not differ significantly from those used by the Department of Social Security for these applications. A bona-fide de facto relationship is regarded in the same way as a married relationship. Because a de facto relationship comes within the range of concessions for family migration, applicants' bona-fides must be verified.
There is no provision in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 for the de facto spouse of an Australian citizen to apply or be considered for the grant of citizenship on the basis of that relationship alone. Therefore no criteria have been developed to determine the genuineness of de facto relationships in relation to applicants for grant of Australian citizenship. (A de facto spouse can, however, qualify as an individual in his or her own right for the grant of citizenship.)
(3) Investigation of claimed de facto relationships is carried out by means of a discreet interview with the family unit concerned, at which time documentary or other evidence of the relationship may be sought. The type of supporting evidence which may be considered includes:
joint bank accounts;
common place of abode and length of relationship; joint ownership/lease of property or dwelling; public awareness of a husband/wife relationship; use of a common name; birth certificate of any children born during the period of the relationship showing the name of both parents.
Although not the principal determinant of recognition, the reasons why the couple have not married are also taken into consideration.

Answers to Questions

Conversion of Vehicles to LPG Usage
(Question No. 3975)
Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 18 February 1982:
(I) Has the LPG Task Force completed its examination into the slump in conversions of motor vehicles to liquid petroleum gas; if so, what are the Task Force's findings and recommendations.
(2) What new initiatives are proposed by the Government to promote greater use of LPG in vehicles.
(3) Has there been any recovery in the rate of conversion of vehicles to LPG in the past year.
Mr Anthony-The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) No; the Task Force has a continuing role in monitoring the rate of conversion of motor vehicles to LPG.
(2) The Commonwealth Government has taken several initiatives to encourage greater use of LPG in motor vehicles. These include the abolition of road tax on LPG fuel, abolition of sales tax on conversion equipment and the extablishment of a pricing policy for LPG which is designed to ensure that it remains attractively priced relative to other transport fuels. The Commonwealth has also embarked on a program to convert a large number of its own fleet to LPG over the next three years.
No further initiatives are proposed at this stage.
(3) Sales of LPG for automotive purposes have increased by about 40 per cent over the 12 months to 31 December 1981 and demand for conversion remains steady. Major distributors foresee further market expansion, especially if motor manufacturers implement plans to offer LPG options on new vehicles.
Equal Employment Opportunities: Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
(Question No. 4139)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Does the Minister's Department have an equal employment opportunities program; if so, (a) how long has the program been in existence, (b) what are the aims of the program, (c) what is the Department's assessment of the success of the program in achieving its aims, (d) how have, or are, the aims of the program been, or being, met, (e) is the program aimed at covering the whole Department, or merely a section of it, (f) what are the procedures for union consultation and involvement in the program, (g) what involvement does the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau of the Public Service Board have in the program and (h) has the program changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.
(2) If there is no program, on what basis was this decision reached.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) No.
(2) Separately identifiable programs can be resource consuming and the Department has not considered this to be necessary given the strongly supportive attitude of senior management towards equal employment objectives and the

measures taken to put these into effect. For instance the Department is endeavouring to maximise opportunities for female officers to gain experience in different work areas (including overseas service), to participate in training and development programs and to be represented on staff selection committees. (The honourable member may be aware of the fact that the Department's newly appointed ACT Regional Director is a female officer.) A number of handicapped persons have been placed with the Department and particular interest is taken in helping to develop their self reliance and job fulfilment. The Department is also currently negotiating an exchange with a view to providing an Aboriginal officer in another authority with a developmental opportunity in Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. As is appropriate the Department has a significant proportion of overseas born staff members; a recent survey of staff in the Melbourne office indicated that 42 per cent of all staff in that office were overseas born.
Citizenship Ceremonies
(Question No. 4169)
Mr Milton asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on II March 1982:
(l) How many citizenship ceremonies were conducted in each State and Territory of the Commonwealth in 1980 and 1981 and what was their cost to the Commonwealth Government.
(2) Will he consider reimbursing costs incurred by local municipalities in relation to citizenship ceremonies; if not, why not.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The following Departmental and Municipal ceremonies were conducted in 1980 and 1981.

The above figures do not include private ceremonies conducted by Departmental officers, or some small ceremonies conducted by Municipalities in remote areas of Australia.
Information on cost to the Commonwealth of the conduct of citizenship ceremonies is not available. For Departmental ceremonies, the costs are minimal in money terms but involve the deployment of officers from other duties. Some staffing assistance has been given to some Municipalities to assist them in the conduct of ceremonies. This has involved clerical, travel, overtime and other miscellaneous costs.
(2) The Commonwealth does not specifically reimburse costs incurred by local municipalities in conducting citizenship ceremonies and it is not considered appropriate to do so. General purpose assistance to local governments by the Commonwealth totalled $300,786,000 in 1980-81 and $350,866,000 in 1981-82. These funds may be spent by local

authorities in accordance with the priorities determined by each authority.
Moreover, it is as important to local government as to Federal and State levels of government, that eligible residents of Australia should become citizens and be aware of the nature and role of government in Australia. Citizenship involves acceptance into the community of additional equal partners with full political rights and attendant privileges and responsibilities. A public citizenship ceremony wherein the individual affirms his commitment and sense of belonging and the community, through its elected representatives, formally welcomes and accepts the new citizen, is particularly appropriate. The majority of new citizens-to-be also think so as some two-thirds of the approved candidates choose to have citizenship formally conferred in the municipality where they reside, pay rates, have most immediate and frequent contact with government at the local level and where they experience their sense of belonging and community. Many local councils welcome the opportunity of conducting citizenship ceremonies for these reasons.
Uniform Penal Code
(Question No. 4218)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 18 March 1982:
(I) Does the Attorney-General intend to set up within the Australian Capital Territory a Sentencing Council as it affects Commonwealth law and as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission.
(2) If so, will he as a matter of priority obtain the views of the State Attorneys-General on the possibility of drafting a model penal code in an effort to obtain uniformity in the definition and treatment of serious criminal offences.
(3) Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to differences between the State and Federal law that have made it a problem for adequate police co-operation to be developed in dealing with serious crime, such as terrorism, offences arising out of drug trafficking and organised crime.
(4) Is this much needed reform a constructive measure to minimise areas of dispute existing throughout Australia.
Mr Viner-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) I have written to the State and Northern Territory Attorneys-General proposing the establishment of a Sentencing Council. The proposal envisages that the Council would consist of Federal, State and Territory judges and that the Australian Capital Territory would be represented on such a Council.
(2) Although the specific functions of the proposed Council have yet to be agreed upon, I would see, as the prime purpose of the Council, promotion of greater consistency and uniformity in the sentencing of offenders throughout Australia. Establishment of a model penal code would of course be outside the responsibilities of the Council.
(3) Differences in State and Federal criminal laws and procedures have in the past created problems for effective law enforcement. The Commonwealth and the States have, however, taken a number of co-operative measures to ensure that, in appropriate circumstances, the full resources of Commonwealth and State law enforcement and security agencies are effectively utilised. The obvious example is the current joint Commonwealth/State Royal Commissions which are serviced by police officers from both jurisdictions. In addition, several

Commonwealth/State Police Task Forces on Drug Trafficking have been established in recent years. Another example is the joint security arrangements for the 1981 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.
(4) Establishment of the Sentencing Council is regarded as a particularly constructive reform.
Civil Marriage Celebrants
(Question No. 4272)
Mr Free asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:
Further to the reply to question No. 3917 Hansard. 24 March 1982, page 1388), (a) has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to population growth in the cities of Penrith and Blue Mountains since the last appointments in 1975 and 1979 respectively and (b) what action does the Attorney-General plan to meet increased demand for the services of civil marriage celebrants in those cities.
Mr Viner-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(a) The population growth in the areas concerned has been noted. The estimated combined population of Penrith and Blue Mountains is in the order of 170,000.
(b) The availability of five civil celebrants in an area of this size and population compares favourably with the position in broadly comparable areas elsewhere in Australia. Figures supplied by those celebrants-as well as several other celebrants living in close proximity to the area-indicate that the level of demand for their services is currently being met quite adequately. The demand, as reflected in those figures, is continually monitored and additional celebrants will be authorised if and when a need becomes apparent.
Research Centres of Excellence
(Question No. 4296)
Mr Barry Jones as~ed the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 25 March 1982:
(I) Further to his answer to question No. 2754 (Hansard. 23 March 1982, page 1300), what methods of evaluation did the members of the Commonwealth Research Centre of Excellence Committee adopt to choose the \0 successful applicants out of the 327 applications.
(2) In view of the committee's statement that it had deliberately chosen to support individuals who had demonstrated achievement in research, on what basis were these individuals chosen.
(3) Were all applicants interviewed; if not, on what basis were the personal qualities of the successful applicants assessed.
(4) Were any of the successful applicants known personally to members of the committee; if so, did committee members disqualify themselves from voting in those cases.
(5) As members of the committee were presumably given enough material to enable them to assess applicants for the Centres of Excellence scheme, will Members of Parliament be given enough material to enable them to assess the work of the committee; if not, why not.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) As explained in the report of the Commonwealth Centres of Excellence Committee, which I released on

2508 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

29 January 1982, the final recommendations of the Committee were based on a combination of academic advice, both from within Australia and from overseas, and on the Committee's own assessment in non-academic areas. Chapter 4 of the Committee's report deals with the selection process in some detail.
(3) No. Chapter 3 of the report contains a section which refers to the visits made by the Committee to those Centres for which it had sought international assessment. There is also reference to the important part which those visits played in the Committee's consideration of the capacity of the principal research workers as academic leaders, their organisational ability, their commitment to the program and their assessment of their own developmental potential.
(4) Because most of the applicants, both successful and unsuccessful, are prominent in their particular academic fields, a number of them would have been known to members of the Committee. I have been advised that the selection process was by consensus, and the question of disqualification was therefore never an issue.
(5) The report includes sufficient material to allow interested persons to assess the way in which the Committee approached its task.
Citizenship Ceremonies
(Question No. 4297)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 25 March 1982:
(I) How many officers of his Department have been involved in assisting local councils at citizenship ceremonies in each State and Territory.
(2) What amount of time, including overtime, expressed as a proportion of the working week of an officer so involved, is spent in assisting in arrangements for and attending these ceremonies.
(3) Has this assistance been withdrawn; if so, (a) what sum has his Department saved by this action, (b) how many representations against the decision have been made by councils and (c) will he reconsider the decision.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Where assistance at ceremonies has been provided between one and four officers have attended depending on the nature and size of the ceremony. Only a minority of Councils in Australia have sought the attendance of Departmental officers. Only in the Melbourne metropolitan area has it been common practice, until recently, for Departmental officers to attend many Council ceremonies as a matter of course.
(2) Officers of the Citizenship Section of the Department in each State and Territory engage in a variety of work to assist in the arrangements for Council citizenship ceremonies. This includes the preparation of lists of candidates and certificates of citizenship and associated documents. In some offices letters of invitation are prepared and sent to candidates. Attendance at ceremonies is usually on an overtime basis of three hours per officer but often time in lieu has been taken. The time taken to perform all these tasks has not been recorded. Consequently the information requested is not available.
(3) The regular attendance of Departmental officers at Council ceremonies in Victoria has been curtailed. This action brings Departmental assistance to Councils in Victoria in line with the practice in all other States and the Territories. Assistance at ceremonies in Victoria will continue in the case of

large ceremonies on special occasions. This is the practice in other States.
(a) This information is not available (see 2 above).
(b) 12 Victorian Councils have made representations.
(c) The decision has been taken following a review of how the Department can most effectively utilise resources allocated for citizenship purposes in Victoria. The decision has been reviewed on a number of occasions but no compelling reason has emerged to justify a return to the unique situation which until recently existed in Victoria (see also answer to Question No. 4169).
Immigration: Arrivals
(Question No. 4365)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) How many persons, as a result of a successful application to migrate to Australia have arrived in each State and Territory since December 1980.
(2) How many of these persons settled (a) privately and (b) in Government hostels upon arrival.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) & (2) A breakdown of persons who, following successful application to migrate arrived in Australia together with the number of these migrants entering Commonwealth Migrant centres in each State and Territory during the period I December 1981 and 31 January 1982 is shown in the following table.

Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2509

(a) The free-flow provisions of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement still apply for New Zealand citizens. From July 1981 such persons require a passport to establish their identity but not a visa. The number of settlers to arrive from I July 1981 to 31 January 1982 was 7,974.
(b) The number of Australian residents departing Australia with the stated intention of disembarking in New Zealand during the period I July 1981 to 31 October 1981 was:
(i) for a temporary stay: 62,777 (ii) for a permanent stay: 2,425.

Note I: The discrepancy between the number of total admissions to centres in 1978-79 (Table 2) and total arrivals for the period (Table I) arises from the inclusion in the former of persons who arrived without prior authority but were subsequently granted refugee status and admission to centres.
Note 2: The difference between the total number of Indo Chinese refugees arriving and those accommodated in migrant centres represents those who settled directly into the community through arrangements made privately or through the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme.

Tenosynoyitis: Department of Veterans' Affairs
(Question No. 4399)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(1) In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction, has there been (a) medical examinations of all workers and (b) an ergonomic assessment of the work process, tasks and work environment made by an

ergonomist in all areas where repetitious injuries, for example, tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome; have been reported; if not, why not.
(2) If so, (a) when were assessments made and (b) what recommendations were made.
(3) Have any recommendations made been carried out; if not, why not.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) The answer to Questions I (a) and (b) is no.
(2) The reported incidence of repetitious injuries such as tenosynovitis in the Department is low (only a total of 19 reported cases) and no comprehensive medical examinations beyond those included in the appointment process are conducted routinely. Medical examinations are, however, arranged when officers or employees report symptoms of apparently job-related illnesses.
(3) The significance of repetition strain injury as an occupational health problem has only recently been recognised. It is understood that the Department of Health is currently researching the problem and it is expected that a NH and MRC occupational health guide will be issued shortly. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will make every effort, subject to availability of resources, to comply with any recommendations by the NH and MRC.
(4) The wide range of occupations in which repetition strain injuries are reported would make a program of ergonomic assessment impracticable on economic and resource grounds. However, the Department is monitoring advice received from the Departments of Health, Housing and Construction and Science and Technology (Working Environment Division) on working environments where possible health hazards may exist, e.g. those involving screen-based equipment.
(5) In the design and equipping of work places, regard is had to standards and guidelines issued by the Department of Administrative Services, Department of Health and the Public Service Board, the NH and MRC and the Department of Science and Technology, the Standards Association of Australia and State and local government safety regulations.
Operation of Visual Display Units: Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
(Question No. 4419)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction, (a) what steps have been taken to make operators of visual display units and screen based equipment aware of the need for a sufficient break from operating this equipment, having regard to the nature of the task and the need for involvement in substantially different activities during the break, as per Public Service Board memorandum 81/418 entitled 'Operation of Visual Display Units and other Screen Based Equipment', (b) what percentage of

2512 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

their working day (i) are operators expected to spend on operating duties and (ii) do operators spend on other duties and (c) how many keystrokes per 7 hour 21 minute day (i) are operators expected to complete and (ii) do operators actually complete.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) All staff who operate visual display units and the screen based equipment within the Department are aware of their entitlements as operators of such equipment. It has been the practice of the Department to ensure all operators benefits and entitlements, in accordance with both Public Service Board guidelines and Union requirements, are communicated to the officers at the time of implementation of such equipment. In relation to the Department's recent computer acquisition, negotiations are currently underway with the APSA to ensure appropriate conditions apply for data processing operators.
(b) It is extremely difficult to determine a percentage for any particular working group (that is word processing operators and part time users of word processing or computer facilities) as the nature of their duties allows them to perform tasks other than screen operations in a normal working day, for example in word processing centres of the Department and its statutory authority operators spend most of their time at VDU screens, however they also carry out operation of word processing printers and other tasks between periods of screen based operations. Output is measured on a sectional basis rather than an individual basis.
(c) The only category in which keystrokes are measured is in the data processing area for input operators. Although no rigid departmental standards are imposed, they are expected to perform in accordance with Public Service standards for such a task.
Immigrants: Length of Stay in Hostels
(Question No. 4468)
Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:

(I) Has his attention been drawn to news reports that new immigrants will henceforth only be allowed to stay in migrant hostels for a maximum of 6 weeks (for English speaking migrants) and 20 weeks (for non-English speaking migrants) because of cutbacks consequent upon the Review of Commonwealth Functions.
(2) Is there any substance to these reports: ifso, (a) is this a dramatic change from the current policy of his Department under which immigrants are able to stay in migrant centres for a period of 12 months for married couples with children, 6 months for couples without children and 3 months for single people and (b) what is the justification for the suffering and difficulty which this new policy will create for newly arrived migrants.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) (a) This length of stay policy by and large reflects the length of stay decisions presently being taken by the occupants of migrant centres. The average length of stay nationally is 14.75 weeks. That is less than the implication of the broad policy position referred to in Part (I) of the question.
(b) The policy is to be implemented gradually and to be operated flexibly. The current long standing review arrangements are being modified to allow for extension of stay where individual or family circumstances warrant it. The operational usefulness of the policy will be kept under review.
Water Conservation
(Question No. 4476)
Mr West asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 27 April 1982:
What funds have been provided for water conservation projects by the Commonwealth in each year since 1977-78.
Mr Anthony-The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

Electorate Offices
(Question No. 4511)
Mr Holding asked the ~inister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 April 1982:
(I) What surveys of members' and senators' electorate offices have been carried out following the introduction of the Government's new immigration policy to determine the extent of the increased workload resulting from that policy.
(2) Have any of these surveys attempted to determine the extent of the increased workload resulting from unsuccessful applications for which in many cases no file may be raised in an electorate office.
(3) How many applications by State and Territory for (a) permanent resident status and (b) short-term visas have been received from 19 April 1982 to the date of preparation of the answer to this question.
(4) How many of the applications referred to in part (3) were (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful.
(5) Did electorate office staff, at the recent seminar conducted by his Department for briefing those staff on the new

policy, express concern that the new policy would result in an increased workload: if so. did senior departmental officers express agreement with this view in their response.
(6) If the surveys referred to in part (I) have not been conducted, will he now instruct his Department to carry them out, if not, why not.
Mr Macphee~ The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1), (2) and (6) No surveys have been carried out. The workload at Members' and Senators' electorate offices is a matter for the individual Members and Senators involved, not the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.
(3) and (4) Applications for permanent resident entry and short-term visas are lodged overseas, although sponsorship applications and applications for Change of Status are lodged in Australia. Reliable statistics on applications lodged after 19 April 1982 are not yet available. I will send the honourable member statistics as soon as they are available.
(5) Electorate staff expressed concern that the new policy would result in an increased workload. Senior Departmental officers agreed that, initially at least, more work would result in Australia. However the new system should not increase workloads in our overseas offices.

(I) Will regular reports be made available to Parliament on the activities of the Immigration Review Panel; if so, will those reports include detailed statistics on (a) the number of cases reviewed, (b) the number of applications rejected and the grounds for these rejections, and (c) the nationalities of the rejected applicants.
(2) Does his Department intend in due course to replace the current chairman of the Panel who has withdrawn from the Public Service with a judicial appointment.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) It is intended that the activities of the Immigration Review Panel will be reported to the Parliament regularly. Appropriate statistical tables will be included. The precise nature and extent of statistical breakdown in order to provide a meaningful report to the Parliament has not yet been finalised.
(2) Appointment of the Chairman of the Panel is at my own discretion. Initially I chose a senior departmental officer as Chairman because he has extensive experience in the review of adverse immigration decisions as well as being the officer who was responsible for the recent Regularisation of Status Program. It is open to me to vary the chairmanship after a suitable period for evaluation has elapsed. I do not see the Immigration Review Panel arrangement requiring that the chairmanship be restricted to a judicial appointee but do favour the appointment of an external Chairperson. This review procedure is intended to be non-legalistic and to provide an opportunity for people to have their applications reconsidered by a Panel drawn from various parts of the Australian community.
Repatriation Review Tribunal: Appeals
(Question No. 4578)
Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1982:
(I) What is the current delay in respect of appeals by veterans to the Repatriation Review Tribunal.

(2) Have there been increasing delays for cases; ifso, Why.
(3) If there are delays, what is the justification for releasing the President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal to conduct an inquiry into another Government department.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) and (2) See the Minister for Veterans' Affairs answer to Question No. 2069 which appeared in Hansard for the Senate on 4 May 1982.
(3) The President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal, Mr Francis Mahony, CB., OBE., was appointed to undertake the review of Customs Procedures in New South Wales because of his wealth of administrative experience in the Attorney-General's Department over many years and more recently the Repatriation Review Tribunal.
The Minister for Veterans' Affairs indicated in a News Release on 29 April 1982 that adequate arrangements to cover Mr Mahony's absence have been made to ensure that there will be no reduction in the service to veterans provided by the Tribunal. Mr Basil Virtue, a former Army Colonel, is to be appointed to act as President of the Tribunal during Mr Mahony's absence. Mr Virtue has been a member of Repatriation Tribunals for a number of years and has acted as President on previous occasions. The services of two part-time Deputy Presidents, Messrs B. A. Locke and A. G. Kno~, will also be available for this period.
'The Minister has also announced that a new position of Deputy President, to be located in Sydney, is expected to be filled soon.

Taxation: Interest Received by Credit Unions
(Question No. 2573)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:

(I) What was the cost of the exemption from tax provided to interest received by credit unions under section 23G of the
Income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1975-76 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.

(2) How long has this or similar provision existed in the

Act.

.

(3) What is the reason for providing this allowance.

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures the
total interest on loans received by credit unions in 1979-80
amounted to $229.6m. If this amount had been subject to tax at 46 per cent, the income tax payable would have been $105.6m. However, if this income had been assessable it would also have been necessary to allow deductions for outgoings such as interest on deposits, wages and salaries, administrative and other expenses.

Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the tax that would have been payable if the relevant rate of company income tax had applied to the excess of total income of credit
unions over their total expenses in respect of each of the income years from 1975-76 to 1979-80 would have been as set out below. The provisions by credit unions for income tax are also set out:

Taxation: Deductions for Gifts to Australiana Fund
(Question No. 2584)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:

(I) What was the cost of allowing a deduction for gifts of art and other property to the Australiana Fund, public Iibrary, museum or art gallery under section 78 (I) (aa) of the Income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1977-78 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.

(2) What is the reason for providing this allowance.

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) The cost to income tax revenue of allowing deductions under section 78 (I) (aa) of the Income Tax Assessment Act for gifts of art or other property to the Australiana Fund, public art galleries, libraries or museums in respect of 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 income years was estimated as follows:

Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: Costs
(Question No. 2647)
Mr Hayden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 18 August 1981:
(I) What is the expected total of (a) administrative and (b) meeting expenses associated with Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne for 1981-82.
(2) What is the expected detailed breakdown of these expenses.
(3) What expenses referred to in parts (I) and (2) will be reimbursed and by whom will they be reimbursed.
(4) What other expenses are expected to be incurred by the Australian Government in the conduct of the Meeting.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) to (4) Set out in the table below are CHOGM costs as now identified for my Department and other Departments. The figures incorporate some accounts expected but not yet received-nevertheless, while the figures are close to final, it must be understood that some accounts have yet to be rendered and others are subject to further examination. The figures will, however, give an indication of the total cost of CHOGM.
In addition to the expenditure indicated in the table, further costs were incurred by the departments referred to and by other departments in the ordinary course of their functions. It is not practicable to separate out and identify all of these costs.
Of the aggregate expenditure shown in the table, some $1.7m was spent from the PM & C vote on security, communications and other equipment. There is a residual value in this which is available for ongoing use, and there is also residual value of some $930,000 from the expenditures of other departments.
Overall, the expenditure on CHOGM was considerable. This was always to be expected. But the benefits also are considerable. The Prime Minister of India (who has offered her country as host for the next Meeting) has indicated that expenditure of this order is small compared with expenditure for destructive purposes and worthwhile in the pursuit of more constructive objectives. That is in the wider context. In more immediate terms, Australia gained directly from the good will and understanding which a significant portion of the world's national leaders and media representatives were able to gain only by their presence here, and from the way we treated them and how they observed us.

Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: Accommodation of Departmental Officers
(Question No. 2649)
Mr Hayden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 18 August 1981:
(I) How many officers of (a) his Department and (b) other Departments are expected to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne.
(2) What is the estimated total cost of accommodation for officers attending the Meeting.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) - 7 officers of my Department and 10 officers of other departments together with 4 non departmental advisers attended the Meeting as part of the Australian delegation. Their accommodation costs were met by the Commonwealth and amounted to $20,520.
Apart from these were the 77 members of the Task Force and 382 short term staff whose responsibilities were to make all the arrangements for the Meeting and service it, referred to in my answer to question No. 2648 by the honourable member (see Hansard p. 3115 of 18 November 1981). The aggregate accommodation cost of the delegates, Task Force and short term staff was about $470,000.
Overall, the expenditure on CHOGM was considerable. This was always to be expected. But the benefits also are considerable. The Prime Minister of India (who has offered her

country as host for the next Meeting) has indicated that expenditure of the order involved is small compared with expenditure for destructive purposes and worthwhile in the pursuit of more constructive objectives. That is in the wider concept. In more immediate terms, Australia gained directly from the good will and understanding which a significant portion of the world's national leaders and media representatives were able to gain only by their presence here, and from the way we treated them and how they observed us.
Commonwealth Bank in Aldwych, London, United Kingdom
(Question No. 3751)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) How many employees work in the Commonwealth Bank in Aldwych, London, UK.
(2) How many of these employees are Australian.
(3) How many (a) savings bank and (b) trading bank accounts are held at the branch.
(4) How does the number of employees in the Aldwych branch compare with branches in Australia with a comparable turnover.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Commonwealth Banking Corporation has advised that:
(I) As at 21 April 1982, there were 73 staff employed at the Corporation's Aldwych House branch, London.
(2) Three of these staff were Australian, recruited recently in line with the Corporation's practice of increasing the staff complement during the peak tourist season through employment of Australian staff travelling overseas on leave from the Corporation. 15 Australian staff were employed at Aldwych House branch on this basis during the 1981 tourist season. The Corporation has found that use of Australian staff in this manner has decided operational advantages.
(3) For commercial reasons the Corporation does not reveal the number of accounts at individual branches.
(4) It is not possible to draw a meaningful comparison in respect of staffing arrangements between Aldwych House branch and branches in Australia with comparable turnover because of the quite different nature of the business of Aldwych House branch; in particular, operations at Aldwych House centre, to a major extent, on serving the financial requirements of tourists.
Announcement ofIniatives: Department of Primary Industry
(Question No. 3895)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) Is it the normal procedure of the Minister's Department that announcements of actions being taken within certain electoral divisions which are likely to influence the livelihood of people within those divisions (such as the structural

changes to government works, grants made to schools, announcements affecting administration, staffing or funding of organisations) are made (a) by the Minister or (b) where the approved project concerned is located in a Government-held electoral division, by the local Liberal or National Country Party Members.
(2) What is the Department's practice regarding the announcement of such initiatives by Opposition Members.
(3) Has any attempt been made by (a) the Minister or (b) any member of the Department to deny to Opposition Members the same courtesy and right of a democratically elected representative as that accorded to a Government Member.
Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) I advise the honourable member that I have followed the practice of personally announcing Government initiatives within my portfolio. I should add that Primary Industry policy announcements have generally been of a national or regional nature and are not specific to an individual electoral division.
(2) and (3) As Minister for Primary Industry, I regard it as my duty and prerogative to announce Government decisions within my portfolio. I do not consider that it would be appropriate for any of these decisions to be announced by Opposition members.

Admiralty House and Kirribilli House

2415-2416). This was done because the question asked for
dates when persons stayed at these residences. On this occasion the question has been interpreted to cover day use as well as overnight stays and has been answered on this basis.

Corporal Punishment in Schools
(Question No. 3954)
Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the long standing prohibition on corporal punishment in schools in most European countries.
(2) Is he able to state whether any investigations into implementation of international declarations on the rights of children and the use of corporal punishment in schools are under way in Australia.
(3) Has he any evidence that there are practical, proven and humane alternatives to corporal punishment.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) I am not aware of any investigations of the kind referred to by the honourable member.

(3) There is a substantial body of literature on the subject of discipline in schools and recent reports in Australia have questioned the use of corporal punishment.
I am, for example, aware that last year in New South Wales the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Pupil Behaviour and Discipline in Schools was published under the title of 'Self-discipline and Pastoral Care'. The Committee had been established by the then NSW Minister for Education in 1978. The Committee found that many organisations and individuals had raised the issue of corporal punishment and that opinions on it were divided. The Committee recommended (inter alia) that 'schools devise a discipline policy in consultation with their school communities, to meet their particular needs and circumstances and that they give specific consideration to the question of abolishing the use of corporal punishment. '
In responding to the Report, Mr D. Swan, NSW Director General of Education, sent a memorandum to all Principals and Teachers-in-Charge requesting that all schools formulate a discipline policy or review existing policy in consultation with parents, staff and, where appropriate, with pupils. Schools were directed to forward copies of their policy to appropriate regional offices by 31 July 1982.
The Commonwealth's direct involvement in the administration of schools is limited to the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT Schools Authority communicated corporal punishment and detention guidelines to all ACT government schools in November 1979. The Authority urges schools to work towards the abolition of corporal punishment. It considers that many alternatives are available which are preferable and which are more likely to result in development of healthy social skills and the learning of adequate personal behaviour. In general it is intended that methods and procedures adopted by schools in the ACT in disciplining students should be an outgrowth of a particular school's philosophy, goals and procedures; the responsibility for methods used lies, therefore, within the school.
Education: Recurrent Expenditure
(Question No. 4089)
Mr Fry asked the Minister for Education the following question, upon notice, on 9 March 1982:
From figures derived from the annual returns to the Schools Commission, what is the recurrent expenditure per pupil in both (a) actual and (b) constant (at most recent date) prices for Government (i) primary and (ii) secondary schools in (A) Australia and (B) the ACT for each of the years 1972-73 to 1980-81.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
Because of difficulties in achieving adequate comparability in earlier years, figures for the ACT are only available from 1977-78 onwards. Again, because of comparability problems, the Commonwealth Schools Commission has used for comparative purposes, a six-State average rather than an Australian total including both Territories.

Equal Employment Opportunities: Department of Housing and Construction
(Question No. 4144)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Housing and Construction, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Does the Minister's Department have an equal employment opportunities program; if so, (a) how long has the program been in existence, (b) what are the aims of the program, (c) what is the Department's assessment of the success of the program in achieving its aims, (d) how have. or are, the aims of the program been, or being, met, (e) is the program aimed at covering the whole Department, or merely a section of it, (f) what are the procedures for union consultation and involvement in the program, (g) what involvement does the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau of the Public Service Board have in the program and (h) has the program changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.

(c) The EEO Policy Committee, established in December 1981 will monitor the progress of the equal employment opportunity policies and programs in the Department.
(d) Actions in accord with the aims of the program are coordinated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Unit to:
develop programs to implement EEO policies for women, Aboriginals, migrants and disabled persons employed by or seeking employment in the Department;
inform staff of Government and departmental equal employment opportunity policies and related matters;
monitor recruitment and promotion procedures to ensure that traditionally disadvantaged groups are not discriminated against;

(2) If there is no program, on what basis was this decision reached.
Mr McVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

encourage disadvantaged groups to undertake further education (e.g. study leave, sponsorships, internal training courses, Public Service Board work experience schemes, as appropriate) to improve their opportunities for promotion;

(I) Yes. The Department of Housing and Construction has an Equal Employment Opportunity Program:
(a) The Equal Employment Opportunity Program was established in December 1979.
(b) The Department of Housing and Construction's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policies, programs and practices aim to ensure that all people have an equal chance to compete for selection and promotion in the Department. This requires that all discriminatory barriers to particular groups or individuals be removed and may also mean that special programs be undertaken to enable groups or individuals suffering past disadvantages to compete on an equal basis with others.

promote mechanisms designed to increase the number of female technical/professional staff and apprentices in the Department through appropriate advertising and recruitment procedures;
ensure that disabled persons are not disadvantaged by the physical environment in which they work;
inform staff of departmental policy on sexual harassment and grievance procedures available to deal with complaints about sexual harassment and related matters, and to undertake counselling where appropriate.
(e) Whole Department.

(I) Has any decision been made regarding the Federal Government's contribution to Australia's bicentennial celebrations; if so (a) what amount is being allocated to (i) the Australian Bicentennial Authority and (ii) each State bicentennial committee and (b) what is (i) the identity of and (ii) the amount being allocated to individual projects in each State.
(2) lfnot, when will a decision be made.
Mr Wilson--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) Following the Government's further detailed consideration of the philosophy and overall strategy for Australia's bicentennial celebrations the Prime Minister made an announcement on these matters on 6 December 1981.
The Commonwealth Government will concentrate its efforts on national and international aspects-the national program involving people from every part of Australia right down to the local level, thus providing a celebration of

Australia, by Australians, for Australians. The Government also wishes to involve countries with which Australia has close ties such as migration, trade, sport and cultural links, and which would want to make their distinctive contributions to this Australian celebration.
The Government sees many possible bicentennial events and projects as being the responsibility of State and local government authorities, organisations and individuals in the community as well as the Commonwealth.
The only allocations to date have been to the Australian Bicentennial Authority for administrative purposes. There have been no allocations in respect of any projects .and events which might be included in the bicentennial celebrations.
The Australian Bicentennial Authority is preparing a program of possible projects and events for consideration by the Government later this year.
Housing Finance
(Question No. 4267)
Mr Uren asked the Minister for Housing and Construction, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:
(I) Does his Department have an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank whereby the Department has access to statistical tapes of housing finance transactions; if so, for how long and under what terms and conditions has the arrangement existed.
(2) Can he provide details for each State for each of the last 5 years of (a) the number of loans advanced to first home buyers, (b) the average loan amount of first home buyers, (c) the proportion of first home buyers who were (i) single and (ii) dual income applicants, (d) the proportion of (i) single and (ii) dual income applicants whose incomes were (A) below average weekly male gross earnings, (B) between 100% and 150% of average weekly male gross earnings and (C) above 150% of average weekly male gross earnings and (e) the proportion of applicants with (i) one child and (ii) 2 or more children for each of the categories in part (2) (d).
Mr McVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes, the Department of Housing and Construction does have an arrangement with the Commonwealth Savings Bank whereby that institution provides to the Department on a confidential basis limited data on housing finance transactions.
The Department has received the statistical tapes of a sample of housing finance transactions from the Commonwealth Bank on a regular basis since September 1978. These tapes are compiled specifically for the Department at a cost of $30 per tape.
The terms and conditions of this agreement between the Department and the Commonwealth Bank include:
The data are provided at the end of each quarter on a confidential basis;
the Department will be responsible for the arrangements and costs involved in converting tapes where necessary from one density to another;
where it is necessary to recreate a tape the cost of such recovery will be borne by the Department;
the Department will be responsible for the maintenance and replacement of magnetic tapes.
(2) No. All housing finance data available to the Department are provided on a confidential basis.

Tenosynovitis: Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
(Question No. 4377)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction, has there been (a) medical examinations of all workers and (b) an ergonomic assessment of the work process, tasks and work environment made by an ergonomist in all areas where repetitious injuries, for example, tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome, have been reported; if not, why not.
(2) If so, (a) when were assessments made and (b) what recommendations were made.
(3) Have any recommendations made been carried out; if not, why not.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) to (3) The only cases of repetition strain injuries reported in my Department and in statutory authorities within my portfolio involve four persons in a work force of some 2,400 personnel.

The incidence is not of a magnitude that would justify the engagement of an ergonomist.
The National Health and Medical Research Council is expected to issue shortly an occupational health guide on repetition strain injuries and every effort, subject to the availability of resources, will be made to comply with the recommendations as they apply to the operations of my Department and authorities within my portfolio.
Staff Ceilings: Department of the Treasury
(Question No. 4437)
Mr Holding asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the article in the Australian Financial Review, page 5, 29 March 1982, headed 'Departments miss Post deadline'.
(2) What are the reasons for the failure by the Minister's Department to make a submission to the inquiry into Australia Post, before the extended deadline.
(3) If the reasons include a shortage of staff due to Public Service Board staff ceilings, will the Minister now ask the Public Service Board to recommend an increase in the Department's staff ceilings; if not, why not.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) The occasional preparation of submissions by the Treasury to public inquiries imposes short term responsibilities on relevant officers additional to their ongoing responsibilities associated wi~h advising the Treasurer. These other ongoing responsibilities on the officers, particularly the senior officers concerned, prevented completion of the submission prior to the extended deadline on this occasion.
(3) Not applicable.
Alcohol Rehabilitation Program
(Question No. 4445)
Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:
Can he provide details as to the additional expenditure of $144,000 for the alcohol rehabilitation program referred to on page 13 of Report 194 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.
Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The addditional appropriation of $144,000 was obtained for the treatment at civilian clinic facilities of members of the Royal Australian Air Force involved in that Service's Alcohol Rehabilitation Program during the second half of financial year 1980-81. In the event, only $64,329 was required for this purpose as arrangements were made which made it possible to undertake the program at No.3 RAAF Hospital Richmond.
University of Queensland: Funding
(Question No. 4498)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 28 April 1982:

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2525

(2) Given that special education for people with learning difficulties is a vital facility at the university, will he, in his preBudget deliberations, allocate additional funding for the University of Queensland to continue its Department of Special Education functions.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Within the block grants made available by the Commonwealth Government on the advice of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, universities are themselves responsible for the distribution of funds among their various academic activities and for determining the nature and conduct of those activities. Decisions relating to the continuation or otherwise of chairs in particular disciplines fall within this area of internal management and are therefore matters for the governing bodies of the universities concerned.
(2) As for all other Australian universities, the recurrent grants for the University of Queensland have been fixed for each year of the 1982-84 triennium and are embodied in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981.
Election Broadcasts
(Question No. 4532)
Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 4 May 1982:
(I) How much time was made available to broadcast election speeches or political advertisements in respect of each political party on each radio broadcasting station and television station in connection with the federal election on 18 October 1980.
(2) What was the percentage distribution of time purchased by parties and candidates on (a) metropolitan and (b) country commercial broadcasting and television stations.
(3) What were the costs charges for this time, and what was the percentage distribution of these costs.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I refer the honourable member to the answer I provided to question No. 136 asked by Senator Mason on 26 November 1980 (Senate Hansard, 31 March 1981, pages 936-954).
South Australia: Salinity Level in Water
Mr Anthony-On 4 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2139) Mr Giles asked me a question without notice regarding salinity levels in water in Lake Victoria. I undertook to provide specific answers to his questions and the Minister for National Development and Energy has now provided the following information:
Electrical conductivity salt readings at Lake Victoria have fluctuated between expected limits with a slight increase towards the end of the season, as is normal. Generally, they have been lower than those reported by the River Commission for the previous two seasons.
During the week ending 21 April, water of about 590EC (or 354 p.p.m.) salinity level was diverted to the storage although subsequently a much larger volume was released over the following week. I have been informed that, with the termination of the irrigation season, the objective of the River Murray Commission is to refill Lake Victoria, and water currently being diverted into the storage is of a lower salinity level.
Lake Victoria is operated as an integral part of the River Murray Commission's system of storages, mainly to ensure continuity of supply to South Australia, but it is also operated,

as far as possible and without undue risk, to reduce the salinity of water held in the lake. It is not possible at this time of the year to predict with any degree of accuracy as to how the storages will be operated next season to meet South Australia's entitlement of water under the River Murray Waters Agreement. This will depend largely on a number of unknown seasonal factors such as winterjspring rainfall and snow, run-off and next season's irrigation and urban water demands. However, I have been informed that the Commission is constantly reviewing strategies for operating its storages in order to provide South Australia with water of a reasonable quality, having regard to seasonal conditions, storage and river levels and aggregate demands on the system.
Uganda
Mr Street-On 21 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1629), in response to a question, without notice, from Mr Bowen, I undertook to provide further information on conditions in Uganda. I am now able to inform the House that the new Australian High Commissioner in Nairobi, Mr A. G. D. White, visited Uganda on 17-22 April 1982 in order to present his credentials to President Obote. Mr White held extensive discussions with Ugandan Government officials, the Leader of the Opposition Democratic Party, and with diplomatic colleagues resident in Kampala. He also visited the Ugandan army training centre at Jinja, eighty kilometers north-east of Kampala, where the Commonwealth Military Training Team is located.
I have seen reports that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Uganda, Cardinal Naubuga, had accused elements of the Ugandan army of inhuman behaviour and has protested about the violence and arrests that took place in Kampala following the 23 February guerrilla attack on the Lubiri army barracks in the capital. I understand that the Roman Catholic Church in Uganda is playing an important role in monitoring the human rights situation, including through visits to Ugandan prisons. During his recent visit to Kampala, the High Commissioner met Cardinal Naubuga at Rubaga Cathedral for discussions about the continuing violence in Uganda and about the situation of Ugandan prisoners.
The reports which I have received from the High Commissioner, following his visit to Uganda, have confirmed the Government's assessment that the security risk to Australian personnel serving in the Commonwealth Military Training Team at Jinja is not high. The High Commissioner will be making frequent visits to Uganda and the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely on the basis of reports received from the High Commissioner, from the Commander of the Australian team at Jinja and from other Commonwealth countries participating in the program.

Answers to Questions

Taxation: Reversionary Bonuses on Life Assurance Policies

(Question No. 2563)

Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:

(I) What was the cost of exempting from tax income de-
rived from reversionary bonuses on life assurance policies under paragraph 26 (i) of the Income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1975-76 and what is the estimated cost for 1980-81.

(2) How long has this or a similar provision existed in the Act.

(3) What is the reason for providing this allowance.

Mr Howard~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) Life Insurance statistics do not include information on
reversionary bonuses paid. The expense items in the statistics include an amount described as bonuses paid in cash, but this
does not include amounts paid on death, maturity or other claims. The latter are not separately identified in the statistics. For 1979, the latest year for which statistics are available, pay-
ments on account of ordinary, industrial and superannuation
business were as follows:

$m

Claims Death Maturity Other Surrenders Annuities Bonuses paid in cash

212.5
389.3 73.0
641.2 3.7
11.4

Total policy payments

1,331.0

Most reversionary bonuses paid would be included in amounts paid on death and maturity and, for the purposes of a broad estimate, it might be assumed that reversionary bonuses represent about 1/3 of these amounts. If the reversionary bonuses paid in 1979 had amounted to about $200m and this amount had been subject to tax at 32%, the increase in income tax revenue that would have resulted from taxing the bonuses would have been about $70m.
(2) A provision effectively exempting from income tax a reversionary bonus on a policy of life assurance has existed in the Commonwealth taxation law since 1915.
(3) The exemption is intended to encourage taxpayers to make long-term provision against retirement or premature death. However, it is also consistent with the treatment of life assurance companies as trustees for their policyholders so that investment income taxed in the hands of the companies is not taxed again when distributed to the policyholders.
Taxation: Capital Gains Provisions
(Question No. 2588)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 June 1981:
(I) What sum was raised under the (a) capital gains tax provisions of section 26 (a) and, (b) short-term capital gains tax provisions of section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act for each year from 1975-76 and what is the estimated sum to be raised in 1980-81.
Mr Howard~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) The available statistics relate to net profits on the sale
or real estate, shares and other property assessed under sections 26 (a) and 26AAA for individuals and partnerships
and trusts. The income assessed under section 26 (a) is not distinguishable from that asessed under section 26AAA in the income tax statistics and corresponding statistics are
not available at all in respect of companies. Profits of that kind that fall within these provisions may also be included in assessable income by reason of the general provisions of
section 25 of the Act, statistics in relation to which are not compiled. However, the income tax payable in respect of amounts assessed under both sections for individuals and
partnerships and trusts for each income year from 1975-76 to 1979-80 has been estimated as follows:

$m

1975-76

14

1976-77

18

1977-78

19

1978-79

23

1979-80

58

The above estimates are based on statistics of original
assessments. Revenue raised by amendments to assessments as a result of audit, investigation or other action is not reflected in the figures.

Mrs S. M. Faulkner
(Question No. 2828)
Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 25 August 1981:
(I) Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to the grave distress and financial ruin of Mrs S. M. Faulkner referred to by Senator Mulvihill on 8 June 1973 (Senate Hansard, page 2609) and by the former Member for Wills on 9 September 1980 (Hansard, page 1050).
(2) If so, will the Attorney-General direct his officers, and seek the co-operation of his colleagues, to ensure that justice is done and compensation provided for the long delay in settlement, recognising, in the spirit of Magna Carta, that justice delayed is justice denied.
Mr N. A. Brown~The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) I am aware of the proceedings between David Joseph Noel Bluett (as trustee of the estate of Mrs Sylvia Margaret Faulkner, a bankrupt) as plaintiff and the Commonwealth and Charles Francis Flint as defendants.
(2) The proceedings have not yet come on for hearing but the Commonwealth has not been guilty of any undue delay in relation to the matter. The Commonwealth has indicated that it will support any application that the plaintiff wishes to make for an expedited hearing. It is not appropriate that I comment on the substance of the claim. The Commonwealth on the advice of counsel, has denied liability. The instructions that the Deputy Crown Solicitor has received from the Department of Defence do not preclude eventual settlement of the matter if the opinion is formed that the Commonwealth is legally liable. At this stage, however, it is considered that settlement of the action is not justified.

(I) Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to the case of Sylvia Margaret Faulkner Sage (Hansard, 9 September 1980, pages \050-1).
(2) What action has been taken to provide legal aid and satisfaction to her.
Mr N. A. Brown-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) I am aware of the proceedings between David Joseph Noel Bluett (as trustee of the estate of Mrs Sylvia Margaret Faulkner, a bankrupt) as plaintiff and the Commonwealth and Charles Francis Flint as defendants.
(2) In March 1980 the Official Reviewer (Mr Bluett) was granted financial assistance under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to enable him to proceed with the action and he has now been substituted as plaintiff. The case has been remitted from the High Court of Australia to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Commonwealth has indicated that it will support any application that the Official Receiver wishes to make for an expedited hearing.
Budget Estimates: Primary Industries
(Question No. 3165)
Mr Kerin asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 September 1981:
(I) Does the method of presenting Budget estimates for the forestry and fishing and agricultural and pastoral industries conform with the preservation of estimates for other industries, for example, the manufacturing industries: if not, what are the reasons for the different forms of presentation.
(2) Why are the salaries and administrative costs of the Department of Primary Industry and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics included in Budget estimates for agricultural and pastoral industries under the general description 'outlays on direct assistance' (Budget Paper No. I, 1981-82, page 152) and why do the estimates for manufacturing industries include only the administrative costs of the industry policy function of the Department of Industry and Commerce.
(3) Is it appropriate to describe the difference between total outlays in 1979-80 and 1980-81 as 'an increase (in direct assistance) of $57.6m' (Budget Paper No. I, 1981-82 page 152); if not, what would be a more appropriate interpretation of this figure.
(4) Could the estimates for primary industries be presented in a way which allows the net government contribution to these industries to be more readily identified; if not, why not.
(5) Could items, for example, 'irrigation, investigation and other water projects' be treated in such a way that only the part of the item directly related to primary industries is included in this section of the Budget.
(6) Why was it decided to include all expenditure under 'Irrigation, Investigation and Other Water Projects' in the estimates for agricultural and pastoral industries in the 1981-82 Budget, whereas in previous years funds allocated to urban water projects were recorded under 'Water Supply, Electricity and Gas'.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes. In Statement No.3 of Budget Paper No. I, Budget outlays are grouped by function in accordance with a classification system broadly consistent with that recommended in the United Nations' 'System of National Accounts' and the International Monetary Fund's 'Manual on Government Finance Statistics'. These are widely accepted international standards for classification of public expenditure. The budget

presentation for each industry is based on consistent classification principles.
(2) Commonwealth departments perform identifiable functions and it is the standard practice to record the salaries and administrative expenditure of these departments under the classification that best describes their functions. For example, the administration of the Department of Social Security is classified under the 'Social Security and Welfare' function and the administration of the Defence Department is classified under the 'Defence' function. Similarly, the salaries and administrative costs of the Department of Primry Industry and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics are properly classified under outlays related to 'Agricultural and Pastoral Industries '.
The classification of salaries and administrative costs of the Department of Industry and Commerce is also fully consistent with this approach. That Department has responsibilities for an 'Industry Policy' function and, since November 1980, for an 'Industrial Capacity' function-the latter relating mainly to the retention and continuing use, in Government aircraft and munitions industries, of production capabilities and skills regarded as essential for the manufacture of, or support requirements for, defence equipment and material. Salary and administrative costs relating to the 'Industry Policy' function are classified to 'Manufacturing Industry', and those for the 'Industrial Capacity' function are classified to 'Defence'.
(3) The statement on pae 152 of Budget Paper No. I, 1981-82 refers to the estimated increase in outlays on direct assistance to agricultural and pastoral industries between 1980-81 and 1981-82 (not between 1979-80 and 1980-81). On the basis of the standard conventions adopted, the statement is accurate and it considered an appropriate description of transactions involved.
The introduction to the summary table on page 150 of that Budget Paper explains the distinction between direct and indirect assistance to industry and the conventions applying to the inclusion of items in the direct assistance category. Some elaboration of that latter point is contained in the answers, given above, to Questions (I) and (2). As noted, outlays on direct assistance to agricultural and pastoral industries cover any expenditure by the Commonwealth which is functionally related to those industries, offset by levies imposed on the industries, loan repayments and other receipts. In some years a large repayment might depress the net outlays figure thus implying only a small increase or even a decrease in that year and a relatively large increase in the following year.
The presentation of outlays for agricultural and pastoral industries in the period 1979-80 to 1981-82 illustrates this situation. In 1980-81, the Queensland Government repaid market support loans of $27.4m advanced by the Commonwealth in 1979-80 to meet obligations under the terms of the International Sugar Agreement. Reflecting this, and other factors, total outlays on agricultural and pastoral industries showed a decline of $31.1 m in 1980-81 and an estimated increase of $57.6m in 1981-82.
(4) The table on pages 152 and 153 of Budget Paper No. I for 1981-82 is drawn up to provide broad consistency with the treatment of other functional areas. That is, payments by the Commonwealth are shown in total irrespective of their source and are then offset by collections of industry charges, levies and repayments to give the net figures shown in the table. This treatment is designed to show, inter alia, the 'net government contribution' as suggested in the question.
The large number of trust account arrangements established for the agricultural and pastoral industries complicates the presentation of outlays and the sources of relevant funds. For example, movements in balances held in these accounts

2528 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

which arise from factors such as carryovers of amounts provided but not spent in a year or amounts spent from previous years' provisions, affect net outlay figures.
Consideration is being given to the provisions of subsidiary data in Budget Statement No.3 to enable the sources of funds to be identified.more fully.
(5) As far as possible this is done. However, insufficient information is available at the time of preparation of the Budget documents on the allocation by individual project of the Commonwealth's National Water Resources Program (NWRP) for the coming year to allow a breakdown of funding in the way suggested. It is the practice for the breakdown of the NWRP, including allocations for both rural and urban water supply projects, to be finalised some time after the Budget. While those allocations for existing project commitments are shown under the appropriate functional headings, including 'Urban Water Supply', the unallocated balance of the NWRP is shown under 'Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects' since most of it can be expected to be for rural projects. In 1981-82, all known allocations at Budget time were for rural projects, and much the larger part of the unallocated amount was expected (in line with past experience) to be for rural projects; hence the NWRP allocation was shown in full under 'Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects'. This is explained in the text relating to that heading on page 159 of Budget Paper No. I.
(6) See (5) above.
Sales Tax: Re-refined Lubricating Oil
(Question No. 3439)
Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 October 1981:
(1) Does re-refined lubricating oil carry a 17t per cent sales tax.
(2) If so, is this equitable in view of the fact that sales tax was paid on the original product.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Re-refined lubricating oils are taxable at the general rate of sales tax, that is 17.5 per cent, as are other lubricating oils. They qualify for exemption, however, when acquired for use for business or industrial purposes as lubricants of machinery, implements and apparatus other than road vehicles of the kind ordinarily used for the transport of persons or the transport or delivery of goods.
(2) Although sales tax may have originally been paid on some of the materials used in its production, re-refined oil is a new and distinct commercial product from the materials, including second-hand oil, used in its production. There are many cases in which second-hand raw materials are used in the manufacture of new goods and lose their identity in the course of that manufacture. The fact that sales tax may have been paid at some earlier time on the second-hand materials is not considered to create inequities. It is simply a case of new goods produced by one method of manufacture being treated in like manner to new goods being produced by a different method of manufacture.
Commonwealth Grants to Local Government Authorities
(Question No. 367S)
Mr Uren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 November 1981:
What was the total value of grants made by the Commonwealth (a) under the Area Improvement Program, (b) under

the Regional Employment Development Scheme, and (c) through the Commonwealth Grants Commission to each local government authority in the western and south western regions of Sydney in each year from 1972-73 to 1975-76.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) Area Improvement Program.
The Commonwealth made grants to the New South Wales Government for on-passing to individual local government authorities totalling $5m, $5.5m and $6,111,017 in the years 1973-74,1974-75 and 1975-76 respectively under the Western Sectors Area Improvement Program and the Area Improvement Program. Payments by the New South Wales Government to local government authorities in the Western Sydney region in these years in respect of these funds were as follows:

Housing Loans Foreclosures

(Question No. 3737)

Mr Uren asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 November 1981:

(I) How many foreclosures on housing loans were advanced by the Commonwealth Savings Bank for each year
from 1970-71 to 1980-81.

(2) In each case, (a) what were the proportions of foreclos-
ures on first home buyers, (b) what were the (i) median and (ii) average prices of homes purchased in (A) metropolitan and (8) non-metropolitan areas in each State and (C) what
proportions of borrowers had incomes less than average weekly earnings.

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

The Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has advised that the Commonwealth Savings Bank (CSB) does not have available statistics covering all the
information sought or in the precise form requested. Within these constraints the following information is provided.

(1) Available records indicate that it was necessary for the
CSB to exercise its rights as mortgagee in possession to dispose of 31 properties by auction (or by private treaty after auction) during the period 1970-71 to 1980-81. These were distributed as follows:

Total

31

Of the total, three instances were due to refusal of borrowers to meet loan repayments, the rest arising from marital disputes and abandonment of properties by borrowers in circumstances where they could not be traced (some are thought to have returned overseas).
(2) (a) I am informed that it is the CSB's practice for files of repaid housing loans to be held for a relatively limited period after repayment of the loan. Of the 31 cases mentioned in (1) above, 16 files were available for perusal and, of these, 13 borrowers were first home buyers.
(b) Sixteen cases is too small a number to permit the derivation of meaningful statistics in the form sought.
(c) From the 16 files available, seven borrowers had incomes at the date of loan application less than the avarage weekly earnings in the State where the relevant loan originated.

Taxation: Profit on Sale of Property
(Question No. 3782)
Mr Robert Brown asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(1) What was the total number of (a) individual and (b) company taxpayers for each year since 1975-76.
(2) How many of each group referred to in part (I), (a) declared the sale of property which had been owned for longer than 12 months and (b) actually paid tax on any profit made by the sale of property.

(3) Under section 26 (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, against how many of each group referred to in part (I), (a) was tax claimed, (b) were inquiries conducted and (c) was legal action taken to recover tax and in how many cases was the legal action successful.
(4) What was the total amount of tax collected from each group referred to in part (I) under section 26 (a) of the Act.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I (a) The numbers of assessments of taxable individuals (including trustees) that were issued within two years of the close of the year of income for each of the income years 1975-76 to 1979-80 are as follows:

(b) The numbers of assessments of taxable companies (public, private, co-operative and non-profit) that were in-
cluded in the main income tax statistics for each income year 1975-76 to 1978-79 (the lastest year for which statistics are
available) are as follows:

2 (a) The relevant income tax statistics relate to information on profit (or loss) from the sale of real estate, shares
and other property assessed under both sections 26 (a) and
26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Profits from property sold that had been owned for more than 12 months are
not distinguished from profits from the sale of other property in the statistics. Information is available on the amount of profits on the sale of property net of losses for individuals and
for partnership and trusts, but comparable information in re-
spect of companies had not been compiled. The relevant aggregate for individuals (including taxable trusts) and for partnerships and trusts is set out below:

(b) The 20,491 taxable assessments for 1979-80 include those in which losses on such sales were recorded, but do not include individuals who had profits or losses on such sales that affected only the partnership or trust income they received. The numbers of assessments in which such losses were allowed are not distinguished in the relevant statistics. However, from a sample of returns of taxable individuals it would appear that they represented less than 10 per cent of assessments. It is also mentioned that the statistics relate only to original assessments. Any amendments resulting from audit action, objections or appeals are not reflected in the figures. It is not practicable to ascertain how many taxpayers have actually paid the tax assessed, but it would be reasonable to assume that there would be little, if any, still outstanding.
(3) This information is not known. However, increased tax and penalties in respect of field audits and investigations in 1980-81 amounted to $128m. Part of this amount relates to amendments to assessments to include profits on the sale of property.
(4) This information is not recorded separately (see (2) ).

Mandata

(Question No. 3834)

Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:

(I) In what year was the use of Mandata first envisaged.

(2) When was Mandata scheduled to be in full operation.

(3) What was to be the full function of the Mandata system.

(4) Was computer equipment required for Mandata leased or purchased.

(5) If leased, who was the equipment leased from and what were the terms of the leasing agreement.

(6) If purchased, what was the total sum spent on purchase and what has become of the equipment since the termination of Mandata.

(7) What was the total cost in operating and setting up Mandata.

(8) What has been the cost in terminating Mandata.

(9) What is the estimated cost saving in terminating Mandata.

Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) The Mandata project was conceived in the 1960's and in 1974 the Government approved the acquisition of the central computer and ancillary equipment.

(2) The original implementation plan scheduled Mandata to be fully operational in 1984. Development and implementation was to proceed concurrently for a 12 year
period from 1972-73 to 1983-84.

(3) The Mandata system was to provide a centralised service-wide computer based personnel and establishment system with direct links to the payroll and superannuation systems.

(4) Computer equipment required for Mandata was a combination of purchased and leased items.

(5) and (6) Items were leased from Burroughs Pty Ltd. The

central computer and some other items were purchased. The

terms of the leasing agreement were of normal business prac-

tices and included the following items:

.

period of hire acceptance tests delivery

site preparation site access installation transport charges charges variation of charges substitution of equipment title patent indemnity warranty limit of liability termination responsibility for loss, damage or injury maintenance payment $8.5m was spent on purchasing equipment and included some initial installation costs. Since the termination of Mandata, the Department of Administrative Services has disposed of most items to departments and agencies. The Department of the Capital Territory has taken over the central computer.

(Question No. 3910)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Vc:terans' Affairs, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
(I) Is it the.: normal procedure of the Minister's Department that announcements of actions being taken within certain electoral divisions which are likely to influence the livelihood of people within those divisions (such as the structural changes to government works, grants made to schools, announcements affecting administration, staffing or funding of organisations) are made (a) by the Minister or (b) where the approved project concerned is located in a Government-held electoral division, by the local Liberal or National Country Party members.
(2) What is the Department's practice regarding the announcement of such initiatives by Opposition members.

Federal Public Service Exchange Programs
(Question No. 3921)
Mr Holding asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
Do specific arrangements exist for the exchange of Commonwealth public servants with (a) private enterprise, (b) State or Territory Public Services, and (c) offices of Members of Parliament; if so, what are the details and in particular, (i) what is the purpose of these arrangements, in each case, (ii) when were these arrangements commenced, in each case, (iii) what are the criteria for selection of Federal public service personnel for these exchange programs and (iv) what is the duration of the exchange period, in each case.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Interchange Program which is administered by the Public Service Board is a scheme whereby exchanges of staff are arranged between the Australian Public Service and private enterprise, State and Territory Public Services, local government bodies and academic institutions.
The Interchange Program was introduced in 1977 with aims to promote mutual understanding between the Australian Public Service, other parts of the public sector and organisations in the private sector.
Since its introduction over 400 placements into or out of the Service have been arranged involving most Commonwealth Departments and more than 160 private sector and other organisations.
In selecting staff members for placement under the Interchange Program the Board seeks individuals who would benefit from undertaking a real and challenging work placement in another employment sector and who could contribute to the better understanding and communication between two organisations. Typically, the people most suitable for Interchange are from the middle to senior management level. Participants should rate highly on most of the following criteria:
knowledge of present job
rate and quality of work
mental capacity, flexibility and initiative
sense of responsibility
ability to organise, delegate and control
planning, judgment and sense of proportion
relationships with supervisors, peers and subordinates
oral and written communication
leadership and ability to work under pressure creative ability.
The more general qualities include:
self motivation, self reliance
capacity to undertake higher level management duties
adaptability to new work environment
high level of general ability and (where relevant) special expertise
capacity to represent and provide information about their organisation and the Service generally
ability to communicate effectively new knowledge and skills and to benefit from contact with people in another employment sector
open-mindedness and the ability to learn.

2534 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

Interchange placements can be from three months to two years in duration, but the normal length of placement is one year.
Details of placements made each year have been listed in the Public Service Board's Annual Reports.
The transfer of officers of the Australian Public Service to the personal staff of Members of Parliament does not take place under the Interchange Program. Procedures for these transfers have been developed by the Public Service Board over a long period. Under these arrangements permanent officers of the Australian Public Service who wish to join the personal staff of Members of Parliament agree to go on the unattached list of the Department in which they are employed, and at the same time apply for temporary transfer to the Department of Administrative Services. At the end of the period of temporary transfer, officers revert to their original Department, on whose unattached list they have remained, and it becomes the Department's responsibility to arrange placement. No time limit is specified for such transfers.
Invasion of Privacy
(Question No. 3933)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 February 1982:
Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to the findings of a national survey of attitudes to privacy conducted by Bennett Research Pty Ltd on behalf of the Law Reform Commission; if so,
(a) how advanced is the Attorney-General's Department in making access to personal information held by others a legal right, as is the precedent in North American and European countries,
(b) is the Attorney-General's Department monitoring and researching reports of invasion of privacy by telephone sales companies,
(c) can the Attorney-General disclose figures of the number of telephone sales companies in Australia and the number of complaints about their mode of operations,

(i) credit bureaux, (ii) insurance companies, (iii) government bureaux, (iv) employers, (v) banks and (vi) police,
and
(e) has the Attorney-General introduced any legislation in his term of office to better protect the privacy of the pUblic.
Mr N. A. Brown~The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) the Attorney-General is aware of a special edition (No. 44) of an information sheet called "Listening Post" published by Ogilvy and Mather Research which contains an analysis of a survey on privacy conducted by a research company called Bennett Research. The Attorney-General understands the survey was conducted at the suggestion of the Law Reform Commission.

(a) In 1976 the then Attorney-General referred the subject of privacy to the Commonwealth's Law Reform Commission for investigation and report. The final report of the Commission on this topic is expected this year and, when received, will be carefully considered by the Government to decide what action should be taken thereon.
The Freedom of Information Act 1982 was passed by both Houses of the Parliament and the Attorney General is pursuing I October 1982 as the date for its implementation. This legislation will, amongst other things, confer on a person a legally enforceable right to obtain access to documents of Ministers, Government Departments and Agencies relating to the personal affairs of that person.
(b) No.
(c) The Attorney-General does not keep data on the number of telephone sales companies in Australia or on complaints made about the activities of such companies.
(d) The Attorney-General's Department does not have a general function of investigating complaints about the type of information held by credit bureaux, insurance companies, government bureaux, employers, banks and police.

Aid to Vietnam
(Question No. 3973)
Mr Uren asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 February 1982:
Further to the answers to Question Nos. 3269 and 5972 (Hansard 3 May 1979, page 1889 and 22 May 1980 pages 3243-4), what arrangements for aid to Vietnam have been made by the (a) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, (b) International Development Association, (c) Asian Development Bank, (D) Asian Development Fund, (e) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and (f) Western donors in the last 2 years.
Mr Street~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) to (d) Since my previous reply to the honourable member's question on this topic on 22 May 1980, there have been no loan proposals for aid to Vietnam submitted for the consideration of the Executive Boards of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Development Association, Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Fund.
(e) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is not an aid disbursement organisation.
(f) The current status of assistance to Vietnam from members of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD in the period under review is that Austria, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand and the United States have not provided any aid. Denmark, Italy and Switzerland have provided aid associated with outstanding commitments entered into prior to the period under review; the United Kingdom and Norway are believed to be in this category also. Germany and Japan have provided aid for humanitarian purposes. Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and France (the last two on a reduced basis) have continued to provide aid, although it is understood that some of these countries may seek to change the forms of their future programs.

P3C Aircraft
(Question No. 4010)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 February 1982:
(I) What is the position regarding the supply by the United States of America of additional P3C aircraft?
(2) Has the US Department of Defense indicated changed numbers required for its own use in 1982-83; if so, will this affect the production and/or price of the aircraft?
(3) Does the manufacture under licence of P3C aircraft in Japan offer an alternative, lower price source of supply for Australia?
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) On 29 April 1982 Mr Killen reaffirmed to the House his announcement of 20 October 1981 that, subject to satisfactory contractual negotiations, the Government intends to proceed with the purchase of 10 new P3C aircraft and sell-back of the existing 10 RAAF P3B aircraft. He also advised that we could expect to take delivery of the new aircraft between November 1984 and March 1986.
(2) In December 1981 the United States Department of Defense advised that from US Fiscal Year 1983 onwards it will reduce its ordering of P3C from the previous level of about 12 aircraft per year to about 5 or 6 per year. Mr Killen's statement of 29 April 1982, noted that curtailment has brought about cost increases in the unit production cost and we would expect the total project cost of our 10 aircraft, including spares and supporting equipment and services, to increase from the previous estimate of $242m to about $280m at August 1981 price levels. It was also noted that delivery of the new aircraft would be advanced from the program previously envisaged.
(3) Japan is manufacturing P3C aircraft under licence but the licence arrangements only allow for aircraft manufacture for Japan's Self Defence Force. Moreover, it is long-standing Japanese Government policy not to sell military equipment to foreign governments. Under these circumstances, Japan does not provide an alternative source from which Australia could acquire P3C aircraft.
Boy Scouts Association Act
(Question No. 4013)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 23 February 1982:
(I) Is he responsible for administering the Boy Scouts' Association Act 1924.
(2) If so, why is this particular Act within his responsibility as its subject matter appears to have no relevance to science and technology.
(3) What offices within his Department take responsbility for scouting affairs.
(4) As the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment takes responsibility for administering a variety of heterogenous activities without any common element, will he be prepared to recommend that his boy scout responsibilities might find a more appropriate location at the Department of Home Affairs and Environment.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.

(2) The Boy Scouts' Association Act 1924 grants certain forms of protection to the name, uniform, emblem and other insignia of the Boy Scouts' Association. The forms of protection are analogous to commercial protection available under the Designs Act 1906 and the Trade Marks Act 1955, both within my portfolio. By section 3 of the Boy Scouts' Association Act the protection afforded relies, in part, on registration under the Designs Act.
(3) Any matter arising from the Act would currently be handled by the Secretariat of my Department.
(4) The Administrative Arrangements Order is regularly reviewed to reflect legislative and other administrative changes. The allocation of responsibility for administration of the Act will be raised with the Prime Minister for consideration in the context of the next such review.

Foreign Ownership and Participation: Statistical Survey
(Question No. 4074)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 February 1982:
(I) Further to his Press release of 20 January 1982 which announced the Government's decision to resume the foreign ownership and participation survey of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in what areas will statistics be kept and, in particular, will the collection of statistical information be resumed in relation to the level of (a) foreign investment in enterprises in Australia (preliminary), (b) foreign ownership and control of (i) general insurance business, (ii) life insurance business, (iii) finance companies, (iv) mining industry, (v) accredited advertising agencies, (vi) tourist accommodation establishments and (vii) manufacturing industry, (c) foreign control in or of (i) manufacturing industry, study of large enterprise groups, (ii) mineral exploration, (iii) finance companies, (iv) life insurance business, (v) general insurance, (vi) registered financial corporations and (vii) the mining industry and (d) research and experimental developmentprivate enterprises.
(2) As the Government has changed its mind on the collection of foreign ownership statistics, will he also reconsider his answer to parts (7) and (8) of Question No. 2976 (Hansard, 16 February 1982, pages 112-3).
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) I refer the honourable member to my supplementary answer (Hansard, 21 April 1982, page 1707) to Question No. 2976 concerning the foreign participation surveys. The Statistician is currently examining the most appropriate concepts, definitions and methodologies to be used in any new studies of foreign ownership and control. He will take into account experience with earlier studies of this kind, views of the major users of the statistics about the data most useful to them and the desirability of achieving comparability with the earlier studies. Estimates will be made of the additional resources required to produce ownership and control statistics. Until the Statistician's investigations are complete, it is not possible to say what sectors will be the subject of ownership and control studies, or in what sequence particular sectors will be studied.
The Bureau's collection of the statistical information referred to in part (I) (a) of the honourable member's question, concerning foreign investment in enterprises in Australia, was not discontinued in 1978; these data continue to be published periodically by the Bureau.
Military Attaches in Middle East Countries
(Question No. 4125)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
Would it be beneficial for the Australian component of the Sinai Peacekeeping Force if Australia had military attaches in Egypt, Israel and perhaps one or two other countries in the Middle East in accordance with recommendation 14 of the 1976 report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled The Middle East-Focal Point ofConftict'.
Mr SincIair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

The implications for defence representation in the Middle East of Australia's contribution to the Sinai peacekeeping force (Multinational Force and Observers-MFO) have been kept under careful review. So far the presence of this contingent in the Sinai has not rendered necessary the posting of military attaches to Australian Embassies in Egypt, Israel or other Middle Eastern countries. Australia is well represented in the headquarters of the MFO by ten staff officers, including the head of the General Staff branch of the headquarters. The question of military attaches continues to be kept under review.
Armed Services Attache in Egypt and Israel
(Question No. 4126)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
In view of Australia's commitments to the Sinai Peacekeeping Force, does the Government consider Australia should have an armed services attache in Egypt and Israel in accordance with recommendation 14 of the 1976 report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled The Middle East-Focal Point ofConftict'.
Mr SincIair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The implications for defence representation in the Middle East of Australia's contribution to the Sinai peacekeeping force (Multinational Force and Observers-MFO) have been kept under careful review. So far the presence of this contingent in the Sinai has not rendered necessary the posting of military attaches to Australian Embassies in Egypt, Israel or other Middle Eastern countries. Australia is well represented in the headquarters of the MFO by ten staff officers, including the head of the General Staff branch of the headquarters. The question of military attaches continues to be kept under review.
Equal Employment Opportunities: Department of Trade and Resources
(Question No. 4128)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Does the Minister's Department have an equal employment opportunities program; if so, (a) how long has the program been in existence, (b) what are the aims of the program, (c) what is the Department's assessment of the success of the program in achieving its aims, (d) how have, or are, the aims of the program been, or being, met, (e) is the program aimed at covering the whole Department, or merely a section of it, (f) what are the procedures for union consultation and involvement in the program, (g) what involvement does the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau of the Public Service Board have in the program and (h) has the program changed in its priority rating within the Department since its introduction.
(2) If there is no program, on what basis was this decision reached.
Mr Anthony-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The Department of Trade and Resources does not have an equal opportunities program separate from its normal personnel management programs, which operate on equal employment opportunities principles. In accordance with guidelines issued by the Public Service Board, vacant positions within the Department are filled according to equal opportunities principles by selecting the candidates judged to be the best available regardless of age, sex, ethnic origin or marital

status. The Department also actively participates in equal employment programs conducted by the Public Service Board and initiatives have been taken within these programs to provide employment within the Department for especially disadvantaged groups.
(2) It is considered that policies relating to the selection and appointment of officers within the Department of Trade and Resources are consistent with the principles of equal employment opportunities enunciated by the Public Service Board and accepted by Government employee associations.
Professor and Mrs Hidaka
(Question No. 4167)
Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 11 March 1982:
(I) Has he denied Professor Rokuro Hidaka and his wife visas to enter Australia on the grounds of their alleged links with the Japanese Red Army.
(2) Can he say whether the Japanese Foreign Minister has stated in the Diet that Professor and Mrs Hidaka had no links with the Japanese Red Army.
(3) Does he have any private evidence that the Hidakas have been involved with the Japanese Red Army or any other terrorist group; if so, will he make public that evidence; if not, will he reveal publicly the reasons for his exclusion of the Hidakas from Australia.
Mr Hodges-The answer to Dr Theophanous' question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) The Hidaka case was discussed in a Committee of the Japanese Diet on I March 1982. The official transcript of the proceedings make it clear that no such statement could be attributed to the Japanese Foreign Minister.
(3) [ assure the honourable member that the decision to refuse visas to Professor and Mrs Hidaka was taken only after the most careful consideration of all aspects of the case. [ am not prepared, however, to make public the information on which the decision was taken. It is a long-standing practice in this Parliament to avoid any disclosure of information of a security nature.
Youth Services Scheme
(Question No. 4198)
Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 March 1982:
(I) [s the funding for the Youth Services Scheme (Youth Accommodation Services Program) due to run out at the end of the 1981-82 financial year and has a commitment to further funding been made by the Government.
(2) Will the closure of youth housing services funded under this program have detrimental effects on homeless young people, their families and on already overloaded, underresourced Government community services and agencies.
(3) [s it a fact that, while there is no commitment to the refunding of the Youth Services Scheme, committees of management are unable to adequately plan their services or offer their employees security.
(4) Will the Minister guarantee that the Youth Services Scheme will be refunded on a triennial basis to lOOper cent of agreed costs with a cost of living component written into all amounts allocated to projects funded under this scheme; if so,

will the Minister give the guarantee before 30 April 1982 to enable proper planning to proceed.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(I) Yes. On 23 March 1982 I announced that the Government had agreed to a further commitment for the 1982-83 financial year, so long as the Commonwealth funds were matched by the State Governments who are primarily responsible for the provision of services for Youth.
(2) and (3) There should be no need for closure of services funded under the Scheme, unless a State Government does not agree to match the Commonwealth funding or does not recommend the continued funding of any particular service. The decision announced by me was aimed at assisting services to plan.
(4) No. The Government's policy is to consider such funding annually in the Budget context. Consideration is given to the needs of services, and to the availability of funds within the overall Budget strategy.
Multicultural Television
(Question No. 4211)
Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 18 March 1982:
(I) Does the Government have any plans to extend the multicultural television service beyond Sydney and Melbourne.
(2) Is economic, social and technical planning and research being carried out to determine the possibility of extending multicultural television; if so, when will (a) the research be completed and (b) decisions be made on extensions to be present service.
Mr N. A. Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The Government has received representations seeking the extension of multicultural television beyond Sydney and Melbourne. Representations have been received from Newcastle, Wollongong, Canberra and other regions.
(2) The options for extending the multicultural television service are currently being examined by my Department. Any decision to extend the present service will be considered initially in the context of the 1982-83 Budget.
Television: Wittenoom, Western Australia
(Question No. 4216)
Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 18 March 1982:
Further to the answer to my Question No. 2287 (Hansard, 19 August 1981, page 508), is it planned to provide television to Wittenoom, Western Australia; ifso, when; if not, why not.
Mr N. A. Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
As foreshadowed in my predecessor's reply to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's previous question on this matter, the proposed National Communications Satellite System to be operational in the mid-eighties may well prove to be the most appropriate means by which the Government is able to provide television coverage to the town of Wittenoom. However, my Department is currently preparing a proposal for a Self-Help Television Reception Scheme which will allow a small communities such as Wittenoom to initiate the establishment of a television service themselves. The intention is to

Pilot Youth Support Services Program
(Question No. 4260)
Mr Beazley asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:
With reference to the Commonwealth-State agreement to provide a Pilot Youth Support Services Program in Western Australia from 1979-80 to 1981-82, what (a) was the original agreement on funding levels, (b) funds have been provided to date and on what dates, (c) were the reasons for any delays or shortfalls, (d) evaluation (i) was originally intended for the program and (ii) has taken place or is now intended for the future and (e) sum allocated to date has gone towards (i) administration and (ii) purchase of premises.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(a) An amount of $251,400 (@ $83,800 per annum) was offered to Western Australia by the Commonwealth for the three years of the Youth Services Scheme pilot period (I July 1979-30 June 1982). The offer was based on the same conditions as applied nationally viz. that the amount would be matched by the State Government and expenditure of the total allocation would be in accordance with agreed guidelines. The available Commonwealth funds were not fully taken up by the State Government, largely due to local delays in implementation of the Scheme (see (c) below).
(b) I have approved Commonwealth grants totalling $136,820 for expenditure on the Youth Services Scheme in Western Australia up to 30 June 1982. The original approval was in March 1981 and further expenditure was approved in November 1981 and December 1981. The honourable member may be aware that the Commonwealth Government

2542 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

announced on 23 March 1982 that it will support the Youth Services Scheme for a further year (1982-83). The full amount to be available will be announced in the Budget.
(c) Delays in implementation of the pilot program in Western Australia were caused largely by protracted negotiations with the State Government over the basis of the program and the interpretation of the guidelines which had been accepted in every other State. It was eventually agreed that the Commonwealth would make special purpose via-the-State grants to certain projects while the State would continue to separately fund its own projects. As the condition that the grants be equally matched still applies, the total funds eventually available to the Commonwealth funded projects was determined by the amounts made available by the State to its own projects.
(d) (i) and (ii) The national guidelines provide for all projects to be included in the National Evaluation. However the Western Australian Government did not agree that the projects receiving State funds (see (c) above) be included. The projects receiving Commonwealth funding commenced operation nine months after the beginning of the national evaluation data collection, but they participated in the last six months of the 15 month collection period. That information is being included in the full report of the National Committee for Evaluation. As part of the total evaluation package, it was originally planned that there be a special study in each State to examine aspects of the Scheme of particular interest to the State. Because of the late commencement of projects there was insufficient time for this study to be conducted in Western Australia. Further, the Western Australian Government did not offer any State grants to match Commonwealth funds.
(e) (i) State and Federal government administration costs have not been charged to the funds made available for the Youth Services Scheme. Commonwealth grants in Western Australia have been made from Appropriation item 956.04 which provides for grants to or for the States.
(e) (ii) Capital grants for purchase of premises are not available under the Youth Services Scheme, which concentrates on assistance with the operational costs of services.
Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer
(Question No. 4274)
Mr West asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:
(I) Did an Australian representative participate in a meeting of the United Nations Environment Program ad hoc Working Group on the Elaboration of a Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, held in January 1982.
(2) Has the Government supported the proposal to adopt such a Convention and is he able to state when such a Convention is likely to be adopted.
(3) Have any legislative or other steps been taken in Australia to limit, reduce or prevent activities likely to have an adverse effect on the ozone layer.
Mr McVeigh-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes. An officer of the Australian Embassy in Stockholm attended the working group meeting.
(2) Australia has supported the proposal for a Convention. Development of the Convention is at a preliminary stage. It is expected that progress will be discussed at the next session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program in May 1982.

(3) A joint working party of the Australian Environment Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council recently completed a report on the health, environmental and economic implications of the use of chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol sprays. Chlorofluorocarbons are the chemicals of principal concern in relation to the possible reduction of ozone levels in the upper atmosphere. The report will be considered by the Environment Council at its next meeting in June 1982.

Commonwealth Employees Compensation
(Question No. 4335)
Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
Is it a fact that workers' compensation claims referred to the Office of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation in Canberra take over 5 months to elicit a response; if so, (a) is this unacceptable delay a result of an arbitrary ceiling on employment in the Department, (b) is economic hardship and worry engendered by protracted decision making and (c) what does the Minister intend to do to remedy the situation.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
I refer the honourable member to the answers to parts (I) and (3) of House of Representatives Question No. 3286 (Hansard of 18 November 1981, page 3148). Since that time additional positions (representing an increase of approximately 20 per cent) have been allocated to the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation (OCEC) as an interim measure and part of the subsequent recruitment action has already beeri completed. The ultimate result, when this action is fully completed, is expected to be an appreciable improvement in the work turn around time in OCEC and the position will be regularly monitored to ensure that these expectations are realised. As well, proposals for still further strengthening of OCEC are under consideration.

Northern Land Council

Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:

Royal Australian Navy Minehunters
(Question No. 4345)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 April1982:
(I) What is the reason for the delay in finalising tenders which were called in November 1980 in respect to the construction of two prototype hulls for RAN minehunters.
(2) Has a decision been taken in respect of these tenders; if so, what is the cause of the delay in announcing a decision.
(3) What sum has been expended on this project to date, and what is the current estimate of the completion cost.
Mr SincIair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Finalising the selection of a recommended shipbuilder for -the minehunters has required my Department to subject proposals received in April 1981 from Australian shipbuilders to particularly close analysis, noting that glass reinforced plastic vessels of this type and size have never before been constructed in Australia, that special construction facilities need to be established and that the vessels are of a prototype nature. The time involved in considering industry's proposals and finalising contractual arrangements has been longer than normally taken for a conventional vessel.
(2) I plan to make an announcement on the tenderer selected to build the vessels in the near future.
(3) Contracts worth some $28m have to date been awarded, relating to project development tasks and to the procurement of long lead time equipment. The estimated total project cost for the two prototypes-which covers all costs associated with their design, development, construction and evaluation-is estimated to be about $70m at August 1981 price levels.
Officer Cadets
(Question No. 4347)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 April1982:
Does the number of officer cadets recruited for the Army and the RAAF fall short of those required; if so (a) is he concerned that (i) the Army and (ii) the RAAF have not been

able to attract authorised numbers of officer cadets and (b) what is the reason for the shortfalls.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
For the Air Force, no. For the Army, targets are being met for the Royal Military College, but there have been some shortfalls for other Officer Cadet Courses.
Any shortfall is a matter for concern but the numbers involved are not significant at this stage.
The principal reason for any shortfall is an inability to attract sufficient numbers of applicants with those qualities judged to be essential to become an Army officer. Shortfalls primarily occur for the mid year (July) intake into the Officer Cadet School (OCS, Portsea). The recruiting period for the July intake into OCS is at a time of the year when fewer suitable applicants are forthcoming.
Mutton Exports to [ran
(Question No. 4357)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to an article entitled 'Iran offers oil for Australian meat' in the Australian, 2 April 1982, reporting that a Japanese company with a branch and meat exporting licence in Australia, Kanematsu-Gosho, shipped about 3,500 tonnes of Australian mutton to Iran as part of a barter deal for 23 million barrels of oil which will be used in Australia.
(2) What is the current price of Australian mutton, per tonne, on the world market.
(3) What is the current price, per barrel, for Iranian oil.
(4) What does Australia gain from this and other such transactions.
(5) Would Australia have gained more by bartering directly with Iran.
(6) Has the Government considered entering into such transactions in the future.
(7) How many (a) foreign-owned companies and (b) Australian-owned companies currently hold Australian meat exporting licences.
Mr Anthony-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) I am aware of the newspaper article referred to by the honourable member.
(2) The average price for Australian mutton per tonne on the world market was $1,054 f.o.b. in January 1982. This is the latest price information available from official sources.
(3) Iran is a member country of OPEC and as such was party to the agreement reached at the last OPEC meeting which set the price of US$34 per barrel for Saudi Arabian light crude. This is the marker price on which OPEC member countries calculate the export price for their crude oil exports.
(4) I have been advised that the sale of mutton by Kanematsu-Gosho was effected through its Australian subsidiary and sold to Iran under normal commercial arrangements, i.e. Iran paid cash for the meat.
(5) Not applicable.
(6) The Government is not involved in commercial trading. Any scope for barter trade with Iran is for the private sector to decide.

Tenosynovitis: Department of Trade and Resources
(Question No. 4378)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:

(I) In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction has there been (a) medical examinations of all workers and (b) an ergonomic assessment of the work process, tasks and work environment made by an ergonomist in all areas where repetitious injuries, for example, tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome, have been reported; if not, why not.

(2) If so, (a) when were assessments made and (b) what

recommendations were made.

.

(3) Have any recommendations made been carried out; if not, why not.

Mr Anthony-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(I) (a) There have been no comprehensive medical examinations conducted within my Department, or statutory authorities within my jurisdiction, beyond those included in the appointment process. However, voluntary eyetests have been arranged for staff employed on VD U's for sustained periods in accordance with Public Service Board guidelines issued recently.

(b) An ergonomic assessment of the work process, tasks and work environment in all areas where repetitious injuries have been reported has not been undertaken within my Department or the statutory authorities within my jurisdiction. The wide range of occupations in which strain related injuries are reported would make such an assessment impracticable on economic and resource grounds.

The significant of repetitious strain injury as an occupational health hazard has only recently been recognised and to date no cases of repetitious injuries have been reported in my Department or statutory authorities under my jurisdiction.

I have been advised that a National Health and Medical Research Council Occupational Health Guide will be issued in June 1982. In the meantime due cognisance has been taken of the evidence becoming available on the potential dangers inherent in employment in areas where these injuries have been reported elsewhere in the Public Service. My Department is making every effort to comply with guidelines available in respect of ergonomic features in these working areas, which will minimise the potential dangers, within resources available.

Overall, in common with all Government departments and instrumentalities, existing work places have been designed, fitted out and equipped having regard to local Government and State safety regulations and relevant standards and guidelines issued by such bodies as the Standards Associations of Australia, the NH and MRC and the Department of Science and Technology.

(2) and (3) See answer to Question (1) above.

Tenosynovitis: Department of Trade and Resources
(Question No. 4378)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
(I) In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction has there been (a) medical examinations of all workers and (b) an ergonomic assessment of the work process, tasks and work environment made by an ergonomist in all areas where repetitious injuries, for example, tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. have been reported; if not, why not.
(2) If so, (a) when were assessments made and (b) what recommendations were made.
(3) Have any recommendations made been carried out; if not, why not.
Mr Wilson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) No comprehensive medical examinations beyond those included in the appointment process are conducted routinely. Medical examinations are arranged, however, when staff report symptoms of apparently job related illness or injury.
The significance of repetition strain injury as an occupational health problem has only recently been recognised. The Department of Health is researching the problem and it is expected that an Occupational Health Guide will be issued to Departments in the near future. My Department and statutory authorities under my jurisdiction, subject to the availability of resources, will endeavour to comply with any recommendations put forward by the Department of Health.
(2) and (3) See (l) above.
Operation of Visual Display Units: Department ofAdministrative Services
(Question No. 4421)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction, (a) what steps have been taken to make operators of visual display units and screen based equipment aware of the need for a sufficient break from operating this equipment, having regard to the nature of the task and the need for involvement in substantially different activities during the break, as per Public Service Board memorandum 81/418 entitled 'Operation of Visual Display Units and other Screen Based Equipment', (b) what percentage of their working day (i) are operators expected to spend on operating duties and (ii) do operators spend on other duties and (c) how many keystrokes per 7 hour 21 minute day (i) are operators expected to complete and (ii) do operators actually complete.
Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
Within my Department and the Statutory Authorities under my portfolio there are a large number of visual display units installed which are used for a variety of purposes. Some of these are operated on a full-time basis for data processing while others are used by staff on a part-time or intermittent basis for inquiry or retrieval of information related to their work. Because the question of rest breaks refers particularly to full-time operators I have confined my answer to that group which comprises data processing operators, word processing operators and photo-typesetters.

2546 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

(a) The Public Service Board's memorandum referred to in the question has been promulgated throughout all areas of my Department.
(b) (i) Word processing operators are expected to spend most of their time on operating duties. One hour per day is allowed for rest breaks which can be taken intermittently throughout the day by arrangement with the Supervisor.
Data processing operators spend between 4t and 6t hours on operating duties with rest breaks ranging between 30 minutes and I hour.
Photo-typesetters at the Government Printing Office spend approximately 7t hours of their 8t hour shift at the terminal keying in from hard copy. Rest breaks are taken as morning and afternoon tea breaks.
(ii) Word processing operators spend between t and I t hours per day on other duties, such as operating printers, filing and associated tasks.
Data processing operators spend between t and 2 hours on other duties such as sorting, filing and processing documentation.
Photo-typesetters spend about t hour per 8t hour shift collecting copy to work from.
(c) Statistics are available for the following areas:
(i) Australian Electoral Office (DPO's)-50,OOO to 65,000 keystrokes per day. Australian Survey Office (DPO's)-25,000 keystrokes per day. Government Printing Office (Phototypesetters) --6,000 characters per hour.
(ii) Australian Electoral Office-60,000 to 70,000 keystrokes per day. Australian Survey Office-20,000 keystrokes per day. Government Printing Office-6,OOO characters per hour.
Operation of Visual Display Units: Department of Veterans' Affairs
(Question No. 4425)
Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1982:
In respect of the Minister's Department and statutory authorities within his jurisdiction, (a) what steps have been taken to make operators of visual display units and screen based equipment aware of the need for a sufficient break from operating this equipment, having regard to the nature of the task and the need for involvement in substantially different activities during the break, as per Public Service Board memorandum 81/418 entitled 'Operation of Visual Display Units and other Screen Based Equipment', (b) what percentage of their working day (i) are operators expected to spend on operating duties and (ii) do operators spend on other duties and (c) how many keystrokes per 7 hour 21 minute day (i) are operators expected to complete and (ii) do operators actually complete.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(a) The Department has used the Public Service Board's memorandum 81/418 'Operation of Visual Display Units and

Other Screen Based Equipment' as the basis for a policy statement covering aspects such as entitlements and responsibilities of staff using this equipment. It also affirms the role of the supervisor particularly in relation to arriving at a consensus, not only on rest breaks, but safe working standards and the working environment.
(b) and (c) Precise answers to the questions asked are not possible. Operators' workloads vary depending on, for example, whether they work as part of the typing resources, as data input staff within 'pure' automatic data processing areas or on a casual basis. Our experience indicates that the percentage of working day on operating duties fluctuates between 60-90 per cent depending on activity and daily workload pressures. Similarly, statistics on keystrokes made are not maintained. Within the typing areas, production records compiled reflect pages produced and no darg is set or expected. Productivity and operator workload are parts of the supervisor's responsibility to manage efficiently.
Defence: Tenders for Training Helicopters
(Question No. 4448)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:
(I) What is the status of tenders for training helicopters for the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy.
(2) Have Bell Helicopters Australia discussed with his Departemnt the possibility of a new Bell tender being more beneficial to the Department should the validity of the existing tenders be allowed to lapse by effiuxion of time; if so, what is the propriety of this course.
(3) Has any deferment in finalising tenders been taken into consideration or been decided upon.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Evaluation of tenders has been completed and my Department will be making an equipment selection recommendation to me very soon.
(2) My Department is not planning to allow tenders to expire for the purpose of illlowing a revised offer by Bell to be formally considered.
(3) Yes. The final selection has been delayed slightly while the Government reviewed the Defence program but is now proceeding.
Tax Avoidance Schemes
(Question No. 4457)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:
(l) Has he expressed concern at the significant exploitation through expenditure recoupment tax avoidance arrangements and at the fact that these schemes exploit income tax rebate deductions for calls paid on shares, that is, afforestation and petroleum exploration companies.
(2) Is it a fact that (a) the amendment to Part IV (A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act is inadequate to deal with these tax avoidance schemes and (b) Part IV (A), that is the revamped section 260, is deficient as it fails to deal with rebate tax avoidance and enormous tax revenue loss has occurred and is occurring.
(3) If so, will he take immediate action to block this loophole and in doing so have the date of effect of any measures applied retrospectively to May 1981.

Answers to Questions

6 and 7 May 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 2547

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (3) The Government has on several occasions in recent years expressed unequivocally its opposition to blatant and artificial tax avoidance schemes. Legislation dealing with 'expenditure recoupment' schemes of tax avoidance was first foreshadowed on 24 September 1978, in relation to a range of losses and outgoings.
My statement of 9 February 1982 foreshadowed further amendments, to apply from 24 September 1978, to counter schemes that attempted to exploit the income tax rebates and deductions for calls paid on shares in afforestation companies and the rebate for moneys paid on shares in petroleum exploration companies.
(2) As I explained in my statement of 9 February 1982, the Commissioner of Taxation is confident that 'expenditure recoupment' schemes which are entered into after 27 May 1981 and seek to obtain a tax benefit by way of deductions will be struck down by the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IV (A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which operate from that date. Any scheme so struck down will be subject to the additional tax provisions which attach generally to schemes to which Part IV (A) applies.
Part IV (A) is confined to tax avoidance schemes which involve assessable income or allowable deductions and, because of the fact, my statement of 9 February 1982 gave notice that any rebate scheme entered into after that date which becomes subject to the 'expenditure recoupment' provisions will attract additional tax on the same basis as schemes covered by Part IV (A).
Foreign Ownership and Control of Australian Commerce and Industry
(Question No. 4458)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:
Further to his answers to Question Nos 2676 and 3276 (Hansard, 16 February 1982, pages 112-3 and 115-6, and 21

April 1982, page 1707), is it a fact that it is the Government's intention to request the Australian Bureau of Statistics to reintroduce the surveys measuring the extent of foreign ownership and control in sectors of the Australian economy; if so, in view of this commitment can he now make public in what areas statistics will be kept and, in particular, whether the collection of statistical information will be resumed in relation to the level of (a) foreign investment in enterprises in Australia (preliminary), (b) foreign ownership and control of (i) general insurance business, (ii) life insurance business, (iii) finance companies, (iv) mining industry, (v) accredited advertising agencies, (vi) tourist accommodation establishments and (vii) manufacturing industry, (c) foreign control in or of (i) manufacturing industry, study of large enterprise groups, (ii) mineral exploration, (iii) finance companies, (iv) life insurance business, (v) general insurance, (vi) registered financial corporations and (vii) the mining industry, and (d) research and experimental development-private enterprise.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
For information on this matter, I refer the honourable member to my answer to his Question No. 4074.
Unemployment Benefit Recipients: Statistics
(Question No. 4462)
Mr Hawke asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 April 1982:

(3) Is this shell clearance operation of a beneficial nature for the Western Australian Government; if so, what will be the level of financial support from that Government.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The increase is to cover the costs of operations required for the clearance of unexploded ordnance from property in the Warnbro area. After experience gained during initial clearance operations, the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments agreed to extend the scope of the operations.
(2) $2,000 has been provided for public liability insurance.
(3) The clearance operations are being undertaken to rehabilitate land contaminated by Commonwealth activities.
Energy Conservation
(Question No. 4486)
Mr Howe asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 27 April 1982:
(I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the analysis undertaken by BHP in its February 1982 'NEWS Review,' which shows that between 1973 and 1981 Australia has lagged behind major OECD countries in improving conservation in energy use.
(2) What are the Government's programs to improve Australia's performance in energy intensity or the amount of energy required per unit of output.
(3) What research has the Minister's Department taken to assess the impact of existing and proposed aluminium smelters on Australia's performance in reducing energy intensity during the I980s.
Mr Anthony-The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

t Comparable changes for BHP data based on the period
1973 to 1981 were 4.9 per cent and -8.5 per cent respectively.
t Reflects the effect, inter alia, of the introduction of full
import parity pricing of crude oil from 15 August 1978.
International comparisons of these figures are complicated by a number of factors which were acknowledged in the BHP study. In particular, many OECD countries were heavily committed to oil fired electricity generation when the oil prices jumped in 1973 and those countries have had a much greater scope and incentive to reduce their oil use than in the case of

Australia, where less than 5 per cent of electricity generation is oil-based. Again, the demand for oil for transport purposes is a more significant part of total oil demand in Australia than in many OECD countries and conservation is less easily achieved in that sector (although good progress is being madepetrol consumption in 1981, for example, was only 0.7 per cent higher than in 1979, after declining in 1980.) It is relevant also that Australia's comparative advantage in the supply of energy has been an important factor in attracting aluminium and other energy intensive industries while less well placed countries have been endeavouring to contain the growth of such industries.
(2) The Government has taken a number of measures designed to encourage conservation of energy and the substitution of oil by other energy forms, including import parity pricing of domestic crude oil; taxation incentives for the conversion and replacement of oil-fired and LPG-fired stationary equipment; sales tax exemptions on solar applicances and equipment and on non-oil fuel space heating appliances; tax deductions for home insulation and mains electricity connections; price and tax incentives to encourage automotive use of LPG; fuel economy goals for new passenger vehicles; expenditure on research and development of energyconservation technologies; and q variety of energy conservation information and education programs.
The oil demand to GDP ratio shown in (I) above indicates that these measures are having their desired effect. At the same time, it should be appreciated that, to the extent Australia enjoys a comparative advantage in the provision of energy and thereby attracts aluminium and other energy intensive industries to its shores, the overall energy demand to GDP ratio in Australia will tend to move in a different direction from that for other countries which do not enjoy this advantage.
(3) My Department endeavours to assess the impact of current and prospective aluminium smelting operations on the Australian energy scene in the course of preparing its energy demand and supply forecasts (see my Department's publication entitled 'Forecasts of Energy Demand and SupplyPrimary and Secondary Fuels, Australia: 1980-81 to 1989-90', AGPS, June 1981). The comment in (2) above about structural changes in the energy market is also relevant here.
Supporting Parents Benefits and Widows Pensions
(Question No. 4492)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 28 April 1982:
(I) Is there a difference in the way maintenance payments are taken into account in payment of supporting parents benefits and widow's pensions; ifso, why.
(2) Will the Minister give consideration to removing any variation; if not, why not.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.
(I) Yes. Under the widow's pension provisions of the Social Services Act maintenance in excess of $6 per week paid for a child and received by a divorcee or a deserted wife is treated as the mother's income in determining her pension entitlement. When supporting mother's (now supporting parent's) benefit was introduced it was intended that this provision would also apply to all classes of supporting mothers. However, due to a drafting deficiency the law did not give effect to that intention and the present position is that any

Answers to Questions

maintenance received in respect of a child of a person in receipt of a supporting parent's benefit is not taken into account as the parent's income.
(2) Yes.
Vietnam Veterans: Claims
(Question No. 4510)
Mr Holding asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 April 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the cartoon 'Wakka and Coy in Army-The Soldiers' Newspaper; Number 567 of 22 April 1982.
(2) Have any protests been made to him, his Department, or the Army about this cartoon; if so, what are the details.
(3) Does this cartoon cast a slur on Vietnam veterans; ifso, will he repudiate this cartoon and call for a retraction to be printed in the next edition of the paper.
(4) Will he give a direction to both civilian and service personnel under his control that the claims of Vietnam veterans, whether serving or not, should be treated with the same seriousness as t hose of veterans of other wars; if not, why not.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) No, not prior to the honourable member's question.
(2) Yes. A telegram from the New South Wales President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia protesting at the cartoon was received by the Editor Army Newspaper.
(3) No. No slur was intended by the cartoonist (a Vietnam veteran) or is acknowledged to exist by Army editorial staff. The Army, as a matter of principle, would not publish material derogating in any way, serving or former members who, indeed, comprise its main readership.
The cartoon makes no specific reference to Vietnam. The honourable member may not be aware that agent amber, referred to in the cartoon is a serviceman's allusion to beer. To place any other construction on this allusion would misconstrue the aim and point of the cartoon. I see no need to repudiate the cartoon.
(4) Claims submitted by Vietnam veterans are treated no differently from any other claims. No direction as sought is, therefore, necessary.
Health Services to Aboriginals in Victoria
(Question No. 5414)
Mr Holding asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 29 April 1982:
(I) Is the Minister able to say when the Victorian Minister for Health received the report of the working party established to examine future arrangements for health services to Aboriginals within the State.
(2) Have any aspects of this report been implemented; if so, which.
(3) What is the expected level of contribution by the Commonwealth to the implementation of this program.
Mr Wilson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
( I ) June 1982.
(2) Yes.
(a) Nine Aboriginal Community-controlled Health Cooperatives recommended by the report are now fully operational, with approval in principle for funding another in 1982-83.

(b) The Aboriginal Health Resources consultative Group has been established.
(c) A training course for Aboriginal health workers has been initiated by the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service, using private funding sources.
(d) the Victorian Health Commission has approved 16 Aboriginal hospital liaison officer positions which are currently being filled.
(3) It is expected that the Commonwealth will contribute a total of $402,000 to the new arrangements in 1981-82. Of this amount $223,000 represents additional funding after taking into account an amount of $179,000 transferred from the health program formerly financed through the Health Commission.
Sheltered Workshops
(Question No. 4520)
Mr Beazley asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 April 1982:
How many payments have been made to sheltered workshops in the form of a bonus as encouragement to place disabled workers in outside employment.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
570 training fees were paid to sheltered workshops for successfully placing disabled people in outside employment from the introduction of the scheme in 1970 until IS March 1982 (the latest date for which figures are available).
Compensation for Noise-induced Hearing Losses
(Question No. 4522)
Dr Blewett asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 April 1982:
(1) What is the usual delay between the notification of a noise-induced hearing loss claim to the Commonwealth Compensation Commissioner and the resolution of that claim.
(2) Are there any departmental estimates of comparisons between noise-induced hearing loss compensation costs and the costs of prevention of noise in the workplace; if so, what are the details.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) The Commissioner for Employees' Compensation has informed me that no records are kept of the time taken to determine claims for compensation in respect of noise induced hearing loss. However, the Commissioner has provided the following information which should be of assistance to the honourable member:
It has long been the practice in the Office of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation to rely on the expert services of the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) in the determination of claims for loss of hearing. In all such claims Delegates of the Commissioner are instructed to arrange examination by NAL preparatory to determination of the claim. The time taken to determine a claim is thus largely dependent on the waiting time for appointments with NAL.
Recently, it came to the Commissioner's attention that the delay in obtaining appointments in Sydney, Melbourne

2550 REPRESENTATIVES 6 and 7 May 1982

Answers to Questions

and Adelaide had reached unacceptable levels. Because of this delay, some claimants may have had to wait in excess of twelve months for their claim to be determined. To overcome the problem new procedures have since been introduced. First, while the delay at NAL continues, claimants will not be referred to NAL-instead they will be tested by audiologists in hospitals or private practice and medically examined by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist Medical Referees. It is hoped that this will reduce the delay considerably. In addition, where a claimant submits satisfactory ENT specialist medical opinion with his claim, the claim will be determined on the basis of that opinion without referral to NAL or a Medical Referee.
In Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart the waiting tinie for NAL appointments is six weeks or less. There would be no appreciable delay in determining claims where NAL examination is required in those cities.
(2) So far as the Commissioner is aware no such estimates have been made. He has ascertained, however, that this matter was examined in detail by Messrs D. C. Gibson and M. P. Norton and their findings were published in an article 'Economics of Industrial Noise Control in Australia' in the May/June 1981 issue of the journal 'Noise Control Engineering' I am arranging for a copy of the article to be sent to the honourable member.
Electoral Enrolments
(Question No. 4529)
Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 May 1982:
(I) What are the latest enrolment figures available for each Federal Electoral Division in New South Wales.
(2) On the basis of the latest available figures, what is now the quota for New South Wales Divisions.
(3) What is the percentage variation of each New South Wales Division above or below this quota.
(4) How many New South Wales Divisions vary from quota by more than 10 per cent, which Divisions are they, and what percentage of the total number of New South Wales Divisions are they.
(5) Does sub-paragraph 25 (2) (b) (i) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provide that a redistribution may be made whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of the State the number of electors differs from a quota ascertained in accordance with that part of the Act to a greater extent than one-tenth more or one-tenth less.
Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

Work Preparation Centre, Marrickville, New South Wales
(Question No. 4543)
Mr Leo McLeay asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 5 May 1982:
(I) What was the cost of establishing the Work Preparation Centre at Carrington Road, Marrickville, New South Wales.
(2) How many people are employed at the Centre.
(3) What are their salaries.
(4) How many trainees are under instruction.
(5) What is the length of instruction courses.
(6) What proportion of trainees are placed in employment within 3 months of completing a training course.
Mr Wilson-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question:
(I) The cost of establishing the Work Preparation Centre at Carrington Road, Marrickville, NSW, which is to be officially opened on 3 June 1982, was $393,000. This figure includes fit-out costs, plant and equipment and furniture and fittings.
(2) Fifteen staff are presently employed at the Work Preparation Centre. In addition, the Centre utilises the services of specialists for several hours per week on a sessional basis. The staff at the Centre work as a team which consists of a wide range of professionals such as psychologists, social workers, vocational counsellors and trade instructors, who combine their skills to meet the wide range of problems and needs of each client.
(3) The salaries of staff at the Centre range from $11,480 for the lowest paid administrative/clerical position, to a maximum of $22, 160 for the highest paid professional position.

placements in employment. As the Centre commenced operations only recently some twenty trainees are presently attending. This number will be gradually increased as the Centre's very diverse and complex programme is fully implemented.
(5) Training programmes in similar centres normally extend over a period ranging from 6 to 12 months. Programmes are not of a fixed duration as they are tailored to meet the specific and often complex needs of individual trainees. The programme for each trainee is adjusted as needed throughout the course of the training. This is achieved using an advanced method of instruction incorporating programme material developed by Macquarie University for these Centres.
(6) As the Marrickville Centre had its initial intake of trainees on 22 February 1982, there has not yet been time for any trainee to complete training and enter employment. However, some 75 per cent of trainees completing programs at the first Sydney Work Preparation Centre at Granville during the six months ended 31 December 1981 were placed in employment. Experience shows that these Centres are highly successful in placing people in employment.
On-farm Use of Pesticides
(Question No. 4561)
Mr Holding asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 May 1982:
With reference to the documents circulated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to primary producers advising them of statistics which will be collected for the year ending March 1983 and specifically mentioning new items to be included in the 1982-83 census, (a) what is the reason for collecting information about on-farm useage of pesticides in Australia, and why has this data not been required before, and (b) why have the States of South Australia and Queensland been specifically excluded from the coming survey.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) The intention of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect information about on-farm use of pesticides in the 1982-83 Agricultural Census is in response to requests from agricultural authorities in several States. Similar information on both herbicides and pesticides has been collected in the past, in years and States as follows:
1975-76NSW, Vic., WA and Tas. I976-77-WA and Tas. 1977-78-WA 1978-79-WA 1979-80-NSW, Vic., WA, Tas. and ACT.
The purpose of collecting the information is to enable the State departments concerned to identify the regions in which herbicides and pesticides are used in the control and eradication of weeds and insect pests, the types of crops treated, and the methods of application.
(b) Similar information is not being sought in Queensland and South Australia because of the lower priority accorded the pesticides data by the relevant agricultural authorities, relative to other information sought by those authorities, in a situation where the Australian Bureau of Statistics seeks to limit the size of the Agricultural Census form to minimise reporting burden on farmers.

(3) How many visually handicapped Aboriginals in the Katherine region are being assisted by this program.
(4) What is its estimated cost in (a) 1981-82 and (b) 1982-83.
Mr Wilson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I), (2) and (3) The Australian National Council of and for the Blind did not take up an offer of a grant from my Department to conduct the survey. The ANCB undertook to provide to my Department advice on the feasibility of the project in 1982-83. When this advice is received it will be considered along with other priorities for funding.
(4) Funding of $36,000 for the survey was approved in 1981-82. These funds are not now required for the present financial year and will be directed to other Aboriginal health projects. In respect of funding in 1982-83, the answer to (I), (2) and (3) above refers.

Only one formal meeting of the Joint Commission has been held to date. Agreements and economic relations established at that meeting are referred to in the answer to question number (2) below.
(2) The visit to Australia by the Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce H.E. Dr Soliman Abdul Aziz AI-Solaim in April this year marked the occasion of the inaugrural meeting of the Australia/Saudi Arabia Joint Commission. At that meeting agreement was reached on the procedures to be followed for the future operations of the Joint Commission. In the commercial area, a contract was signed during the meeting between the Saudi Meteorology and Environmental Protection Administration (MEPA) and the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation (AOPC) relating to the provision of Australian expertise in the development of the Administration's scientific and technical programs. The duration of the contract is for two years at a total cost of $11.25 million.

Answers to Questions

In addition to these specific agreements the Joint Commission, which included senior businessmen from both countries, examined various ways of fostering the trade and economic relationship and the possibilities for further Australian involvement in the major developmental projects taking place in the Kingdom. Discussions canvassed the possibilities for increased sales to Saudi Arabia of Australian commodities such as wheat, barley, meat and sugar; for co-operation in areas such as minerals, agriculture, medical and health services, railways and standards and for developing closer cooperation between businessmen of both countries.
(3) In addition to Saudi Arabia, Joint Commissions or Committees have been established under Agreements Australia has concluded with Bahrain (Agreement on Trade, Economic Relations and Technical Co-operation signed on 15 May 1979), Iraq (Agreement on Trade, Economic and Technical Co-operation signed II March 1980), Oman (Agreement on Trade, Economic Relations and Technical Cooperation signed on 20 October 1981) and Kuwait (Agreement on Economic and Technical Co-operation signed 22 April 1982).
Generally, these Agreements provide that the Joint Commission or Committee shall meet at times to be mutually arranged by the two countries. The regularity of meetings varies from country to country. In some instances, for example, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, it is envisaged that Joint Commission meetings will be held on an annual basis while in other cases there may not be a need for regular annual meetings.
With respect to Bahrain the inaugural meeting of the Australia/Bahrain Joint Committee was held in February 1981. At that meeting agreement was reached on a number of measures designed to encourage an expansion of Australian exports to Bahrain and to develop closer co-operation in the agricultural and industrial/servicing areas. The inaugural meeting of the Australia/Iraq Joint Commission was held in Baghdad in March 1982. The Joint Commission reviewed trading relations between the two countries and agreed to cooperate in an effort to expand and diversify trade and other bilateral relations particularly in the area of agriculture. Meetings of the Joint Commission with Oman and Kuwait, which have only recently been established, have yet to be held.

Answers to Questions

Taxation Review Committee
(Question No. 4662)
Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 May 1982:
(I) Did the Taxation Review Committee, in its 1975 report, reach one conclusion which it believed should be acceptable to a broad spectrum of public opinion; if so, was that conclusion that the emphasis of taxation should be shifted away from the taxation of income towards the taxation of goods and services.
(2) Did the committee also claim that a shift in this direction would go far towards achieving the principal aims set for it in its terms of reference if it were accompanied by a tax on capital gains.
(3) Did the committee state on page 433 of the report that the introduction of a capital gains tax requires considerable public discussion.
(4) If so, what steps has the Government taken to encourage debate on this subject.
Mr Howard~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) One of the major recommendations of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee in 1975 was that Australia's relatively high degree of reliance on income tax be reduced.
(2) and (3) The Committee concluded that there was a strong case for taxing capital gains but there would be practical difficulties in introducing such a tax, particularly in inflationary times, and that the question should be a matter for public debate.
(4) There has been considerable public debate on this matter.
Personal Income Tax
(Question No. 4663)
Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 May 1982:
(I) Is the personal income tax still progressive.
(2) What evidence can he provide to support his answer to part (I).
(3) Does his answer take into account tax evasion and tax avoidance.

(4) What have been the changes to the progression of the tax since January 1976.
Mr Howard~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) The personal income tax rate scale is so designed that as incomes rise a higher proportion is taken in tax.
(3) Because of their very nature tax evasion and tax avoidance cannot be taken into consideration.
(4) Apart from indexation adjustments to the personal income tax rate scale which were intended to reduce the effect that inflation has on tax rates, the most significant change to the rate scale since 1975-76 was the introduction of the standard rate system in 1977-78. The number of steps in the rate scale was reduced from 7 to 3 at that time. Because of the wider steps individuals can now earn more before being taxed at a higher marginal rate and to that extent the change could be said to have reduced progression.
Animal Welfare Groups: Tax Deductions
(Question No. 4664)
Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 May 1982:
( I) Are donations over $2 made to the RSPCA tax deductible.
(2) Are there more than 40 other animal welfare groups in Australia to which donations do not attract this form of tax deductibility; if so, why.
(3) How does the Government distinguish between the RSPCA and the many conservation groups which attract this tax deductibility for donations and other animal welfare groups which do not.
(4) Will he consider rectifying any anomaly.
Mr Howard~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Legislation has been introduced into the Parliament to allow income tax deductions in respect of gifts of $2 or more to the RSPCA and its Queensland and Northern Territory equivalents.
(2), (3) and (4) I am currently examining the position in relation to other animal welfare societies which, I note, differ widely in geographical coverage, size and particular interests.
