That this House-
(I) notes with concern calls by Government back benchers, as reported in the national Press of 22 April, for personal income tax cuts coupled with increases in indirect taxation and reduced social welfare spending;
(2) condemns an approach to tax reform which shifts the emphasis in this country from direct to indirect taxation without compensating increases in social security benefits for pensioners and other low-income earners from the regressive effects of that shift; and
(3) calls on the Government to ensure that any taxation changes contemplated in the coming Budget will restore the principle that our taxation system be based on the taxpayer's ability to pay.

That this House is of the opinion that the insistence by Fairfax Publication that its starting prices for gallopers, trotters and dogs be considered the official starting price for all bets made with illegal starting price bookmakers conflicts with its often expressed concern with gambling and calls for consideration by the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE
EVASION OF CUSTOMS DUTY Mr JOHN BROWN-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in the process of prosecuting a world class Australian sportsman for evasion of customs duty? Has the Prime Minister intervened in any respect and at any time with the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs or with any other authority on behalfof this sportsman? Will the Prime Minister direct the newly appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to table all the relevant papers on this matter in the House?
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I do not know what papers there are on this matter. One sportsman did speak to me in relation to a certain matter and an argument he had been having with the Bureau of Customs. Having spoken to me about other matters and having sought an interview about other matters, he then raised this matter. I have mentioned the matter to the Minister responsible for Customs matters, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. At all times he is required to carry out the law as it exists and to exhibit no favour to any person, no matter what his position or status may be. They are the rules that I would expect to have applied. A directive issued in 1976 made it very plain that as far as this Government is concerned all Australian citizens, not just Ministers and parliamentarians, no matter what their status, should be treated equally in relation to these matters.
Mr John Brown-Will you table the papers?
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-There are no papers as far as I am concerned.

Questions Without Notice

SUGAR EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES
Mr BRAITHWAITE-My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Resources. Has the Australian Government objected to the Government of the United States of America about the United States proposal to introduce sugar import quotas which would seriously limit our access to that market, bearing in mind that last year Australia shipped some 800,000 tonnes of sugar to the United States? Secondly, in view of this proposed restriction of sales opportunities in the United States and of the depressed worldwide sugar market, can the Government persuade the Western Australian Government of the futility of proposing to establish a sugar industry on the Ord River?
Mr ANTHONY-I am very concerned about reports that United States officials and the Administration are examining the possibility of imposing import quotas on sugar. Last year the United States was our largest market for sugar: We exported some 800,000 tonnes to it. Therefore, any restraints on that market would have severe implications for Australia. I am told that under the United States agriculture and food Act, which was brought down in 1981 to bring in a special price support arrangement for the domestic sale of sugar, it is not possible for the United States to increase protection by way of duties and fees beyond a certain margin. Therefore, the only way of doing it is by introducing an import quota arrangement. What concerns me is the report that Australia is likely to be discriminated against because the United States is looking at ways and means of giving special benefits which would result in a preferred position for some of the Caribbean countries. I would react strongly if I thought the United States was doing this at the expense of Australia.
We all know the reason for the very low price of sugar, which is below 9c a pound. That is a totally unprofitable price, caused largely by the heavy dumping of European sugar on to the world market. European sugar is being produced in excess by means of various forms of industry assistance, incentives and subsidies and then is being unfairly placed on the world market. We have made strong representations to the United States. Last week I wrote to the Special Trade Representative, Mr Brock, to express our concern about import quotas and the possibility that we might be discriminated against. This week the Vice President of the United States, Mr Bush, will be coming to Australia. The case of the Australian sugar industry will be put firmly to the Vice President. I hope that he will take back to the

United States the message of our concern in relation to action that the United States might take. If the United States does move to introduce quotas I hope that they are non-discriminatory and that Australia's performance will be taken into account.
So far as the Ord River is concerned those parties who are interested in developing an industry on the Ord River, along with the Western Australian Government, should consider the commercial implications of the possible action of the United States-indeed, of the whole of the world sugar market situation. Any people getting involved in the production of sugar in the Ord River area, particularly the Western Australian Government, cannot expect that governments will automatically come in to underwrite them with subventions to keep the sugar industry profitable and viable. It is terribly important that they do not make any rushed or wild decisions, and that during these consultations there are full discussions with the Australian sugar industry to see what are the best arrangements that can be made to ensure the continuing viability not only of our existing industry but also of any new industry that might develop on the Ord.
EMBEZZLEMENT FROM AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY
Mrs KELLYI direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the Minister to his answer, given through Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in the Senate last week, that his Department, after 'a careful check', is not aware of any embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Tehran. When did the Minister's Department inquire into the matter, and at whose initiative? When did the Minister receive advice from his Department that there was no embezzlement? Is it a fact that the Department of Finance is now inquiring into this matter? At whose initiative is the Department of Finance conducting the inquiry? Why is there a Department of Finance inquiry in view of the fact that the Foreign Affairs Department has found no embezzlement and the Minister has given this assurance to the Parliament? Finally, if the Minister played a role in initiating the Department of Finance inquiry, is it because he does not trust the advice of his Department and believes he was misled?
Mr STREET-I shall have to check carefully some of the dates involved in the honourable member's question. The subsequent investigations arose from the question asked by Senator Primmer in the Senate about alleged embezzlement some years ago in Tehran. I asked my Department to make investigations about that, naturally, to

Questions Without Notice

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1847

give the honourable senator an answer to his question, and no evidence of any such embezzlement was found. I then replied to the honourable senator saying that, as far as I was aware, and according to investigations conducted by my Department, no such misappropriation of funds had taken place. However, I also said to the honourable senator that if he or anyone who had been in touch with him had any evidence of such financial misappropriation, would they please let me know. There the matter rested, from early March, I think, until 24 March. On 24 March an officer of my Department got in touch with me and said that he believed he had evidence which would lead to a finding that some misappropriation had taken place. I immediately asked the officer concerned to provide to me whatever evidence he could get together, and said that I would then seek from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, an undertaking that that evidence, when it was produced, would be investigated by the Department of Finance. At that time. I left for my visit to the Middle East. On my return the papers were delivered to me from an officer of my Department. At my initiative, therefore, the Minister for Finance agreed to undertake an investigation into them. I got a letter of acknowledgment from the Minister for Finance, last week I think, and in my reply to that letter of acknowledgment I suggested to the Minister for Finance that, first of all, if the people undertaking the investigation felt that any other papers were required by them, they would be made available by my Department-that is, in addition to the papers which had already been passed to them-and secondly, that if, as a result of these inquiries, it was felt at any time that it would be appropriate to seek the advice of the Attorney-General, that that should be done. I also wrote in similar terms to the Attorney-General.
Mrs Kelly-But last Tuesday, through Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, you said that there was no embezzlement.
Mr STREET-That is as complete an answer as I can give.
NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE TRIBUNAL INQUIRY
Mr SPENDER-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is there any action which the Government proposes to take or ought to take arising out of the findings made by the Police tribunal inquiry into Mr Deputy Commissioner Allen?
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I have today written to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, asking that all the papers and files relating

to this inquiry be made available to the Australian Federal Police. It is quite clear that there could be some external matters relating to Mr Allen's behaviour that could transgress Commonwealth laws. Whether that is so or not is a matter for the Commonwealth police to determine. I hope very much that the New South Wales Government will respond in a co-operative way and make those files available. Sir Colin Woods, through the normal police net, is also making the same request.
BUREAU OF CUSTOMS: STAFFING STRUCTURE
Mr LEO McLEAYMy question is addressed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Is it a fact that there has been considerable agitation in the Bureau of Customs regarding the adequacy of staffing at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport for many years? Is it further a fact that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has been seeking the Public Service Board's agreement to a restructuring of the Bureau for four years? Is it a fact that following the resignations of the former Minister for Health and the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs the Chairman of the Public Service Board made the first substantial response to the Minister's Department last week? Was the basis of that approach an offer by the Board to negotiate a new staffing structure for the Bureau? Is it a fact that the approach was made at the behest of the Prime Minister? Will the Minister undertake to advise the House when this new staffing structure will be implemented?
Mr N. A. BROWN-There has been a long standing investigation with respect to staffing matters in the Bureau of Customs. That has been done at the highest level. The matter is still under review. At the appropriate time. I will make an announcement on the subject.
AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL AUTHORITY
Mr GROOM-Is the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment aware of concern being expressed about the operations and effectiveness of the Australian Bicentennial Authority? Will the Minister briefly state the achievements of the Authority and inform the House of any major decisions the Authority has made since its formation was first announced in this House over three years ago? What will be the cost of salaries and other administrative expenses of the Authority during the present financial year, and how many people are now employed by it? When will the Minister be in a position to provide the House with an up to

Mr WILSON-I am aware of the honourable member's continuing interest and the part that he has played in his electorate in developing the atmosphere for the Australian Bicentenary. The Authority was established and set up in 1980. Since then it has been talking with the Australian community at all levels. It has been setting up machinery at national and State levels. It has been conducting some feasibility studies into a limited number of possible major events. It has had discussions with governments, both Commonwealth and State. As a result of those discussions the Prime Minister made a statement in December last year in which he announced some decisions by the Commonwealth. They included decisions that the theme of the celebration is to be the Australian achievement and that the celebration is to be a primarily Australian occasion. The Commonwealth recognises that Australians in their communities, as members of families and as individuals, in their local government areas and in their States, will all in their own several ways want to celebrate the Bicentenary. The Commonwealth has indicated that it will take responsibility for the national and international program. In fact, the Bicentennial Authority has been given the task of bringing up a report as to what that national-international program should be. I anticipate receiving a report from the Authority in the second half of this year.
The Authority has been successful at all levels in the community in making Australians aware of the significance of 1988. It has been playing a catalyst role which it will need to continue to play in the time immediately ahead. Its function also is to act as a co-ordinator, not merely of the national-international program but as a source of advice and co-ordination for State and local programs during the bicentennial celebrations because all Australians will want to be able to celebrate this very significant occasion with their own ideas and their own resources. For that purpose the Authority has had, in the current financial year, a budget of about $2.4m. It has a staff of 40 full time officers and two part time officers, all of whom are needed as the Authority moves into this very important phase of developing the advice that it will be giving to the Commonwealth as to the national-international program and providing a catalyst and co-ordinating role at State and community levels.
KAKADU NATIONAL PARK
Mr WEST-My question is directed to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment.

Given the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 for the leasing of Aboriginal land in the Alligator Rivers area to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for inclusion in the Kakadu National Park, what is the timetable for the transfer of the latest successful land claim to the relevant lands trust? What consultations are taking place between the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding transfer and subsequent lease of relevant land in the Alligator Rivers region for declaration in stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park? When will stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park be declared under the present National Parks and Wildlife ConservationAct?
Mr WILSON-Consultations are taking place between the departments and authorities to which the honourable member referred. No firm timetable has yet been developed, but the arrangements with regard to the Aboriginal land in stage 2 are quite clear. Under the agreement between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Land Council the land, as a result of being declared Aboriginal land, will be automatically leased to the parks service. The other matters that the honourable member referred to are under active consideration and an announcement concerning the timetable will be made at the appropriate time.
AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND: CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS
Mr O'KEEFE-Can the Minister for Trade and Resources indicate what progress he made last week in negotiations with the New Zealand Government on closer economic relations with that country? Will he assure the House that before any final decisions are made there will be consultation with those Australian industries likely to be affected when the agreement comes into force?
Mr ANTHONY-Last Tuesday and Wednesday I had discussions with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Muldoon, Mr Cooper, Mr Templeton-indeed all the Ministers of the economic committee of the New Zealand Cabinet. I am pleased to say that considerable progress was made, although a number of outstanding issues could not be resolved. However, I will be reporting to Cabinet on these issues and particularly on the ones that are still unresolved. I want to say that the process of bringing about a closer economic relationship with New Zealand is a complex

Questions Without Notice

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1849

issue. Trying to resolve all of the issues involved between countries which produce many of the same products and have specialised marketing arrangements, varying forms of protection against imports and different sorts of export incentives is not necessarily easy.
I would, however, like to mention some of the items that have been under discussion. For instance, how are tariffs to be treated within a closer economic relationship? How are we to handle import restrictions and export incentives? What commodities might need to be deferred in the initial stages of a closer economic relationship? How will we handle various intermediate goods and agricultural support and stabilisation matters? We must also consider customs, quarantine and standards matters, as well as the transitional arrangements involved in changing from the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement to a closer economic relationship. How will we integrate the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement, and how will we have forms of consultation and implement safeguards? Of course, a multitude of industries have already had some discussions; indeed, there has been some agreement. I would like to commend those agricultural industries, such as the sugar industry, the wheat and dairying industries, the wine industry and the forest products industry. They have either come to an understanding or an agreement with their counterparts in New Zealand, or the basis for their treatment under a closer economic relationship is being evolved in consultation with industry.
Dr Everingham-What about fishing?
Mr ANTHONY-And fishing; I am glad the honourable member mentions it. Fishing is an important matter that has to be resolved with New Zealand, particularly in relation to its joint venture arrangements with Soviet fishermen. These are all items that need to be closely examined in order to reach some satisfactory conclusion. Very considerable progress has been made and I hope that it is possible to achieve the objective, that agreement can be reached so that this new closer economic relationship can commence from 1 January 1983. If settlement can be reached on the many items, both primary and secondary, that need resolution, then draft heads of agreement will be prepared and that will enable discussions to take place with the State governments and with industry. Those draft heads of agreement would be necessary before any final conclusion could be reached on a closer economic relationship.
The objective is to bring about a bigger domestic market, a domestic market of 18 million

people. The dynamics it would create are all part of what a bigger trading bloc is about. I ask honourable members to imagine Australia with an additional South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania included in its domestic arrangements, or a State with a population greater than that of Queensland and almost as great as that of Victoria. Of course, it means for New Zealand that in effect it will be six times bigger than it is at the moment. If we can get proper exploitation of resources and rationalisation of industries then we must have more efficient industries for a larger domestic market. That is what a closer economic relationship, a larger trading bloc, is all about, and I believe it is in the interests of both countries to try to achieve it.
SWASTIKA SYMBOL Mr FRY-I direct my question to the Minister for the Capital Territory. As a result of legal advice taken by him last week over the painting of a swastika on a garage door in Charnwood, can he say what powers he has over the painting of symbols on garage doors in the Australian Capital Territory? Will the Minister apologise to the student concerned for his implication that the student was associated with one of the groups given permission to take part in the ANZAC Day march? Will he also apologise to the student for his intemperate outburst in the House over what was apparently an innocent April Fool's Day prank?
Mr HODGMAN-In answer to the first question asked by the honourable member, the matter has now become one of law and if that symbol is, in law, either obscene or objectionable, then an offence has been committed and proceedings may well be instituted. With respect to the second part of the question, I make no apology whatsoever to anyone for what I did on Thursday. My actions were correct and I believe the overwhelming majority of Australians would accept that what I did is correct and would firmly reject the view put forward by the honourable member for Fraser.
TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS: SPEAKERS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES
Mr CHAPMAN-I ask the Minister for Education whether his Department pays the travelling and accommodation expenses of suitable guest speakers at the graduation ceremonies of tertiary institutions. Does it give advice about the appropriate tone, content and length of speeches made at such graduation ceremonies? Is the Minister aware of complaints about the poor quality and taste of some speeches recently made at such ceremonies?

1850 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Questions Without Notice

Mr FIFE-I make it clear to the honourable member for Kingston and to all other honourable members that my Department does not make available to institutions funds to assist in travel, accommodation or other arrangements associated with invitations extended to people to address graduation ceremonies. However, I hasten to add that funds are made available to universities and colleges of advanced education by way of block grants. These, of course, are used for the general recurrent expenses of the institutions concerned. It may be that, in circumstances that the institutions would judge as appropriate, some of those funds are used to assist in bringing an appropriate speaker to a graduation ceremony. In regard to whether advice might or might not be given to a guest speaker I also answer in the negative because that is not a role of my Department or any part of the administration. It is, of course, a matter for the institution concerned to invite a speaker of the type and quality of its choice. No doubt some negotiations take place in relation to the time that a speaker should occupy and also the subject of the particular speech. Again, it is really a matter for judgment and for the taste of the speaker concerned.
I have had no complaints forwarded to me, but I have read reports of an incident last Friday night in respect of which it is alleged that the honourable member for Wills was the guest speaker at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education. According to those reports, it was indicated to the honourable member for Wills, after he had been speaking for some 40 minutes, that the speech was too long and not appropriate for the evening. This came about as a result of a young lady in the audience standing up and stating: 'We have spent four years working towards this evening. We think it is our evening, not yours'. It is a matter for the judgment of the person concerned, when he or she is invited to one of these institution ceremonies, as to the time that is to be occupied and the subject of the speech that is to be given. It is to be deplored when any person, whether a member of this House or somebody outside of it, goes to the graduation ceremony of one of these institutions and makes what has been described as a political speech. It is an occasion for graduates and one when something appropriate should be said, something that would be of interest, and possibly assistance, to those who are graduating.
BANKS: TAXATION Mr HAYDEN-I ask a question of the Minister for Education in his capacity, as I understand it, of Acting Treasurer in this House. We will now establish whether he knows anything about this

subject. Has his attention been drawn to reports of a survey of the profitability of the world's top 150 banks? In particular, has he noted the fact that the survey shows that Australian banks rank first, fifth and sixth in terms of internationally comparable real profitability? Is it also a fact that the far from socialistic Thatcher Government last year imposed a super tax on bank profits when United Kingdom interest rates were well below those now prevailing in Australia? Is it also a fact that with wage and salary earners carrying an ever-increasing burden of the nation's taxation, and indeed interest rate charges, all the evidence now supports, as a matter of equity, consideration by the Government of a special tax on very profitable Australian banks?
Mr FIFE-First, let me correct the impression that the Leader of the Opposition has. I am not the Acting Treasurer at this stage. The Acting Treasurer is Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who is in another place. The question raised by the honourable member contained a great amount of detail. I will take it on notice and see that a thoughtful reply is provided to the Leader of the Opposition.
HOUSING INTEREST RATES Mr SCOTTI refer the Prime Minister to the presence in Canberra of Mrs Glenys Lane and Mr John Knight, two Adelaide residents who are concerned about and have been campaigning against high and increasing interest rates. The Prime Minister will know that these two people have attempted to make an appointment to see him to express the concern of Australian home buyers at the increasing burden of interest rates, but he has refused to see them. Is the Prime Minister aware that they have seen his Minister for Housing and Construction who has told them that the Federal Government has no control over interest rates? Will the Prime Minister tell this House how long his Government intends to remain insensitive to this growing group of concerned Australians? Will he now meet with Mrs Lane and Mr Knight? Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I did receive a message in the middle of a Cabinet meeting this morning saying that Mrs Lane had arrived in Canberra on a plane early this morning, was waiting in King's Hall and would like to see me about the question of interest rates as they affect home buyers. Because Cabinet was sitting I asked the Minister for Housing and Construction whether he would discuss this matter with Mrs Lane. He said he already had but would be delighted to do so again. I have not yet had a report of his subsequent discussion but I will look forward to getting one a little later in the day. It needs to be

Questions Without Notice

understood very clearly that the Government does recognise the burdens that high interest rates place on a large number of people within the Australian community. We recognise in particular the burden that those interest rates can place on home buyers because, unlike businesses, for home buyers interest is not generally tax deductible in Australia. That has not been the Australian practice.
Because of the shortage of capital for lending, in many instances, and because of the price at which available funds were being lent, we introduced a number of changes designed specifically to assist first home buyers, people intending to buy, or those who had bought over recent years. As a result of a wide-ranging package of measures-which, including a greater range of lending by banks, offers shielding from interest rate increases of those who have taken out loans over the last couple of years and, once legislation is passed through this Parliament, provides special tax rebates to certain home buyers including higher rebates for families with children-first home buyers should be assisted very considerably. I know that the Housing Industry Association believes the policy measures that we have introduced are very much worthwhile and that they address the problems as they are at present. In addition to that, the Association believes that the range of measures that we have introduced should re-establish confidence in the home purchase and home building industry. That is very important because, while it has a vested interest in this particular matter, it also recognises that the policies are designed to benefit many thousands of Australians.
We have also abandoned the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and introduced a new approach designed to make sure that funds are available to assist families on settlement to overcome some part of the deposit gap. In recent times a great many things have been done to give recognition to the fact that the home building industry was in difficulty and this was causing hardship to a very large number of Australian families. I believe that the policies have been well received, but I have no doubt that the Government will be monitoring the progress of the policies to see what their impact is in the housing market.
NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE TRIBUNAL INQUIRY
Mr WHITE-My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. In view of the adverse finding against Deputy Police Commissioner Allen by the police tribunal, and the

unanswered questions arising out of that tribunal's inquiry, does the Minister entertain concern for the security of common police operations?
Mr NEWMAN-The honourable member for McPherson asks a very important question which I am sure is of great concern to every member of this House. Over the past few years there have been quite magnificent strides in the amount of common policing effort in this country. I talk particularly about the establishment of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and about the operations of joint task forces with various police forces, including the police force of New South Wales. It is absolutely essential that the integrity and effectiveness of those joint common policing efforts be maintained, but I am afraid that there are many questions which have come out of the Allen inquiry which lead me to be worried about the integrity and effectiveness, as the public sees it, of that common policing effort. Various members of the New South Wales police force are members of joint task forces and there is no doubt that their position as a result of this inquiry makes them feel very exposed.
There are all sorts of questions which the public is demanding be answered. Firstly, allegations of the most grave kind concerning the disbursal of money have been accepted as being quite true. In this regard any reasonable person would be very surprised if Sergeant Molloy was the first and only person ever to be offered money. Secondly, as it stands, there is the strongest possible reason for believing that Mr Allen has been part of the systematic corruption in the vice and gaming areas of New South Wales. Thirdly, the visit of Mr Allen to the United States of America, to Las Vegas, opens up questions of his links, and perhaps other links in the force in New South Wales, with syndicated crime in the United States. Fourthly, public comment suggests that there is a degree of cynicism about the lack of criminal proceedings originally, or even now, arising from the trail of corruption which has been exposed by this inquiry. Lastly, the penalty imposed on Mr Allen does not reflect that fact that Mr Allen's service has been against the best interests of the community in New South Wales. One has to ask how this can entitle him to a comfortable superannuation benefit. It defeats all understanding.
It is absolutely essential that Mr Wran demonstrate to this country that he intends to investigate all those questions and others which arise from this inquiry. When those investigations are complete it is essential that he make the findings public so that everybody may have the benefit of what he has done. I have spoken about the co-operation

1852 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

that exists between the Australian Federal Police and other police forces. This applies particularly to the New South Wales police. As the Prime Minister has indicated, he has written to Mr Wran asking for any details that he can provide to the Australian Federal Police so that we may help the New South Wales police and the New South Wales Government to answer the sorts of questions that I have just raised.
Mr Hurford-I take a point of order. I ask that in accordance with Standing Order 321 the Minister table the document from which he read.
Mr SPEAKER-Has the honourable gentleman been quoting from a document?
Mr NEWMAN-Well, I have been quoting from notes that I have taken, but I have not read from the document completely.
Mr SPEAKER-Is the document confidential?
Mr NEWMAN-One is and one is not. But there are notes--

Mr Scho1es-The Minister should--
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for Corio will remain silent.
Mr NEWMAN-I am not going to table the confidential document. I am quite happy to table my other notes.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman should table the notes.
ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO DRUG TRAFFICKING
Mr HAYDEN-I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to the expanded terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking which now will investigate certain aspects of the Nugan Hand Bank. Did the Prime Minister note that the terms of reference do not make provision, however, for any investigation of allegations which may be directed against a Minister or Ministers of the Government in relation to this matter? Did he note on the weekend in the National Times an article which declared that three -ex-Narcotics Bureau officers gave evidence under oath to the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission that they believed at least two Federal Government Ministers were involved in deflecting the Bureau's inquiry into Nugan Hand Bank and associated matters? In the light of this, will the Prime Minister reconsider the limitations on the expanded terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry to ensure that matters such as this are also properly canvassed there?

Mr MALCOLM FRASER-We have made it plain on many occasions that, if the Stewart Royal Commission believes there ought to be an expansion of the terms of reference, the Government will be prepared to accommodate that. It is worth noting that, subject to checking the records, the New South Wales Government has at no time sugested that there ought to be an expansion of the terms of reference. The honourable gentleman will know that once he was prepared to make documents available to our own law officers, and once they indicated that expansion of the terms of reference was desirable, we acted accordingly and we acted speedily. I have not read the National Times. I still do not read the weekend newspapers. I hope the honourable gentleman is not going to base his allegations and accusations in this Parliament on that kind of scuttlebutt.
TRANS AUSTRALIA AIRLINES
Mr TUCKEY-I refer the Minister for Transport to an article which appeared in the 3 April issue of Business Review, the cover of which reads 'TAA's Nose Dive.' The article includes the following statement:
The gentleman's agreement is gone, Ansett has adapted, but the bureaucrats are still in power at TAA.
It also states:
The federal government has $385m tied up in TAA. Yet the airline is losing money and asking for more.
Has the Minister read the article and, if so, are the quoted statements correct? Is it a fact that the 'TAA Nose Dive' is the result of poor management and not unfair competition created by another airline's ownership of feeder airlines? What action is proposed to resolve these problems?
Mr HUNT-I have not read the article to which the honourable gentleman refers. Trans Australia Airlines' trading position was very seriously handicapped during this financial year as a result of a lengthy dispute which affected only TAA's ground staff. The estimated loss from that dispute was $6m to $7m. The Government has, of course, announced that it will make TAA into a public company. Consultants have been invited to make recommendations to the Government as to how such a company should be formed and what measures should be taken to ensure that if TAA or any portion of it were sold it would not become part of a monopoly airline. I will read the article and respond to the honourable gentleman if I think there are any inaccuracies in it.

Mr Scott-Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.
Mr SPEAKER-I have called the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs)- For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on customs tariff simplification.
PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect)-Mr Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented. Mr SPEAKER-If the honourable member claims to have been misrepresented and wishes to make a personal explanation he may proceed. Dr KLUGMAN-On the Australian Broadcasting Commission news at 12.30 p.m. today a question I asked the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) was quoted which allegedly showed that Australian trade with the Soviet Union has dropped by 14 per cent since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In fact, the answer to the question indicated that the value of trade with the Soviet Union increased from $265m in 1978-79 to $832m last year, a rise of 214 per cent. I assure the House and you, Mr Speaker, that if I had expected the answer to have indicated a drop of 14 per cent I would not have asked the question. Mr SPEAKER-I should indicate to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is the practice in this House for honourable members to let the Speaker know if they wish to make a personal explanation. Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented? Mr SCOTT-Yes, Mr Speaker. Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman may proceed. Mr SCOTT (Hindmarsh)-In reply to my question the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated that Mrs Lane and Mr Knight arrived by plane early this morning. This is not so. In fact, Mrs Lane and Mr Knight travelled all night by bus and arrived in Canberra early this morning.

Ordered that the report be printed.
Mr CONNOLLY-by leave-The 196th Report on the curatorial and conservation functions of the Australian War Memorial breaks new ground for the Committee. Rarely has such a topic been considered by this or any other Committee of the Parliament. Curatorial and conservation functions relate to the capacity of the Australian War Memorial to exhibit, maintain, catalogue and restore its collection. In his report to Parliament of 30 March 1981, the Auditor General highlighted the parlous state of the collection of the Memorial and the administrative difficulties that were contributing to it. The Committee's inquiry has fully substantiated his Report.
In historical terms, the worth of the collection to this nation is immeasurable. In monetary terms, it has been valued at over $1 OOm. Because of past neglect, parts of the collection are at risk. Already many assets have been lost, including 17 vintage planes now worth over $100,000 each. The Memorial estimates it will take at least 400 working years of conservation to fully restore the existing collection. The problem, however, does not end at the War Memorial. The Committee found that other institutions within the National Collection, such as the National Library of Australia and Australian Archives, also face heavy conservation backlogs. A similar situation will arise in the case of the Museum of Australia unless early action is taken to re-house and store its existing collection in an appropriate manner. These backlogs have arisen for a number of reasons. Firstly, there has been a lack of awareness by those who have been responsible for the conservation and maintenance of the collection in the past. This 'unwitting neglect', as it has been described, has been an outcome of complacency engendered by the fact that the Memorial attracts a high proportion of those who visit Canberra. This high attendance has apparently been interpreted as an indication that further upgrading of the display or condition of the collection was unnecessary. Secondly, the need to conserve all collections has only recently been realised by most museums and government institutions. Consequently, there is an insufficient number of suitably trained personnel on which to draw and inadequate funds to employ those experts who are available.

1854 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Committee ofPublic Accounts

Our Committee believes that there has been an inequitable sharing of resources amongst institutions responsible for the National Collection, for example. The Australian National Gallery, in contrast to the Australian War Memorial, is well endowed. Since the completion of the inquiry the Public Service Board has advised the Committee that some action in line with our recommendations regarding staff ceilings and salaries at the War Memorial has already been implemented. We hope this trend will continue. The Committee's recommendations are numerous. In essence they involve the following proposals: A greater role for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in co-ordinating resources within the institutions responsible for the National Collection; personnel career planning for curators and conservators within government employment which would involve revision of the salary structure and classifications; staff ceilings for the Australian War Memorial to be at least on a par with the Australian National Gallery; and introduction or extension of corporate planning techniques, disaster planning procedures, internal auditing, conservation data bases and automatic data processing inventory control systems within all institutions housing the National Collection, especially the Australian War Memorial.
The Committee wishes to make the public and the Government aware that conservation is not only the problem of the institutions. Preventive conservation methods-such as the use of longlife inks, typewriter ribbons, paper, et ceteramust be encouraged if further compounding of the conservation crisis is to be prevented. With the exception of the segment housed in the National Gallery a conservation crisis does exist within the National Collection. This is exemplified by the poor and threatened condition of the Australian War Memorial collection. We acknowledge that only a certain amount of the resources of the national purse can be allocated to solving the problem. It is a problem that must be tackled now and we call for a review of the allocation of these resources and improved management approaches within the institutions in an attempt to overhaul these serious conservation backlogs.
Under the user pays principle the question of admission charges was canvassed. However, while the Committee makes no firm recommendation on this issue we are concerned that if the Memorial does not fully utilise its revenue raising potential its current position as the poor relation within the National Collection may be exacerbated. The need for a high standard of conservation for the National Collection is essential.

The threat to these unique repositories of Australian history and traditions demands the attention of Parliament. We appear to be witnessing the unmaking of Australian history. That, my Committee believes, will concern all members of the Parliament as well as the citizens whom we represent. I commend the report to honourable members.
Mrs KELLY (Canberra)-by leave-The recent investigation by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the National Collection and, in particular, the state of the Australian War Memorial's collection, highlights the need for more staff and resources to be provided for these conservation functions. Few studies have been done on this subject and the investigation held by the Public Accounts Committee was a noteworthy first for this Parliament. We hope that this report will raise community and parliamentary awareness on this subject. Most people will be aware of the important role of the Australian War Memorial, the National Library, the National Gallery and the Australian Archives in collecting and preserving our national heritage. What many people may not realise is that at present there is a crisis in conservation which is endangering many irreplaceable documents and items.
The Committee visited all four institutions to see the state of the National Collection at first hand. We were enormously impressed by the dedication and hard work being done by the staff in these centres. In some cases they were working under very difficult conditions because there is a great need for more skilled staff in this area. However, at present there is an enormous conservation backlog due to inadequate staffing and resources being allocated to the work of preserving our National Collection. I cite some examples. At the Mitchell annex there are 10,000 works of art but only 10 per cent of those are on display. The Australian War Memorial has a collection of more than 8,000 stamps valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars which need to be catalogued and prepared for display purposes. There is an enormous public demand for photographs of the War Memorial's paintings-up to 700 requests are received per month-but it is difficult to meet this with only four photographers, especially when one considers that important cataloguing and preservation work is also necessary.
The Memorial is constantly receiving documents and records from the general public, which must be processed and stored, so the collection is continually growing and the work load is continually increasing. The Memorial has a movie collection of 4 million feet, with 4,000 titles which require careful conservation and cataloguing work.

Committee ofPublic Accounts

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1855

So there are all these items that are available for the public to see, and yet, because of the inadequate staffing that is available, particularly to the War Memorial, they are just not able to be put on display for the public. There is also an enormous number of other items and relics, ranging from uniforms to guns, which require specialist conservation care. At present preservation work, indexing and display preparation are severely hindered by lack of staff, and many of these items remain unseen and in storage. The list goes on.
This is a deplorable situation. In order to preserve our national collection, especially in the light of our forthcoming bicentenary celebrations, immediate action needs to be taken to upgrade the management and preservation of our historical records. The Public Accounts Committee report makes 38 important recommendations in support of improved staff and resources for conservation of our national collection. In particular, I draw honourable member's attention to recommendations 16 and 17, which urge that the Australian War Memorial be accorded special consideration in regard to staff ceilings and that there be an increase in staff ceilings specifically for the War Memorial.
Recommendations 18, 19 and 21 call for a new, improved salary structure for conservators and curators. Recommendation 2 urges that the institutions housing our national collection take a more active role on campuses of tertiary institutions to persuade students of the worth of taking on these important curatorial functions. Recommendation 25 refers to the need to establish a 'database' of conservation to assist in reduction of the backlog. Recommendation 27 urges that the automatic data processing documentary and inventory control system at the War Memorial is essential and should be expanded. Recommendation 6 calls for an extension of conservation facilities at the National Library. Recommendations 9 calls for special attention to be given to the shortages of conservation staff and storage resources at the Australian Archives.
However, not only staff and resources are needed. Recommendation 8 calls for urgent action in the Australian Public Service to educate staff and to institute proceedings in preservation and conservation of documents. The Public Accounts Committee was also particularly concerned about the Australian Museum project, which, it will be recalled, was yet another casualty of the razor gang. Recommendation 10 points out that early action is needed to organise and house the collection of the Australian Museum, presently in such a poor state.

I trust that all honourable members will receive this important report favourably and will do all that they can in their own electorates to raise public awareness of the need to conserve our national heritage. The national collection provides an invaluable record of our history and our culture. It is vital that we provide all Australians with the opportunity to view this collection. The collection belongs to all Australians, young and old, and should not be treated as a commercial venture, with turnstiles and entrance fees. Recent suggestions that entrance fees should be charged at the Australians War Memorial should be deplored. It is quite inappropriate that people should be expected to pay for entry to view what basically is a memorial to those who fought and died in war. It is clearly a national responsibility that our national collection be preserved and displayed so that both present and future generations will be able to appreciate our historical and cultural heritage. I commend the report to the House.
RESIGNATIONS OF MINISTERS
Ministerial Statement
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond ValleyMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs)-by leave-Honourable members will recall that on 22 April 1 tabled a document that is relevant to the matter of the importation into Australia of a colour television set by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). That document is a minute paper dated 4 February 1982, signed by Mr R. E. Kennedy, Director, Internal Affairs U nit. On that occasion I said:
In the circumstances I have issued a further instruction to the permanent head of my Department that further searches should be made to ensure that all relevant documents are made available and, of course, subsequently tabled. The Government is determined that all relevant documents will be tabled. Should any further relevant documents be discovered, they will of course be tabled.
I should remind the House that as early as 19 April the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his statement on the resignations of Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore, said: 'relevant papers will be tabled'. The Government has never resiled from that undertaking. Indeed, everything that it has done subsequently in this matter has been directed to finding out the facts about this matter, locating the relevant documents and tabling them. That has been our concern and remains our concern.
As I said on 22 April, I issued a further instruction to the permanent head of my Department that further searches should be made. As a result of my instruction, the permanent head of the Department issued instructions to both deputy secretaries, all division heads, collectors of Customs

1856 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Resignations ofMinisters

and the Assistant Secretary (Legislation) requesting that further and thorough searches be made for documents relevant to the issue of the importation of a colour television set by the honourable member of Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and related matters. As a result of those instructions thorough searches were conducted in every part of the Department and the results have been communicated to me. I have followed up the instruction to my permanent head with further instructions that specific searches be conducted and every possible avenue be pursued. Where I have felt that a particular and specific inquiry should be made, it has been made. As a result of these searches and inquiries further relevant documents have been discovered and produced to me. In keeping with the undertaking I gave the House on 22 April I will now proceed to table those documents and where appropriate make some comments on each.
The first of these documents is a computer printout. As part of the further search instituted by the permanent head, the computer files, which record details of ministerial and permanent head correspondence, were interrogated. That interrogation identified the title and date of an internal departmental minute from the former permanent head of the Department, Mr M. A. Besley, to one of the then deputy secretaries, Mr V. G. Montgomery, dated 13 October 1981. I table a copy of the printout, which is marked 'Document 1'. No copy of the minute referred to in that computer printout could be found in the Department. Accordingly, it was then directed that the search being conducted should be widened to include an examination of stenographers' shorthand notebooks. As a result of that extensive examination a dictated minute from the then Secretary to the Department, Mr M. A. Besley, to Mr Morttgomery came to light. The shorthand minute itself cannot be photostated but the actual notebook is available to be inspected by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in my office should he wish to see it. The minute has since been transcribed by the personal secretary who took down the dictation. I now table a copy of that transcription, which is labelled 'Document 2'.
I would like to comment on what I have just tabled. The first part of the document represents an attempt to reproduce or transcribe as accurately as practicable a facsimile of the entry in the shorthand notebook. The second part of the document sets out how that entry would have normally been transcribed into a final minute. The minute, in its final form, reads as follows:

Deputy Secretary Montgomery
MR MacKELLAR'S RECENT ARRIVAL IN SYDNEY
The Minister phoned me last night. I told him that we had checked it out and that the equipment brought in by his Ministerial colleague was not dutiable. I said we had closed the circle with the Collector in Sydney. We can now let the matter
rest. M.A. Besley Secretary
I do not of course say that no alterations or additions were subsequently made to the minute.
The third document that I have to table is a copy of a minute from the Collector of Customs, New South Wales, Mr F. I. Kelly, to his Senior Assistant Collector (Services), Mr J. M. Drury, dated 19 February 1982. It will be noticed that the minute was also marked for copying to the Assistant Collector, Management Services in New South Wales and to the Director of the Internal Affairs Unit in Canberra. The first paragraph of this minute refers to a report by Mr R. E. Kennedy, Director, Internal Affairs Unit. That report is the minute dated 4 February 1982, signed by Mr R. E. Kennedy and which I tabled in this House on 22 April 1982. The minute which I am now tabling refers to several matters which were discussed between Mr Kennedy and Mr Kelly. Only one of those matters touches on the area of immediate concern to this House. Accordingly, in reproducing this minute I have directed that the references to all the other matters be deleted. I now table this document. It is labelled 'Document 3'. The whole of the document is available to be inspected in my office by the Leader of the Opposition should he wish to peruse
it. I have now to inform the House that two diaries
are maintained in the office of the Collector of Customs, New South Wales. The first is a telephone diary maintained by his secretary. A search of that diary has revealed entries that indicate that telephone calls were made by the Collector to Mr V. G. Montgomery, then a deputy secretary of the Department, or alternatively that telephone calls were received by him from Mr Montgomery as follows: On 6 October 1981, two calls; on 9 October 1981, one call; on 12 October 1981, one call; on 13 October 1981, one call; and on 21 October 1981, two calls. The diary does not distinguish between inward and outward calls and it does not show on its face the subject matter of the calls. I do not propose to table this diary as, in addition to the calls to or from Mr Montgomery, it records telephone calls to or from many other people. However, the diary will be available for inspection in my office by the Leader of the Opposition should he wish to peruse it. I am sure that he will be content with examing the relevant pages of
it.

Resignations ofMinisters

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1857

The second diary is an office diary maintained personally by the Collector of Customs. That diary contains an entry on 9 October 1981 which indicates that some discussion was held that day between the Collector and the then Secretary, Mr M. A. Besley, and also between the Collector and Mr Montgomery. The record of the communication between Mr Besley and the Collector shows that three subjects were discussed. The second of those subjects is described in the following words.
M. A. Besley--
Then there is the figure'2':
McKellar/radio/cassette/TV (Black & White) Monty.
The record of the communication between Mr Montgomery and the Collector shows that the subject discussed between them was expressed in the following words:
v. G. Monty $250 u.s. Black & White, TV/radio/cassette.
I now table a photostat of that section of that page of the Collector's diary with reference to other matters deleted in the reproduction. It is labelled as 'Document 4'. This document also is available for inspection in my office by the Leader of the Opposition should he wish to peruse it, and again I am sure that he will be content with inspecting the relevant pages. I can assure honourable members that these documents were discovered after thorough examination. They are now tabled consistent with the undertaking of the Prime Minister that relevant pages would be available to be tabled and consistent with my undertaking that further searches would be made and that documents discovered would be tabled.
Mr JOHN BROWN (Parramatta)-by leave-I would have thought that this Government would have learnt from the lessons of history. I refer it to the incident in 1967, now notoriously known as the VIP plane dispute. I would have thought that the Government might have learnt that to have tabled all the documents quickly and immediately, with some urgency, would have headed off the problem that that Government found itself in when the then John Gorton tabled the documents in the Senate. I suggested in the House last week that we were now looking at a document-a-day process, and that we feared we would have to prise out all these snips of information by a tortuous and painful process of boring repetition, perhaps even attrition. I say quite clearly that the Opposition will continue to press this matter until it believes that all the relevant documents are tabled. Today's documents are just another instalment; they are an instalment only.

Some questions were asked in a Senate Estimates committee last Thursday evening which I believe have prompted the tabling of these docu-
ments today. Senator Evans questioned Mr Carmody, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, and suggested to him that the minute which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mf N. A. Brown) had tabled in this House earlier that day
was incomplete because it was only an opinion on some people who had been interviewed, and surely there was some record of the interview. I guess it was quite humourous when, at about 5.30 p.m., Mr Carmody almost claimed the Fifth Amendment and scuttled away to his Minister to see what he could find out about it. He came back at 8 o'clock, after the dinner break, and suggested that there might be some other document that he could table today. I believe that is amongst the list of documents that we have here.

Mr N. A. Brown-By today, you do not mean

last Thursday, do you?

.

Mr JOHN BROWN-No; by the next sitting day, which is today. It was somewhat like the
Minister having to run away and see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) the other night about that other document. What members of the Opposition want of this Government is that it come clean and give us all the documents. We be-
lieve a lot of other pieces of paper are floating about. Nobody will convince me that there are not contemporaneous notes floating around some-
where relating to all the various interviews of Customs officers that have been conducted. For a start, Mr Kennedy, whose minute was produced
in the documents provided to Parliament last week, is a former Deputy Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police. So, he is the classic police-
man. Nothing will convince me, or anyone sitting in this House, or even any kid in Australia who knows anything about the actions of policemen,
other than that the first thing he would do when carrying out an interview would be to pull out a diary and take notes. I want to know where all the
contemporaneous notes are before I am satisfied that all the documents have been produced.

I turn now to the notebook to which the Minister referred today. The main point to focus on in
this document, from my short reading of it,
appears on page 5. It is a note to Deputy Secretary Montgomery of the Department from Mr M. A. Besley, the Secretary. It is headed 'Mr MacKellar's recent arrival in Sydney', and reads:

The Minister phoned me last night. I told him that we had checked it out and that the equipment brought in by his Ministerial colleague was not dutiable. I said we had closed the

1858 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Resignations ofMinisters

circle with the Collector in Sydney. We can now let the matter rest.
They were ominous words, because the matter has not rested. The main point to focus on is that extract is that Mr Besley says that a check had established that the set was not dutiable. Am I to infer from that that he was telling the Minister that he had passed down the line a message already concluded by Mr Besley and others, and perhaps the Minister? Where did Mr Besley get his information from? What was Mr Montgomery's knowledge in this matter? Why did Mr Besley say it was not dutiable? Was it because it was a black and white set or because he had passed a fiat on down the line to that effect? At that time information was coming up the line to the contrary. We would like to know whether that information had reached Mr Besley. If so, what did he do with it or on what grounds did he discard it? If it did not reach Mr Besley, where did that information stop?
The two Ministers who resigned paid a very high price for an indiscretion. The Opposition has no desire to pursue the matter any further in this regard. I would like it known very clearly that we are not interested in further persecuting two people who have already paid a high price. We are concerned that the present state of the documents does nothing to put to rest the doubts that we have and the increasing evidence of attempted conspiracy to conceal an offence. Nothing today has responded to the allegations of attempts to hinder a Customs officer or officers in the lawful discharge of their duties.
The heart of the scandal that cost two Ministers their job is not the colour TV set that Mr MacKellar failed to declare and on which he paid no duty. Nor is it former Minister Moore's failure to bring his colleague to account. It is something more basic. It is the lie that found birth and subsequently flourished within the Department. The main thing that the Opposition seeks is not a witch hunt but a wide-ranging royal commission into the whole of the affairs of the Customs Bureau. As I pointed out in the House last week, the Customs Bureau is one of the main revenue gaining arms of this Government.
We want appointed by this Government a royal commission which will look into the whole of the affairs of that Bureau. We want it to look at the whole matter of revenue raising. We want its terms of reference to be wide enough to encompass looking at the whole issue of staff relations, which are obviously at a very low ebb. We want them to be wide enough to permit the commission to look at whatever allegations there may be of maladministration or possible corruption

existing within the Bureau. It should be the primary goal of such an inquiry to pin down the origin of the assertion which became the basis for a wall of silence, and eventually part of legend within the Bureau-that there was nothing to the suggestion that Mr MacKellar should have paid Customs duty since the set was, after all, black and white. We would like to know how that happened. The inquiry should also investigate why, when that fabrication ran into difficulty in the person of officer Mayhew sticking to his belief that the TV set was a colour set, the Customs Bureau went into high gear to protect the lie that had already been told.
To our knowledge, Mr Mayhew was interviewed on three occasions, the dates of which I cited in the House last week. Two of the interviews were conducted in the course of telephone conversations and one was in person, when he was taken to Clarence Street and interviewed by Mr Williams and Mr Tuite of the internal affairs section of the Customs Bureau. Where is the record of that interview? Mr Mayhew tells me that he saw a file that day which he claims, was two inches thick. People might say that that is an exaggeration or a figment of Mayhew's imagination, but I suggest that subsequent events have given the allegations, the claims, of Mr Mayhew, great legitimacy. He is, in fact, the person who came out of this entire affair with the most honour.
I am sure that there is floating around somewhere a file that Mayhew claims to have seen that day. He said he was shown parts of it but that the officers covered up parts of it that he could not see. Mayhew proved not only stubborn but also courageous. Considerable effort was made by those investigating officers to convince him that what he had seen with his own eyes, and heard from the Minister's lips, were false. It was noted in the file, the only report of the interrogation that was tabled in this House, that he was agitated. Well, why would he not be agitated? Here is a man of honour, a man with a considerable record of good service in that Department, being interrogated, intimidated and almost terrorised to make him believe something that he knew was wrong. It was only when it was discovered that the Press and the Opposition were interested in Mayhew that the Department started to worry about his allegations. Only when the story was published did the lie come into question. The colour TV affair, or 'Telegate' as it is now called, has something in common with Watergate: Most of the damage stemmed from the cover-up.
I repeat what we have said in the House before and will continue to repeat until what we seek

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1859

happens. The Prime Minister has promised an in-
quiry into the Department of Business and Con-
sumer Affairs. The Opposition will not accept anything less than a full scale royal commission
into all the affairs of the Customs Bureau. We will
continue to press in this House, to ask questions
and to probe, until that happens. I only hope that our investigations will stop very quickly and that
his Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), the new Minister in charge of
the Bureau, will press the Prime Minister to see
that what the Opposition claims is the right course
of action does in fact take place; that very shortly we will have in this House the announcement of a
wide-ranging royal commission with wide terms
of reference that will ensure that this whole affair
will be explored properly.

FRASER GOVERNMENT: MINISTERIAL STANDARDS
Discussion of Matter of Public Importance
Mr SPEAKER-I have received a letter from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:

The failure of the Government to maintain proper ministerial standards.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

More than the number ofmembers required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-

Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (3.10)-This

matter is of the utmost importance because no

government has set such a low standard of public

behaviour in this country's history as the Fraser

Government has set since 1975. Australia today is

being served by an incompetent, barren and non-

performing government that will be remembered

for having more sackings, demotions, resignations,

court appearances and public scandals than any

other government in the country's history. The

Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has ignored

the rules so others have seen fit to follow. Some

have done it on a large scale; some on a small

scale. Some have been punished; some remain un-

, punished. It depends solely on the climate of the

Ii

day. On a number Prime Minister has

of occasions since 1975 the told the Australian people

t that he would set a standard unparalleled in

'\ Australia's history. That is the only promise this

Prime Minister has kept. He has set a standard

\ that has not been reached by any previous Aus-

\tralian government I can assure honourable

~embers that such a standard will not be reached

by any future Australian government. On 12 March 1978 the Prime Minister said:
One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of Government.
Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no government can hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people.
This Prime Minister has had people in and out of the Ministry, in and out of courts and in and out of judicial inquiries non-stop. One wonders why so many people in the Ministry serving with this Prime Minister have continued to set such a low standard of behaviour in public office. There is only one reason why Ministers continue to do this: The standard set by the Prime Minister is seen as such that he will tolerate this sort of behaviour by people in public office. It all started in 1975, even before this Government was elected, when a then member, Mr Garland-he is now Sir Victor Garland and is Australia's High Commissioner to London-committed an offence. A prime facie case was found against him that he tried to bribe a
r candidate in the Federal election in 1975. If the I'
Prime Minister had been interested in setting a standard that everybody on his side of the House I: would follow he would have dealt with that matter deliberately and conclusively. But what hap- (\ pened to Mr Garland? Not only was he restored to the Ministry; he was later made High Commissioner to London. Then it was recommended to Her Majesty the Queen that he be made a knight. So our High Commissioner in London is now Sir Victor Garland. He is the same person who committed the first offence, before this Government was elected.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman is not entitled to make that statement.
Mr YOUNG-We are all aware of his appearance in the court and of the findings against him. If the Prime Minister had dealt with Garland in the way in which he should have been dealt with in 1975 then this could have come to an end. But how can the Prime Minister promote such a person, make him a high commissioner and recommend a knighthood for him, and expect that all the other Ministers will behave themselves over
\l the next six or seven years? The whole sordid \
story is that Ministers do not believe this Prime Minister has acted as he should have during the last six or seven years and so they have continued to play up.
The word 'promise', associated with this Prime Minister, will get a laugh from anybody in Australia-never mind the conduct of his Ministers. Look at some of the legislative matters that

1860 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982
this Prime Minister promised to keepindexation and Medibank. He promised to reduce inflation and interest rates. As I said, the word 'promise', associated with the name of Fraser, brings a laugh to everybody in this country. We all know that some of the offenders still sit on the front bench. Not everybody who has committed an offence has been expelled from the Parliament or put on the back benches. Some of the chief offenders are still sitting on the front bench. The then Treasurer of the country, Mr Phillip Lynch-he is now Sir Phillip Lynch-was dismissed from the Treasury because of his association with the smirky land dealings at Stumpy Gully in Victoria, but he was restored to the Ministry as the Minister for Industry and Commerce and again Her Majesty was called on to put the sword on the shoulder to make him a knight. So he is now Sir Phillip Lynch, after having been dismissed in 1977 because of his association with all those smirky land dealings in Victoria.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentlemen is not entitled to attack the personal probity of a member of the House except by way of a direct motion.
Mr YOUNG-lam not attacking him. I do not know how much money he made out of it. All I am saying is that the Prime Minister tolerated it, celebrated the event by promoting him back into the Ministry and then recommending that he be made a knight. Something must have happened in the meantime for the Prime Minister to take leave of his senses and to congratulate the Minister, after having sacked him, and having brought into question what he had done, by making him a knight. Of course, we also had the long-standing association in this House of the honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair, who was dragged through the courts in New South Wales. He is now back sitting on the Government front bench.
What an extraordinary feature of this democracy we have when the latest two Ministers, Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar, are marched into the Cabinet room to hear their fate. Who were sitting there putting up their hands but George Sinclair and Stumpy Gully Phil. They-two Ministers who had already been sacked from the Ministry for misbehaviour in public office-had leave to vote on the future of two other Ministers. They were sitting there being called upon to vote on the future of the other two Ministers.
What an extraordinary episode we are being told of today about the colour television set. The former Minister for Health, on $70,000 a year, was trying to sneak through Customs with a lousy

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards
television set on which he would have to pay $100. III"
He said that he did not know about it, and the' then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs did not know about it. They share a house in Canberra and have done so for the past six months. Who do honourable members think shares a house with them? It is the toe cutter, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Withers, who has also been expelled from the Ministry. They must have had a good breakfast. One can hear them. MacKellar would have said to John Moore: 'Pass the Corn Flakes John'. John would have said: 'What about your colour TV set?' MacKellar would have said: 'Shut up. Pass the Corn Flakes. I do not want to talk about the colour TV set'. They were living together for six months; yet they come in here and have the hide to tell the Parliament that they did not know about the television set. The former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs says he did not follow it up. He should not have said that he did not follow it up. He should have said that he was doing his best to cover it up. If he was not doing his best to cover it up, the former Minister for Health, was telling lies-he did know and did not pass on the information.
How can we expect people outside the Parliament to believe that this Government is beyond reproach when all these things have occurred? I will go through them all. We had the cases of Vic Garland, Sinclair, Lynch, MacKellar, Moore, Withers and the late Eric Robinson-a whole list of people who have been associated with scandals, with public inquiries and with court cases. For how much longer can it go on? No one in his right mind believes these two Ministers resigned four days after the matter became public. They had VIP aircraft waiting on the tarmac in Canberra for six hours while they thought about resigning. They were dragged into the Cabinet room twice to decide about their resignations. These two Ministers were sacked.
I will tell the House the other sinister aspect about their dismissal. Was it not ironic and strange that on the day that they were sacked every editorial of every major newspaper in Australia called for their dismissal. One has the feeling that our Prime Minister was very busy on the phone on the Sunday before those editorials, saying: 'I need a bit of help. I really do not have the conviction or the courage to carry out the dismissals that I should. Give me all the fortitude I need by a few pleasing editorials on Monday morning so that I can dismiss them'. That is exactly what occurred. The newspapers played host to the Prime Minister's feelings, wrote the editorials that were required and, of course, the

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1861

Ministers were dragged screaming into the Cabinet room to be told that they had been dismissed. But dismissed by whom? Let us look at the group who were sitting around the Cabinet table. Fair dinkum; it was like St Valentine's Day in Chicago to have these people sitting around the table passing judgment on the two Ministers over a lousy television set. Some of the people who are still sitting on the front bench have been associated with tens of thousands of dollars.
This Government is to linger on probably until the end of 1983, the end of the period for which it has been elected, but it will govern in title only. How can the mix in the Ministry be changed now under the same Prime Minister to give Australia a better performance? How are people outside to believe that things really have been changed and that we are now going to have a decent government? Nothing can be done. All the Ministers are doing is conforming to the standards that have been set by their friend from Nareen. He is the ;person who spoke about standards. I will raise another question about our friend from Nareen.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will use the right title.
Mr YOUNG-The Prime Minister. In a document of 12 March 1978, in which the Prime Minister made public one of his electorate talks, he said:
A matter of public concern and comment-the question of gifts to Ministers-was also reviewed. Now, Ministers who receive gifts on overseas visits must declare them to me as Prime Minister-
He probably takes them.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable gentleman will withdraw that statement.
Mr YOUNG-I withdraw. The Prime Minister continued:
. . . If gifts are more than token in nature, they are valued and Ministers are then given an opportunity to purchase.
I think it would be a delightful exercise for the Prime Minister to give us a list of all the gifts he has been given, the specific details of those gifts, the names of the people who have valued them and the amount of money the Prime Minister has paid into general revenue as a result of the promise he made to us in 1978. I think the Parliament is entitled to follow up the promises made to us by the Prime Minister about the way in which these things are to be conducted in future.
A few other people have been involved in the general dismissal of Ministers. Not only have we Sir Victor Garland in London, but also we have

Mr John McLeay in Los Angeles. It was interesting that he left the Parliament so quickly. His departure came right on the heels of his companies in Adelaide going into receivership. Again, there was no talk of his being dismissed from the Ministry. Mr McLeay was elevated to represent Australia in Los Angeles, a post he still holds. We do not normally knight people representing us in the United States, but if he had gone to a Commonwealth country we would probably now be referring to him as Sir John McLeay. That was another case that Australian people had to tolerate. As I have said, Senator Withers, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate, was dismissed from the Government because of his involvement in trying to persuade the electoral commissioners of Queensland to draw the boundaries so as perhaps to satisfy some of the whims of his Liberal and Country Party colleagues in that State.
When we raise questions of the utmost importance in this Parliament, they are dismissed as being of no consequence. For years now we have raised the question, for instance, of the public register of people who make donations to political parties. At Question Time today we heard Ministers trying to make the most of the dismissal of Deputy Commissioner Allen from the Police Department in New South Wales. So we should; that is what parliaments are about. But people also suspect that outsiders have a similar influence on Australian politicians. Why will the Prime Minister not come clean on the question of reform of election funding? Why will he not give us the names of people who make donations to political parties? Why will he not institute public funding of political parties? Why do we not have a clean sheet on this? If we expect the police force and every other public institution to come clean, this is the one that ought to set the example. The Parliament of Australia should be cleaner than any other institution. Yet this Prime Minister, by his standards, will not have any reform.
These measures warrant continued consideration by the Parliament. Nothing is more important than the way in which these people who are called Ministers behave themselves and set an example to other people in Australia. Nothing is more important than the relationship between the Government and the people of Australia. Today there is a vacuum between this Government and the people of Australia. There can be not one skerrick of trust between the Australian people and this Government because of the way in which this Government has conducted itself and continues to conduct itself. I predict now that Ministers will continue to make mistakes, as they have

1862 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

done over the last seven years, because they are led by a person who has very low standards. They do not believe anything he says and they will not be crippled in their activities by electorate talks that are meant to mean absolutely nothing. This Parliament should examine continuously the public behaviour of Ministers so that everybody in Australia can really see what this Liberal and Country Party Government stands for.
Mr MACPHEE (Balaclava-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs) (3.24)-Much of what has been said by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has been said many times before in a recycled contribution to debate whenever a Minister has left this Government. Something has been said of the fact that a number of Ministers have resigned and it has been alleged that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) has tolerated their alleged misconduct. The reason why this debate is on, and why other debates of this nature have been on, is the very fact that the Prime Minister did not tolerate that kind of misconduct. He has not tolerated a failure to comply with the highest standards.
Reference has been made to the standing down of Messrs Garland, Lynch, Sinclair and Robinson. They were stood down when charges were laid; they were restored when they were cleared of those charges by the various authorities. They were condemned and then they were cleared. If people are cleared, are they then to be forever debarred from resuming a role in the service of the country? If members of the Opposition loosely smear and condemn people whose lives are open to much greater scrutiny than anyone else in this country how can we ever expect to attract people of integrity, ability and quality to govern what is an increasingly difficulty country to administer? For example, we have just heard reference to Mr McLeay. Allegations were never made when Mr McLeay was in the Parliament which would have warranted action by the Prime Minister. Had there been I have no doubt the Prime Minister would have acted as he has always acted and asked for the person to stand down until an appropriate inquiry was held.
We are debating this matter today because of the Prime Minister's insistence upon and determination to uphold the highest standards. One could reasonably say it is because of this determination that there has been so much debate on this and other occasions. It seems that the Opposition continues to focus on this matter ad nauseum instead of on some of the complex issues which bedevil this country at the moment. Members of the Opposition have used a privileged moment of debate to raise again loose dramatic smears instead of

getting on with the issues with which this country is concerned. When the Opposition does occasionally turn its thought to such issues it does so with the same simplistic sensation which characterised the speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide. That occasion for this rehash of previous personality smears was the resignation of two Ministers who not only had a great deal to offer this country but also were amongst the most respected and liked members of this House. We have heard from the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) today that it is not the intention of the Opposition to continue to harass these members, and yet this is the effect of this kind of matter of public importance. We all accept that they have paid an enourmously high price for the omissions which they publicly acknowledge. At the very least it is an interruption to their ministerial careers and a very great personal embarrassment to themselves and their families.
Prompt action was taken by the Government. There was not a delay. The episode became public on the Friday and the members resigned on the Monday. There was a weekend between those two days. Files had to be obtained and information sought from a secretary and deputy secretary of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs who had retired since the incident took place. The Ministers resigned and in fact acted in the highest standards which are the very subject of this matter of public importance. A form of inquiry has, of course, been promised by the Government into the events involving that part of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs which underlay the issue.
One has to ask why the Opposition is now so determined to pursue former Ministers and other persons whom it has named and who have been cleared of the charges which were levelled against them. Why is the Opposition itself so reluctant to answer the National Times questionnaire on customs? Mr Speaker, I do not want to waste the time of the House too much but I want to draw attention to an article at page 3 of this week's National Times headed 'Labor Covers up on Customs'.
We recall that the National Times asked every member of this House and the Senate: 'Have you ever brought anything into Australia which you should have declared but did not?' I wonder why Australian Labor Party parliamentarians were reluctant to answer that questionnaire? They did not have to answer the question but if they had nothing to hide one would have thought they would not have hestitated to do so.

This matter is important because we are told that the honourable member for Port Adelaide, who brought forward this matter of public importance, was in fact the person who advised the Caucus not to answer the questionnaire. If the honourable member for Port Adelaide and his Opposition colleagues were really in touch with the people of this country they would know first that they expected the two Ministers to resign and that they regarded the Ministers as having paid a very high price in so doing. They believe deep down that many people in this country would be saying: 'There but for the grace of God go 1'. However, they expect parliamentarians to be above that kind of temptation. Everyone in Australia now wants all members of this Parliament to get on with the job of grappling with the issues and stop yelling abuse at each other across the chamber and continuing to focus on personalities.
It is no wonder that parliamentarians are despised by the community when the limited debating opportunities in this Parliament are consumed in this way. This matter has been raised not because an omission has been made and a heavy price paid but because the Opposition wishes to continue to malign these members to a serious point of vindictiveness and pettiness. Seeing that the honourable member for Parramatta likes to quote old expressions, let me recall an old expression which says: 'He who comes to equity must do so with clean hands'. It does not become any member of the Opposition in this place to stand up and make such wild allegations.
Why was it necessary for the Prime Minister to lay down such rigorous standards and issue a circular to the then permanent head of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs only a few months after coming into Government? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the proximity of the issuance of the circular and the outgoing Whitlam Government. But what was the record of the Whitlam Government in terms of ministerial changes? What is the record of this Government by comparison? It is worth perhaps taking just a few minutes to look at that matter. The present Government has been concerned with high standards of Ministerial conduct all the way through its term of office. Apart from setting up the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest-the Government, of course, accepted the principal recommendations of that inquiry-the Government has made a particular feature of enforcing probity and taking action at all times.
But let us look at Labor's record. Only seven Labor Ministers held the same position in

November 1975 as they did in December 1972. So in the space of just under three years only seven of 27 Ministers held the same portfolio. Two Ministers were sacked. In the three years of Labor Government there were three Deputy Prime Ministers, three Treasurers, three Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, four Ministers for Secondary Industry, three Ministers for Works and Housing, three Ministers for Immigration, three Ministers for Northern Development, three Ministers for Customs and four Ministers for the Environment. All one can say about that situation is that in three years Labor Ministers certainly got some experience at changing chairs. This Government has been in power for two and a half times longer than the Labor Government. It is interesting to note that 13 of the original Ministers are still Ministers after all this time.
The Opposition likes to create the impression that some 21 Ministers have been sacked. In fact only Senator Withers and Senator Sheil were sacked. Some Ministers resigned on matters of principle. Is anyone suggesting that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) or Mr Ellicott resigned under a cloud? Of course they did not. Senator Greenwood for one died in the cause of serving Australia. Let us just have a look at the matter. Others, such as Mr Staley, resigned from the Parliament for personal reasons. We have seen plenty of examples. If one were to go through the record of this Government compared with the record of the previous Government one would recognise what a sham this debate is today.
Those who seek to smear this Government collectively do great damage to themselves and to the institution of Parliament. The Labor Party would do well to look at its own record. For example, it has been said openly by a number of Opposition members that the New South Wales Premier wishes to come here. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has already mentioned a matter concerning Mr Allen. I would only like to say that in the light of those remarks the Australian Labor Party would do well to look to its own backyard. This kind of approach only compounds the Opposition's folly in using valuable debating time to cheaply smear former Ministers or persons who, having been stood down, have been properly restored after being cleared. So, the important point is that this Government has in fact stood very much by principles of propriety and has acted quickly when it has been apparent that people ought to be facing charges. When people have been cleared of charges they have been restored to their original positions. A fair minded view of the ministerial changes of this Government shows that it has maintained the highest standards of

1864 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

propriety and the Westminster tradition. These principles have been maintained by resignation where necessary of certain Ministers and by reinstatement when charges have been cleared. The Government has in fact got on with the business of governing the country. This is a complex and challenging chapter of our history. We are endeavouring to do this in spite of difficulties, some of which have not been the fault of the Government. I believe the Opposition should be ashamed of wasting this valuable time recycling spurious charges and cheap sensation. It might excite the Opposition but it bores and disappoints the public. This Government regrets greatly that some of its Ministers have had to stand down but when they have done so they have acted in accordance with the highest principles of propriety.
The matter of public importance which we are debating is really a nonsense and it ought to be condemned by the general public. If we look at changes that have been made we will see that they were made in the ordinary course of governing over a period of some six and a half to seven years. Let us look at the way the changes were made. On 6 February 1976, Mr Garland resigned pending the resolution of charges. He was reinstated in September 1977, having been cleared of those charges. Mr Robinson was appointed in his place. Mr Robinson properly resigned as Minister for the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Staley was appointed in his place. Senator Greenwood died. Mr Newman changed portfolios. Senator Durack was appointed to the ministry. And so it goes on. All the way through there is a series of changes which would be typical of changes made in the life of a government existing for as long as this in difficult times such as these.
It might be a source of some amusement to the Opposition but to the Government and to the people of Australia it is a most regrettable thing that this Parliament should spend so much time on this matter again after last week's momentous decisions by two people who had a great deal to offer and who admit what were, for them, regrettable omissions. The Prime Minister has been determined to set and uphold the highest standards and the matter of public importance raised today is a nonsense.
Mrs KELLY (Canberra) (3.37)-It is interesting that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) argues the Government's case in this matter of public importance. Maybe he is one of the few Ministers on the front bench who still have sufficient integrity to be able to argue such a case, or maybe he has not been caught out yet.

Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member will withdraw those words.
Mrs KELLY-I withdraw. No government has taken so much effort to proclaim the integrity of its Ministers as has this Government. We have heard that reiterated today by the Minister for Immigration. No Prime Minister has talked so much about integrity of government while laying down standards of behaviour for Ministers as the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). But no government has so badly failed to live up to the community ideals about standards of behaviour of Ministers and no Prime Minister has had to sack as many Ministers as this Prime Minister. The action has fallen behind the rhetoric.
The main example that the Australian community and this Parliament has seen of this gap between rhetoric and practice is in the recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry on Public Duty and Private Interest, the Bowen report. This report sets out rigorous standards of codes of behaviour, especially for Ministers. These recommendations in respect of Ministers were accepted by the Government in 1979. But the big question is this: To what extent have all these standards and procedures become a reality? Do these standards exist in the consciousness of Ministers? Do they permeate their behaviour, or do they mean nothing? For instance, in all the debate surrounding the resignations last week of the former Minister for Health and the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs there is one simple reality. In February 1976 the Prime Minister gave a clear instruction that his Ministers, as well as all parliamentarians, were to have equal Customs treatment with all Australians. That was a fine declaration. The sentiments are excellent. But have they been followed? They were not followed in the case of the former Minister for Health. Was this an aberration or is this the norm? How many Ministers do get equal treatment with other Australians coming through Customs? Is the Prime Minister's instruction of early 1976 a reality or is it merely a worthless piece of paper? This is the real question.
Ministers have not lived up to the standards required by the Prime Minister. We know of those who have failed. Many of them have been mentioned by previous speakers. Mr Garland was charged with bribery. He is now Sir Victor Garland and is located in London as High Commissioner. Sir Phillip Lynch was involved in land deals. He resigned from the Ministry in 1977 but is now on the front bench once again. Mr Robinson was suspended because of allegations relating to the electoral distribution in Queensland. There was a royal commission into that matter. He was

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1865

reinstated but he later resigned from the Ministry. Senator Reg Withers was sacked as a result of the findings of a royal commission. The right honourable member for New England, Mr Sinclair, resigned from the Ministry in 1979 pending a trial for forgery and false statements. However, he has now been returned to the front bench. We now know of the case of the former Minister for Health and the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs.
However, the standards for the Liberal Party are quite different from the standards for the National Country Party. This was demonstrated when Mr Nixon and his family held shares in Murray-Goulburn Co-operative while he was Minister for Primary Industry and was involved in dealings that directly benefited MurrayGoulburn. However, he did not disclose his shareholding to the Prime Minister or divest himself of the shares. So there are two sets of standards, one for the Liberal Party, one for the National Country Party. Many assurances have been given to the people of Australia and to this Parliament about the honesty and integrity of this Government but the Government has not lived up to those assurances. I quote from another speech of the Prime Minister in which he said:
My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in our history.
There is no doubt that it is without parallel in our history. The Prime Minister continued:
As long as I lead the Government, there is no way that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated.
The Ministers set a fine example of that. The sentiments are all there but the practice is wanting.
Let us look at some of this code of ethics and behaviour laid down in the Bowen report. At how many Cabinet meetings has a Minister disclosed to his colleagues that he has an interest which conflicts, or might reasonably be thought likely to conflict, with his public duty as a Minister? How many times has this declaration been noted in the Cabinet records? How many times has a Minister indicated that he will not take part in the discussion in question because he has an interest in it? How many times has a Minister divested himself of his shares or similar interest in any company or business involved with his Department? I think the Parliament has a right to know the answers to those questions.
I conclude by referring to a statement made by the Prime Minister as a result of the royal commission of inquiry relating to matters of electoral

redistribution in Queensland 1977 in which he stated:
The community rightly demand a high standard from the Ministers of the Government. The judgments on Ministers are more exacting and sometimes more harsh than the judgments which might be passed on those outside the sphere of public life. If these high standards were not upheld, the people's confidence in Government-a confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy-would be undermined.
The Government has an obligation to uphold them even though the cost can be and is a high one.
In this particular instance he was quoting. I submit to the Parliament that there is clear evidence that the high standards which the Prime Minister has called for have not been upheld, that as a result the integrity of this whole Parliament has declined in the community and that there is in fact an undermining of confidence not only in the Ministry of this country but also in the Government of this country.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond ValleyMinister for Employment and Youth Affairs and Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (3.45)-Such was the overflowing fury, enthusiasm and vigour of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) on this subject. I could not help but observe that she could not stretch her flimsy argument out even to occupy the entire time she was allocated under the Standing Orders of this House. I think it indicates very clearly that there is very little to talk about. I may as well come dean at this stage and say that it is extremely unlikely that I will be able to occupy the next 10 minutes replying to this matter of public importance because there is so little to which I need reply.
At the outset I make two brief points. The first is that I refute the allegations made against my colleagues, the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). Secondly, the honourable member for Canberra, in her tirade against the Minister for Communications, omitted one fact. It is true that there were court proceedings concerning the Minister for Communications, but the fact that the honourable member for Canberra omitted, of course, was that the Minister was acquitted. He was acquitted of all charges. What sort of justice is it when one can make allegations against a Minister and, in support of those allegations, can say 'look, he has been in the courts', but then can leave out the single fact that he was acquitted? What has happened to the basic principles of justice upon which this country is based and the basic principles of justice which we have all regarded and always will regard, I hope, as basic to our system? I think it is discreditable that any honourable member can stand in this Parliament, can

1866 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

point the finger at any honourable member or anyone outside this House and can say 'he has been in court' but then can ignore the factthereby misleading people-that indeed the person concerned has been acquitted.
The next point I make is that this debate is nothing more than a rehash of the same argument that was trotted out in the Senate only a few days ago. The same arguments were used; the same old stories were dug up; and, I may as well confess at the outset, the reply is much the same. Honourable members will hear more of it from me. This is a rehash of the same exercise that was gone through in the Senate a few days ago. I make a very simple point by way of introduction. I was appointed Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs on 16 April last year.
Mr Hodgman-Good appointment. Mr N. A. BROWN-A good appointment, as my colleague points out. He is a very perceptive Minister, I must say. I have sat here in this chamber month after month, since 16 April last year, waiting for questions from the Opposition about employment. I thought that was why I was here-to answer questions about employment. I thought the Opposition would be interested in asking substantive questions concerning the high rate of unemployment-I concede that there is a high rate of unemployment. One would have thought that constructive suggestions would have been forthcoming from the Opposition. One would have thought that there would have been penetrating cross-examination about what we, as a parliament, can do to improve the employment situation. But we have not heard such suggestions. All we have heard is rubbish of the sort we heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and his colleague, the honourable member for Canberra, in this debate today. Let me put this matter into perspective. I mention two things that will put to rest the allegations made by the Opposition in this matter. The first is that the debate arises today presumably because of certain circumstances which have been gone over quite thoroughly in this Parliament and outside for more than a week concerning the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). The debate concerns the question of the propriety of people bringing goods into this country and the payment of duty on those goods. What is the Government's position on this matter? The Government's position is that in 1976 under this Government-under Mr Fraser's Government-a directive was given to Customs

officials that there was to be no discrimination between VIPs, Ministers and members of Parliament on the one hand and the ordinary public on the other hand. That is where this Government stands. It stands for equality in the implementation of the Customs laws.
I say without any equivocation whatsoever that if there is any need to tighten up that situation, to reinforce that directive or to make a stronger directive those steps will be taken. The Government stands today exactly where it stood in 1976 on that issue-that is, that the law is to be enforced with respect to Customs and matters relating to Customs for VIPs, members of Parliament and Ministers in exactly the same way as it is for ordinary citizens. The second point to make-it should state the Government's position on this matter very clearly-is that it was this Government, Mr Fraser's Government, that appointed the Bowen Committee of Inquiry into Public Duty and Private Interest. It was Mr Fraser's Government that encouraged the Committee to proceed with its work. It was this Government--
Dr Klugman-You never did anything about it. Mr N. A. BROWN-The honourable member for Prospect says that the Government did nothing about it. The Government has implemented the recommendations of the Bowen Committee in relation to Ministers. That is where the Government's responsibility lies. It has the responsibility for the propriety of Ministers, of members of the Government. The recommendations of the Bowen Committee are in force as far as this Government and its Ministers are concerned. Mr Young-But they are not in force.
Mr N. A. BROWN-The honourable member for Port Adelaide is an expert in making trivial speeches in this place. He seems to have only one speech and it comes out no matter what the subject is. It is all rubbish, from beginning to end. He uses words like 'reform'. He says: 'Let us reform the electoral funding situation'. When people such as the honourable member for Port Adelaide use the word 'reform' one would be very wise to look out because it is probably a swindle and probably a fraud.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Minister will withdraw that remark.
Mr N. A. BROWN-I withdraw that, Mr Speaker. I did not mean the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I know he would not do that. But when people use words like 'reform' one should be very wary. What the honourable

Fraser Government Ministerial Standards

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1867

member for Port Adelaide means is that the Australian Labor Party wants federally-this occurred in New South Wales-an opportunity to help itself to public money to finance its own political party. That is what the Opposition means by 'reform'. That is not reform; that is a retrograde step.
Let us remind ourselves-I take no pleasure in talking about comparative propriety-as the Senate reminded itself only a few days ago, of some of the interesting events that happened during the three dark years of the Whitlam Government. In those three years there were three Deputy Prime Ministers, three Treasurers, three Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and four Ministers for secondary industry. Despite the fact that there were four Ministers for secondary industry, secondary industry had the life strangled out of it under that Government. There were three Ministers for housing, three Ministers for immigration and three Ministers for the Northern Territory, one of whom lasted, I think, only a couple of days. There were three Ministers responsible for Customs and four Ministers for the environment. Who can torget that deplorable record of ministerial behaviour?
As these shadows come back from the past I remind the House of some interesting events. I refer to the Gair affair. Who can forget the then Prime Minister sneaking over to the Department of Foreign Affairs with former Senator Gair's commission so that no one, particularly his own colleagues, would find out what he was proposing to do in respect of that appointment? Who can forget former Senator Murphy, the then Attorney General, sneaking off to mount his Australian Security Intelligence Orgamsation raid? Who can forget the Croatian raids? Who can forget the Crean affair when Mr Crean was made a scapegoat for the Government's incompetence? Who can forget the Cope affair, when the then Prime Minister would not even accept the ruling of the Speaker? That was his standard of propriety-he would not even accept the ruling of the Speaker. Who can forget the Cameron affair? Mr Clyde Cameron, one of the most distinguished people ever to come into this Parliament, was made a scapegoat by the then Prime Minister. Mr Cameron had to barricade himself into his office. He was dragged out to be taken to Government House and was forced to resign. What a great standard of ministerial propriety that was! Who can forget the whole tragic loans affair? The whole story is like the sad parts of The Sullivans-there is one thing after another. This debate does not deserve to have any more time devoted to it. It is spurious and it should be rejected

by this House as, no doubt, it will be rejected by the Australian people.
Mr SPEAKER-The time for the debate has lapsed. The honourable member for Ryan has indicated to me that he would like to make a personal explanation. The Standing Orders do not specifically provide that he can make a personal explanation because he did not participate in this debate, but in the circumstances I will give him indulgence and permit him to make a personal explanation.
Mr MOORE (Ryan)-Thank you, Mr Speaker. During the debate the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) asserted that I shared a house with the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). I wish to put the record straight, because I have heard this in the media. I do not and have not shared a house with the honourable member for Warringah. Since 1977 I have owned a property in Giles Street, Kingston, where I live when I am in Canberra.

by Mr Ewen Cameron and Mr Shipton.
Petitions received.
Taxation: Child Care Expenses
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:
Taxpayers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from income taxation in the same way as other business expenses.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Carlton and Mr Peacock.
Petitions received.
Australia Day
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
The humble petition of the undersigned electors of Australia respectfully showeth:
That the 26th January 1788, is the date of first white settlement in Australia, and therefore marks the beginning of modern Australia, and this event marks the most appropriate date on which to celebrate our national day.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament will determine that Australia Day is to be celebrated on the twenty-sixth day of January each year, and that a public holiday will be declared on that day, regardless of which day of the week is the 26th.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Braithwaite.
Petition received.
Trade Unions
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully
showeth~
The petitioners' fear and condemnation of Australia's chronic decline from a land of prosperity, generosity and peace to a strike-torn, minority controlled and broken country. This is due to Union corruption and interference which is applied using undesirable methods including black banning and threats. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Prime Minister and the Members of the House of Representatives will introduce legislation to ensure the following:
I. That the Union system is revised to encompass the secret ballot which is the only fair and just indication of what the people really want. Wives or de-facto wives names should be included on their husbands' or de-facto

husbands' Union ticket at no extra cost and they should be entitled to a secret vote on all issues which involve their breadwinners. This is a valid request as in a strike action women and children are usually the deprived parties. Household and often financial management is frequently left to the wives and therefore they should be entitled to a vote in any Union dispute directly affecting them before having hardships imposed upon them. 2. That the Unions are restricted to fulfilling their original purpose which is to negotiate fair wages and conditions for their members and not to interfere in external affairs outside their immediate employment.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Good luck.
Petition received.
Marine Mammal By-products
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that:
I. Since the Australian Whale Protection Act 1980 provides for the banning of importation into Australia of all whale by-products, and
2. the Prime Minister has stated that he and his Government support the international banning of whaling,
3. then consistent with (I) and (2), this Government should immediately legislate to ban the importation of all marine mammal by-products, including the harp seal of Canada, and
4. through the Australian delegate in the United Nations General Assembly, the Prime Minister should state his Government's support for an international ban on the slaughter of any marine mammal for commercial reasons.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that consistent with legislation on whaling, this Government should ban the importation of marine mammal by-products and support an international ban on slaughter of any marine mammal.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Humphreys.
Petition received.
Plant Variety Rights
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern over Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation.
We agree that:
(I) PVR will aggravate the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding.
(2) PVR will not enhance Australia's access to improved plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable varieties on the Australian market.
(3) PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation by private enterprise and discourage breeding for disease and pest resistant varieties.
(4) PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interests not responsible to the Australian people.
(5) The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.

Petitions

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1869

Your petitioners therefore pray that Parliament:
( I) refrains from enacting any legislation on PVR, (2) calls for a public enquiry into the impact of existing
overseas PVR schemes on the Australian seed industry and the international seed trade.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Jacobi.
Petition received.
Funding of Children's Services
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Australian Parliament assembled.
Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Parliament assembled take action as it deems appropriate to ensure that the present Federal Government children's services programme is maintained and improved, and the Child Care Act is retained as a legislative base for this important programme.
In considering the recommendations of the Spender report, no recommendations put forward should be implemented without full consultation with community groups.
The present subsidy system to Child Care Centres should be retained. The proposal that moneys be made available to subsidise child care in commercial centres is viewed with grave concern. The proposal to alter the present guidelines for subsidy in different programmes and introduce a common means test is also viewed with grave concern, as the present arrangements are effective.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action on the above mentioned issues.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Kent.
Petition received.
Youth Accommodation Service Program
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia showeth that whereas a pilot program of emergency accommodation for young people ends in June 1982, many young people continue to be at risk in our local communities through lack of adequate housing and support.
We therefore pray that funds be made available to continue and extend the services available through the Youth Accommodation Services Programme.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by MrKerin.
Petition received.
Student Loans Scheme
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:
I. Restrict Access to Education-People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.
2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS should cover the basic living costs of

students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced. 3. Disadvantage Women-Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate. 4. Disadvantage Mature-age Students-Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study ifit meant incurring substantial debts. 5. Distort Educational Choices-Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study. 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates-Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to "drop-out" rather than continuing study and increase their debts. 7. Cause Administrative & Financial DifficultiesOverseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters. Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: The House of Representatives will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme.
And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray.
by Mr MacKenzie.
Petition received.
Sales Tax Legislation
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
That the proposed sales tax of 2.5% on books, magazines and newspapers represents a tax on knowledge which should not be contemplated in a civilised country. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this proposed sales tax be withdrawn from the Budget proposals.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr McLean.
Petition received.
National Estate Areas
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the lack of effective Federal environmental protection legislation and urge that suitable legislation be enacted immediately.
Your petitioners are concerned that National Estate areas such as South West Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Western Australian Jarrah Forests cannot be fully protected until adequate legislation exists and is enforced. Your humble petitioners therefore call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that all provisions of the Heritage Act and the Environment Impact of Proposals Act are fully complied with in respect of National Estate Areas. In particular your petitioners call upon you to adopt the recommendations of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee

1870 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

on the Environment on South West Tasmania. Your petitioners believe that this is a national issue and must be resolved by the action of the Federal Parliament.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Les McMahon.
Petition received.
Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth-
I. We call upon the Commonwealth and State Governments to select a site for Sydney's second Airport now and to protect it by immediate development.
2. We do not agree to the expansion of the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport.
3. We support the Marrickville Municipal Council's opposition to the Airport extension proposals.
4. We do not agree that nuisances from aircraft noises are reducing.
5. We oppose any shorter evening 'curfew' hours.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that there be no extension of Kingsford-Smith Airport, Sydney.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Anti-discrimination Legislation
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled.
The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth-
That currently discrimination in the provision of work, in appointment to jobs and in promotion exists in Australia on particular grounds including, inter alia, grounds of race, ethnic origin, marital status, pregnancy, sex and/or sexual preference; and
That currently discrimination in the provision of unemployment benefits is exercised against particular groups of individuals-in particular, against married women.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:
That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employment, in employment of individuals under federal awards, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasigovernmental organisations, and in employment of all persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdiction; and
That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in the provision of unemployment benefits to all persons without regard to sex and/or marital status.

South West Tasmania: Wilderness Area
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at

proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. This area is on the Register of the National Estate and therefore is of national concern.
Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Rights of Disabled
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.
The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth-
I. The failure of the Federal Government to seek information from the census re disabled people-i.e. partial or total disability-to enable for adequate planning of, and for, types of services needed by disabled people to be undertaken.
2. The failure of the Federal Government to lead the way in employment of disabled people by employing a greater number of such people within the Commonwealth Public Service-note the small number currently employed within the Service.
3. The wastage of the Federal Government funds perpetuating large, bureaucratic institutions and organisations where there are often few disabled people on their Boards and little emphasis is placed on consumer participation in decision making.
4. The failure of the Federal Government to encourage independence of disabled people, or to develop 'normalised' support systems~-attendant care.
5. The failure of the Federal Government to provide 'noninstitutionalised' specialised accommodation for those people who would not be able to benefit from, or cope with attendant care.
6. Failure by the Federal Government to alter, or create a 'disability' allowance means test free for all disabled people-this would assist with necessary equipment and mobility costs.
7. Failure to provide a national compensation scheme thus saving time and enabling people to be automatically covered in the event of a disability.
8. Failure by the Federal Government to abolish tariffs on all equipment available to the disabled-e.g. Optacon.
9. Mismanagement of Federal IYDP funds-e.g. nonreceipt of some States of funds through unresolved negotiations.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that immediate action be taken to remedy the above stated and that the Federal Government recognise that disabled people are citizens who should have equal rights.

gravely concerned that the taxes of all Australians will be used to finance a dam that would flood the Lower Gordon and Franklin Rivers in South-West Tasmania. Your petitioners declare that the intrinsic values of this area, and the provision of funds from the taxes of all Australians, for the destruction of this area of the National Estate and of world heritage value, does make this a national issue.

Anti-discrimination Legislation
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled.
The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:
That since 1788 discrimination has existed in Australia on particular grounds including, inter alia, grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, marital status, pregnancy and/or sexual preference;
That since 1788 such discrimination has been accepted and promoted by Australian laws and practices, particularly in the provision of work, in appointment to jobs, in promotion to positions of authority and lucrative incomes, in the provision of goods and services, in the provision of accommodation and generally in relation to political, economic and social institutions of power.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:
That adequate and appropriate laws be immediately formulated and passed through the Parliament to render unlawful discrimination in all areas over which the Commonwealth holds power, namely, in employment of all persons in the Commonwealth Public Service and employed in Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and other bodies, in the provision of Commonwealth accommodation and goods and services and also in all areas over which legislation for the Australian Capital Territory would be valid.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1981-82
Second Reading
Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by MrHoward:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr HODGMAN (Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory)-Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1981-82, Supply Bill (No.1) 1982-83 and Supply Bill (No.2) 1982-83 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these four measures? There being no objection, I shall allow that course to be followed.
Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (4.0)-The Bills now before the House are Bills which normally come before the House at about this time of the year. In the normal course of events, as the Supply Bills would come in later they would be debated quite separately from the Appropriation Bills. The Government's arranging for these Bills to be debated cognately today, of course, is one way of avoiding another debate on the economy. Given the appalling state of the economy, one can well understand why the Government would want to do that.
These Appropriation Bills authorise the expenditure of funds by the Government during the rest of this financial year for purposes for which appropriations were not made in Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2; that is, the Bills which come in at Budget time in August. Appropriations were not made at that time because of the tradition not to make some such appropriations earlier in the financial year, or bec~use costs and price increases have occurred since the Budget, or because the Government has decided on new expenditures since the Budget. The extent of these new appropriations is reduced by savings in the original appropriations brought about by economy measures or reductions in plans for expenditure on certain items. The savings this year are partly due to the Government's cost-cutting policy introduced early this year after the Government discovered that the Budget deficit was blowing out again. However, the minimal impact of that program on the deficit is shown by the fact that it will save only about $25m in expenditures, whilst the deficit is blowing out, according to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) by about $850m. That is, according to figures given recently by the Treasury, the

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1873

deficit will be about $1,OOOm this year, against a Budget estimate of $146m.
One may well ask in those circumstances whether all the disruptions to the Public Service caused by the stricter limitations on overtime, public servants' travel and attendance at seminars, and the use of office equipment and materials, which have caused enormous disruption to the efficiency of the Public Service, have been a cost-effective operation. Would it have made any substantive or even discernible difference to the macroeconomic effect of the Budget if the deficit had been $25m higher? I suggest that it would not have done so. Furthermore, looking at some of the other savings, so called, one can only question the Government's priorities. For instance, in the document which the Government has distributed entitled 'Savings-Appropriations', we see that for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, in the area of youth training, the Government has reduced its expenditures by $11 m. This is on school-to-work transitional allowances and assistance for work experience. That $l1m reduction on what was originally appropriated last year represents a 14 per cent contraction in expenditures which I should have thought were of very high priority if we are at all concerned about youth unemployment. This is an area into which we should be putting a lot of funds. But no, this Government is cutting back on its original appropriation by some 14 percent.
In the important area of research and development incentives for the private sector, the Government has reduced its allocation by some $16m; that is, it is going to make a so-called saving of $16m by not spending that much of the amount originally appropriated. This is a 33 per cent cutback in the original allocation of $49m. This area is of extraordinary importance. If Australia wants to become a nation which can be in the forefront of technological change this is surely a very appropriate area of Government expenditure; but we are reducing expenditures by 33 per cent on what was appropriated last year.
A third matter to which I draw attention is bilateral foreign aid. In this area there is a reduction of $18m on the amount originally appropriated, which represents a 12 per cent cut in the original allocation of $146m. This is from a government which spent much of last year talking about the need to be involved in the North-South dialogue, hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and showing great concern for the Third World. And now it is cutting back its bilateral aid allocation by $18m. So much for the rhetoric. Such examples demonstrate much about the

Government's concern for the vital areas of Government expenditure.
I turn now to the Supply Bills. These Bills provide funds for the Government to meet its expenditures between 1 July and 30 November this year, by which time Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2) for the financial years 1982-83 are likely to have been enacted by the Parliament. So these four Bills, the two Appropriation Bills and the two Supply Bills, are essential to enable the Government to carry out its programs and therefore they raise for debate the Government's budgetary stategy and its economic policies generally.
I suggest there can be little argument with the proposition that the Government's economic policies have manifestly failed. After more than six years of this Government the economy is now in a worse state than at any other time since the 1930s. The Fraser Government's period of office has been marked by substantially lower economic growth than that of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development generally, with which we like to compare ourselves. We are now in a state of severe recession with official unemployment at 6.7 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent when this Government took office in November 1975. So unemployment as a percentage rate is getting on to half as much again of what it was when this Government took office six and half years ago. With all the signs being of a deepening of the severe recession we are already in as business investment growth slows dramatically, as consumer expenditure growth likewise declines and as these have been the engines of growth in the last year and a half the prospects for economic growth in the future are therefore markedly diminished.
The Budget estimate for non-farm domestic product growth was 3t per cent for this financial year. But the Treasurer admitted last week that it is likely to grow by only 2 per cent to 2t per cent. In other words, the rate of growth will be much less than the original forecast in the Budget. As economic growth slows we can expect employment growth likewise to decline. Indeed, that is already happening. Since September last year the employment level has not increased at all in seasonally adjusted terms; hence unemployment is increasing markedly. It is up 50,000 in seasonally adjusted terms since March of last year, and it is likely to increase much more as the economic growth rate declines.
Already the prospects for unemployment of the order of 7t per cent to 8 per cent by next January or February must be regarded as high. They are

1874 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

figures we have not seen for a long time-7t per cent to 8 per cent. As it was 6.7 per cent in March, we must expect that with the further deterioration in the economy that clearly will occur we will be looking at figures like that for the unemployment rate in January or February next year. If there is no substantial pick-up in the economy in the course of the calendar year 1983 we will be looking at figures close to 10 per cent perhaps by January-February 1984.
On top of this gloomy employment scene we have tax and interest rates at their highest levels ever. So those people who are employed are being increasingly discomforted by the impact of such developments on their living standards. To top it all off, despite all this pain and penalty that the Government has inflicted on the nation, the Government has failed to reduce the inflation rate more than marginally. It is still double figures and not much below the 12 per cent rate recorded in the last 12 months of the Labor Government's period in office. The failure of the Government's economic policies is therefore undeniable and especially so if measured against the extraordinary promises that this Government has made to the Australian people. Let me just very briefly remind the nation of promises. The Government promised to provide jobs for all, to reduce the tax burden, to reduce interest rates by 3 per cent, to defeat inflation, to support wage indell.ation, to restore prosperity. All those promises have been grossly breached. This raises questions not only about the Government's economic performance but also of course about the probity of this Government which is so suspect in many other ways.
Why have the Government's economic policies failed so comprehensively? Although other factors are involved the principal reason for such failure, as we in the Opposition see it, is that the basic economic strategy pursued by the Government since it came into office is fundamentally misconceived. It not only provides no hope of resolving our current economic difficulties. It also has within the seeds of economic disaster as it leads us inexorably into deeper and deeper recession and economic trauma.
Let me acknowledge the impact of the world recession on the Australian economy. Unlike the Opposition when the Labor Government was in office we of the present Opposition acknowledge that the world recession of course has an impact on the Australian economy. It has clearly added to the recessionary trend in Australia at present. In that regard I would like to make two points. Firstly, if we are to take note of international factors we must acknowledge the enormous impact

of international factors in promoting economic growth in Australia in the last couple of years. In 1980-81 the major reason why the growth rate picked up considerably and with it the employment growth rate was the big increase in private investment, an enormous increase in that year, brought about by the resources boom, which in turn was brought about by the second oil shock, the large increase in oil prices in 1979 and 1980, which made Australia's resources so much more attractive for investment for various reasons and therefore brought about this enormous surge of private investment. The international factor which the Government now points to as a reason that we have so many problems was of course the prime reason why there was a pick-up in the growth rate in 1980-81. This had a little to do with the Government's economic policy and much to do with the impact of the world economic developments on Australia. If the Government wants to point to the world recession to explain the recession in this country it should at least acknowledge the favourable impact of recent world developments too.
The second point to make in this regard is that the world recession, which is now very severe, is partly due to the adjustment needed by oil importing countries after the second oil shock. But it is also due to the fact that some large countries, indeed a number of large countries, with conservative governments have pursued the same policies as those that have been pursued by the Fraser Government, that is, the so-called monetarist policies which became fashionable amongst conservative governments in the 1970s and which have become increasingly less fashionable in the 1980s.
The key element of monetarist policy is a tough monetary policy, which is adopted in the belief that it will eventually bring inflation down and destroy inflationary expectations and thus enable a non-inlationary recovery to occur. Such policy is generally associated with a policy of slashing government expenditure, reducing the deficit, reducing the size of the public sector also by selling off government assets, deregulating the economy and providing tax cuts for the highest income groups. All of these factors have been applicable in Australia. In every case where these policies have been tried they have invariably reduced economic growth, increased unemployment, greatly increased interest rates and poverty and generally failed to make much impact on inflation. The United States is perhaps an exception to that in that it has now significantly reduced its inflation rate but only after moving into what I think is better described as depression rather than

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1875

recession. In the first quarter of this year its growth rate was showing a per annum rate of decline of 4 per cent.
The severity of the current world recession therefore is substantially due to the pursuit of these monetarist policies which not only affect the countries initiating their use but also, by reducing their demand for imports in those countries and by raising interest rates, cause increased recessionary developments in all countries. Particularly is this so when the United States, which has by far the largest economy in the world, is currently pursuing such policies. So the fundamental problem is not world recession as such but the policies being pursued in many Western conservative governments, including the Fraser Government here in Australia.
These policies have been pursued for long enough now for several lessons to have become clear. The first of those lessons is that insofar as such policies act to reduce inflation they do so only by increasing unemployment. So what the policy really amounts to is fighting inflation by increasing unemployment. The idea is that with increased unemployment it would be more difficult for employers to increase prices; employers would be forced into squeezing profit margins; wage earners would find it harder to get their wage claims accepted by employers; and there would be a general increased difficulty in increasing costs and prices and therefore by increased unemployment inflation would be reduced.
The Treasurer has vehemently denied that this is what the Government's policy amounts to but I suggest that only shows that if he really believes what he is saying he is even more naive about economics than he displayed in a recent interview when he said his lack of background in economics was no handicap because: 'You do not have to practise economics in being Treasurer'. I think that extraordinary statement says a fair bit about the Treasurer. But maybe a Treasurer who can say something like that really believes that his policies do not involve increasing unemployment to fight inflation. More likely he probably does not want publicly to acknowledge what he knows to be the truth; if he is really being honest about it, his policies undeniably involve increasing unemployment to fight inflation. Either way, whether it is his belief or not, there is no refuting that this is what the policies involve. Experience shows that to be the case. Such policies have everywhere reduced the rates of economic growth and therefore of employment growth and so increased unemployment.

With the work force increasing at about 1.7 per cent per annum in Australia at present and with a productivity increase of about 1 per cent, we need 2.75 per cent economic growth to stop unemployment getting worse. Honourable members should compare that with the Treasurer's acknowledgement that this year we will get an economic growth rate of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Clearly unemployment is on the increase. It is already showing up in the figures. But that is what we would expect with reduced economic growth which comes from a toughening of budgetary and monetary policy which this Government has introduced to control inflation.
A reduction in the growth rate is part of the Government's deliberate strategy. Its tight budgetary monetary policy ensures that that happens. Other countries are pursuing similar policies. They are all fighting inflation by increasing unemployment. The National Bank of Australasia Ltd, which is not an Australian Labor Party source-I do not think anyone would argue with that-recently acknowledged the truth of this. In an article in its monthly summary for March 1982, entitled 'The monetarist approach to inflation' it had this to say about monetarism:
Finally, the experience has been that it works indirectly against inflation mainly by raising unemployment and, in so doing, moderating wage and price rises.
So the National Bank, which can be regarded as not a source which is aligned with this side of the Parliament, clearly accepts the fact, as I am saying, that monetarist policies rely on increasing unemployment to fight inflation. In those circumstances I think the Government is being rather naive in expecting the Australian people to think otherwise.
A second lesson which comes from the experience of the last several years is that it takes more and more unemployment to keep inflation at any given level. If this approach is to be used to control inflation the level of unemployment we must commit ourselves to becomes greater and greater as time goes on. Let us look at what has happened in Australia in the last 20 years or so. In the early 1960s a credit squeeze was brought on by the Government of that time to stop inflation, which resulted in unemployment of, I think, 3 per cent in January 1961 or January 1962. Inflation then fell to zero in 1962. But now we have not 3 per cent unemployment but 6.7 per cent official unemployment, which is much higher unofficially if all the people who have dropped out of the system altogether and ceased looking for work are counted. The official firgure is 6.7 per cent with an inflation rate of 10.5 per cent.

1876 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

Obviously if we were to bring inflation down to zero we would need a much higher level of unemployment than 6.7 per cent. What would that figure be? Could it be 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 14 per cent? We cannot really say, but we can say that it takes vastly more unemployed now to keep inflation at a given level than it did a generation ago. We must therefore ask: Where is this policy taking us? By 1990, if we pursued these policies, what would the unemployment level if we were to try to keep inflation at 10 per cent, 15 per cent or even 20 per cent? What about the year 2000? Can we go on pursuing these kinds of policies? I suggest one only has to look at what has happened with the development of unemployment and the relationship of unemployment to inflation in the last 20 years and then look forward another 20 years to say that these policies are totally unacceptable to the Australian people. We just cannot continue to pursue policies which involve such a massive destruction of our work force, a waste of resources and the callousness and inhumanity of massive unemployment.
Our third lesson is that such a conclusion surely demonstrates that the present poliCies provide no hope of eventual economic recovery. The monitarist assumption is that if only we can bite the bullet hard enough, inflation will be substantially reduced or eliminated entirely; then a noninflationary recovery will be able to occur because we will have eliminated inflationary expectations. This assumption is absurd for two reasons. Firstly, because to eliminate inflation altogether or to reduce it to 1 per cent or 2 per cent would require a level of recession and unemployment that would certainly be politically unsustainable. If this Government were to now say 'We will reduce inflation to one per cent or 2 per cent by the end of next year', it would obviously need to increase unemployment to something like 10 per cent or more, and that would ensure its destruction even more certainly than that destruction is already ensured by the mess it has made of the Australian economy.
It is simply not a practicable policy. Inflation simply cannot be eliminated with this kind of approach. But even if it was a practicable policy, it would he highly unlikely to enable a sustained recovery to occur. This is because, if economic recovery were allowed to occur from whatever abysmal trough of depression it had been taken to eradicate inflation, it is likely that inflation would soon recur because the reactions of the parties involved-employers and trade unions-would soon be to seek to expand income claims, and so we would be back on the inflationary track. Then

the Government would move in with contractionary policies to stop inflation so we would remain in that very severe depression. The only way that may not be so would be if the economy were to be kept in this grossly depressed state for several years. Inflationary income claims may be limited in the recovery stage, but there is no certainty of that either. Again I suggest this emphasises the total impracticability of such policies, leaving aside the Government's lack of humanity.
Thus the basic and crucial monetarist assumption is seen to have no basis in reality. What follows from that is that a sustained economic recovery allowing a return to full employment or something vaguely resembling full employment is not at all possible with present policies. Any recovery that occurs with the inflation levels currently applying will soon be chopped off as the Government tightens its budgetary and monetary policy to minimise the increase in inflation. Thus any recovery is quickly followed by more recession and unemployment and a move into deeper depression. That is the cycle we are on; a recessionary vortex into which we are being sucked by these disastrous policies. We are seeing this occur right now. There was recovery in 1980-81, because of the resources boom-and as I have previously explained-then inflation reared its head. Then there was an introduction of tougher budgetary and monetary policies to stop inflation, the end of the boom and the end of the reduction in the growth rate, increased unemployment, and more recession, and in 1982-83 there will be much more recession.
Clearly all this suggests that there is a need for alternative policies. Surely it is clear to anyone who is at all objective that alternative policies are needed. From all parts of the country we hear calls for changes in policy. Even within the Government's own ranks there is great concern at what is happening in the economy and to members' electoral prospects. We have all sorts of calls for new policies to be adopted. Unfortunately most of them are about as effective as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. From published reports of the party room debate on the economy, from what Government members are writing in newspapers articles or other publications or from what they are saying in this House, it seems that no real change of basic policy direction is being suggested by anyone on the Government side. Meanwhile, the Government maintains its stoic position that no alternative policy is available, and it hopes for the best from the present policies.
I will pursue the Titanic analogy a little. As we head straight for that big economic iceberg which

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1877

these policies have us heading directly towards, we have the captain and his first officer refusing all pleas from the passengers for a change of course on the ground that no alternative course is available; those s.uggesting the current CQUfSe is disastrous are motivated only by ill will towards the officers. They also keep pointing to the rough seas that we are passing through as a reason for the passengers' discomfort. Other officers are saying that what we have here is a communications problem with the passengers. They are advocating careful explanation to the passengers as to why the ship is on its present course and are urging the band to play louder to keep the passengers' spirits up. Some of the drier members of the crew are trying to solve the problem by improving the efficiency of the ship's engines. Other crew members are trying to promote a mutiny, but not having much success. Almost all the officers and the crew, from the bone dry members to the sopping wets. are saying that the passenger fares should be reduced and that the cost of that should be covered by reducing services to the passengers or increasing charges for the things they buy on board.
It is clear to any objective observer of the passage of that ship that whatever the merits or demerits of these various recommendations, they will do little or nothing to change the ship's course and that what is therefore needed are new officers and crew who are prepared to steer a more rational and productive course. Thus the Opposition-and not only the Oppositionstrongly believes that what is required is a set of policies which will enable us to fight inflation by means other than unemployment. We reject the policy of fighting inflation by increasing unemployment as being callous and inhumane as well as being quite ineffective. The combination of policies required is clearly one which promotes economic recovery by removing the budgetary and monetary policy restrictions on growth whilst employing other means to control inflation. Those other means desirably would involve policies to directly influence prices and incomes so as to enable a reconciliation of conflicting income claims at much lower levels of employment than is possible with present policies. We will have much more to say about the details of such policies in the near future but in the meantime I note that there is increasing recognition that this is what is n~ded. For example, the National Bank, in the article that I referred to earlier, whilst maintaining that tight monetary policy is still necessary, stated that incomes policies are also required. It said:

While some may think this message simple or naive, in the long run no other alternatives exist.
I suggest that that is a nice turn of phrase for the Government to consider since it keeps saying tl1ere are no alternatives available. The National Bank is saying that in the long run there is no .alternative but to pursue some detailed incomes policy, and that is the policy to which there is no alternative-not the policies presently being pursued by the Government. Such a statement from a clearly conservative source demonstrated growing concern in the community that without such policies no solution to our economic problems is available. Similarly, in respect of budgetary policy, industry bodies such as the Australian Industries Development Association are calling for a more stimulatory budgetary policy and are correctly saying that such budgetary policy change could be encompassed within responsible monetary guidelines. Though we may argue with AIDA as to what responsible monetary guidelines are, we would agree that the general direction of change that it advocates is appropriate. However, no one on the Government side is yet able to see the need for such policy changes and so I move the following second 'reading amendment:
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that:
(I) current economic policies have utterly failed to achieve the Government's stated objectives;
(2) this Bill maintains these disastrous policies, which have depressed economic activity and living standards, increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates, and accentuated inequity and division in society, and
(3) a (:QI11pletely new economic strategy is required to prevCllt tile Australian economy sliding into deeper reC~IlI1, and to provide any hope of sustained econolllicreeovery '.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilIar)-ls the amendment seconded?
Mr Hurford~1 second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.
Mr PORTER (Barker) (4.29)-We have just heard from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) a rather tired old speech in which he said that the Government is doing everything wrong, that it is not doing anything right. No concrete proposals were offered by the hOnQurable member fpr Gellibrand as to what we Should be Poing but I have a sneaking suspicion that the words he stated to the Labor Economists Conference will come b~ck to haunt him. He said:
If Labor does not gain office next election then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-and maybe an

1878 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so.
I have a sneaking suspicion that that is just what the honourable members speech was all abouthigher taxation, larger government and less scope for individual initiative.
The purpose of the Appropriation Bills is to allocate extra funds to the Government for expenditure over and above the August 1981 Estimates. The amounts included in the Bills reflect a number of increases in costs to the Government. The Bills therefore provide an opportunity to discuss post-Budget economic developments and to look to the future. There is no doubt that last year on the international scene there was a high level of activity in the resources sector, with high commodity prices and general economic confidence. People got used to the higher oil prices and changed their consumption patterns by using alternatives or adopting measures to conserve more of the available oil. In Australia this lead to an increased resurgence in coal exports and an increase in oil exploration, together with higher returns for most mineral exporters, including those who exported gold. At the same time there was a generally high level of domestic economic activity, with stronger consumer demand, increasing employment opportunities and high levels of investment expenditure.
Subsequently the unions of this country became dissatisfied with the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's indexation of wages and started to pursue so-called productivity increases, shorter working hours and, in addition, indexation increases. The multitude of these claims came to a head last year when indexation was abandoned and the level of industrial disruption increased to about the highest level since 1974. There is no doubt that many unions adopted the boom mentality. They believed that things were good and went hell for leather to make sure they got as much as possible either regardless of the consequences or because they were ignorant of the consequences. Their claims reached a peak at a time when international demand was slowing and interest rates were climbing. Unfortunately our unions pressed on regardless. The result was that, during a period when there was a slow-down in the international economy, our competitive position was becoming worse. We have had wage increases far beyond the inflation rate. The result has been that instead of our inflation rate being below the average of the other Western industrialised countries, we are now forging above them. Of course, this has led to a slow down in our domestic economy and, aggravated by the unrealistic wage demands together with demands

for a shorter working week, there has been a reduction in the number of new jobs created.
The effects of industrial disruption are felt most keenly by exporters, especially those in the resources and primary industries, because they are subject to the cold winds of international competition. They are price takers on the world market and must bear the burden of the protected Australian industries, together with the high rate of wage increases and inflation in Australia. The people in my electorate now face a period of high and rising input costs and low returns for their products. They are justifiably furious when they see export markets at risk because of irresponsible union action. In South Australia, thanks to the efforts of the South Australian Liberal Government and, in particular, the now retired Minister for Marine, Allan Rodda, we have seen a reopening of ship trade at Port Adelaide. These efforts are now being sabotaged and the future of Outer Harbour and Port Adelaide is being put at risk by the totally irresponsible action of striking tug boat crews around Australia, including those in Adelaide, which is preventing the docking of ships vital to our international trade.
Mr Hodgman-Shame on them.
Mr PORTER-As the Minister at the table quite rightly says: 'Shame on them'. I have told the South Australian Government that if it wants men to crew the tugs, I know many farmers who will be there at the drop of a hat. Farmers know that their livelihoods depend on this country being seen as a reliable supplier and they are ready, willing and able to fulfil Australia's end of the bargain if the unions involved are not.
Given the general economic picture, the question arises as to what should be done by the Government in the form of its Budget strategy to assist Australia through this period of depressed economic activity. Firstly, I do not agree with the prophets of doom, especially the Australian Financial Review, which has suggested that we are heading for a depression worse than that of the 1930s. Clearly there is a need for us to pull together. I do not believe that this is the time for unions to press ahead with further unrealistic wage increases when some overseas unions are, in fact, negotiating wage decreases. I believe labour and capital can co-operate. In fact, some of the collective bargains reached to date indicate progress towards that end. Our future is bound up with our ability to co-operate for the benefit of all.
Recently we have seen the emergence of collective bargaining. Of course, if we are to go down that road, fundamental to the bargain is its observanct! by both sides. In the past this has been

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1879

the main problem. Until recently the parties were not prepared to stick to the agreement. However, I hope we have reached a new maturity in our industrial relations, one which will enable this avenue of settlement of wage negotiations to proceed.
I have made the point that I do not believe that the state of the economy is as bad as some have suggested. I believe that the Government must continue down the path of responsible economic management to ensure that when there is an improvement in the world scene we will be in the box seat to take advantage of it. That does not mean that in the next Budget the Government should not take bold initiatives. We should make some changes within a framework of sound economic management. The sort of changes to which I refer are in the area of taxation. However, before I deal with those I want to look at the other side of the ledger; that is, government spending.
I firmly believe that the majority of people in this country still want to see smaller government-that is, less government regulation, less government interference, less government appropriation of an individual's income and less government assistance given those who do not really need it. Over the last 10 years Commonwealth Government outlays have continued to increase in real terms, although at a much slower rate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the changes that have occurred in outlays, receipts and the deficit since 1971-72.
Leave granted.

(a) Current values, deflated using Gross Non-Farm Product Implicit Price Deflator, assuming a 10.5 per cent increase for 1981-82 over 1980-81.
(b) Estimated.
Mr PORTER-I thank the House. The table shows how the Government has reduced the rate of growth of its spending-expressed in real terms; that is, after accounting for intlationfrom a peak of 19.9 per cent in 1973-74, the heady days of Gough's Government, to an estimated rate this year of about 2 per cent. The years 1976-77 and 1979-80 were significant for this Government because they were years in which our expenditure rose at a rate which was less than that of intlation. I am suggesting that we should aim to minimise the growth in public sector spending to around the rate of intlation or, at most, slightly greater than the rate of intlation, so that the Government's share of the economic cake, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, will continue to decline.
It will be recalled that in the three years 1972 to 1975 the Labor Government managed to increase expenditure vastly. However, that increase was not matched by increases in revenue; rather, it was matched by soaring deficits. Over the last five years, as is shown in the table that I have incorporated in Hansard, we have reduced the deficit to more manageable proportions and have now more nearly matched our spending with our income. The task has not been easy. We have had to raise income to balance the books and there is no doubt that it has taken us nearly six years to correct the three years of Labor's economic mismanagement. I say that not to score political points,

1880 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

but rather as a basic economic fact. It is amazing how much damage can be done to the fabric of our economy in such a short time.
Nevertheless, given the circumstance that in the Budget the Government can contain further growth in expenditure and given than the economy is not overheated, as it was during many of the last five years, in my view it is feasible to run a small domestic deficit. If the growth of the money supply is kept at around the rate of inflation I believe the Government will have the ability to give, and indeed ought to provide, worthwhile cuts in income tax. I believe that in present circumstances that is an achievable and desirable goal.
Those income tax cuts could be greater if the Government were to continue on its course of shifting the emphasis away from income tax as the main source of income and to increase indirect taxes, if it were to work towards restoring the historical balance between the two. I believe that we are unduly reliant on income tax. As a result, initiative and incentive for the individual to increase his earnings are severely impaired. Clearly, any increase in indirect taxes must be matched by a reduction in direct taxation. Exactly where the cuts in taxation ought to occur is a matter of judgment. However, I believe that an increase in the tax free threshold has two obvious benefits: Firstly, it will ensure that pensioners will not become subject to taxation, and secondly, it will provide a direct cut in taxation for every taxpayer. My priority for further cuts would be given to an increase in the spouse allowance because I believe that under the current system single income families are prejudiced. The system can be made a little more equitable by increasing the spouse allowance, which has the added benefit of assisting families.
It is clear that it will not be easy for the Government to cut taxes and at the same time bring down an enonomically responsible Budget. As was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) recently, to cut marginal tax rates by lc-that is, from 60c in the dollar to 59c in the dollar for those on high levels of income, from 46c to 45c in the dollar for those in the middle range and from 32c to 31c in the dollar for other taxpayers-will cost some $770m. At present anyone earning less than the tax threshold of $4,196 pays no tax at all. To lift that threshold by $100 would cost about $2 10m. So to make the tax free threshold, say, $4,500 would cost around $630m. To lift the tax free threshold further to, say, $5,000 so that everyone earning that sum or less would pay no tax, would cost around $1,680m. That would be a tax cut of about $800, or some $15 a week, for most taxpayers. In summary, it is clear that we ought not to expect too much if we are to maintain a respon-

sible Budget. But if the Government strictly controls expenditure there will be room to move within the framework of a responsible, noninflationary Budget.
I make the final comment that, whilst the Government can do everything right, nothing is surer than that if we have another round of wage increases similar to that we have just had we can kiss goodbye to a re-emergence of a prospering Australian economy. We have to restore our international competitive edge by working together today so that we can all benefit tomorrow.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Before calling the honourable member for Lowe, I inform the House that the honourable member is about to make his maiden speech in this place. Therefore I call upon honourable members to extend to the honourable member for Lowe the customary courtesy of hearing him without interjection. I call the honourable member for Lowe.
Honourable members-Hear, hear!
Mr MAHER (Lowe) (4.46)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe it appropriate that in my maiden speech in the national Parliament I have the opportunity to join the debate on Bills appropriating expenditures from Consolidated Revenue for various purposes, including Public Service salaries, overseas aid, et cetera. The Bills before the House, which are being debated cognately, present an opportunity for me to comment upon certain policies of the Liberal-National Country Party Government which occupies the treasury bench. It was partly as a protest against these policies of the Government that the electors of Lowe returned me as member for that constituency-the first member of the Australian Labor Party to represent that seat since it was created in 1949. The two main issues which emerged in the by-election were interest rates and the high level of taxation. Ordinary Australians are worried about interest rates on housing, and indeed they should be because interest rates are now at 18 per cent to 20 per cent. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who pledged to bring interest rates down. It was the campaign slogan of the Liberal-National Country Party Government. The Australian public will not forget this broken pledge at the next general election.
During the campaign I found that householders in Lowe wondered how their children could ever be in a position to buy a home of their own in Sydney. Many could not see how their families would ever be able to raise the necessary deposit for a mortgage. Young couples paying rent told me that they would have no hope of obtaining a home in Lowe and would have to be prepared to move to a

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1881

far distant outer suburb-perhaps a long way from support for their young families from grandparents who can be of assistance and render practical help with baby-sitting and all other problems facing a family in our Australian society today. Women in my electorate have told me that with increases in mortgage repayments they have been forced to seek employment just to maintain payments on their home. Until recently some were active in local voluntary organisations within the community and schools. When a mother seeks employment such activities often become an impossibility and our community organisations suffer. Working women also create a greater drain on children's services, particularly long day care centres which are in short supply in the Sydney area.
It is most regrettable that the present Liberal Country Party Government seems determined to cut back on subsidies to these important children's services. Pre-school centres, long day care centres and other forms of children's services are, in many areas, becoming too expensive for middle income families to patronise. A charge of $40 a week to mind a child is an inordinate amount for a working woman to pay, particularly if she is a sole parent working to support her family. If more than one child is placed in a centre then the costs on outgoings for the working wife become prohibitive. It will certainly be my aim to do everything possible, as the member for Lowe, to improve children's services in the electorate, particularly in areas where residents, for one reason or another, have not been able to form and sustain community groups to launch such important projects.
The second issue to emerge in the campaign was the high rate of income tax paid by the average Australian wage earner. As I campaigned and canvassed, many families told me that despite having a two-income household they did not appear to be going ahead or saving any significant sum over a financial year. The high rate of taxation was universally condemned throughout the constituency of Lowe. A worrying tax question for pensioners was the proposal by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in October last to amend the Social Services Act so as to strengthen the provisions of the legislation against schemes that he described as being 'contrived to circumvent income tax'. As a guideline to age pensioners, the Minister said that an amount of $2,000 could be retained by a single pensioner in a cheque account or other non-interest bearing account whilst a married couple could retain only $3,000.

Many pensioners, particularly those who are aged or frail, have placed their small savings in cheque accounts which do not bear interest, usually because they are ill and do not wish to lose the medical card that pensioners receive. If a person is frail it is a worry to him to have to pay medical insurance, particularly as this Government's health schemes change with great regularity. Aged people do not ~ant the worry of having to prepare and lodge income tax returns or even the stress of having to invest money. Many to whom I have spoken are quite prepared to lose interest on their savings rather than lose their all-important medical cover. They want a simple scheme to entitle them to hospital and medical cover. During the campaign I spoke to many who were appalled at the Government's decision to make them invest any savings which they may hold over the $2,000 or $3,000 cut off point. Several pensioners spoke to me about the need for pensioners to retain money in their cheque accounts for household repairs and other purposes. Some could not believe or understand why they were now being discriminated against just because they receive the age pension.
Any. Australian can keep money in a noninterest bearing account or a cheque account for as long as he or she wishes. Only pensioners are to be discriminated against. They have been told that the amount they can leave in a cheque account or non-interest bearing account is strictly limited. A parent who is in receipt of a family allowance is not discriminated against; nor are all those others in our Commonwealth who are receiving government payments so discriminated against. It is almost beyond belief that the government of this Commonwealth could be so harsh to our aged Australians-our senior citizens, our pioneers, those who bore the burden when our nation was at war and who suffered the trials of the Great Depression.
Many of our pensioners were not on high wages until after the Second World War. It is only since then that they have been able to save to pay off their homes and put away a small amount for a rainy day. Now this Government, which is totally bereft of a social conscience, proposes to raise a trifling amount of additional tax from the savings of our pensioners. The Government has admitted that the drafting of the amendments to the Social Services Act have proved, to quote the Minister, 'more complex than expected'. It is my belief that no parliamentary draftsman could ever produce legislation to meet the Government's wishes. However, it is clear from the Minister's statement that the Government has not changed its mind on the issue and has only deferred its plan to limit to

1882 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

$2,000 the amount that a pensioner can retain in a cheque account or a non-interest bearing account.
During the Lowe campaign I addressed a meeting of pensioners in Burwood. This proposal of the Government was mentioned but most of the people present who were in receipt of the age pension did not believe that such a scheme would ever eventuate. Until this proposal is completely withdrawn the pensioners who have been frugal and fortunate enough to save a small sum of money are in jeopardy. They will be forced to pay tax on the interest on their savings or, alternatively, lose their fringe benefits and medical and hospital cover. The pensioners in Lowe who have to rely completely on the age pension for their livelihood are in a very serious position, as are the widows and the invalids.
Paying rent causes great financial difficulty to pensioners. They have come to regard the Government's rent allowance of $8 a week as a farce. The rent allowance is not paid at a realistic level. In Sydney there is a great demand for cheap fiats and low income accommodation. Pensioners are being harmed by the policy of this Government by which it has cut back in every Budget on allocations to the State housing authorities. Applicants who might previously have been allocated a housing commission dwelling or fiat are now taking their chances with pensioners in the private rental market. Pensioners and others who are at risk in the housing situation are facing a sad future. It is my belief that at the next election the Australian people will elect the Labor Party as the government of Australia because only a Labor government will take positive initiatives in housing to ensure that all Australians have an opportunity to live in a dwelling which affords them some form of personal dignity.
The Appropriation Bills which are before the House today deal with the estimates for the Australian Electoral Office. It is of some concern to me that the allocation of funds to this important office is to be reduced in that overtime is being eliminated. Since 1975, when the Liberal and National Country parties came to Government, all movement towards electoral reform and updating of the Commonwealth Electoral Act has been frustrated. It is quite clear to me, as a member recently elected in a by-election in which 12 candidates nominated, that there is a great need for optional preferential voting-that is, if the Executive's aim is to ensure that as many people as possible cast a formal vote. Hundreds of voters in Lowe quite unwittingly voted informally because of the sheer complexity of writing 12 numbers on a ballot paper, possibly in a dark and

unfamiliar polling booth with a blunt pencil provided by the Australian Electoral Office.
The Commonwealth is lagging behind the States, particularly New South Wales, in relation to reform of its Electoral Act. There should be a draw by lot for positions on the ballot paper. There must also be public disclosure of the source of campaign funds. It is my belief that our system of parliamentary democracy will be greatly strengthened in the Federal sphere if the electorate is able to scrutinise the source of political donations which are now furtively contributed. New South Wales has led the Australian States in relation to public disclosure of campaign funds. It has also led Australia in providing a small measure of public funding to candidates and to political parties in both Houses at general elections and by-elections. I believe that public life has been greatly strengthened in New South Wales by these areas of public disclosure and public funding. At least one State in our nation can now compare itself with the rest of the democratic world in that candidates for parliament are no longer impoverished or financially embarrassed after a campaign in which they might be successful, or, worse, unsuccessful. New South Wales has also led Australia in the area of electoral reform, with the four-year term of office to be introduced at the next general election. I was delighted to note reports of the incoming Labor Government in Victoria taking a similar step. I can only hope that, now that the two most populous States of our nation have opted for a four-year parliamentary term, strong pressure will be placed on the Commonwealth Government to follow suit.
As this is my maiden speech in the Federal Parliament I must take the opportunity to extend my good wishes for a long and enjoyable retirement to my predecessor, Sir William McMahon, and to his wife. I wish Sir William good health and good fortune. I know that he will continue to have an active life even though he is not serving as a member of this House. The Labor victory in Lowe would have been completely impossible had it not been for the dedicated unpaid work of hundreds of local members of the Australian Labor Party. Australian Labor Party members in Lowe and elsewhere, including many of my former colleagues from both Houses of the State Parliament and many of my new colleagues from this House and from the Senate, came to Lowe and worked tirelessly at all the difficult and burdensome tasks associated with a by-election. The leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party, and his wife, Dallas, attended many functions, as did all the members of the shadow Cabinet. The Premier of New South Wales, the Honourable Neville Wran and

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1883

his wife also attended any functions to which they were invited. I must say that I was greatly encouraged and heartened by the support I received from all the Labor members of parliament.
My campaign director, Alderman Rod Rimes of Strathfield Council, and Mr Paul Hayes, my campaign secretary, efficiently carried the campaign along and at alI times gave me complete support and any assistance required. The Labor Party's campaign manager in New South Wales, Mr Seamus Dawes, conducted the long drawn out by-election campaign and tied up alI the loose ends. Two of my former colIeagues in the State House~Phil O'NeilI, M.P., member for Burwood and Garry McIlwaine, M.P., member for Ryde~ were particularly involved in the Lowe campaign, organising functions and rendering assistance, as was the wife of the Federal member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), Jan Murray, and the wife of the State member for Parramatta, Mrs Cathy Wilde.
Any election produces great strains and stresses on the family of a candidate. However, the response of the local community and of Labor supporters throughout the State was truly magnificent. Australian Labor Party members even came from Goulburn in a hired bus just to help on election day. Others came from Nowra and other country areas at their own expense and stayed overnight just to work on the polls.
Throughout the weeks and months of the campaign, however, a great burden did fall on my wife, Margaret. No spouse could have given greater support than she gave to me throughout the campaign. She bore the burden of the telephone calls and personal visitors to our home. Continuous meetings and Press conferences were held at home and friends visited. Supporters and members had to be fed and entertained, and always she welcomed them and showed them true hospitality whilst, at the same time, looking after our young family and speaking at functions. I thank my wife, my aunt Bessie Maher, who lives with us and who also had to take her turn in answering the phone, and our neighbour Flo Vernon. Without these three supporters the campaign would have been impossible. Finally, I thank my secretary, Mrs Jean O'Hare, who came with me from the State. Her calm competency carried me forward. Mrs Margaret Donovan, my research assistant, also shares my debt of gratitude. No member could be more efficiently served than I am in my electorate office. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis).

Mr BRAITHWAITE (Dawson) (5.3)~1 welcome the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) to this House and congratulate him on his maiden speech, the first of many to come. This debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills allows for a wide selection of matters to be brought before this Parliament by any honourable member. However, the financial expenditures of the Parliament in 12 months do have significant influence on our economy and have social, industrial and political consequences. In fact, the news last Thursday of the reduced rise in the consumer price index for the March quarter of 1.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent for the year to March must have been of great surprise to those prophets of gloom and despair in the ranks of the Opposition spokesmen. Of course, the luxury of Opposition, which the Australian Labor Party exploits to the maximum, is the making of false economic predictions and never being called to account when those predictions prove to be false. The same may be said of the Opposition's economic policies; while being e1ectorally helpful to the Australian Labor Party, they would prove economically disastrous for this country. Let us hope that the Labor Party is never allowed to repeat the economic ineptitude which it displayed during the three dark years of Australian politics from 1972 to 1975 in Federal Parliament.
The economic good news is that for the year to February 1982 76,000 additional job opportunities were created and filled within the Commonwealth. Unemployed people have not been crucified for the attainment of better economic results, as has been the situation in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other European countries where unemployment figures are at record levels since the Depression of the 1930s. The answer to these problems is not to go back to the years of the Labor Government when unemployment more than tripled in three years. I recall that the figures went from about 80,000 in 1972 to well over 250,000 by the time we retained government. The answer to the problem is not in temporary pump priming as in the old Regional Employment Development Scheme, but in making the private sector more productive and more profitable. I believe this is where the focus of our policies should be directed~to the private sector.
In spite of a smaller deficit, a good result in the CPI to March and an improving employment position, no one should be content with the present economic situation that we have in Australia. But all does not rest on the shoulders of the Commonwealth Government. The responsibility rests with

1884 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

the States, local government bodies and semi-government authorities to restrict their borrowing requirements, to cut their expenditures and to provide support for their State industries. Economies vary from State to State so that what we have in Australia is an average of those six States and the Territories. For instance, the statistics on employment transfers in favour of Queensland are rather startling. Of the civilian employable population of 15 years of age and over, in the year to January 198247,600 transferred to Queensland from other States such as New South Wales and Victoria. Yet, in spite of our growth in civilian population transfer of 2.8 per cent, I think it is important to realise that Queensland's unemployment rate has remained level. In addition, the transfers do not include those people who come from New Zealand to seek a better life in Queensland while bypassing the other States.
I believe that my electorate of Dawson is the most productive, prosperous and progressive electorate in Australia. I refer to the many different types of development in that electorate, including the new ports at Abbot Point above Bowen, the doubling of the Hay Point coal capacity near Mackay and the proposal for further ports at the lower end of the electorate in the Livingstone subdivision. I refer also to the proposed developments at the Riverside lease and the Winchester South lease which will double the population of Moranbah within the next three or four years. The new town site of Glendon will be a population base for some 3,000 people by 1984 when the Newlands mine is expected to produce coal for export through Abbot Point. All of these projects are developments in respect of coal. A feasibility study costing some $20m to $24m is being undertaken with Japanese interests into one of the largest and accessible oil shale deposits in Australia at Condor near Proserpine. If this project comes on stream it will be just another example of mineral development that is taking place within Dawson and Queensland.
In addition to this a recent report forwarded to the Queensland Government indicated that the hinterland of Mackay and the central highlands, which covers basically the same area as does the Bowen Basin coal deposits, has great potential as a grain growing area. It is said that the potential of this area for grain production is as great as that of any area in Queensland, Australia or, in fact, probably the rest of the world. This potential makes this area important as a future food bowl. Tourism is important right throughout Queensland, particularly north Queensland. We now have access to international flights, and for this I thank the Minister for Transport (Mr

Hunt), who is sitting at the table. Many tourist attractions are being set up in this area. As a result of all this, Queensland has an economic growth which far surpasses that of any other State.
I would like to draw a comparison between Queensland and New South Wales, a State over which I fly when I travel to this place. I can comfortably predict that outside of Newcastle at least 40 coal ships, normally called 'Wran's navy', lie at anchor. Up to $500,000 is being wasted each day just on demurrage. The coal industry in New South Wales is now going into recession. In fact I understand that New South Wales is losing coal contracts not only to Queensland but also to countries such as Canada. This means that the Australian industry loses, exports are lost and the economy is dampened. We hear perpetually about a power crisis in New South Wales. We heard about such a situation last year. We have already heard about it this year; the situation will become worse during the winter months. There is also a transfer of labour from New South Wales to Queensland. People are going to Queensland to seek job opportunities which are opening in that State. In fact, I have read over the last six months that some people authoritatively say that the State of New South Wales is bankrupt. Queensland is different in that other State governments intervene in their economies, some in a progressive way and others, as I have said, in a regressive way as evidenced by New South Wales intervention in the New South Wales coal industry.
I think it is fair to say that while the responsibility for the economy lies with many people we should look very carefully at how private enterprise and private industry is promoted in this country. Too often government interventionState, Federal and local-depresses the opportunity for development of our private enterprise system. I think the Commonwealth Government has to bear some responsibility for this in that many incentives are not made across-the-board but are given for a particular purpose. While the results have been progressive for some industries they have not for others. As an example I mention the imposition of the export coal levy on the coal mining industry. In some instances the levy will mean the difference between whether or not a new enterprise starts. I know that some coal mining industry people are very concerned about this matter. There is also a lack of certainty in government legislation about whether we can alter depreciation rates, investment allowance rates and sales tax rates on expenditure committed in the hope that these allowances will apply.

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1885

This has not been the case. Therefore this matter is also of some concern.
Whilst I support requests by the States for private enterprise assistance for infrastructuretowns, education, transport and communication-I believe the States have to appreciate that they gain revenue by way of royalties, rail freights and other means. They have to look very carefully at the degree to which they impose infrastructure development on private enterprise in view of the. fact that royalties and other levies are intended to boost their finances to enable them to carry out this work themselves.
The legislation before us also gives me an opportunity to speak on some tax matters. I do not intend to do so in any depth because we will be discussing tax legislation later tonight. However, I believe that we should not tinker with or adopt a band-aid approach to direct taxation or to the indirect taxation. We need a major restructuring of the taxation system. The Income Tax Assessment Act was introduced into this Parliament around 1935. This means that it has survived 45 years under a band-aid philosophy. I believe there has to be a major restructuring of the system for contemporary Australia. We should not have to rely upon legislation that was evolved immediately after the Depression of the 1930s. There needs to be a complete re-write of the Act. I believe other honourable members will speak on this matter later in the debate. It is important that our approach to tax should be made on the basis that people should be given incentive to produce. The tax scales should be lowered. Incentives should be given to families to maintain themselves as a family unit and allow the breadwinner to get out and be productive.
I understand that the forecasts have now indicated a Budget deficit of almost $1,OOOm as against the Budget prediction of, I think, $150m. I think it is important that we look at this result in the light of the sales tax levy which was rejected by the Senate late last year and earlier again this year. This rejection has contributed to the increased deficit that we have today. I am not saying that the sales tax levy as it was first introduced had the full support of Government members. But it was part of the whole Budget context, and its rejection has meant a blow-out of the Budget deficit. We need a Budget that will balance. I say that without much hesitation, because if we do not and the Budget goes into deficit the price that we will pay is further inflation which is only another indirect tax which affects every citizen of this country. A deficit also affects the borrowing

program of a government where interest payments and redemption have to be met by future generations.
My concern for the next generation brings me to my next point. I have heard that the younger people of Belgium are deserting that nation in their droves to get away from the burden that is being imposed upon them for the social consequences of a government that has seen welfare as the be-all and the end-all. Now they see the debt and the commitment on the younger people mounting and they are the ones who will be forced into paying taxes to meet this debt. We can look at any country that provides such a massive welfare program. If we are not careful we will be letting our younger people in for a future which is far from rosy. I have already mentioned the consequences of borrowing now. This debt will have to be repaid by a future generation.
The prime matter in my mind is the national debt. But there is also the local government debt. I understand that at the moment the commitment for debt and interest redemption in the rates structure right throughout Australia runs at 35 per cent. That is a tremendous commitment merely to redeem the debts of past generations. It is not fair or good enough for those young Australians whom we want to come on and keep pace with the economy and work to improve it.
The darkest cloud on the immediate horizon for the young people, as I see it, is the future and growing commitment to pensions for the aged. Nobody wants to reduce pensions for the aged. I would say that everybody feels they have a commitment to making sure that our senior citizens are well looked after. I would say that the system of welfare that we have in Australia, particularly in regard to pensions, is as good as, if not better than, that of any other nation. But we have to make sure, out of sympathy for our younger people and our coming taxpayer population, that we do not allow that generosity to extend. When I say extend, I mean that the lowering of the ages at which people can obtain the pension should not be looked at unless it is looked at in the whole context of future commitment. There are also the future prospects of a zero population growth, as we have at the moment, and an aged population which will double by the year 2021. I believe we have to look very carefully at present policies to make sure that this does not occur.
I read with interest an article which said there is a non-contributory superannuation scheme in place in New Zealand. There is no such thing as a

1886 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

non-contributory plan for welfare or for superannuation. Somebody pays. As I see it at the moment, a non-contributory plan would be noncontributory only so far as the recipients are concerned. It would be contributed to by the taxpayer through the government. That is why I believe, at the moment, that one of the growing problems we have before us is a commitment now to a national superannuation scheme.
I have spoken about the area of welfare. There are still great areas of need in this country. One of the greatest is the needs of families. We must make sure that families keep together. An increase in the rebate for a spouse will do that. Such an increase is simply a matter of equity as far as the single income family is concerned. There are areas in the handicapped and the invalid pension field that need to be looked at. I believe that in those fields we implement our guidelines too severely and to the detriment of genuine people. All of these people have needs. In the past, and now, the welfare system in Australia has been directed not so much to the needs but to the wants. I refer particularly to pensions which are given without any income or means test, and also to the work test for the unemployed. I hear many complaints by employers that they have job vacancies but they cannot get employees. Whilst job vacancies may be registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, people are not coming forward to take these jobs. This is a serious situation. We have the CES to advise the best means of employment for people who come to it and yet these jobs are not being filled. I think that the work test for unemployment relief must be looked at very carefully.
I have supported this Government's intention not to pay the unemployment benefit to families of people who voluntarily put themselves out of work through strike action. There are other means of redress as far as the relief system is concerned, but unemployment benefit is not one of them. I feel that sometimes the CES advises applicants too much as to the best way in which they can continue to draw pensions and benefits while not being put to profitable and progressive work. The statistic that surprised me and which is important to me is the 80 per cent who are of pensionable age, that is those aged 60 and 65 and over, who can draw the pension. Surely this must be looked at to make sure that those people who have a need get the pension. But people should not get it irrespective of their assets. People who are prepared to deprive themselves of income and assets should not have access to it.
I briefly want to mention Australian manufacturing indusry. I have been described as a dry in

this House as far as tariffs are concerned. I believe that strong industry means a strong economy but a strong industry is not one that is supported on the crutches of the taxpayers and the consumers right throughout Australia. I think that over a period, as the Industries Assistance Commission has said, we must remove these crutches. An immediate solution is not being proposed but we must allow reconstruction in such a way that there will be an incentive for industry to rationalise, to improve and also to use the products that are available to Australia to encourage production and make industry more productive.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr HURFORD (Adelaide) (5.23)-1 support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Before talking about that amendment and reminding the House of its terms, I offer my warm congratulations to the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) for his splendid, compassionate, maiden speech which we heard in the last hour in the course of this debate. The honourable member for Lowe shows a keen concern for the residents of his constituency. He comes to this Parliament from the Parliament of New South Wales with a high reputation. After listening to that competent and compassionate maiden speech, we can fully understand why he comes to us with that reputation. I congratulate him, as I know my colleagues in the Parliament will also congratulate him.
I think the terms of the amendment bear repeating. We are not opposing this Bill. We are not in the business of stopping the Government having funds so we have put it in this way: 'Whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that'. We then make three strong points. The first one is that current economic policies have failed utterly to achieve the Government's stated objectives. I pause there to say that in many cases the Government's objectives would not be the objectives of the Australian Labor Party. We believe in reducing inequalities in this community. We believe in far greater growth than does the Government. I will say more about that later in my speech. But even looking at this Government's economic strategy and its performance in the terms of what it has set out to do we can say that it has failed, which is the first point of this amendment which we put to the House.
The second arm of this amendment is that this Bill maintains these disastrous policies which have depressed economic activity and living standards,

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1887

increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates and accentuated inequity and division in society. Who could wonder at those terms or disagree with them when we witness the level of interest rates with which the Australian people are being burdened at present, and when we witness the level of taxation with which the Australian people are being burdened. I refer not only to income tax but also to the increased indirect taxes. Some of them-thanks to the Labor Party, with some help from the Australian Democrats when it came to sales taxes-were stopped by our using our non-government majority in the Senate. But still the burdens have been great. Labor was not able to stop all of the sales tax increases going through. Indeed, some of them were supported by the Australian Democrats.
Let me come quickly to the third term of this amendment moved to the motion that this Bill making available money for the appropriations of government be read a second time. The third element is this: We need a completely new economic strategy. The Opposition's amendment in part, states:
. . . a completely new economic strategy is required to prevent the Australian economy sliding into deeper recession, and to provide any hope of sustained economic recovery.
I will deal with that alternative economic strategy in the course of my speech on this Bill. The economy of Australia is in a mess. What better illustration-other than what I have said about interest rates and tax rates-than the fact that in this month, April 1982, Japan has overtaken us on the international league table of per capita incomes. In other words, due to this Government's economic policies, we find that, on a per head of population ins;ome basis, from now on Japan will overtake us. A lot of other countries have overtaken us in recent years. I will talk about those league tables in greater detail later if I have time. Let me say-I am referring to countries in this part of the world-that if we go on pursuing the monetarist economic policies that have been pursued by the Fraser Government over the last six and a half years we will find, at the present rate, that Singapore and Hong Kong will overtake us on the per capita league table by the end of the 1990s. The expenditure appropriated in this Bill is totally inadequate to get the economy moving on the growth path necessary if we are to stop this sort of thing happening; if we are to stop the decline in relative living standards, with more and more countries overtaking us.
Let there be no doubt that monetarism is still in full flight under the authority of this Fraser Government. It is bringing enormous hardship in its wake. I want to describe what is happening,

how this monetarism is being applied and what it does. It works by restricting bank and other lending. Its whole purpose is to limit credit. When credit is limited it becomes more expensive and interest rates increase. This results in the high interest rates which we are suffering now. Who does this benefit? Of course, it benefits those who receive the high interest rates. Who are they? Of course, they are the more wealthy in our community who have money to lend, including the banks. The better off, the more well-to-do in our community, are the ones who benefit by higher interest rates. Policies of limiting credit and making that credit more expensive through high interest rates do not hurt those who have no need to borrow, but, my goodness as one goes down the table to people of lesser wealth one finds the penalties applying. The penalties start as one passes down the income scale to those who have less than the well-to-do to whom I referred earlier.
The whole purpose of the monetarist policy is to restrain activity. The well-to-oo have a margin, they are not so hurt; but those who are less well off are deprived and restrained by the monetarist policy. Let us examine who they are. First of all there are those who must borrow for their businesses. I refer particularly to small business people. They are burdened enormously by higher interest rates and by not being able to borrow from the banks what they need for their businesses. Those who must borrow to house themselves, of course, are also enormously burdened. I refer particularly to new home owners who incomes are low when they go into marriage. Those people now are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. There are those who must replace their consumer durables-their cars, their washing machines and other such items. They are limited by this monetarist policy that we have been suffering for six years. The consequence of this is, of course, a record number of bankruptcies in this nation.
As I said earlier, the less income one has, the worse is the effect of the monetarism policy. It directly hits the employment of the most vulnerable in our community. Its direct purpose is to wind back wages growth. The only way that Labor's political opponents know to do this is to throw people into unemployment and to create idle plant capacity. I point out that a good purpose can be achieved by restraining income growthnot just wages but other income as well-if we are to fight inflation effectively. I do not quibble with that purpose; what I do quibble with is the monetarist way in which the Government is achieving that purpose. I recognise that restraining wages growth is necessary; so is restraining prices growth

1888 REPRESENTATIVES 27-April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

and so is encouraging discounting of prices. All these things are all right if-it is a big 'if-they are carried out in the right way. But these blunt monetarist ways are not the right ways of achiev-
ing this purpose. These monetarist policies penalise the young, those who are burdened by interest rates, the disorganised, and the most vulnerable in our society, as I said earlier. In summary, monetarism rewards the rich at the expense of the poorer people in this community. It leads to social disruption of great magnitude. We suffer enough divisions in our society; we do not want more. But this monetarism approach to our economy is creating more and more divisions in this society. What must be put in its place? I will come to that in detail in a moment.
I want to dwell on some of the effects of mone-
tarism at the present time. There is a danger in listing statistics but it is necessary at least to point out to this House that unemployment in March 1982 was at the level of 460,000, 6.7 per cent of the work force. Just a year ago it was 409,900, 6 per cent of the work force. Heaven knows, the level of unemployment was bad enough a year ago at 6 per cent, but it is getting worse. This has occurred after six and a half years of a government which said it was coming to power in order to put the economy right. In February 1982 there were 33,700 job vacancies. There was no improvement to speak of from February 1981. I refer now to production statistics. Pig iron production was down 12.5 per cent; raw steel production was down 15.5 per cent; and clay brick production was down 9.4 per cent. One could go on through this list of sad statistics which betray the sad fate of our economy at the present time. I repeat: The figures were bad enough a year ago, but now they are appalling. There is little excuse for pursuing further this monetarist ideology that has given rise to these effects.
A survey of industrial trends conducted by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales which was released recently revealed that a severe downturn occurred in the Australian manufacturing sector. It showed that the level of new orders, output and employment fell in the three IYonths leading up to that survey. The people who were involved with the surveywere extremely pessimistic about the period ahead. 9ne does not wonder that they were extremely pessimistic when one dwells on the figures that I just gave to the House. This Government's policies continued to be based on the so-called 'fight inflation first' theory, which is being increasingly discredited around the world. To fight inflation first has meant to fight inflation forever. This is particularly tragic because, even

when the economy is recessed, the level of inflation is maintained in the 9 to 11 per cent range by the cost pressures of tax charges and interest rates. One swallow does not make summer. One improved consumer price index result given last week does not mean that the situation is not still tragic. Even though the level of unemployment
has been increasing at an enormous rate in recent years because of this Fraser Government's policies, the performance of this Government in relation to inflation is terrible.
The Labor alternative rejects the concept that inflation or anything else should be treated first, or alone. Our primary objective is full employ-
ment, but that does not mean that we pursue it first among some imaginary sequence of objectives. The fact is that sustainable full employment requires that there be co-ordination of a number of policies at once. These must aim at securing improvements over time in relation to all of the key objectives. Let me talk about the Labor alternative. There should be an immediate cut in taxes by abandoning any ideas of introducing new sales taxes. There ought to be also a lifting of the income tax threshold by at least $500, thus giving all taxpayers a cut of $3 a week and freeing hundreds of thousands of low income earners from tax. This is particularly urgent now, when so many pensioners in this coming week will be getting an increase in pensions and so many of those pensions will become taxable. Now is the time when we need that threshold lifted, not in six weeks time or at the time of the next Budget. It would save many people from becoming taxable when they do not deserve to be taxed.
The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) talked about this subject yesterday and in his speech today, so I shall leave the matter at that. However, I should say that tax cuts also make economic sense as well as social sense. Properly directed, they will expand the money supply which, as I have stated, is currently running at far too low a level under these monetarist policies. Unless alternative policies are introduced, unless there is a substantial change of economic strategies, it is clear that in the year 1982-83 the economy will be in an even worse state than it was in the year that has gone by, and indeed as bad as it was in the 1930s. Australians will miss out on the opportunities which are available to us, because Australia is the lucky country. We have so much going for us in the way of lower priced energy if only we had a more expansionary policy to take advantage of it.
One word summarises Labor's economic strategy as I am putting it to the House. That word is 'growth'. Growth through expansion of the public

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1889

sector does not only mean more jobs in the public sector by appropriating more in an Appropriation Bill such as those before the House; it also means jobs in the private sector, because one feeds off the other. That brings me also to the need for growth in the expansion of the money supply, which is being kept so tight at present and which is so much a cause of the high interest rates to which I have drawn attention. Growth of demand through increased government spending also needs that growth in the money supply to bring down those interest rates. We must not allow our economy to ricochet back into an inflationary situation. Labor will not allow that. That is why we have an anti-inflation program. We advocate very strongly a prices and incomes policy as a base for expansion. I go so far as to say that we cannot have that more expansionary budgetary and monetary policy, that greater spending, that easing of the tight rein on money supply, unless we have that prices and incomes policy in place. This means restraints on all incomes, not just wages, and it means restraints on prices as well. So we do not talk just about wages, we do not jawbone just wage-earners, as do our political opponents-the Fraser Government, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. We talk about restraints of all incomes. We shall not get that restraint, understandably, in wage claims unless there is something in line to achieve restraint in relation to higher incomes.
Why should we get that restraint? What about doctor's incomes? What about lawyers' incomes? What about the incomes of senior company executives? Indeed, what about politicians' incomes? I believe that almost all members of this Parliament, if not all of them, would be party to restraint on their incomes if they saw it as part of an overall prices and incomes strategy-instead of their falling further behind as has been the case to date. Well might I ask: What about the incomes of all of those who determine prices? Who is it who believes that we shall get a prices and incomes policy into line unless we have a form of prices justification tribunal monitoring what is going on in the prices sector? Of course, one will have to be re-established. I do not hold necessarily to having the particular type of tribunal that we have had in the past. We learnt much from that. Perhaps there will not be the need for such a legalistic approach. But certainly an institution there will need to be to make sure that there is restraint in the prices sector, which restraint is absolutely vital if we are to have that prices and incomes policy on line which itself is vital for that more expansionary growth policy which Labor pursues.

We can base a prices and incomes policy, of course, on wages indexation, but there must be restraint beyond that. It is much better to give living standard increases in forms of relative price reductions by achieving price restraints than by giving such increases in the form of wage increases, which so often lead to another bout of inflation.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr DONALD CAMERON (Fadden) (5.43)-This afternoon I have listened very closely to two major, important spokesmen for the Australian Labor Party in this debate.
Mr Cohen-You should have waited for me.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-The honourable member for Robertson will speak after dinner, but I have listened to two Labor spokesmen who have managed to maintain their position on the front bench. If other people had listened to them as closely as I have, they would have formed the view that there is more than two bob each way; there is total conflict and confusion in what they are saying. What strikes me as even more frightening is the fact that both speakers stuck very closely to prepared notes-in order, perhaps, to avoid conflict in terms of what they were saying.
We had the remarkable statement by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that in the near future Labor will announce its alternative policies. Labor will announce its policies! Here we are in a year in which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has been whipping up speculation that there would be a Federal election-so that he could keep the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) at bay. The whole nation has not known whether there would be an election. At this time, when there is supposed to be so much turmoil and difficulty, we have the official Labor spokesman on economic matters saying that Labor will be announcing its policies at some time in the future!
There were some other gems presented to the Parliament this afternoon by Labor spokesmen, such as the gem from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) when he indicated that Labor would not regard it as paramount to continue to fight inflation. Do I understand the honourable member correctly?
Mr Hurford-No, you do not. I said that we would not dwell only on inflation; we would have a range of policies, not inflation only.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-A range of policies-it is as undefined as that. My friend the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) is

1890 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

laughing as he tries to put his interpretations on the form of words that came from the honourable member for Adelaide. This Government has always regarded inflation as being of paramount importance.
Mr Hurford-We think that unemployment is important as well.
Mr DONALD CAMERON-I have not finished yet. The honourable member is starting to write my speech for me. I do not need that type of assistance. This Government has always recognised in other areas the need to maintain a strong Australia. What the honourable member for Adelaide told us when he said that Labor would create jobs through the public sector-which means more Government expenditure, more public servants, more grandiose schemes of the sort to which this country was subjected between 1972 and 1975-was that this would help the private sector. That is what he said. He said that there should be more public servants-more people feeding on one another. Let me go back in time. I am not one who harps about yesteryear. The period 1972 to 1975 is a long way back, thankfully, but the lessons of that period should not be forgotten. Excess expenditure in that time created a growth rate in unemployment the likes of which we had not previously seen in this country.
The difference between the level of unemployment under Labor and the level that this country is currently suffering from is that during Labor's reign unemployment grew and jobs disappeared. We have a real problem with the growth in unemployment. I acknowledge that this problem exists. It worries me as much as it worries anybody else in this place. However, in recent times we have seen a growth in the number of new jobs. According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures which were released early in April, approximately 80,000 new jobs were created in Australia in the previous 12 months. That did not happen during the Labor Administration. In Labor's time the only new jobs created were public sector jobs-in the Government employees area. That is one of the reasons that this country went into such a spiral. With respect to the honourable member for Adelaide, I still do not think Australia has anywhere near recovered from some of the excesses of that period of administration.
It is granted that some of the world's problems today have contributed to Australia's problems. When the honourable member for Adelaide was comparing income levels in Japan I interjected, appropriately I think, that in Japan a lump of steak on a plate costs about $30. It suited the honourable .member to ignore the interjection.

Living standards in different countries vary. If an Australian were challenged to live on the income levels that exist in some Asian countries he would find it impossible to do so because the living standards are totally different. I do not for a moment say that is justification for Australia falling back in terms of its relative position but it is beyond the pale for honourable members to cite in this House figures of like countries without taking into account the prices which exist in those countries. There is no escaping the fact that in recent years Japan has suffered greatly in terms of inflation. Japan is very dependent on other countries. When there is a downturn in world purchasing Japan, which is manufacturing oriented, slips more than importing countries do when there is a world recession or a downturn Japan does not have the insulation that fortunately Australia possesses.
The honourable member for Adelaide and all Labor speakers conveniently omit at all times to make any reference to the battles of the trade union movement for shorter working hours in this country. Many of the unions believe-they sell this idea to their workers-that if we work fewer hours in a week it will create more jobs. I do not contest the sincerity of some of them in that belief. But I do contest the policy of the educated, knowledgeable men in the Labor ranks who simply sit to one side quietly because they do not want to upset their base support. The facts of life are that the world is going through a difficult situation, Australia is going through a difficult situation and all around this country we can find examples of people who are prepared to go out on lightning strikes simply in support of a 35-hour working week. I think it was the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) who, in his position as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions a few years ago, made some reference to a man's wage increase being another man's job. If a person is to work only 35 hours a week and an employer has to keep him on overtime for an extra five hours that will certainly contribute to higher unemployment and more difficulties for other people in the work force.
If people want to work say 35 hours a week because they want to create more jobs, the only possible way it can follow is if they accept a salary or income level commensurate with a 35-hour week. That would be the test of sincerity. But I have yet to hear one union leader or one Labor spokesman in this Parliament advocate that course of action. They know that is not what their campaign is all about. The 35-hour week issue is simply a disguised campaign for higher wages. I am not arguing against increases which are sought and considered necessary to allow people in the

work force to maintain their living standards. 1am talking about the back-door method of acquiring increases which contribute greatly to the difficulties of this nation, whether it is the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or a party of any other philosophy that is at the helm.
When 1 was putting together my thoughts on this afternoon's debate 1 felt it appropriate to look at a couple of letters that had recently arrived on my desk. 1 link this comment with the comments of the honourable member for Adelaide, who said that Labor will cut taxes. That promise is the same as the theory that these Liberals love motherhood, Labor loves motherhood and we all love motherhood. But on the other side of the coin, is the question of how we go about producing motherhood. Likewise, how we go about producing tax cuts? On one hand the honourable member for Adelaide talks about increasing public sector employment-the number of public servants-which can be paid for only in one way and on the other hand he talks about the difficulties of those on limited incomes. He cannot have it both ways.
1 have received a letter from the Australian Taxpayers Association. No doubt Labor members of this House have also received a similar letter. The Secretary to the Association, Mr Eric Risstrom, talks in the letter abut the extra money that will flow into the Government's coffers in the current financial year because of people moving to higher income levels. 1 do not contest the accuracy of what Mr Risstrom has to say. The letter states:
Our figures show that, even if spending went up 14 per cent (12.6 per cent in 1981-82), and if wages rose in 1982-83 by only 14.5 per cent . . . there should be between $1,200 millions and $1,400 millions available to cut taxes from 1st July.
Those comments are under the heading 'The Unavoidable Conclusion: Tax Cuts from 1st July'. Other members would have received today a communication from a group of people representing religious welfare agencies who held a meeting on 22 April, only days ago. The letter was sent by Reverend Father Kevin Mogg, Reverend Canon Peter Hollingworth and Rosemary Kiely. The letter came in an envelope marked the 'Brotherhood of St Laurence'. Listen to what it had to say about the $1 ,400m. There would be millions of people in this country screaming out: 'I agree completely with what the Australian Taxpayers Association is saying because 1 am personally carrying too heavy a burden'. The second statement reads:
We understand that the Commonwealth Government will have an extra $1 ,400m available as a result of the effect of inflation on the tax scales. Social justice requires that this money should be used to supplement the incomes of the poor, and of

families, rather than to provide relief to affluent taxpayers without family responsibilities.
We can all commend and applaud those ideals. These people go on to state that the best way to assist the more needy groups is to devise more equitable means of sharing the tax burden, which burden has increasingly tended to fall on those who are least able to pay-the low to middle income earners.
One minute they are saying: 'Let us avoid giving tax cuts back to affiuent taxpayers without family responsibilities' and within another 20 lines or less they are talking about the tax burden falling more heavily on the low to middle-income earner. For a long time 1 have expressed the view that the group in our community which today carries the heaviest burden is that containing the pay-as-youearn taxpayer. He cannot escape; he is locked in. 1 have expressed the view also that the amount of money that is being lost in this country through tax evasion-through people who receive money in the hand and never declare it is totally appalling and disgraceful. There is no escaping the fact that the people who do that are shifting their responsibilities on to the shoulders of others.
While 1 have total sympathy and indeed do my best to assist those who are totally reliant upon government for support, 1 am also appalled at the extent of ripping off the system which goes on in the community today. 1 am of the view that we have probably never been less honest in our approach to our responsibilities as a nation. One of the problems is that we have seen the more affiuent amongst us look to some of those who have been unemployed. Many of those unemployed are willing to work but some have appeared to dodge the system and, what is more, obtain financial support when avoiding work. We then have the more affiuent saying: 'Blow it, my money is not going to go to supporting some bludgers. 1 do not mind supporting those in genuine need'. Then we have people at the other end of the income scale looking up and saying 'Look at those ripping into the system through tax schemes, through simple tax evasion and other methods'. We have created in Australia in more recent years a merry-go-round, and all that is left in the middle is the PAYE taxpayer who cannot escape. 1 am not for a moment even remotely suggesting that a large percentage of people with higher incomes or those reliant on the Government are into the system, but I am saying that more people are into the system now than probably have been for a long time. The spindle of the merry-go-round is none other than the PAYE taxpayer.

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

In the few remaining moments I mention that this Bill has been introduced to seek extra govern.. ment expenditure. There is also a document which sets out how the Government has saved something like $36Om to $370m in government expenditure. I notice one of the largest areas of savings is the withholding of money for the replacement of much military equipment. Many people out there would applaud and say: 'Hear, hear'. Many people I meet express the view that Australia should not be spending money on defence and that the money should be directed elsewhere. If ever we had a time to remind ourselves that what has happened in history Will always happen again, it is right now with the problem between Argentina and Great Britain. there is no escaping the fact that Australia, an island jammed between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, has no alternative but to look after itself and to show its allies and friends that it is prepared to make a contribution to its own well-being, because if it does not do so it becomes a plum for the picking. I make a plea to Opposition spokesmen to use their influences amongst their own party supporters to try to persuade them against believing that one of the ways of curing this nation's economic ills is to abandon expenditure on defence. I believe that the honourable member for Adelaide would share my views on that subject.
Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.
Mr COHEN (Robertson) (8.0)-During the
past few weeks there has been more debate about exactly where the Australian economy is going than at any time since 1974. A spate of newspaper articles and comments by business leaders, economists and economic institutions suggesting that Australia is in the midst of a recession or worse was followed by cries ranging from 'foul' and 'shame' to something akin to treason for suggesting that everything in the Australian economy is less than perfect. Most of these assertions, that those who dared criticise the economy were at best unpatriotic and at worst traitors, came not surprisingly from the very same Liberal-National Country Party politicians who from 1972 to 1':)75 devoted every minute of every day to predicting imminent disaster for the Australian economy under a Labor Government. In what can be described only as criminal acts of sabotage, they were the original purveyors of gloom and doom as they delighted in terrifying the wits out of businessmen and consumers so that in the end their predictions contributed significantly to the economic downturn brought about by the energy crisis resulting from the October war. Anyone who has doubts about what I say need only read Hansard of that period.

These are the same people who promised, if elected, to turn on the lights, restore economic confidence, put sport back on the front pages, restore full employment, reduce interest rates and so on. After failing to do any of these things from 1975 to 1980, and when it appeared they were heading for defeat at the election due at the end of that year, they attempted to talk up the economy by issuing weekly bulletins about the billions of dollars that would be invested in a resources boom. Australia, we were told, was sitting on a gold mine and it was only a matter of time before we would be vying with the oil-rich Arab countries for the title of the richest nation in the world. Those who had the temerity to question this coming EI Dorado were once again described as Jeremiahs or traitors. This utopian future we all had to look forward to was, of course, the result of the wisdom, foresight and economic expertise of our beloved Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his colleagues.
Suddenly, all that changed. In a speech that must go down in the record as the greatest aboutface in history, and which is known as Malcolm's farewell to his troops, the Prime Minister informed a stunned nation that it was not all about to happen. After 6t years of tightening belts, razor gangs, no more free lunches and learning that life certainly was not easy, we were suddenly shocked to discover that we were not about to gain all the benefits that come to the righteous through self-denial. On the contrary, the best that Australians could look forward to was higher interest rates, increased taxes, higher inflation, greater unemployment and depressed living standards. The resources boom was over before it had started. Who was to blame for the wheels falling off? Was it the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) or anyone of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition? Not at all. Everyone knows that they are responsible only for the good things that happen in the Australian economy!
Just once I would like to hear this Government accept responsibility for something when it goes bad. God knows they are quick enough off the mark to claim credit if there is the slightest sign of improvement. Last week the first piece of good economic news for months arrived with the annoulicement by the Treasurer that the consumer price index had dropped from the December quarter increase of 4.4 per cent to a March quarter increase of 1.7 per cent. The annual rate of 11.3 per cent had come down to 10.5 per cent.
The last thing that I want to be is a prophet of gloom, or, to behave as the Liberals did during the period of the Whitlam Government, delight in

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1893

talking the economy down. However, I do want to examine those CPI figures and ask a few questions as to why there was such a drop during the March quarter. In doing so I want also to talk about a very vital sector of the economy upon which any recovery is dependent-the retail sector.
The headlines that heralded the new figures did, in fact, in part explain the reduction: 'Food, Clothing slow inflation to 1.7 per cent' was the pronouncement of the Australian Financial Review of last Friday. It was not until today's issue that the slower increase in clothing prices was more fully explained. An article by Robyn Short, entitled 'Low apparel prices restrain
March quarter's rise in cpr, contained the
following statement:
The low increase in the March quarter's CPI clothing component was influenced by minimal rises in women's and girls' apparel, footwear, retail drapery and industrial wear and a fall in men's and boy's clothing prices.
Clothing price5 were held back by widespread discounting after soft demand in poor summer weather in most Australian capitals and the subsequent overstocking especially in men's and boy's wear.
These revelations were hardly news to people in the clothing industry and they go some way towards explaining the confusion that occurred earlier this year when debate ensued over exactly what sort of Christmas retailers had had. Late last year it was widely reported in the Press that December trading was very depressed and that the usual ttramatic lift in spending prior to Christmas had not eventuated. Early in the New Year, however, somewhat different reports appeared indicating that retailers had in fact had a good Christmas, despite their assertions to the contrary. Their wailing was put down to the usual habit, so it was said, of retailers crying poor mouth and never being satisfied. The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 February, under the headline 'Late rally in consumer demand', had this to say:
Official figures show that Australia's retailers had a good Christmas, shattering earlier doubts about the strength of consumer spending during the festive period.
After most of 1981 had been strong for the shopkeepers, sales slumped during October and November and brought on fears that Christmas could also be bad.
But the bureau's figures show that Christmas sales totalled $4.25 billion which, after seasonal adjustment, represented a 3 per cent rise on November's result and the best monthly increase since March, 1980.
This December's sales total was 13 per cent ahead of December, 1980, bettering last year's 11.3 per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index.
I do not question the Bureau's figures but I do question the Press interpretation of them. What happened-I speak from a close and intimate

knowledge of the trade-was that with few exceptions retailers in almoSt all retail trading areas experienced one of their worst ever trading periods leading up to Christmas. Normally speaking, retailers stock up heavily in October and November, looking forward to the month of December for vastly increased sales and their best, in some cases their only, opportunity to make a profit.
After an appalling start to summer caused by bad weather, industrial problems, power shortages in New South Wales, high interest rates and higher taxes-all contributing to lack of consumer confidence-most retailers, not just clothing retailers, panicked. I do not mean to imply that their panic was unjustified. Retailers know from long experience that if they do not sell their goods in October, November and December, particularly December, they will have great difficulty selling them in January and February. After Christmas, with people away on holidays and usually having spent a great deal before Christmas, consumer spending is very tight. This is particularly true in the clothing sector, which is more seasonal than most areas. Clothing retailers have to clear their stocks by February to make way for the new season's autumn-winter fashions. Seeing that their figures were well down for Christmas trading, many retailers quite rightly decided to have unusually heavy sales in the last week or two before Christmas. These sales may well have boosted Christmas spending and kept the December figures high, but anyone who interprets this as meaning that the December trading was satisfactory fails completely to understand the way in which business operates.
If the figures were satisfactory in terms of their total spending, they would certainly not be satisfactory in terms of their profitability. The simple fact is that with some exceptions Christmas trading was bad and most retailers had a very poor season. They know, as the Government ought to know, that they cannot trade forever by having sales. These sales continued throughout the whole of the retail sector during January and February with the result that the March quarter consumer price index showed a reduced inflation rate of 1.7 per cent. While I welcome the reduction in the CPI, I think that the House ought to be aware of the price that was paid for that drop. On 2 April the Australian, under the heading 'Consumer confidence drops-Retail sales dip, car registrations slip into reverse', stated:
Signs of a significant decline in retail sales emerged yesterday with the release of figures showing a sharp fall in consumer demand in February.

1894 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

Retail sales in the month fell 6.2 per cent from January to $2,741 million. Seasonally adjusted, sales were down 0.4 per cent to $3,134 million.
The setback follows a fall in another key economic indicator, car registrations, which, according to figures released on Wednesday, slumped 10.3 per cent ir. February.
Registrations had been one of the few reliable economic indicators to record rises each month since October.
The article then went on to make the point that I really want the House to take notice of. It stated:
The fact that retail sales and registrations have fallen in February indicates rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy are starting to bite into consumer confidence.
Falling retail sales have an indirect impact in other areas of the economy, affecting wholesalers and manufacturers.
Sackings can be expected if the trend continues.
What is even more depressing is what has occurred since February. No figures have yet been released for March or April but, if the stories which I have been hearing in the trade are correct, the situation as far as the retail trade is concerned is bordering on calamitous. One needs only to talk to people in the retail trade or the manufacturing sector to know just how bad things are. The reason for this slump ought to be obvious to even the dullest member of the Government. It is no good the Government blaming the trade unions, the Opposition, the United States economy or Uncle Tom Cobley.
The slump in consumer spending is caused by three factors. The first two are increased interest rates and increased taxation. There would hardly be one taxpayer who is not affected by interest rates. Everyone who is paying off a home or a car or who is operating on an overdraft has, over the past year or two, found that he or she has less disposable income. It is as simple as that. The wages of taxpayers may be increasing but because of massive increases in interest rates and because taxpayers often find themselves in a higher tax bracket, the amount of money which they have to spend on food, clothing, furniture, electrical goods, travel, motor vehicles, leisure and all the other goods and services that our economy provides and which enable the wheels of commerce to turn is decreasing. When the taxpayers find that they have less disposable income and they hear the Prime Minister tell the nation that despite six years of frugal living that have gone for nothing all he can promise is a depressing economic outlook, it is hardly surprising that the Prime Minister has lost that vital component for a prosperous economy-consumer confidence. People simply will not buy in the present economic climate, and who can blame them?
If the economy is going into a recession, or worse, the natural reaction of people-be they retailers, manufacturers, wholesalers or

consumers-is to batten down the hatches and wait until things get better. Consumers delay buying a new car-they make the old one do for another year-cancel the annual holiday, postpone doing that extension to the house and certainly delay buying clothing, electrical appliances and all those other goods and services that are not considered essential. They may not be essential to the lifestyles of consumers, but it is essential for our economy that someone buys these goods. If the consumer stops buying, so do the retailer, the wholesaler and the manufacturer. If they stop buying, eventually the wheels fall off, bankruptcies ensue and unemployment rises dramatically. It is not a complicated matter; it is very simple. It is the way in which our economy operates.
There may be little the Government can do about interest rates, about the demand for our raw materials or even some of the inflation, but there is something it can do to restore some consumer confidence, and that is to cut taxes and put more money into consumers' pockets. I recognise that consumer confidence is a very ephemeral thing. It can come and go very quickly. At the moment it is at a very low level and it may go even lower, which, quite frankly, will be absolutely disastrous. It is not something I look forward to with any pleasure. The news that the inflation rate was lower for the March quarter, and the news of a slight rally on the stock exchange, is some good news but it needs to be supplemented by substantial tax cuts, and they need to come soon. It is no good waiting until the Budget and then telling taxpayers that they will get their first tax cuts in November. By then it may be too late. If people are to regain their confidence and start spending again, an announcement needs to be made now, with the tax cuts taking effect no later than 1 July. I understand that this is what Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association told the Cabinet last week when he presented it with his submissions for the 1982-83 Budget. Promises of tax cuts may soon just avert the sort of disaster that I believe is imminent-I believe this with all sincerity-unless there is a pick-up in consumer confidence in the next two or three months. I support the amendment.
Mr FALCONER (Casey) (8.18)-The House is debating a group of Appropriation and Supply Bills for the service of government expenditure for the next few months. I want to deal with some
matters concerning taxation policy. Some speakers in the debate so far have talked about taxation policy and in particular the need for taxation cuts. I want to talk about some of the social implications of the way in which we might approach any taxation reforms to be introduced in

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1895

the near future. The point I want to make is specifically with respect to a very significant group within my electorate. I refer to young married people who in the last few years have started off in their first house and have a very young family. In many cases the situation in which they have found themselves is that they entered into commitments two, three or four years ago when interest rates were lower than they are at present. They entered into those commitments with certain expectations of what they would be able to manage in their household budgets for the first few years of their married lives. Frequently, those commitments were entered into at a stage when two inc'lmes were still coming into the household. After a short while, when the family came along, those two incomes dropped to one income. Despite the wonders of modern family planning, those families have a habit of coming along a little earlier than expected and that often results in a squeeze on the household finances. With a regime of rising interest rates, however much they might be explainable in economic terms, people in that situation find that their disposable income is not as much as they had expected when they did their original budgets, and they have to trim and to cut to make ends meet.
The point of citing that particular group is that I want to make the strong plea that in any taxation reforms that are undertaken we look at the social implications of those reforms and not merely at the economic implications. For example, a decision on whether to base taxation policy on personal taxes or on family and household incomes might have similar economic effects in terms of the aggregate figures that one might come up with in a Budget, but they will have vastly different social outcomes. It is vital, before any measures are considered, torelate those measures to a government's social objectives as well as its economic aims.
I want to suggest that while there is a good case for saying that there ought to be an overall taxation reduction, particularly in the personal income tax area, I believe that we have to ensure that some part, indeed a substantial part, of any taxation reform ought to be targeted towards introducing improvements in areas of social priority. I want to suggest that one major need is the need to transfer resources to the family at the time when its needs are greatest-that is when it has dependent children and while it is gathering resources to have children. This is a question with strong political, economic and social overtones.
Clearly the two-parent family, where both are working, with or without children, has a substantial advantage. It may well be that in some

cases-in many cases-people have been forced into a situation where they have tried to get two incomes into the household in order to meet the commitments that I have outlined already, such as increasing costs, particularly of interest rates. But certainly a two-income family with no dependent children has a substantial advantage in present circumstances. This is due to the effect of two tax thresholds. The first $8,390 of family income is tax free compared with the first $4,195 for a single income family. Whilst they do not benefit from the spouse rebate the effect of the extra tax threshold is equivalent to a spouse rebate of $1,342.40 on taxable incomes below $17,894. By contrast, the two-parent family with only one working gets a spouse rebate of $830 and the single parent family a rebate of $580. Generally speaking, those families with dependants are better off than those without; this reflects the value of the family allowance scheme. Nevertheless, a single income family without dependants is better off than a single parent family with dependants where the parent is employed. This reflects the greater value of the spouse rebate compared with the single parent rebate. The current spouse rebate is equivalent to $2,594 of income per year whereas the single parent rebate is equivalent to $1,812.50 per year.
I suggest that a proper order of priority for government tax relief or direct assistance should be based on the following principles: Firstly, families with dependants should be given support compared with families without dependants, having regard to present costs in the community; secondly, families with a dependent spouse should be favoured somewhat over those without, reflecting the economic objective in part of trying to encourage some people not to work in order to bring extra income into the household. This would assist in providing more employment opportunities for younger people. I do not for a moment want to suggest that married women who wish to work or who wish to follow a career should not do so. But where both parents are working out of economic necessity rather than of their own free choice I think we have to give them some incentive to correct that situation and get back to the position they would prefer to be in-that is, one parent working and the other carrying out the role of full time home maker.
Various proposals for assistance which have been canvassed in the community encompass a range including the following: Firstly, the introduction of income splitting for single income families; secondly, an increase in the spouse rebate to some much larger figure; and, thirdly, an increase

1896 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April ,1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

in family allowance payments with some suggestions that those increased family allowance payments should be means tested or taxed so that a greater proportion of the assistance is directed to families in the greatest need. Another suggestion that is made is the reintroduction of some form of dependent child rebate.
Income.splitting does not help the single parent family, nor does it maximise assistance for the low income family whose tax liability can be a negative figure. It makes no distinction between families with or without children. Increasing the spouse rebate helps the low income family relatively more than the higher income family. It does little or nothing for the single parent family depending on what is done with the sole parent rebate. Depending on the level of rebate, the low income family may still finish with a negative tax liability so assistance in this field is limited. Providing tax rebates for dependent children will assist all families with dependants. Higher income groups are relatively better off than low income groups who pay little tax to begin with. However, it does transfer the tax burden .to the two-income family with or without dependants since only one taxpayer would be able to claim the rebate.
One of the points I make on the employment side is that our economy, despite its inadequacies, despite the fact that it has not had the rate of growth that we would have hoped for it, has had a fairly good record in creating employment compared with economies of many other countries. If we look at the actual percentage of the population employed compared with several years ago we can see that there has been a very significant growth in employment.
Mr Barry Jooes-You have to take part time employment into account.
Mr FALCONER-Yes. I was going to say that we have to look at the way in which that is broken up, and the type of people who are in employment now compared with several years ago. There are some interesting figures. I know that it can be oversimplifying things to cite overall figures, but one comparison that I have, and one may query the basis on which it has been put together, gives me this information. Last year I did some calculations on the basis of available informatin and at that time 43.3 per cent of the population were in actual paid employment compared with-on the same type of figures calculated in the same way-42 per cent of the population seven years ago. Over that period the total population grew by 1.3 million but, of that 1.3 million, 705,000 people entered the paid work force. So 54 per cent of the increase entered the paid work force.

One may want to query how valid those figures are as an absolutely fair comparison depending on how many were in various categories of employment, how many were in full time and part time employment, and indeed constituted the definition of full time employment. But I think it indicates that this economy has not had a bad record in creating extra jobs. This reinforces the point that I made that if we have a situation in which some people are entering the work force out of economic necessity because of a squeeze on their household finances at a time when they would prefer to have a situation whereby only one parent was working and the other was looking after the family full time, it does place a very high social priority on us to adjust our taxation and general welfare policies in a way which gives the young family facing real cost pressures the maximum possible assistance at that time in their life. That will not only have very desirable economic consequences, and not only very desirable consequences in social terms, in terms of the welfare of those families who would prefer to organise their affairs in that way, but also will give us some prospect of creating extra openings for people who at present want to work but who find the competition from more experienced people in the community too great for them.
In areas such as retailing, for example, it is quite often very hard for young people who want to enter retailing as shop assistants to compete with older people with more maturity, more experience in dealing with other members of the community who are also seeking jobs in those same shops. That situation arises frequently. In that sort of situation where people would prefer not to be working and would prefer, if their economic circumstances permitted, to have the opportunity of looking after the family full time, I think our taxation and welfare policies ought to give the maximum possible impetus.
The source of any economic strategy insofar as it relates to the structure of the Budget must be the growth in real gross domestic product. Only growth will allow the Government to reduce its overall percentage take or to provide for more services. Any attempt to increase the level of services or to provide more services to more people will demand higher levels of taxation or inflationary monetary policies unless there is a pool of uncommitted resources from which to draw. This can come only from real growth-an increase in the size of the cake. It is politically and economically irresponsible to engage in such increase in services without economic growth. This is what the Whitlam Government did in 1974-75 in particular

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1897

and the nation, to some extent, is still living with that.
The Government has two options. It can substantially reduce the level of services or hold the real level and foster growth until the cake catches up with it. So far it has done neither to the maximum extent that we would like although we have had some desirable results. It is interesting to look at a table which was published in Budget Statement No. 6 and which tells the story of the changes in the total demands made on public spending, government spending, at all levels as a proportion of the gross domestic product. The table published in Budget Statement No. 6 indicates that in 1971-72 all Commonwealth authorities took 24.6 per cent as a proportion of gross domestic product. These are outlays of public authorities as proportions of gross domestic product. That grew to 30.7 per cent in 1975-76. We have been able to peg that back somewhat to the extent that in 1980-81 the preliminary figures in the Budget Papers indicated that that was 29.1 per cent. It showed a decrease from the peak percentage of 30.7 per cent in 1975-76.
If we look at all State and local authorities in that same lO-year period we find that in 1971-72 all State and local authorities accounted for 17 per cent of outlays of public authorities as proportions of the gross domestic product. That grew 10 1977-78 to a peak of 20.9 per cent and in 1980-81 it slipped slightly to 20.1 per cent. The aggregate effect of that was that all public authorities accounted for 32 per cent of outlays as proportions of gross domestic product in 1971-72 growing to a peak of 39.7 per cent in 1977-78 and then slipping back to 38.1 per cent in 1980-81. ~learly, it is not possible to blame only the preVIOU:S government or the States for the problem. Nevertheless, the final figures for 1980-81 and the preliminary figures for 1981-82 suggest that the Commonwealth is at least moving in the right direction.
Everyone per cent of growth in real gross domestic product adds approximately $1.3 billion to the economy. The Federal Government will take, at present tax rates, about $350m. I am using some fairly round figures. This is what the Commonwealth has to play with, so to speak. It can use it to reduce taxes or to increase spending. Further, it can use the increase to improve its opportunities for stimulating growth.
Finally, I suggest, as I did when I opened my remarks, that in looking at the sort of flexibility that we might have in the next Budget the Commonwealth ought to look at its social priorities-at direct assistance to families in need, in particular,

and other categories in the community which are in need-as well as at giving some measure of taxation relief to the whole community as far as personal income tax is concerned. This is a subjective thing, but I believe that high rates of personal income tax have a very strong psychological effect on our community. They act as a disincentive to people who want to go out and achieve, to invest to produce growth, to work harder and to be more productive.
This is one reason the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Government have been keen to see a readjustment of our taxation system away from the very substantial reliance we place on personal income tax at present. There is room for change in the taxation system in terms of the balance of taxes that we draw from different sectors of the economy and there is room also for overall relief in personal income tax. I hope that in that there will be a bias in favour of families with very real commitments and facing serious budgetary problems.
Dr THEOPHANOUS (Burke) (8.36)-The economic crisis which this nation faces is the result of a metaphysical obsession on the part of this G~)Vernment and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) With monetary policy. I describe it as a metaphysical obsession because the Government completely ignores all empirical evidence of economic disaster. It is blind to rational critique from economists; businessmen, union leaders and community leaders. It is obsessed with the pursuit of its one and only path-controlling the money supply, increasing taxes and attacking the public sector. The Government's obsession with this strategy continues notwithstanding its monumental failure overseas and in Australia in the last seven years. Indeed, the Government is so dogmatic in its pursuit of its monetarist policies that it

State election.
Although the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has tried to deny responsibility for this shattering series of defeats, it is clear to all that the electorate totally rejects liberalism-a-la-Fraser. This series of election defeats and internal crises for the Liberals has greatly strengthened the Australian Labor Party's chances of gaining office at the next election. However, the extraordinary and unfortunate outcome for the Australian people is that the Liberal Party of Australia, rather than changing direction, has decided to continue and to intensify its disastrous economic policies. The Treasurer's election as Deputy Leader in place of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) has strengthened the hand of the

::xtreme right-wing faction within the Liberal Pa;;ty. This man is so deeply committed to the ngid monetarist policies which have been ruining the economy that he behaves like a religious fanatic worshipping at the altar of Friedman.
Under the Fraser-Howard partnership Australia can expect only more of the same in regard to economic direction-a fact which is promoting widespread concern and discussion throughout Australia. This led the Australian Financial Review recently to devote a complete issue to the state of the economy, an issue full of gloom and predicting that the present recession in the economy could deepen into a genuine depression. This prediction provoked a highpowered debate in the media as to whether the Australian economy was on the verge of a depression. Irrespective of different viewpoints on this issue, the consensus is that the economy is in crisis, that the Fraser Government's economic policies have led us into a serious recession which will continue and worsen unless new policy directions are adopted.
The nature of the economic crisis is worse than was anticipated. Much of the resources boom has failed to materialise. The level of unemployment has continued to increase. Interest rates have risen several times and they are set to rise again. There is a severe housing downturn, a slump in retail sales, and the rural export market is depressed. There is heavy pressure on the Australian dollar and business and consumer confidence is at a record low.
What do the Liberals propose to do about all this? The sad fact is that policies for renewal are not available within the Liberal Party, whose organisation has been increasingly taken over by fanatics committed to a continuous rundown of the public sector. The fundamental point that seems to have escaped the media is that neither the so called dries nor the wets have any new strategies directed towards solving the crucial crisis of stagnation and the fiscal crisis of the state-problems affecting all Western economies. In fact, the conservative policies promoted by the wets and the dries have already proven to be totally inadequate in solving these crises in other countries. So why pursue them in Australia?
It is clear that the conservatives have run out of ideas. The only response of the Treasurer to the flurry of media reports on the economic recession has been to call for less pessimism. The Treasurer's theory is that the more people talk about depression the more likely there is to be one. This is typical of the Liberal approach of trying to deal with the symptoms of crisis rather than

with the real causes. No wonder the Treasurer tries to avoid responsibility for his disastrous economic management by blaming the fact that economics is an inexact science. Whilst getting exact solutions may be difficult, we can learn from experience. We do know that Liberal policies are clearly not working. How long will it take the Treasurer to recognise it? How long before he comes down to earth from his obsession and recognises the massive suffering and hardship created by his policies? As the Australian Financial Review pointed out:
The Government has no wages policy, and has, as virtually the only effective economic instrument available to it, a restrictive monetary policy. This is contributing to increased unemployment in two ways~both directly, by depressing the demand for labour, and indirectly by the effect of rising interest rates.
Indeed, the Government not only has no wages policy but also it has no strategies for curbing unemployment or rising interest rates. It has no idea how to strengthen the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The most frightening thing is that not only has the Government led the Australian economy into its present depressed state but also it has nowhere to go from here. The ascendancy in the Liberal Party of the extremist economic forces following the outcome of the leadership crisis means that the economy will continue along the road to destruction it is already on. With unemployment at 6.7 per cent and inflation at 11 per cent that is a grim outlook indeed for Australia and only the election of a Labor government can reverse the trend. Labor will not try to control inflation by increasing unemployment. Rather, Labor must adopt a comprehensive strategy including a wages and incomes policy, a substantial redistribution of wealth and controls on interest rates.
Let me say something about interest rates. The Treasurer claims that he can do nothing to control interest rates, that they are due entirely to international trends. Yet on the other hand the Government is determined to move towards greater deregulation of interest rates, which will mean that Australia's interest rates will probably be the highest in the industrialised world. One important cause of high interest rates is the fact that foreign corporations are borrowing massive amounts of money from within Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which show that borrowings by foreign corporations have increased more than threefold in the last five years.

Dr THEOPHANOUS-This increase in foreign borrowings has substantially squeezed the Australian capital market and is directly responsible for many of the economic problems facing the nation at present, including high interest rates. Supporters of foreign corporations' investments in Australia claim that uncontrolled access should be given to these corporations because it is necessary for them to bring moneys into Australia. These figures, however, clearly indicate that the foreign corporations, to a substantial degree, are taking money from ordinary Australians rather than bringing it in themselves. Whereas Australians had loaned $10,096m to foreign corporations by 1980, their direct investment in these corporations was only a measly $817m, or less than 10 per cent of the amount borrowed by these corporations. These figures indicate a new and frightening dimension of the rip-off of the nation by these corporations. The Government should introduce drastic measures to limit these corporations' loan raisings in Australia. Given the profits which these companies are making, a minimum requirement should be that they bring in money for investment rather than borrow it from the limited Australian capital market. I point out that the last Liberal Government of any backbone, the Gorton Government, did indeed impose such limits.
I mentioned the human suffering created by these policies. Nowhere is this more evident than

in the disastrous increase in the levels of poverty since this Government came to power. To illustrate this I refer to the headline in the Age of 20 April, namely: 'Poverty worst for 50 years ..'. This was not the statement of some radical academic but of the Salvation Army. It followed a report, prepared by the Victorian Council of Social Service and financed by the Department of Social Security, which showed that the demand for emergency relief services has trebled since 1980. In 1978 the Salvation Army dealt with 277 cases a month. Four years later, it is 730 a month. Thus it is clear that thousands of people have been turning to crisis and emergency services to survive. Most voluntary organisations have now exhausted their resources of emergency funds. People in this situation are virtually begging for food, shelter and assistance to pay electricity and gas bills. Anyone on the other side of the House who does not believe this is welcome to come to Broadmeadows in my electorate, where they will soon see what the reality of Australia is.
The general level of poverty in Australia is degrading and disastrous. Late last year the Australian Council of Social Service estimated that over two million Australians are living in poverty. Professor Henderson said last week that the situation regarding poverty is much worse than it was in 1975. He said:
There is no doubt that the Australian Government does not have an effective system of income security. It leaks like a sieve and people who fall through it depend on voluntary agencies leaving enough money to assist them.
His proposed solutions were an upward revision of benefits immediately and moves to change to a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all Australians. Part of any strategy to resolve our problems and one which this Government could well adopt should be the raising of pensions and benefits to at least the Henderson poverty line. Let me remind the House that this poverty line is a very stringent one indeed. It provides for only the very basic necessities of life. It is an absolute minimum that would be acceptable in an affluent society. Indeed, the Australian Pensioners Federation believes that pensions should be raised to a level substantially higher than the Henderson poverty line, so as to allow for a decent, as distinct from a minimal, standard of living for pensioners. It is a massive indictment of this Government that nearly all pensioners and social security beneficiaries are below this stringent Henderson poverty line. This is shown dramatically by the tables which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.
Leave granted.

Note: Benefits for unemployed persons with children are the same as for an invalid pension except guardian and rental allowances are not payable.
The pensions and benefits calculated include family allowance payments and the payment of taxation where applicable. Recipients of unemployment benefits have the option of not paying tax on their benefits until the end of the financial year. However the above figures have been calculated with the tax payable on benefits debited from the weekly payment.

Dr THEOPHANOUS-These tables are worth considerable investigation. They show, firstly, that single pensioners are disadvantaged
and significantly below the poverty line; secondly, that pensioners with children are in a serious situation, especially those on the supporting parent's benefit; and thirdly,. that all unemployed persons who rely entirely on the unemployment benefit are well below the poverty line. A small increase in pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earn-
ings would help those most in need and help to alleviate, at least partially, the ugly problem of poverty in Australia. The Government should do this immediately. No doubt our opponents will attack such proposals, claiming that the Government cannot afford it. Yet we are told daily that the
Government can afford personal income tax cuts costing up to $l,500m. While such cuts are necessary for low and middle income workers, it is completely wrong to argue that such tax relief should be given to millionaires and the wealthy upper
class. After all, we should remember that the richest 10 per cent of Australians own 59 per cent of the wealth, whereas the poorest 10 per cent own less than one per cent. This obscene situation can be changed only by a program of redistribution of wealth and the extension of government services to the majority of Australians. Income tax cuts must therefore be selective and not across the board. They certainly should not be given to the wealthy upper class.

not be able to assist the poor, increase public services, restructure Australian industry and create more jobs. It is necessary to adopt all of those courses of action if we are to have an economic strategy which will resolve the basic problems that I mentioned at the beginning.
Mr ADERMANN (Fisher) (8.5l)-ln the debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills, perhaps not surprisingly, much has been said about taxation. It has been said many times that when the level of income tax increases to oppressive levels it cripples incentive-incentive to expand production, incentive to growth and expansion which is necessary to provide increased employment opportunity, incentive to work overtime, incentive to invest, and incentive to develop initiatives rather than demand or expect governments to provide, subsidise and indemnify. Also it is the favourite, even if substantially insincere, excuse given by tax avoiders and evaders for their subterfuge in opting out of their tax paying responsibilities. Of course, while tax avoiders complain that they are forced to find ways of avoiding tax to remain viable, they have no hesitation whatsoever in demanding or expecting more and more largesse from government. They are quite happy to let other taxpayers pick up the tab. Indeed, it is generally felt that income tax levels in Australia have reached punitive levels which are adversely affecting incentive and enterprise.

Another source of public revenue must be those sectors of the economy which have been generat-
ing super-profits. I refer especially to the banking sector, which has benefited enormously from the situation that the rest of us have suffered from, namely, rocketing interest rates. The Labor Party will be looking at the possibility of a super profits tax on the banKS to ensure that at least some of the benefits of this financial bonanza will be distributed back to the Australian people. Unless we are prepared to undertake such ventures we shall

It is all too easy to simply call for reductions in income tax and even to make broad statements that income tax should be reduced by $1.5 billion
or $2 billion or some other magical figure. Today, my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and others have clearly shown
that unless government expenditure is correspondingly reduced and unless demands on the Government for expenditure in services are reduced we will merely end up with massive deficits, still higher interest rates and inflation which will swallow up any tax benefit provided in

1902 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

such a manner as that. Most certainly there must be, and soon, real income tax relief. This can be achieved by containing and reducing government expenditure, broadening the tax base and combating effectively tax avoidance and evasion. As these matters have been extensively canvassed in the debates in this House and in the wider community, I do not propose to repeat arguments which have been exhaustively explored. Rather, accepting all of those to be axiomatic and essential, I would develop other arguments which must not be lost sight of in the taxation debate.
I do not believe the answer to be an arbitrary, across-the-board cut in income tax. That merely perpetuates many inequities and anomalies in the Income Tax Assessment Act which has become so massive, so cumbersome and even so internally self-contradictory that it is screaming out for revision and redrafting. The Act even defies the
most qualified practitioners' full comprehension and understanding. Consequently, even with the most commendable and unremitting attacks on tax avoidance by the present Treasurer (Mr Howard), it remains, in its present form, a fertile field for promoters of unsavoury tax avoidance schemes. I believe, as I have said, that we should not simply seek arbitrary, across-the-board cuts. We must pursue the sensible broadening of the tax base. We must attend to rewriting and revising our income tax Act. We must get busy on the proper restructuring of our taxation system.
It is on the restructuring of the tax system that I want to concentrate for just a little while. Our income tax Act is far more than an Act to collect tax. It seeks to do many things: It seeks to dispense social security and provide incentives to industry. In some ways it is another tariff mechanism. I will show the nonsense in this. How efficient can it be as a means of dispensing social security when, to a large extent, it has no contemplation whatsoever of need. For example, there is a thresholdprobably now it is too low-at which taxation commences. That threshold is the same for the taxpayer whose income exceeds it by just a few dollars as for the taxpayer whose income is 10 times as much. What then is the rationale of a threshold of that nature? If it has social security connotations, surely it is a most inefficient manner in which to dispense it. Where there is a need, let that need be directly redressed, identified and quantified and let us contain ourselves to redressing those needs. If we took that course, assistance would be given to those in need, it could be even more generously provided and the inefficiency and waste inherent in trying to dispense social security through the income tax system could be avoided.

What nonsense the general rebate available to all taxpayers has become. Even if a taxpayer has no medical expenses, takes out no life assurance and pays nothing for house rates and education, et cetera, in fact, does not spend a cent, he gets a general rebate of about $1,590 for those headings. But the family man who has medical expenses, who insures himself and his family-that unfair limit of deductibility still remains-and who pays rates on his home, again with an unrealistic ceiling, and who pays education expenses, again with an unrealistic ceiling-in fact, who spends probably considerably more than $1,590 on those expenses-gets a rebate no more than that received by the taxpayer who spent nothing at all on them. What is the equity, the sense or the justice in that? I suggest that if such inefficient and wasteful taxation methods as this were rectified it would not only save some massive expenditure, but also would allow us to help the family man who is insuring and educating his children, buying a home and meeting medical and dental expenses.
I would like to have time to expand that sort of argument further, but surely it illustrates my contention that we need urgent restructuring of our taxation system and the removal of many anomalies and inequities inherent in it. The tax Act also doubles as a mechanism to provide incentives and to redress disadvantages to industry. Again it is the most inefficient and uneconomical way of attending to these things. Where industry needs help, let that help be identified, its parameters defined, and the need quantified and directed to that need. Under the income tax Act there are no defined parameters. The cost cannot be accurately quantified and it often goes where there is no need.
Let me illustrate this. We can all readily recognise the particular needs, hazards and concerns of the primary producer. We know that he is at the mercy of adverse seasons, droughts, floods and disease. That has to be recognised and he has to be helped to overcome the massive fluctuations in his income. The vagaries of the export market and the valuation of currencies in many countries, et cetera, also treat the primary producer mercilessly. He has to undertake extensive capital expense to conserve his soil and fodder, to build dams and bores or to harvest the scarce and unreliable resource of water. There is need in all of these areas. I would resist any diminution in these forms of assistance and, indeed, "ould claim that it is as yet insufficient. But here is the problem: once again we use the income tax Act; we average his income, because that is vital; and we provide write-offs and accelerated depreciation because

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1903

he has got to have that help. Then the unscrupulous tax avoidance industry gets busy and we have doctors, lawyers, accountants and virtually every other profession seeking to obtain all of these deductions for hobby farms, et cetera. What happens is that a whole new area of tax evasion emerges and professional people who have only an incidental interest in primary production qualify for a mass of taxation advantages. The gate is open and the costs are astronomical. The bona fide primary producer who desperately needs the help is getting far too little help and is in parlous circumstances. A mass of tax avoiders who do not need help are finding a lucrative field of tax minimisation.
If honourable members go through the tax Act and look at other industries they will see that situation repeated over and over again. I believe that if we really do something about restructuring our taxation Act and our taxation system we will be able to much more sensibly and generously provide help where it is needed and warranted instead of dissipating our resources over all and sundry for all who are devious enough to find a way to get into the act. Restructuring would not only ensure that help would go where it is needed but also would be a constructive and effective blow against the tax dodgers. I am most certain that we would be able not only to give greater assistance to redress real need but also to achieve considerable reductions in income tax for everyone. That is why I appeal that we just do not make arbitrary cuts across the board and do nothing about the inequities and the nonsense that are inherent in our system. We should do something about those things. Yet the restructuring and cuts will be the inevitable bonus which must ensue. I hope we, therefore, are not so hypnotised by the talk of tax cuts that we go hell-bent in the wrong direction instead of doing this properly, in the right order and the right manner.
Let me reinforce, too, what other colleagues have said today. We have to ensure that government expenditures are properly directed. For example-I stress it is only an example-it is absolutely pointless to parade a figure of so many hundreds of millions of dollars spent on education, health or something else. It may be too little; it may be too much. We cannot know unless we see and understand where it is spent and whether it is directed at need. I believe that there are areas where we could achieve much more and much more sensibly direct our expenditure and yet reduce the absolute expenditure levels quite considerably by eliminating areas of misdirection and wastefulness.

What is the sense in parading the family allowance as a great social security benefit if it is not directed at need? It takes no account of need. It contemplates only the number of children. Therefore, it cannot be indexed or be effective for those in real need because it is dispensed for every child irrespective of family circumstances. Why should it not be income tested on the basis of family in-- come? Why is it a right instead of a needs based support? If it were income tested it would serve its true purpose. It could then be indexed. I believe that would be achieved at a cost to revenue below the present level. Instead of a blanket attack on particular pensions, benefits or expenditure to save a few dollars, I believe we have to concentrate on ensuring that they are related to need. Government responsibility is to the needy and not to the greedy.
One other most important consideration is many decades overdue and many governments of different complexions overdue. With the latest statistics showing that in a decade we have moved from a position where the ratio was 20 social security beneficiaries to 100 people in the work force to a present figure of 40 beneficiaries to 100 people in the work force, and knowing that the graph is rapidly rising along that same projection, we have to realise that we are on very dangerous grounds. The pay-as-you-earn taxpayer who bears the real load of taxation in this country cannot be expected to pay more and more of his pay cheque for social security benefits for others. We have to meet our responsibilities to the aged, the infirm and the disadvantaged. That is certain. That is uncontested.
We have to look at other alternatives, surely. One which I can suggest and which has already been mentioned here today is a national contributory superannuation scheme. It is not simple. It needs much work and it needs much development. But while all governments persist in putting it into the too-hard drawer we are drifting into a situation which is entirely untenable. The inevitable end of that road is that either the aged, the sick and the handicapped will suffer insufficient help and financial disaster or we will erect a social security system which this nation cannot possibly afford. I know it is hard to achieve a national superannuation scheme which is fair, equitable and entirely effective. I know that I cannot give to this Parliament tonight a blueprint with all the answers, all the t's crossed and the i's dotted. I know that, with all of the expertise available to governments and to all of us, if we have not the wit and the resolve to get on with a plan like that we will face a day of reckoning-all of us on both sides of the House-which it is our responsibility

1904 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

to plan now to avoid. For years and years, ever since the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Act became simply the Income Tax Act, we have been bumbling along financing all social security out of taxation. There is no doubt in the world that the PAYE taxpayer who cannot split his income, whose deductions are extremely limited and who cannot buy a tax scheme, is the ham in the sandwich. He has had enough. He wants tax relief and not an increased burden.
Yet, that is our system and governments of all persuasions have persevered with it and must accept the blame for it. That is why we have to put up with income tests, with all their inequities and political odium. That is what contributes to occasional dishonesty in the exploitation of the system. Not only will that remain but it will get worse and worse until we get down to looking at national contributory superannuation and perhaps other alternative means. It is not good enough to court political popularity by a pension increase at election time or a tax cut at a politically opportune time. Unless we get down to a proper restructuring of our Income Tax Assessment Act and our tax system, unless we get down to putting need above greed, unless we look at national contributory superannuation, we all, from both sides of the House, had better get out and make way for someone who will front up to these problems.
To make promises to abolish the income test while preserving the present system and merely covering that promise with more and more taxes is neither realistic nor honest. That is why I am disappointed in the Australian Labor Party's grandiose promise to abolish the income test and to finance it from new taxes. That would be a confidence trick of the highest order. I condem its members, if that is their solution, for that type of cliche. Equally, I expect my Government to come to grips with the matters I have outlined-I have had to be brief in their outline-because if it does not its course will be no better. We look for a broadening of the tax base. There has to be tax relief. Yet, inflation and soaring interest rates must be seen as our enemies and we cannot afford to reduce our efforts to contain them.
The needy must not suffer. Government must do even more to identify, justify and contain its spending. To imagine that an arbitrary tax cut alone is the panacea is to delude ourselves. There is no alternative-I stress: There is no alternative-to a complete review and restructure of Our taxation system, not tomorrow but today. The Australian people will welcome that. They will respond to it. But the Australian people will

not respond to arbitrary, ad hoc tax cuts which inflation will soon take away. They will not buy any of Labor's pie in the sky cliches. They demand, and rightly so, a different approach. I hope I have at least pointed out a course which we can prudently and should urgently follow. I support the Bills before the House.
Mr MOUNTFORD (Banks) (9.8)-The Appropriation and Supply Bills before the House are for the purpose of providing sufficient funds for the remainder of the current financial year, until 30 June, and from I July until the Budget Bills are passed by the House some time in November. The Appropriation Bills also have the purpose of providing the Government with additional funds over and above those budgeted for in August 1981 to cover extra costs caused by its mishandling of the economy.
In speaking to these Bills I support the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Although this Government has never been able to match its promises and rhetoric with actions and deeds, we have now reached that point in time, in the Government's seventh year after obtaining office, when its performances in handling the economy can no longer be tolerated. When this Government came to office in late 1975, after the most dastardly performance in the history of Australia, the inflation rate was little more than 11 per cent and falling. At the end of March 1982 it was over 11 per cent and rising. The level of unemployment was then 310,000 and falling; now it is 486,000 and rising. Interest rates on home loans were then 10 per cent and falling; now they are 13t per cent and rising. As for income tax, the family man on average award wages was paying 4t per cent of his weekly wage in taxation; now he is paying over 12 percent.
In 1975 the Government came to power with the new federalism schemes of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), which were supposed to improve government efficiency by transferring resources and responsibilities to State and local government. This so-called new federalism was a vision of a streamlined government system with lessened tax burdens and reduced Budget deficits. In election speeches prior to the general elections of 1975, 1977 and 1980, the Prime Minister promised the people of Australia that his Governmen would lower taxes, lower interest rates, lower the level of unemployment and lower the rate of inflation. Although I am unable, because of the Standing Orders, to describe the Prime Minister in the best Australian terms, his performances to date have, in the best of acceptable terms, been less than forthright.

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1905

As late as December 1980 the Prime Minister was still publicly espousing his liberalism philosophy-one of the major reasons why the economy is in such a mess at present. In his expose of December 1980 the Prime Minister said:
to attempt to govern from a blueprint is a recipe for disaster; indeed this is the essential case against central planning:
The Australian economy has turned sour because the Government has no central plan. Instead of a planned approach to economic matters, for the past seven years we have seen adopted a laissezfaire approach. For that period that approach has seen the Government adopt policies of the United Kingdom and the United States, none of which has worked in either those nations or Australia. Of course, those policies from overseas have been supplemented by the policies of our Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Howard), who are commonly dubbed the doom and gloom of Australian politics, even by some of their erstwhile party colleagues. We were told by these two gentlemen that the Liberal strategy assured all Australians of enhanced social cohesion with secure long term employment opportunities as a result of economic growth, alongside stable and accessible government and minimal individual hardship caused by inflation. They told us that their policies would result in decreased inflation, decreased interest rates and decreased unemployment. Theirs has been a thoroughly disgraceful performance, one which has caused grief and heartbreak to many Australians.
From a political point of view, we on the Opposition side could take pleasure in the Government's self-imposed predicament because we have been telling the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for some years now that their policies and strategies were wrong. However, let me assure honourable members and those of our fellow Australians who are listening to this debate that I gain no pleasure at all in telling Government members: 'We told you so on many occasions and warned you that our economy was sliding downhill'. It gives me no pleasure to talk about how bad is the situation in Australia. Only last week the Treasurer said that we should not say anything about recession or depression because if we spoke about them they would occur. By inference, if we remained silent all of our economic problems would just go away.
Let us hear what the Prime Minister has had to say about the economic situation. In early March he went to Brisbane and spoke to a group of that city's community leaders. What did he tell them? He told them that the world economic situation

represented not a recession, just a plain old fashioned depression. So much for all this nonsense concerning talking about the economy from our Prime Minis,f,er and Treasurer, the doom and gloom of Australian politics. What we need to do to solve our economic problems is to change the Government. We need a government that will act, not just talk. This Government has had its chance and has failed the Australian community. It is time Australia had a government with a heart, one with an affinity with the people. It is time Australia had a Labor government. We have now, at this moment, those reprehensible circumstances in which the government of -the day should be forced to go to the polls to give an accounting of its performance to the people of Australia.
This Liberal-National Country Party Government has caused grief and suffering to so many people in our community. Probably those who are suffering the greatest are the unemployed and the members of their families. In February of this year the level of unemployment reached 486,200-the highest on record since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started conducting unemployment surveys. It represented 7 per cent of the labour force, the worst result for three years. If estimates of hidden unemployment are also taken into account, the actual rate of unemployment in this country is nearer 12 per cent of the work force. In March the employment figure improved only slightly to 460,000-the highest March figure for four years and 50,000 higher than the March 1981 figure. The seasonally adjusted figures confirm the underlying deterioration in the jobless situation.
Analysing the unemployment figures, we see that, although there has been a continuing increase in adult unemployment, the hardest hit has been our teenage population. Twenty per cent, or one in five, of those under 20 years of age are unable to find work. In this age group the deterioration has worsened by 1t per cent over the previous year. The unemployment rate for the little publicised 20-year-old to 24-year-old group has increased from 8.9 per cent to 10.1 per cent. The employment situation has worsened and will continue to worsen under the policies of this Government. The Government has attempted to reduce the inflation rate by dampening the growth of the money supply which, by restraining economic growth, has both limited the availability of new employment opportunities and caused retrenchments in many of our established industries. The policies of the Government in attempting to control inflation have not only caused massive unemployment levels but have also been responsible for destroying business confidence. This has resulted

1906 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

in industry not proceeding with normal expansionary processes which would have created not only additional employment opportunities but also additional export opportunities for home produced goods and services.
A recent survey conducted by the Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research together with the Morgan research organisation put the consumer sentiment index in March at a low 91.8 points, which is close to the lowest level in the past 10 years. This is 20 points below the 111.8 recorded in the same period last year and 16 below the average index level for March surveys of 108.4 points recorded over the previous nine years. The survey revealed that of the 1,027 business people surveyed only 14 per cent expected good times in the near future. This is a deplorable situation for the short term future, because a lack of confidence of such magnitude by the business sector means that any significant recovery measures taken now would have only a long term effect on business and consumer confidence. Given the Government's persistence in pursuing deregulation of interest rates, there will obviously be harder times ahead as the money market becomes further out of reach for both private citizens and the business community. The level of real interest rates in Australia at present is the highest in the world. On commercial bills and treasury notes or bills the interest rates in Australia are approximately 8 per cent above those prevailing presently in the United States of America.
I have attempted to show in this debate the changes which have occurred in Australia during the seven years that this Government has been on the treasury bench. We have seen that there have been many changes during that period. Unemploym~nt has officially increased by 170,000; home mterest rates have increased by 3t per cent; taxes on average wages have increased by almost 500 per cent for the family man; the trade deficit is nine times greater than for the same time last year; the current account deficit is already $6,300m and will increase to as much as $9,OOOm; t~e balance of payments deficit is $1 ,248m; in the eight months to the end of February the money supply grew by 4.8 per cent compared with 7 per cent last year. The average growth in gross domestic product is now unlikely to reach one per cent. The average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will be about 2 per cent this year. So we can see that Australia's performance on GDP is half the average for the OECD nations.
The Government has failed the Australian community. Its policies are in disgrace. It has no

answers to the many challenges facing Australia. The Government has lost the confidence of the people and should resign and allow the people to judge its performance at the ballot box.
Dr JENKINS (Scullin) (9.19)-1 enter the debate on the Appropriation and Supply Bills at rather short notice. A number of factors have been brought out in the debate today. There has ?een .considerable reference to the fight against mflatlOn. The Government has emphasised that the Opposition would like to see this fight extended just as much to unemployment. There has been a critical examination of the need for the tax~t.ion structure. in the community to free up posItions and provide greater opportunities. During this session I had occasion in the House to point to an in-depth study that was taken of unemployed youth in a particular Victorian shire. The examination pointed out some rather important defects in Government action in this respect. It certainly countered any suggestion that there were loads of jobs for young people and that it was their fault that they were unable to find employment.
In fact, the principal finding of the youth education advisory committee of the Whittlesea shire was that the main reasons for not employing more young people have more to do with structural and economic factors than shortcomings in the individual applicants. The conclusions of the committee pointed out that the strategy for reduction of unemployment among young people which this Government has taken and which focused on training and the improvement of young applicants offered only small scope for alleviating the problem.
There was a further study of the use of the existing training schemes and the knowledge of them by industry. Although they are much lauded, when we get down to the fact that training schemes will not solve the problem completely, their small contribution is much affected by the employers' lack of knowledge of them. For example, in a survey of employers in that area, about 41 to 44 per cent who responded to a widely circulated questionnaire had never heard of the Special Youth Employment Training Program. A similar number had not heard of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training program, the CRAFT program. It was rather interesting that the best known scheme was NEAT, the National Employment and Training scheme. Only 31 per cent reported that they did not know about that scheme. It had been used by a higher proportion of the people concerned.

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1907

We have been told that facilities are made available to the Commonwealth Employment Service for it to make regular visits to local employers. We know that over the years with this Government's restrictions on the staffing in that Department, it has been impossible for the Commonwealth Employment Service to carry out adequately that service to employers. In fact, 20 per cent of the employers in the area did not know that the CES was supposed to make regular visits to employers to determine local job vacancies. Only one-third had ever received visits from the local Commonwealth Employment Service with regard to job vacancies. In terms of the use of other services, only 28 per cent had ever used any of the work experience programs. Twenty-six per cent had been associated with the NEAT scheme, only 12 per cent with the Special Youth Employment Training Program and 15 per cent with CRAFT. That reflects two things. Although emphasis has been placed on the training programs to suit young people for employment, they are not widely appreciated by employers in the community. They are not widely used. The CES, because of staff restrictions, has problems in carrying out its regular visits to employers. The limitation on these services means that the people most likely to have heard of them or to have received visits are the larger firms where there is less opportunity for increasing the prospects of youth employment than there is with smaller employers.
I quote this survey once more because it is an in-depth study of a particular area-an area that has its dormitory as well as light, medium and heavy industry sectors. The survey found that 49 per cent of small firms, 44 per cent of medium sized firms and only 15 per cent of large firms did not know about the Special Youth Employment Training Program. So there is a substantial area of possibly increasing youth employment that does not know of the facilities which exist. I might add that the survey defines a small firm as one with fewer than 10 employees, a medium firm as one with 10 to 50 employees and a large firm as one with more than 50 employees. A similar position applies to other training schemes. The survey found that 22 per cent of small employers, 30 per cent of medium employers and 41 per cent of large employers have been involved with the NEAT scheme. This may to some extent reflect the industrial nature of larger firms which undertake more specific trade training.
I would like to refer again to the state of the economy, high youth unemployment and the staff restrictions in the Commonwealth Employment Service. The survey suggested that small firms

offer most opportunities for the expansion of employment for young people. We find that only 22 per cent of small firms had received visits from the CES seeking the listing of job vacancies. We also find that 54 per cent of medium sized firms had had contact and 47 per cent of large employers had received visits. It is interesting to note that some emphasis has been placed on the role of career teachers in the training of young people for employment. Career teachers' contact is in the same sort of proportion as CES contact in these different sizes of industry. According to this survey, whilst a large proportion of job vacancies that could be created for young people are in the smaller establishments, that is the area that is neglected by the Commonwealth Employment Service because of the restrictions placed on its activities. That is the area that is disadvantaged as far as career teacher limitations are concerned. That is the area that has least knowledge of and least information about the various training and assistance programs that are available.
It is rather interesting to consider how the usefulness of the various programs are ranked. Work experience itself is seen as the most valuable, NEAT is second and visits from the CES come third. I emphasise that this is an area of neglect. The CES can visit the smaller firms and find potential for further development of employment. Next in order came CRAFT and finally visits from career teachers and the Special Youth Employment Training Program.
If we are to look at the youth unemployment level, I think we ought to have a look at experience in areas such as this. We should question the Government's claim for its training programs. We should acknowledge that these people have been able to show that training programs are not much use when employers do not know about them. Employment services are not much use when they do not have the staff to go out and look at these job vacancies. Finally, they are not much use unless this Government, which claims to be a government of small business, is prepared to go out and talk to small business about the opportunities that can be created there. I think this is a great cause of criticism. While lip service is paid to combating youth unemployment, there has been no analysis of how successful the programs are, only claims for their effectiveness.
One of the other areas with which I am particularly concerned is the increased demand for emergency relief. In January 1980, in the Victorian area, all of those services which were concerned with emergency relief carried out a survey of how much deficiency there was in those services. It showed a rather alarming situation. The

1908 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Appropriation Bill (No.3)

honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) quoted from a letter from certain clergymen distributed by the Brotherhood of St Laurence accentuating this particular problem. I do not want to be specific but it se~ms to me that the structuring of welfare agencies \loder the Federal Liberal Government and under State Liberal governments-thank goodness it has now changed in Victoria-has been such as to reduce the total funding and create a situation in which to get reasonable grants in an area one needs a multiplicity of local welfare agencies. This has meant the setting up of committees to ensure that each agency gets its share of the small amount of welfare funds available. A multiplicity of organisations means that there are gaps in those welfare services that are overlooked by the organisations; that there are considerable overlaps of services taken on by, say, bodies such as the Ethnic Care Force, family support schemes, migrant resource centres and a number of others. They overlap and people are wasting their effort. They are wasting money in the duplication of services in an area in which the funds available are particularly scarce.
Having spotted this, I have asked a number of workers in these agencies in my area to meet with me. We have met on a number of occasions. One of the fundamental things they find preventing them getting the maximum out of their services and money is the lack of communication in the field. No comprehensive cover exists at federal level for such workers to find out what programs exist in social security and what programs come within the responsibility of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). There are no substantial lists of programs that exist in the Department of Health. There is a complete lack of co-ordination and a lack of availability of this information to professional workers in the field. Without that information these professional workers cannot make maximum use of the facilities that are available, nor can they communicate these matters to the people they serve. I suggest that there is inefficiency within Government departments because no comprehensible statement concerning these programs is available. There is inefficiency in not ceding finance to allow information to be distributed within the community.
Quite apart from this Government's general lack of economic and social policies on taxation, inflation and unemployment, the Government has failed badly even in the benefits it has offered the young unemployed. It has placed restrictions on the operation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. There has been a lack of effective communication with employers in relation to

training programs and subsidy programs and there has been a complete failure to see the worth of coordinating welfare, youth unemployment and health services that should be available in the community. I thoroughly support the basic amendment that my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) moved. He dealt in his speech with much broader aspects than I have. I have spoken on matters at a relatively parochial level. These are the things that affect the ordinary people in the community who are suffering from straight out government inefficiency and poor policies.

REVIEW OF CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION
Ministerial Statement
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond Valley-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs)-by leave-The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) informed the House on 20 April 1982 that there were matters which seemed to require examination within the administration of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in New South Wales. He indicated that consideration was being given to the appropriate form of the inquiry into those matters. The circumstances associated with the importation last year of a television set by the former Minister for Health have attracted publicity and comment in this House and outside. There has also been publicity and comment about wider difficulties in Customs administration in New South Wales.
In tendering their resignations last week the then Minister for Health and the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs accepted responsibility for what happened in relation to the importation of the television set. They have paid a heavy price. In addition, the Government has tabled the relevant documents. The Government does not believe that there is any good purpose to be served by further examination of those particular events with a view to reporting on the responsibility and conduct of those involved. What is important, however, is to look to the future and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that any difficulties in Customs administration in New South Wales are put right.
In this respect I inform the House that a great deal of work has already been completed by the Department and the Public Service Board on a major restructuring of the Customs organisation throughout the Commonwealth. The proposed restructuring includes the introduction of a single work category of Customs Officer which should

1910 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Review of Customs Administration

lead to the elimination of work demarcation tensions now present. The Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended the early introduction of a single work category. The implementation plans which will be made public very shortly include processes for consultations with the interested staff associations. The Government believes that the reorganisation will do much to avoid a repetition of the difficulties that have been in evidence recently. It is the Government's wish that the reorganisation proceed expeditiously.
While it believes that this reorganisation will achieve a great deal, the Government has decided to establish a further review of administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales. The review will have particular regard to:
(a) Clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport;
(b) The relations between management, staff and staff associations; and
(c) The need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures.
The review will report on any changes that may be necessary or desirable for more efficient and effective administration, including industrial relations, and ensure observance of the instruction by the Prime Minister in 1976 that all Australians should receive equal treatment in respect of the enforcement of Customs regulations.
The review will be carried out by Mr F. 1. Mahony, c.B., OBE. Mr Mahony is the President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal. He was formerly a Deputy Secretary in the Attorney General's Department and acted for a period as Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Mr Mahony will be invited to take account of such reports, development s, events and other circumstances as he may consider necessary in order to report on necessary or desirable changes.
The Government does not propose to confer on Mr Mahony powers under the Royal Commissions Act. The Government does not believe this is necessary for a review which is essentially forward looking and directed to setting the administration right for the future. While Mr Mahony's attention will be directed to the Customs administration in New South Wales he will not, of course, be excluded from examining the relationship between the Department in Canberra

and the administration in New South Wales. The manner in which Mr Mahony conducts his review will be a matter for him including the extent to which he may decide to hold public hearings.
The Government will be asking Mr Mahony to present his report in a form that may be made public subject, of course, to any particular part that should be treated confidentially. I table the terms of reference of the review and ask leave to incorporate them in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows-
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR REVIEW OF CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION
I. To review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales, with particular regard to: (a) clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; (b) the relations between management, staff and staff associations; and (c) the need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures; and to report on any changes that may be necessary or desirable for more efficient and effective administration, including industrial relations, and to ensure observance of the instruction by the Prime Minister in 1976 that all Australians should receive equal treatment in respect of the enforcement of customs regulations.
2. Without limiting the generality of the above, account may be taken in the review of such reports, developments, events and other circumstances as may be considered necessary in order to report on necessary or desirable changes as required above.
Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed:
That the House take note of the papers.
Mr JOHN BROWN (Parramatta) (9.52)-1 move:
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
'the terms of reference for the review of Customs Administration should be amended to include the following matters:
(I) (a) the effectiveness of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in the performance of its functions under the Customs Act 190 I;
(b) the handling of complaints within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and in particular the Bureau of Customs;
(c) any question affecting the industrial relations or relations between the management, staff and staff associations within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, and
(d) any changes necessary in(i) arrangements or procedures within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and (ii) the Customs Act 190 I;
(2) without limiting the generality of the above, account may be taken in the review of such reports, developments,

events and other circumstances as may be considered necessary in order to report on necessary or desirable changes as required above;
(3) that the review have the status, powers and privileges of a Royal Commission; and
(4) that the review should produce its report by 1 November 1982.'
The history of events since 5 October last, the sad day of the arrival in Australia of the former Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), has brought great discredit on this Government and caused a great air of disquiet in the community as to how the affairs of government and this country are run by this inefficient and seemingly inept Government. The events at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on that day were indications, firstly, of dishonesty; secondly, of arrogance; and, thirdly, of a cover-up from top to bottom within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. We_had the sad and almost comical situation of two Ministers being closeted away for two days trying to arrange a statement that would hold water. The one they produced was like a colander-it would not hold ice, let alone water. It was not suitable for even the shoddy standards of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), so one can see how unacceptable it was to the Australian community generally and to the Opposition in particular.
The Press was baying for blood. So the Prime Minister did what we normally expect of him-he announced that two Ministers had resigned. But we all know that they resigned with their hands twisted up behind their backs; they had been sacked. Those Ministers came into this House and made melancholy statements to the Parliament about how they would be faithful soldiers of the Government and true to the cause of liberalism. The Prime Minister eventually suggested that he would establish an appropriate form of inquiry. If the form of inquiry that has been announced tonight by the Minister is in the Prime Minister's eyes appropriate, let me tell the House without reservation that it is not appropriate to the Opposition representing the conscience of the people of Australia. I am not surprised that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) did not read the terms of reference. I am sure his faithful minion who is sitting up the back, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who just laughed, will also laugh at me when I read them. I will not read them all. I will read some sections of them. Paragraph (a) reads:
Clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport;
Well, bully for the Government! It is going to have a look at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Does it

really believe that is where the activities of the Bureau of Customs start and finish? This Government has managed, in terms of pork barrelling electorates, to form overseas gateways all over Australia. Does the Government not know that there are international flights into Melbourne, Darwin, Port Hedland, Launceston, Hobart, Townsville and, if it has its way, into Brisbane and Adelaide? What about those gates? Is there not a shortage of staff at those places? Is there not great evidence of inefficiency at some of those places also? What about an inquiry into them? Paragraph (b) reads:
The relations between management, staff and staff associations; and
I should think so after the revelations of the last fortnight. Just how bad the relations are between management and staff in this Department would be fairly evident to anybody who bothered to read what the Opposition has had to say particularly about officers like Tony Mayhew who have been pilloried, intimidated and terrorised by this Department because he wanted to tell the truth. Paragraph (c) reads:
The need to ensure the effective and impartial application of custom procedures.
Efficient and impartial! Was there any sign of efficiency or impartiality in the treatment of the former Minister for Health? As I understand it, the duty has not yet been paid. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said that the review Will report on any changes which may be necessary or desirable for more efficient and effective administration, including industrial relations. There is a whole lot of unnecessary verbiage that really does not stand up to examination.
In the period since we have been calling in this House over the last week for a royal commission we have seen a day by day tabling of documents, part of this total jigsaw puzzle. We saw the grudging release of a few more documents today, incomplete records but still complete enough to show evidence of a cover-up, clear evidence of intimidation of Mayhew as I suggested and also Bennett, the New South Wales President of the Customs Officers Association. These documents also open up questions of impropriety right from the top of the Department. Can anybody explain why Mr Besley, who was Secretary to the Department at the stage in question, was allowed to resign from that Department five days later and, against all the guidelines of the Bowen inquiry, allowed to take a job in private enterprise with a company that had done an enormous amount of business not only with the Department that he was working with but also with the previous one? Has anyone explained that yet? Has anyone

1912 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Review of Customs Administration

explained about the mislaid file that we have mentioned-the file that Mayhew talks about, the two inch deep file? What has happened to it? What about the police records of interview with all sorts of officers? What about the diary notes? They have not been found yet.
On 20 April the Prime Minister, under extreme pressure, announced that there would be some sort of inquiry into the administration of this Department. At that stage he no doubt intended that it would be a South American inquiry, with the Department investigating itself. The following day an article appeared in the Australian Financial Review which showed that the comment by the Prime Minister had not been properly thought out, as most of his statements are not properly thought out, and the Prime Minister later announced that the investigation would not be Caesar investigating Caesar. Let us see whether that is the case or not. It would appear, to use his own words, that the present Minister, a lawyer, who no doubt believes that a royal commission with wide-ranging terms of reference would be the appropriate way of handling this matter, has been nobbled by his Prime Minister. Why is the Prime Minister so concerned about limiting the inquiry to New South Wales and giving it such incredibly narrow terms of reference? As I mentioned earlier, not every entry into Australia is by aeroplane and not very entry into Australia occurs in Sydney. The Prime Minister has, no doubt, entered Australia on numerous occasions at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne. Last week we debated in this House a Bill which gives the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, among other departments--
Debate interrupted.
ADJOURNMENT
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilIar)- Order! It being 10 p.m., I propose the question:
That the House do now adjourn.
Mr Fife-I require that the question be put forthwith without debate.
Question resolved in the negative.
REVIEW OF CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION
Ministerial Statement
Debate resumed.
Mr JOHN BROWN-Last week we had some legislation in this House about which I spoke giving the Bureau of Customs power over off-shore installations-oil rigs sitting out on the Continental Shelf, some of them many miles from the coastline. I am pleased to say that the Minister for

Business and Consumer Affairs commented on the rationality of the points I made, that with the present thin cover provided by the Bureau of Customs on existing ports, however could they consider attending to all the difficulties with off-shore installations. Not long before that the ex-Minister, the honorable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), introduced into this House a Bill concerned with increasing penalties for evasion of duties. He said:
The review took into consideration the matters to which I have just referred, the difficulties faced by Customs in supervising the growing flow of goods into and out of Australia, the need for Customs to rely to a significant degree on the integrity of importers and exporters and the magnitude of the rewards that can be obtained from revenue evasion or unlawful import or export activities.
If ever there were words from a man that were pregnant with meaning they were those. If only the House knew at the time he was mouthing these words what secrets were hidden, but I think they point out the fact that this Bureau of Customs relies to an enormous extent upon the honesty of people declaring their intentions and on the integrity of the officers who police those regulations. Nobody could tell me that Customs officers, as badly as they have been treated by this Department, as badly as their complaints have been put down over many years, would be in an appropriate frame of mind to put themselves out to make sure that these regulations would be policed properly. That is no denigration of the officers but merely a denigration of the system under which they work.
We do not quibble with the Government's choice of a person to conduct the review-Mr Mahony-however we object to the fact that Mr Mahony will have no powers at all. The review should be public. Why does the Government want to hide this? Why does the review have to be covered with the secrecy of a private inquiry? A cynic might say that a person with Australian Security Intelligence Organisation connections has been chosen because he is likely to conduct the inquiry with the utmost secrecy. We are not saying that but we say that there is no reason why there should not be a requirement for public hearings. The real need is for an investigation into the whole of this very troubled Department. The degree to which it is troubled has been more than adequately shown by the departmental cover-up illustrated in the documents which have slowly been brought to light following the MacKellarMoore resignations. The trouble goes back almost the entire period of this Government's life. The Bureau of Narcotics, to say the least, was ineffective, but the Government steadfastly denied this,

Review o/Customs Administration

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1913

even allowing the former Secretary of the Department, Mr Besley, to give evidence before the Williams Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. He tried to claim that his Department was effective until Mr Justice Willaims exploded that myth with his report. Now we are to have a little report into a little of the Department and into only a few of the issues which affect it.
Why is the Government scared to have a review with the powers of a royal commission? Why is it scared to give that review wide ranging terms of reference into the whole question of the effectiveness of the Department and the way in which internal complaints are handled, particularly in the Bureau of Customs? I am sure that every member of this Parliament should be disgusted as I am, as I am sure the new Minister is, about what has been revealed about the way the courageous Tony Mayhew has been mistreated. No date has even been set on which the review should be completed. I am sure the Government hopes this review will make the issue disappear. I can assure the Minister and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Opposition will not let the issue disappear.
We are speaking on behalf of the responsible people of Australia-who, I presume, are almost all the people with the exception of members of this Government-who really want to see the Customs Bureau work effectively. It is a very major arm of government, in terms not only of revenue collection but also of the duties it undertakes, its responsibilities, at least to the Customs barrier, for the detection of drug importation into Australia, for the policing, with very scant resources, of the whole of the Australian coastline and for the manning, with not enough resources and staff, of all the Customs checks around this country. The terms of reference and the nature of the inquiry suggest a further cover-up.
I urge the Minister to accept the amendment that I have moved. This matter ought to be resolved by the Government. If it refuses to do so the Opposition will have to seek proper inquiry in another forum. It might well be that a select committee of the Senate, clothed with the power to summon witnesses and record detailed evidence, is the answer. Maybe that is just what we will seek because things have altered in the Senate. I remind honourable members that it is no longer a House that stamps every action of this Government without question. It might well be that the Senate will accept the responsibility for seeing that the people of Australia are protected and that the Customs Bureau which they pay for is one of which they can be proud; they need to be sure that it is doing its job effectively.

My closing remarks are directed to the media. I hope that the media, which has adopted a very high principled and responsible attitude in this whole episode, will keep up supporting the Opposition in its call for a proper royal commission of inquiry into the Customs Bureau. We will not accept this review which the Government has proposed. It is just not good enough.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)-Is the amendment seconded?
Mr Lionel Bowen-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.
Mr SPENDER (North Sydney) (10.7)- Listening to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) one is tempted to think that the whole purpose of the Opposition is to exaggerate, mislead and confuse. He came here this morning and in the course of his comments said that there was no intention to persecute anyone. He comes back here this evening and brings in not just events which had anything at all to do with those of 5 October but questions concerning Melbourne Airport and airports in Queensland and Western Australia as though the events of 5 October threw up major questions concerning the administration of Customs throughout this country. On an examination of the records we realise that that is not so. He has criticised the terms of reference of the inquiry. It is worthwhile looking at those terms of reference. They begin with:
To review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales.
Is not that just what we are concerned with; the events of 5 October? How do they throw up any possible basis for some wide-ranging royal commission into the events that have nothing to do with what took place on that day? In brief, we are concerned here with the clearance of incoming passengers, with relations between management, staff and staff associations and with a need to ensure the efficiency and impartial application of Customs procedures. Those are the questions that arise, not other broader questions. We are concerned, no doubt, with an instruction given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1976; not, I might add, an instruction given by a previous government.
The honourable member for Parramatta has said that the events today indicate dishonesty, arrogance and cover-up. It is perfectly plain what took place on that day. He said that there has been a day by day dribbling out of documents. It is perfectly plain that, in the short time available to it, the Government got as many documents together as it possibly could. Since then it has been

1914 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Review of Customs Administration

at pains to ensure that all documents came before this House. As to the allegation that in some way there has been an attempt to cover up the persecution of Mr Mayhew, I have nothing to say about Mr Mayhew one way or the other; bilt it is essential if this House is to go about the investigation into the matters that arose from the events of 5 October that it does so under sensible, clear and limited terms of reference of an administrative nature. If the Opposition wants to have a royal commission it might as well wrap up the next two or three years. It is often said in this House that lawyers should be excluded from many matters. Certainly if the Opposition wants a royal commission and it wants a long, dragged out inquiry which will reveal nothing at all that is the way to go about it. If the Opposition wants to produce a quick and efficient solution, these terms of reference are the way to go about it.
Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah) (10.12)-Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)-I will grant indulgence for that purpose.
Mr MacKELLAR-Although I was not listening to the actual words that were being spoken by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), I understand that he said in the course of his speech either that I had not paid the duty that was owed or that he was not sure whether I had paid it. I understood him to say that I had not paid the duty. I make it absolutely clear that I have paid the duty plus the penalty. I have a receipt from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs documenting that fact.
Mr JOHN BROWN (Parramatta) (10.13) -Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member may procee4.
Mr JOHN BROWN-If I did say that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) had not paid the duty and I was wrong, I apologise. If I said, as I think I did, that I did not know whether he had paid the duty, I thank him for the information.
Mr N. A. BROWN (Diamond ValleyMinister for Employment and Youth Affairs and Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (10.14)-The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) said, in substance, in his contribution to the debate that the inquiry that is proposed by the Government is too narrow and unnecessarily restricts the matters that should be inquired into. I refute that suggestion very

strongly. The best piece of evidence that can be used to refute the suggestion is the proposed terms of reference that came from the Opposition itself. When the matter was raised on 20 April the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) moved an amendment, which is set out on page 1508 of Hansard of 20 April. He set out quite clearly the sort of inquiry the Australian Labor Party apparently wanted. What was sought at the outset was a judicial inquiry, not a royal commission. There seems to have been a change in that regard. The Opposition sought a judicial inquiry on 20 April. A few days later that has been translated into a royal commission. It would seem quite clear that, in the first place, the Opposition does not know what it wants.
The interesting thing is that the proposed inquiry which the Opposition sought had five terms of reference-paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). The proposals in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) were confined solely to what one might refer to as the specific MacKellar-Moore issue-the specific issue that was the vehicle for raising the general debate. So three of the Opposition's proposed terms of reference were themselves narrowly confined in the extreme. They did not seek the elucidation of any general matters concerning the Bureau of Customs and did not seek the improvement in any aspect of administration or efficiency in the Bureau at all. They sought information and details and particulars with the specific one-off situation that gave rise to the general debate.
The same can be said of the Opposition's proposed term of reference (e) which was to inquire:
Whether any other Minister was aware or should reasonably have been aware of these matters and failed to take appropriate action.
So it is completely without any foundation whatsoever, on the evidence, and beyond argument completely that the Opposition sought at that time, when it knew what the issue was, a wider inquiry. It did not seek a wider inquiry at all. It sought a narrow and restricted inquiry indeed. It is the Government which has set up the proposed review to be conducted by Mr Mahony. It is clear from the terms of reference of the review that it is a wide-ranging inquiry. The honourable member for Parramatta, of course, omitted the substance of the terms of reference in the course of his contribution because the inquiry is in these terms:
To review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales, with particular regard to:

Review of Customs Administration

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1915

The specific matters that the honourable member referred to come only after the words 'with particular regard to'. So Mr Mahony who will be conducting the inquiry is not confined to those specific matters. He is to review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act. He is not narrowly confined. He has a very wide writ indeed. He has ample scope under the proposed terms of reference to investigate, as I understand it, all of those matters which the honourable member for Parramatta now, at this late stage, comes along and says should be within the ambit of the inquiry. The proposed terms of reference are wide. They do give scope for all of those matters which the Opposition now, at this late stage, says should be inquired into. it lies pretty dryly in the mouth of the honourable member for Parramatta to say that we are having a narrow inquiry when, only on 20 April, the Opposition was itself proposing a narrow and restricted inquiry.
There is a' specific matter which should be addressed very briefly and that is the question of a royal commission. If the honourable member for Parramatta wishes to seek advice on this matter he will find that it is, I think, common ground that the purpose of a royal commission is to have an inquiry armed with very extensive powers where the necessity is to dig deeply into specific contested questions of fact and, indeed, to apportion blame or fault. That is the function of a royal commissioner-to inquire into those specific areas where there are arguments on the facts and to resolve those facts and, in effect, to attribute blame or fault where it is felt that blame or fault should be attributed. In this case we say that it is very interesting that the honourable member for Parramatta does not say, as I understand it, that there should be an investigation now into the specific question of the importation of the colour television set. Why do we need a royal commission, if that is not to be inquired into? The Opposition has not asked for the terms of reference to be widened to include the specific case. It has not asked for that at all. We say that there is no need for a royal commission. It is not an appropriate case for a royal commission. The matters are not the sorts of matters that are normally investigated by a royal commission. To hold a royal commission would be to elevate the specific issue out of all proportion and indeed, to postpone for an unnecessarily long time the resolution of these matters. It is proposed that this will be a forwardlooking inquiry. What needs to be inquired into

are the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the Customs aspect. It should be a forward looking inquiry; it should be concentrating on administration and the specific matters referred to in the terms of reference. The terms of reference cover all those matters that the honourable member wants investigated. Mr Mahony in effect will be, within the terms of reference that are set out, at large. Indeed, if honourable members read clause (2)-again, the honourable member did not read it in his contribution to the debate-they will find that it states quite specifically:
without limiting the generality of the above, account may be taken in the review of such reports, developments, events and other circumstances as may be considered necessary in order to report on necessary or desirable changes as required above;
Therefore he can have regard to reports; he can have regard to developments, events and circumstances. What is he not to have regard to? What is not covered by those explanations? He can have regard to material that he wishes to have regard to for the purpose of answering the questions that are put to him. It is not an appropriate case for a royal commission. As I have said, it is necessary to have an inquiry and the appropriate and proper way to have an inquiry which will produce the information that is needed is by adopting exactly the method which the Government has proposed.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (10.21)--1 second the amendment. I will not delay the House but I must say that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) has made a better fist of a poor job than the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I make it very clear that we are asking for a judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. It does not have to have the high powered powers of a royal commission but it needs some judicial backing. If it is a judicial inquiry it is tantamount to being a royal commission. The Minister would understand that. What is Mr Mahony going to do to compel witnesses to attend and give him evidence? He has no power to do that. How is Mr Mahony going to compel the production of documents? He has no power to do that either. Therefore there is a basic weakness in this area.
The Minister was very critical of the fact that on 20 April the Opposition appeared to want a limited inquiry. A lot has happened since 20 April. Documents have trickled out which clearly indicate that we need to have a good look at the efficiency of the Bureau of Customs. Its officers are seeking such an inquiry. It is not so much a matter of the Opposition trying to persecute a couple of former Ministers. That is history. The

1916 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Review of Customs Administration

issue is what is wrong with this Department. All the Minister has done is to expand the inquiry to cover the whole of New South Wales. I do not know his reason. If it was to be only a narrow inquiry into a little colour television set coming into Kingsford-Smith Airport, why in the name of fortune is he now talking about the whole of New South Wales but Kingsford-Smith Airport in particular? As the Opposition says, let us have a look at the administration of this Department. We know that for some time these officers have been complaining not only about Kingsford-Smith Airport but also about the port of Sydney, and about containers of drugs coming into Wollongong and other areas of Australia.
If the Government is so concerned about having a narrow inquiry, why narrow it to New South Wales but with particular reference to Kingsford-Smith Airport? Is it really interested in what its officers are about and their morale? They feel that there is a lot of graft, corruption and crime. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) seems to have a very keen interest in the matter now so let us get to the issues. A few yachts and vessels containing a fair amount of cargo that the Bureau of Customs would have been very interested in have been seen off-shore. Are we not going to look at such matters just because certain goods did not come into Australia by aeroplane? How ridiculous can the Government be!
I think the Minister is trying to do a job but he is under severe riding instructions. He cannot even look at what comes into Tullamarine. It would be worthwhile, would it not, to see the arrivals there? The Government has agreed to an inquiry but it has now nobbled-that is a favourite word of the Minister's-or hobbled Mr Mahony to the extent that he will merely ask a series of questions. He will not be able to compel anybody to answer them or to produce any documents. He would be the most castrated commissioner I have ever seen from the point of view of being able to perform any function. He is struck with sterility. He is unable to do anything in this area. Is it not about time that the Government opened up and did what the Press are saying it should do? The officers are saying: 'Isn't it a bit suspicious about (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)?' This matter has nothing to do with a television set; it has everything to do with the administration of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs.
Let us get this very clear. We could almost be ad idem on this issue if the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs were given his rein in this matter and were not subservient to the Prime Minister. The issue is this: We must not try to have a limited inquiry on what happened in New

South Wales, with particular reference to an airport. The matter of Customs and the administration of Customs affairs, relate to the importation of goods, the payment of duty and criminal penalties if narcotics or major offences are involved. Why would such an inquiry be limited to a minor aspect or a particular location? If we wanted to hold a royal commission on that issue we would limit the terms of reference to: On such and such a date did the Minister bring in a colour television set? But we are not dealing with that issue. We could put down the specific terms if that were the issue, but it is much wider than that.
That is why we want to see Mr Mahony given some powers. We want to see him given judicial powers. They have to be given in the form of a royal commission of inquiry. He would then have power to compel witnesses to appear, to get records produced and to conduct his inquiry in public with the Press and the media present. The public of Australia could then be informed from day to day of what Mr Mahony was inquiring into. By so doing-by involving the media and letting the public know what was going on-we might find that they have more evidence to give Mr Mahony. That is the whole idea of public hearings. That is the advantage in giving to the people of Australia an indication of what the inquiry is all about. We are talking about the efficiency, administration and procedures of this Department. As my colleague said, it is a most important department. This has a lot to do with the matter of duty. But it involves not only duty; it also has a lot to do with integrity and the performance by public servants and others of their duties in accordance with the Customs Act. A failure to perform in that area can cost this nation dearly.
Heroin is coming into this country. There is obviously laxity in the ability of law enforcement officers to prevent that. Surely we would like to think that Mr Mahony could inquire into whether there is laxity in other aspects. He has the intelligence and the ability to investigate issues and certainly to examine people. He might also want to look at people's bank accounts, which might not be beyond the normal way of investigating whether anybody suddenly came into wealth. If he can look at Mr Allen's bank accounts, what about looking at a few others? It might help the administration of justice in this country to do that.
For that reason, without delaying the House any further, I strongly urge the Government to reconsider what the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) moved by way of amendment. He picked up some of the Minister's sentiments. To suggest that we need a narrow inquiry-that is all that is proposed now-is

Review of Customs Administration

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1917

ridiculous. I suggest that honourable members should look at what has happened since 20 April. They should look at the real point at issue in this country now; that is, the eradication of crime, the prevention of graft and corruption. We want an efficient and effective Customs administration. We can have that only if the officers concerned are able to give evidence before the inquiry. In view of some of the things said to the Opposition, I am certain that if they can be sustained before Mr Mahony it will be found that there is a need for a drastic overhaul, not only of the Act but also of the people who at present, have the obligation to administer the Act.

ADJOURNMENT
Death of Mr Fred Williams
Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:
That the House do now adjourn.
Mr BARRY JONES (Lalor) (10.35)-ln Melbourne on Thursday 22 April 1982 the death occurred of one of Australia's greatest painters.
Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:
That the question be now put.
Mr Barry Jones-I wonder whether the Minister would reconsider for a moment. This is not a political speech.
Mr SINCLAIR-I beg your pardon. I apologise.
Motion-by leave-withdrawn.
Mr BARRY JONES-In Melbourne on Thursday, 22 April 1982, the death occurred of one of Australia's greatest painters-possibly our greatest landscape painter-Fred Williams. He died of cancer at the age of 55 at his home after an illness of some months. He was born in Richmond, Victoria, in 1927. He studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne and the Chelsea Art School in London. He did not gain much public recognition, although he had been a painter for years, until he was about 40. His recognition owed much to the astute promotion of his friend and agent, Rudy Komon.
Fred Williams evolved a spare, disturbing, calligraphic style which eliminated all extraneous elements from his landscape subjects. His style was absolutely unique. Even a casual art lover could walk into a gallery anywhere in Australia, see a painting for the first time and say: 'That is a Fred Williams'. In the last three or four years of his life his style changed to more expressionist, dramatic,

1918 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Adjournment

large scale works. If 1 may be parochial, some of his late works included magnificent studies of my electorate-the Werribee Gorge and Cobbledicks Gorge. He was an extraordinarily prolific artist. He worked quickly on many paintings almost simultaneously although sometimes two or three years would elapse between the beginning of a work and its final execution. His work gained international recognition and reached a climax perhaps in 1977 with his one-man exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Fred Williams leaves a wife, Lyn, and three daughters, Isobel, Louise and Kate. Just as we mark the passing of members and former members of this Parliament, so it seems appropriate that in this national forum it is possible to pay tribute to great Australians as they pass from us. I am sure that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) would agree with that. Fred Williams's last week, perhaps, is worth noting. It was known for months that he was dying of cancer. His last week was a good one. On Tuesday he came to Canberra-not all of us think that is a particularly good way to start a week-to attend a meeting of the National Gallery Council and to see the National Gallery, which when it opens will in part be a monument to him. On Wednesday he had lunch with his old painting mates. On the Thursday morning he died in his sleep. His death is a blow to those who loved him; his work, which will never die, enriches us all.
Mr WILSON (Sturt-Minister for Home Affairs and Environment) (10.39)-On behalf of the Government 1 place on record a tribute to the late Fred Williams. He was, indeed, a great painter but his memory will live on not only in his works of art-significant as they are and will be to the cultural and artistic life of this communityhis contribution to the development of the National Gallery will reveal itself in its full splendor only following the opening of that gallery later this year. As my friend the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has mentioned, the late Fred Williams came to Canberra last week and attended a meeting of the National Gallery Council. All of us who knew of the seriousness of his illness were praying and hoping that he would have the joy and the excitment of being present at the opening of a gallery that he had for many years, as a member of the Gallery Council, helped to plan for. Not only did he plan and assist in the development of the building; he played a significant role, with others, in the development of the national collection. It is a collection which many of us have only read about, because as money has been invested in it over the years on

the advice of people like Fred Williams, that collection has been put in safe custody. It will only be later this year when that collection is placed on public display that we will be able to appreciate the great qualities and talents of this great Australian painter.
1 express on behalf of the Government to members of his family our deepest sympathy in their sad loss. Their sad loss is of very great significance to them but it is also a sad loss to the nation to lose a man of such talents who was still, as my honourable friend has said, producing paintings right up until the time of his death. Those paintings will be of very great significance, as they express something of the Australian identity through the visual arts. It is appropriate that in the adjournment debate this evening we as a House place on record our acknowledgement of the great contribution to Australia of this great painter and extend our sympathies to all members of his family.
Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (10.42)-1 join with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) in saying a few words about Fred Williams. I perhaps do not know as much about art as my colleague the honourable member for Lalor, but I have considered myself a friend of Fred Williams for some years. Among other things, we supported the same football team-Collingwood. Fred Williams had other interests besides his art. He was a great Australian character. I do not know whether it will ever be published, but he was one of those unique people in that he kept a diary on everything he did, every place he went to and every experience he had. He followed some of the great traditions of Australia in that he would have a drink on a very hot day. We drank many bottles of wine together at his home, at my home and, on the last occasion, at a Vietnamese restaurant in Canberra just after we had been to an exhibition of his at the Australian National University.
For me it was a unique experience in that the art of Fred Williams was an introduction to understanding how Australia can be seen. 1 had no formal education in this field but 1 did not find it a great difficulty to understand the way in which Fred Williams was expressing the Australian landscape. It often seems to me that when we take off in an aeroplane from Canberra Airport and look at the landscape out the window really what we are seeing is what Fred Williams saw years ago and expressed to us; it just took us a little longer to understand it.

27 April 1982 REPRESENTATIVES 1919

He really was a great character amongst the artists. It is extremely sad, not just for his familyLyn and the girls-who will sadly miss him. Artists, as is their wont, are great politicians. They all like to be involved in what is going on. On some things they are expert and on some things they are terribly inexpert. But it is a great tragedy to lose a person who has contributed so much and saw so much pride in the building of the National Gallery and developed such an active part in it. He came to see it for the last time last week before the opening in October this year. It would have been of great pride to Fred had he been a part of the throng that will walk across the lawns between Parliament House and the Gallery in October this year to watch the opening. We will all take great pleasure in the years ahead in having known him. That is one of the great things about being in national politics in Australia. We are all in a position on occasions to meet some of the greatest Australians. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Lalor has said, that high among the greatest Australians in this field will be the name Fred Williams. People will be able to look at the works that he had produced. They are in all the art galleries of Australia. They are in the galleries of France and the United Kingdom. He was the first artist to have a major exhibition in New York. He will not be a person easily forgotten by art lovers, by friends, or by people, as I say, who shared a bottle of wine with him. He was not a great judge of wine; I think he took solely the recommendations of his custodian, Rudy Komon. Nevertheless, that relationship between himself and Rudy Komon, and the way in which Rudy was able to project Fred Williams's art on to the people of Australia so that they understood it, speak volumes for the benefit that was derived from that relationship.
I hope that Lyn, his wife, and the girls understand what we are doing tonight in placing his name on the Hansard record of the national Parliament. He will be sadly missed by many Australians and especially by those who in future will see his art but were never able to meet the man.
Mr HODGMAN (Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory) (10,46)-May I simply add some brief words to those already uttered by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). The House is

indebted to the honourable member for Lalor for giving the national Parliament the opportunity briefly to pay tribute to the late Fred Williams. I do so both personally and because I feel it is my duty on behalf of my predecessor, the former Minister for Home Affairs and the Capital Territory when the two ministries were combined, the Honourable R. J. Ellicott, now His Honour Mr Justice Ellicott, to place on record what I believe he would be saying were he here this evening.
Bob Ellicott held Fred Williams in the highest regard. They had a close personal friendship and I think they had a mutual admiration for each other, coming as they did from totally different disciplines and professions. I did not have the opportunity of knowing Fred Williams as others who have spoken earlier did but I do have the opportunity, as a layman, of looking at his work. It is, as the Minister has said, a tragedy that he has died before the official opening of the National Gallery. But what a magnificent tribute to his character and fortitude it is that, facing the inevitability which he knew was just around the corner, he came to Canberra last week and saw in the closing stages of its construction what I have no doubt will be one of the finest national galleries in the world. His memorial will be the paintings displayed therein, through other parts of Australia and indeed through other parts of the world. In that sense his spirit will live on. As I said a moment ago, I do not claim the excellence to be a judge of art, so I simply conclude my remarks by quoting words which have been expressed to me by his colleagues in his profession. They simply said: 'He was the greatest'.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
House adjourned at 10.48 p.m.

1920 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982 ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

Answers to Questions

The following answers to questions were circulated:

Cooper Basin Oil
Mr Anthony-On 17 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1037) Mr Wallis asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, a question without notice concerning the proposed development of oil and gas liquids reserves from the Cooper basin. In my reply I undertook to seek information about the scheme.
The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer:
Work has commenced on the liquids pipeline to carry crude oil and natural gas liquids to Stony Point near Whyalla. Work has also started on the fractionation plant and sales of oil and condensate are expected to commence in early 1983. Sales of liquefied petroleum gas are due to commence in early 1984. I understand that sufficient feedstocks are likely to be available from the Cooper Basin to support a small oil refinery at Stony Point but it is up to the private sector interests to demonstrate the feasibility of such an enterprise.

Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) As mentioned in the honourable member's question, oils are now taxable at the rate of 17.5 per cent. Products known as re-refined oils are also subject to sales tax at 17.5 per cent. However, oils, greases and other preparations, including re-refined oils for use for business or industrial purposes as lubricants for machinery, implements and apparatus, other than road vehicles of the kinds ordinarily used for the transport of persons or the transport or delivery of goods, are conditionally exempt from sales tax.
(2) The scheme of the sales tax is such that second hand goods are not subject to sales tax. However, re-refined oils are not second hand goods. Although some of the materials used in producing re-refined oils are second hand, the re-refined oil product is a commercially distinct article from the raw materials used to produce it. The fact that a product may be manufactured from materials, some of which may be second hand, is not conclusive in determining whether the product manufactured is second hand. If the manufactured product is a new product, it is taxable in like manner to other similar new products.

New Parliament House: Creches and Child Minding Facilities
(Question No. 3077)
Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 10 September 1981:
(1) What provision, especially capacity, has been made for (a) creches and (b) child minding facilities in the new Parliament House design.
(2) Will there be restrictions relating to the use of these facilities by any persons employed in Parliament House; if so, what will be the restrictions.
Mr Hodgman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) No provision has been made for incorporating a creche or child minding facility within the new Parliament House building. The Joint Standing Committee on the new Parliament House has, however, asked the Parliament House Construction Authority to set aside a suitable area in the surrounding landscaping for a possible childcare facility.
(2) The administration of any future child care facility within the precincts of the Parliament would be a matter for determination at the time by the appropriate Parliamentary authorities.
Sales Tax on Oil
(Question No. 3747)
Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
(I) Is the Government imposing its recent decision to levy 17t per cent sales tax on lubricating oil and lubricant and refined oil.
(2) If so, to be consistent does the Government see a need to levy sales tax on other second hand goods and does the Government intend to do so.

Cocos Islands Airport
(Question No. 3755)
Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
What steps are being taken to investigate a proposal for upgrading the airstrip at Cocos Islands to make it suitable for taking large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747-B.
Mr Wilson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
There is no such proposal under consideration.
Ministerial Stationery Requirements: Prime Minister
(Question No. 3785)
Mr Robert Brown asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
What are the details, including:
(a) quantities and (b) costs, of ministerial stationery requirements for his
ministerial office since the 1980 general elections.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) and (b) In the period November 1980 to February 1982, 348 reams of letterhead, 18 reams of compliment slips and 197,000 envelopes were purchased at a cost of $21,936.

Voluntary Early Retirement
(Question No. 3821)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 February 1982:
Is the Government considering proposals for the extension of voluntary early retirement provisions currently available to Commonwealth public servants to all Commonwealth employees in statutory corporations and similar bodies; if not, why not; if so, will he announce a date on which these provisions will take effect and if not, why not.
Mr Viner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 provides for voluntary early age retirement for employees of Commonwealth authorities which are prescribed, by regulation, under that Act. The initiative rests with authorities in deciding whether or not to seek to become prescribed under the Act. To date 19 authorities have been so prescribed.
Defence Programs: Deferrals
(Question No. 4081)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 February 1982:
(I) Have any major capital equipment maintenance programs or purchases been deferred temporarily; if so, do these include (a) proposed purchases of additional Orion aircraft and (b) maintenance work on (i) refitting HMAS Melbourne, (ii) major refits on the DOG's and (iii) development work on the Jindalee OTH Radar.
(2) Will any deferment of equipment repairs and maintenance increase the risk of (a) loss or damage to equipment and (b) injury to Service and civilian personnel.
(3) Will he review the practice and validity of deferment of equipment maintenance and repair.

Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(I) (a) No.
(I) (b) The refit of HMAS Melbourne has been cancelled as a result of the decision to purchase HMS Invincible. Neither the DDG refit nor presently approved developments for Jindalee (OTH Radar) have been deferred.
(2) No.
(3) There is no 'practice of deferment of equipment maintenance repair' applied to Defence equipment. There is a continuous process of judgment applied to the allocation of defence resources within an overall allocation.
Refreshments Provided to School Groups Visiting Parliament House
(Question No. 4086)
Dr Everingham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 March 1982:
(1) Were refreshments provided at Parliament House for visiting school groups at one stage changed at my request from pastry and soft drinks to packets of dried fruits and/or nuts and fruit juice.
(2) Will he take steps to restore this innovation in conformity with current moves elsewhere in Australia to limit sales of sweets on or near school premises.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) Children from primary schools are now offered refreshments such as health bars, biscuits and soft drinks. Children from secondary schools are offered refreshments such as sandwiches, cake and soft drinks.
The change was instituted by the Joint House Committee in 1977 as a result, I understand, of representations from senators and members.
Fifteen Millionth Australian: 'Australian Women's Weekly' Promotion
(Question No. 4090)
Mr Fry asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1982:
Is the Population Branch of his Department working on a project to find the 15 millionth Australian in conjunction with a promotion being run by the Australian Women's Weekly, if so, (a) how many officers of his Department are involved in the project, (b) can he provide an estimate of the cost of the project in staff time and Government resources, (c) is the Australian Women's Weekly contributing towards any of these costs and (d) does he consider it feasible to positively identify the 15 millionth Australian.
Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Population Branch of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in conjunction with the Australian Women's Weekly has conducted a quest to select a person symbolically representing the 15 millionth Australian, in order to publicise this significant milestone in Australia's population development. Promoting a greater awareness of population matters and highlighting the importance of population trends in many policy areas such as education, housing

1922 REPRESENTATIVES 27 April 1982

Answers to Questions

and health, is one of the basic functions of the Population Branch.
(a) One officer in Population Branch has undertaken most of the Departmental work. Three officers have worked on the project from time to time. It has only taken up a relatively small amount of their time.
(b) A meaningful estimate of the cost of the 15 millionth Australian quest in staff time and Government resources cannot be made because work on the project is combined with other Departmental tasks.
(c) The Australian Women's Weekly is contributing to the costs of the project by organising sponsors, providing a trophy and developing material to be published when the quest results are announced. No financial arrangements between the magazine and the Department have been made and neither party has special rights to the story once the selected person is announced.
(d) No. At all times the symbolic nature of the project has been made clear.
Export of Live Sheep
(Question No. 4149)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 10 March 1982:
(I) Is it a fact that more than 100,000 sheep from Australia died on board ships bound for the Middle East in 1981.
(2) Do recommendations prepared in December 1981 by the Bureau of Animal Health entitled 'Standards for the preparation and carriage of sheep by sea', state that 'a Government officer' and later 'the Government veterinary officer' shall inspect the animals for health and fitness to travel and there is no mention of the need for, or the required provision of, veterinary assistants.
(3) Given that the average ship carried in excess of 100,000 sheep, the period of detainment for inspection before departure is four days and inspection of the sheep cannot begin on each day until the sheep have consumed their morning ration, resulting in an effective 18 hours a day remaining for inspection, would one Government veterinary officer, working the full 18 hours a day available, have an average of 2.59 seconds to inspect each sheep for some of the 10 omens of ill health and unacceptability for travel.
(4) Is 2.59 seconds per sheep a sufficient period to inspect a sheep for (a) pregnancy, (b) internal and external parasites, (c) infectious or contagious diseases and (d) clinical digestive upsets or signs of metabolic disorder.
(5) What action does he intend to take to ensure that adequate inspectors are made available for pre-shipping inspections of export sheep.
Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes, the total mortality was 2.17 per cent (approximate) in 1980-81. Based on 5.7 million exported sheep 124,000 (approximate) sheep died.
(2) Yes, but it is assumed that normal State inspection practices will be followed and that veterinary officers will use assistants as necessary in the inspection process.
(3) The average ship does not carry 100,000 sheep, only four ships carry 100,000 or more. The range is 12,000 to 125,000. Experienced officers will not allow sheep to be presented in a way which does not allow for adequate examination for signs of ill health. The inspection process is a continuing one at feedlots and before loading.
(4) Sheep are inspected for a sufficient period to ensure that they are healthy and fit to travel. This does not necessarily

imply separate inspections. Sheep as flocking animals are in fact distressed by separation from their fellows and may exhibit signs of distress which is not their actual physical state. Experienced veterinary clinicians always carry out flock inspections in order to discern the abnormal state. If animals exhibit signs they are examined as individuals.
(5) The methods of inspection at feedlots and ports are under continuous scrutiny by officers of the Australian Bureau of Animal Health. Any complaints or allegations of shortcomings are investigated and corrected as necessary. The Australian Bureau of Animal Health as the responsible organisation, welcomes any information which will further the welfare of sheep during the export process.

Research Centres of Excellence
(Question No. 4174)

Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 11 March 1982:

(I) With respect to the Research Centres of Excellence
Committee, how many submissions were made from each State in the social science area.

(2) Is it a fact that the only award given to a submission in the social sciences was a total of $1.2m to be provided over a
three year period to the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University, Victoria, where the principal research worker is to be Professor Michael G. Porter, F.A.S.S.A.

(3) Were other submissions made to the Committee by Monash University; if so, how many.

(4) Were the submissions ranked by universities in order of importance; if so, where did Monash University rank the
Centre of Policy Studies in its own submission.

Use of Toxic Materials in Vietnam
(Question No. 4190)
Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 16 March 1982:
(I) In view of the statement on page 7 of the Repatriation Review Tribunal's Decision in the case of Colin Peter Simpson (Registration No. N81/0181, File No. MSS 577, dated 5 January 1982) that Dr Gunz was supplied with inter alia; extracts from literature on certain chemicals, their use in Vietnam and elsewhere, and their reported effects, as supplied by Mr John Evans to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, will the Minister state in detail what this material supplied to Dr Gunz was; if not, why not.

Williamstown Naval Dockyard: New Procedures
(Question No. 4244)
Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 March 1982:
What are the details of (a) any new procedures to cater for special shipbuilding problems being implemented at Williamstown Naval Dockyard, Vic.; and (b) the new structures for purchasing shipbuilding supplies at the Dockyard.
Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:
It is too early to provide details of new procedures to cater for special shipbuilding problems at Williamstown Naval Dockyard. Suitable measures, including new structures for purchasing shipbuilding supplies, are being developed from recent reviews. These will be implemented progressively before destroyer construction commences.

Antarctica: Icebergs
(Question No. 4262)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:
(I) Is the exterior limit to the Antarctic Territory at the edge of (a) the continental land mass or (b) the ice mass.

Taxation of Lump Sum Superannuation Payments
(Question No. 4279)
Mr Beazley asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 March 1982:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the remarks of Mr Allen Coates, Chief General Manager of the AMP Society, regarding superannuation and income tax on lump sum payments; if so, will he consider then when recommendations of the Campbell Committee in this area are considered for implementation.
(2) Is he committed to continue the application of paragraph 26 (d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act to lump sum superannuation payments; if not, does he intend to limit any change in the application to prospective superannuation participants.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) and (2) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the comments made by Mr Coates, in his capacity as the General Manager of the AMP Society, in regard to the conclusions reached by the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System concerning the taxation arrangements for superannuation. These comments, together with those of other interested parties, will be borne in mind when the Government considers that aspect of the Committee's report.
As the honourable member will be aware, a Task Force at the official level is currently preparing an evaluation of the report's recommendations and conclusions to aid the Government's consideration of it. Until the superannuation aspects of the report have been examined in greater depth, it is not possible for me to indicate what the Government's response will be to this area of the report.
