Wednesday, 29 April198J
Mr SPEAKER (Rt Hon. Sir Billy Snedden) took the chair at 2.15 p.m., and read prayers.
PETITIONS The Acting Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:
Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.
Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:
(i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;
(ii) higher domestic air fares. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Holding, Mr Howe, Mr Humphreys, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Les McMahon, Mr Milton, Mr Morris and Mr Mountford.
Petitions received.
Unemployment Benefit
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully calls for:
The immediate and unconditional withdrawal of any proposals to deny Unemployment Benefits to unemployed people under 18 years old.
That the level of Benefits for all unemployed people, and including people receiving sickness benefits and pensions, be raised to at least 120 per cent of the poverty line.
That future employment policies be devoted to job creation and the restoration of full employment rather than the evasion of this responsibility by hiding the unemployed in short term training and education schemes.
Public aCknowledgement of the fact that unemployment is the result of insufficient jobs and not the fault of any minority group, the education system or the unemployed themselves.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Cunningham, Mr Howe, Mr Barry Jones and Mr Mildren.
Petitions received.
Plant Breeders' Rights
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned

citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:
1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.
3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognize that any system giving 'property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.
4. Recognize that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse e!Tects namely:
(i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,
(ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,
(iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,
(iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,
(v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.
5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Ewen Cameron.
Petition received.
Plant Breeders' Rights
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:
1. Note that legislation establishing plant variety rights in other countries has had adverse effects, namely:
(a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production bas passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
(b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
(c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic material from falling into private hands.

Taxation: Child Care Expenses
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:

Discriminatory Legislation
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to
outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employment, in employment of individuals under federal awards, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasigovernmental organisations, and in employment of alI persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdiction; and
That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in the provision of unemployment benefits to all persons without regard to sex and/or marital status. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mr Humphreys and Mr West.

Plant Breeders' Rights
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:
1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:
(a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into th~ hands of a few international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.
(b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artifical fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.

2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materillls from failing into private hands.
3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to -legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Petition received.
Toxic Shock Syndrome
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:
(I) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classifiedunder Therapeutic Agents (not under "Cosmetics" as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.
(2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.
(3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fulIy informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mrs Child.

Your petitioners therefore pray:
That the Federal Government will assume its full responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs, and use the powers conferred on it by the people of Australia in' the 1967 Referendum to intervene on behalf of Aboriginals in any conflict with any State or Territory Government;
That the Government respond to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitution Legal Affairs on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland Reserves which sets out precisely the Commonwealth Constitutional and legal position under Section 51;

by Mr Hayden.
Petition received.
Use of Live Animals in Research
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
(I) That continued use of animal ingredients in cosmetic products, and the inhumane use of animals in scientific research for cosmetic products is abhorrent and barbaric.
(2) That no central records exist on such inhumane use of live animals for experimentation purposes, yet research institutions in several Australian States engage in such a practice.
(3) That there exists no uniform legislation between the States concerning responsible standards of research conduct, indeed, in some States there is a complete lack of legislation altogether.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will enact legislation to require:
(a) the Australian Bureau of Statistics to produce annual statistics on the numbers of live animals involved in research, and provide information as to research purpose;
(b) the National Health and Medical Research Council to develop humane and responsible standards of conduct for researchers using live animals in all Government, Industry and Educational Research Laboratories.

Immigration
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens showeth:
That we protest at the many unwise decisions of our National Government which have resulted in discrimination against Australians in many ways.
That unwise immigration has introduced into Australia crimes characteristic of some races and which through an environmental impact is influencing the behaviour of some Australians.
That unwise immigration has led to the basing within Australia of a number of foreign terrorist groups such as the Mafia and alleged Liberation groups, all of which are causing the police and citizens great concern.
That the Government act immediately on the wishes of the people as expressed in numerous public opinion polls and bring to a halt the present huge intake of non-Caucasian people, thereby retaining some portion of the fast diminishing goodwill and public confidence in that Australians have not given the Government any mandate to populate the country with people alien to the Australian way of life.
That the Government give practical effect to the views so earnestly espoused by the recent Minister for Immigration, Mr M. J. R. MacKellar (Hansard 30.11.72), ex Minister for Immigration Sir Phillip Lynch (Page 16 Policy book, Evolution of a Policy), Ex Immigration Minister Forbes (Hansard 17.8.72 and press statement 2.5.72), and ex Prime Minister Sir William McMahon (Press statement 4.5.72).

Our affirmation that Australia's own development depends upon the development of its most important natural resource, our children, and that education must be restored to a position of major priority for this task by this and all future Federal Governments.
We call upon the Federal Government to immediately restore and increase substantially its allocation of resources to education in government schools and colleges in order to achieve these ends.

To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. A petition

of the undersigned citizens, residents within the Federal electorate of Dundas, respectfully showeth:
Our dismay at the reductions in the total expenditure implemented in 1980 and proposed for 1981 and in particular on government schools and colleges.
Our concern at the immediate and long-term effects such reductions are having, and will have, upon the educational needs and welfare of the children and students within public schools, Technical and Further Education Colleges, Colleges of Advanced Education and Universities.
Our further concern that education, which is a major element in the public sector of the Australian economy, has been consistently down-graded from a position of importance in the development of the National economy as a whole.
Our afi1rmation that Australia's own development depends upon the development of its most important natural resource, our children, and that education must be restored to a position of major priority for this task by this and all future Federal Governments.

AirFares
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth:
I. That we oppose the massive increase of 30.7 per cent in air fares from Canberra to other capital cities compared with the average increase of 7.4 per cent.
2. That this will cause serious hardship for many Canberra families who will not be able to afford to see their relatives from other parts of Australia.
3. That the ordinary families of Canberra should not be singled out for such massive increases and should receive equal treatment with the rest of Australia.
Your petitioners therefore pray that the Federal Govern- ,nent take immediate action to adjust air fares to and from Canberra in line with the average increase of 7.4 per cent or to compensate the citizens of Canberra for this massive increase in air fares.
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
by Mrs Kelly.

QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE
NORTHERN IRELAND Mr YOUNG-I ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Has the Government made any representations to the British Government, either through the High Commission in London or through other channels, concerning the case of Gerard Sands, generally known as Bobby Sands, the recently elected member of the British Parliament, who is currently on a hunger strike in Maze Prison, near Belfast? If so, what was the nature of those representations? If not, will the Government urge a policy of moderation on the British Prime Minister in an effort to avert Bobby Sands's death and the inevitable civil strife that it would provoke? Mr MALCOLM FRASER These matters are properly the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. I think we in this House all know that the difficulties in Northern Ireland have been extreme for many, many decades. I do not see that we would advance the cause of peace and stability in Northern Ireland by seeking to intervene from Australia. The United Kingdom Government would have total concern for the well-being of all the people of Northern Ireland in its considerations and these matters ought to be left in its hands.
AIRLINE HOSTESSES DISPUTE

(2) Is of the opinion that the Government should have contingency plans to use RAAF aircraft promptly if Tasmania is isolated by future industrial disputes.
PRIME MINISTER Notice of Motion
Dr THEOPHANOUS (Burke)-I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That this House-

Mr DEAN-I address my question to the'Minister for Transport and refer him to the large number of people in some of the outlying regions of Australia, particularly the Northern Territory and north Queensland, who are severely disadvantaged as a result of the continuing flight attendants dispute. I ask the Minister: Has the Government developed any plans to try to assist the people in such regions?

(l) Condemns the Prime Minister for the authoritarian and arbitrary methods he uses in running the Cabinet and in achieving Cabinet decisions; and
(2) Calls on all Ministers to ensure that proper democratic procedures are used in Cabinet and that due weight is given to alternative views to those held by the Prime Minister.
AIRLINE HOSTESSES DISPUTE Notice of Motion
Mr GOODLUCK (Franklin)-I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That this House condemns the air hostesses strike and calls on the Government to introduce legislation to declare air travel an essential service free from all strikes.

Mr HUNT-The Government is very concerned about the continuation of this dispute and the hardship and suffering it is causing people right throughout Australia, particularly those people living in the outlying areas who have not available to them any other means of transport. The Government has, therefore, decided that the Royal Australian Air Force services will be made available to those people living in the outlying regions of Australia, such as the Northern Territory and north Queensland, who are in urgent need of travel for medical, compassionate and other special reasons. If this dispute is not settled today the Government will locate RAAF aircraft at Townsville and Darwin to service the surrounding

regions and will cover such routes as DarwinAlice Springs-Adelaide and Townsville-Darwin and Townsville-Brisbane. Steps will be taken immediately to implement the necessary arrangements.
Both the Premier of Queensland and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory have been in touch with me, expressing their very deep concern about the difficulties that some people are experiencing in some remote locations. They have sought assistance. It is expected that the RAAF can provide a range of services on a continuing basis within 24 hours. In the event of any breakdown in the services presently being provided by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia to Tasmania and by MacRobertson Miller Airline Services to the north-west coast of Western Australia, which have been given a limited dispensation by the hostesses, the RAAF resources will also be utilised in the same way as they will be for the Northern Territory and Queensland.
It is my hope that this dispute will be settled as soon as possible. It is causing a tremendous amount of damage to this country, including to tourism. The losses of revenue that have been occasioned both TAA and Ansett are of the order of $11m. Of course those losses will be recouped through future fare adjustments. I think it is high time we saw a sense of responsibility in the leadership of the hostesses' union and a number of other unions around this country that are causing a lot of discomfort to people generally.
KAMPUCHEA Mr MORRISON--My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 1 refer again to my question to the Minister on 27 November 1980 concerning Kampuchea. Will the Minister now admit that the Government continues to give respectability to the Pol Pot regime by Ministers of this Government sitting at international conferences with representatives of that regime as a consequence of its hypocritical vote in the United Nations on 13 October 1980 in favour of the Pol Pot regime?
Mr SPEAKER-Before I call the Minister 1indicate to the honourable member for St George that the question is in order but he should eliminate from his questions such words as 'hypocritical' .
Mr STREET-I recall the honourable gentleman's previous question. At the time. I made a distinction between recognition of a government and the question of credentials at the United Nations. To the best of my knowledge, the honourable

gentleman's party, when in government, adopted the same attitude as this Government has in relation to credentials. The Credentials Committee brings forward technical recommendations as to whether the credentials presented on behalf of a country are in accordance with the -procedures and so on of the United Nations.
Mr Morrison-I raise a point of order. The Minister's statement is completely incorrect. We did not accept the Credentials Committee report on the People's Republic of China--
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for St George will resume his seat. He can make a personal explanation at a later time.
Mr STREET-The Australian Government has always drawn a distinction between the recognition of a government and the question of credentials as brought forward by the United Nations Credentials Committee. The Australian Government has made its position quite clear. At present it recognises no regime in Kampucheaneither the installed Heng Samrin regime nor the previous Pol Pot Administration. That is where the situation is at the moment. When the issue of credentials arises in the United Nations we will take an attitude according to the circumstances at the time.
DOMESTIC AIRLINE PASSENGERS: CARRIAGE BY INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES
Mr SHACK-I ask the Minister for Transport: Is it a fact that the recent approval for international airlines to carry domestic passengers in the course of their normal scheduled services has demonstrated that any administrative and practical difficulties associated with such services have been and can be easily overcome? Will the Minister allow international services to remain available to domestic passengers after the current air hostess dispute has been resolved?
Mr HUNT-I think the events of the last few days have indicated that the proposition put forward by the honourable member is certainly a feasible one in terms of administration. In the longer term, however, I understand that there would have to be additional facilities for Customs, quarantine etc., in order to cope with the mix of passengers on such aircraft. I have initiated discussions between the airlines to ensure that there is a way through the problem that has been concerning the Western Australian people for some considerable time. Where we can use excess capacity on international services from Perth to the eastern States, we should endeavour to do so, so long as we do not disrupt the regular scheduled

services that the Western Australians have come to expect. That is the only concern I have in trying to achieve that objective which has been sought by a number of people from Western Australia.
FILM INDUSTRY: TAX CONCESSIONS Mr CHARLES-I refer the Treasurer to answers that he gave in this House on 10 and 11 March concerning the cost of tax concessions promised to the film industry, which had jumped from the $2m cited during the election campaign to $lOm and finally $20m. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that these tax concessions may now cost as much as $30m a year, or 15 times more than originally estimated? Is this estimate correct? If so, does the Treasurer agree that these measures are extremely generous and unprecedented in Australia? In the light of their rapidly escalating cost, does the Treasurer still propose to proceed with these measures in their promised form? Mr HOWARD-I do recall the questions referred to by the honourable member. The honourable member's recollection of the revenue cost amounts coincides with mine. I have seen reports suggesting that the revenue cost will be higher than I said it would be in those answers. I agree with him that these concessions are particularly generous. I do not venture a view about precedent without taking the matter on notice. The legislation covering this matter is due to be introduced into Parliament before the House rises for the winter recess. Then it will be possible for the House to know the precise terms of what the Government is proposing. In saying that, let me make it clear that the Government is keen-it was keen at the time the commitment was made, and remains keen-to give significant assistance to the Australian film industry. It is an industry which has been extremely successful in recent years and has been a source of very considerable pride to all Australians.
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO POLAND Dr EDWARDS-Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs say whether the Government has yet decided how to respond to the recent Polish request for economic assistance in that country's current difficult economic situation? Mr STREET-The Government has decided to meet an urgent request from the Polish authorities for credit assistance to enable the continuation of Poland's traditional purchases of wool, skins and hides from Australia. This assistance will take the form of credit guarantees for up to $A40m of export credits which the Polish authorities are currently seeking through the private banking system in Australia. The credits will be

fully underwritten by the Government, using the facilities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The credits will finance purchases which are urgently required to maintain the operation of key enterprises in Poland. As with a number of other Western countries which have similarly decided to respond to Poland's request for assistance, Australia has taken this action to help Poland in its current difficult economic situation. Assistance at this time is designed to help the Poles resolve their current internal difficulties in their own way and without external intervention.
BELCONNEN MALL Mr FRY-Did the Minister for the Capital Territory agree with his Government's decision to sell the Belconnen shopping mall as a further step in undermining the rights of the citizens of Canberra to have some say in the government of their city? Is he aware that plans have been drawn up by the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, which runs the mall, to use the current profits from the mall to develop recreation facilities at the top of the mall, which are badly needed? Given that the mall is said to have a market value of $7Sm to $80m, is it the Government's intention to put it up for auction or tender, or has some cosy deal been arranged with some of the Government's friends? Did the Minister feel under any obligation to consult with the people of Canberra, through the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, before agreeing to this further erosion of their rights? Will he consider recommending to the Government that it conduct a referendum of the people to determine whether they wish the Government to sell the shopping mall?
Mr HODGMAN-No decision to sell the Belconnen Mall has been announced by the Government. I will not speculate on any of the matters raised by the honourable member. I resent the implication that this Government in any way, shape or form engages in the same sort of cosy deals as the previous Whitlam Administration engaged in.
ANZAC DAY PARADE Mr KATTER-I direct my question to the Minister for the Capital Territory. I refer to the shameful incidents which occurred during the ANZAC Day ceremonies in Canberra. I ask the Minister: While taking his decisive-and commendable actions, did he unearth or find evidence of any plans for this weird group to indulge in similar activities at similar solemn occasions in the future?

Questions Without Notice

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1693

Mr HODGMAN-I believe that every member of this Parliament and the overwhelming majority of Australian citizens recognise that since 1916 ANZAC Day has been a day of solemn national remembrance for over 102,000 Australian ex-service men and women who laid down their lives in defence of freedom in two world wars in Korea, in Malaysia and in Vietnam. I say to this Parliament for the first time that I, as Minister for the Capital Territory, deeply regret what transpired in the national capital last Saturday. I say further that this is the third successive year that the solemn ANZAC Day commemoration has been so disturbed in the national capital. On each occasion the group claiming the credit for this act has been a group describing itself as Women Against Rape-WAR.
Mr Fry-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister has claimed that the service was disturbed. All people who attended would agree-
Mr SPEAKER-Order! the honourable gentlemen is arguing the issue. He will resume his seat.
Mr Fry-That the service was not disturbed in anyway.
Mr SPEAKER-There is no point of order.
Mr Fry-It was a mile aWllY from the ceremony, where these disturbances that he caused were taking place.
Mr SPEAKER-I indicate to the honourable member for Fraser that when I give a ruling he must obey the Chair and resume his seat and not continue speaking. If he does otherwise, I will have to deal with him.
Dr KIugman-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Certain charges have been laid against people arising from this matter. It so happens--
Mr Birney-Where were you in the war?
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for Prospect will resume his seat. The honourable member for Phillip will withdraw.
Mr Birney-I withdraw. Dr Klugman-I do not wish to take sides on that issue because as it happens I do not support the women who demonstrated. I think it is important to realise that certain charges have been laid and that if the Minister makes certain broad allegations against people they will tend to stick against individuals. Mr SPEAKER-I take the point that the honourable member for Prospect has made. Have charges been laid?
Mr HODGMAN-Yes, Mr Speaker.

Mr SPEAKER-I will not allow the answer to proceed further.

I have given a ruling. Mr Hodgman-I accept that, Sir. Now we know where the Labor Party stands on ANZAC Day!
RUNDLE SHALE OIL PROJECT Mr HAYDEN-I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I remind him that in this House on 9 April he repudiated as 'despicable' a question from me asking for an assurance that no Minister or his family had taken up shares in the two Rundle companies, Central Pacific Minerals NL and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL. I accordingly ask: Is the Prime Minister aware that, 24 hours after his denial, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs confirmed that shares in one or both of these companies were held in trust for his children? Is he also aware of information that the family of another Minister in this Government traded in shares in one or both of these Rundle partners? Is he prepared categorically to deny this information too? Finally, will he now acknowledge that a public register which declares the pecuniary interests of Ministers and members of Parliament is the only way to reassure the public and dispel this sort of disquiet? Mr MALCOLM FRASER-We have had discussion on these matters. A report was prepared

1694 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Questions Without Notice

by Mr Justice Bowen and the Government has accepted that report in relation to Ministers. It has applied it in relation to Ministers and public servants. It is in the process of being applied in relation to the Parliament. At the appropriate stage there will be a full debate about the Bowen report. It is worth noting that the Bowen report, having very carefully gone into these matters, rejected the notion of a public register.
I have said on a number of occasions that it is very difficult to know where these things end. I am not speaking now of a particular case. Is it just a question of the member? Is it a question also of a member's family who can have ownership of certain things in his or her own right? When does a child become an adult and have a right to a private life of his or her own? There are many questions here which are questions of privacy for individuals, not all of whom are members of this Parliamen~ but who might be related to a member of this Parliament.
The Bowen report quite clearly went into all these matters in great depth. If the honourable gentleman wants to have a further debate on that report I think, subject to what my colleague who is handling this matter says, we will be able to expedite that more quickly to make sure that these matters can be fully debated.
In relation to the particular instances that the honourable gentleman mentioned, I still regard the original question that he raised as offensive and despicable. I regard the implications that he made in the question on this occasion as it refers to honourable members as despicable.
Mr Hayden-Well, your answer was despicable because it was not honest.
Mr SPEAKER-The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.
Mr Hayden-He gives an incorrect answer and now he is trying to presume that he has never made a mistake.
Mr SPEAKER-The Leader of the Opposition will remain silent.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-What a person does before he is a Minister is his own affair and entirely his own right. It is how a person behaves as a Minister that is important in relation to these matters. My colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs had indicated quite plainly on that day or the day after that what he or his family had done was entirely in accord with the principles of the Bowen report and with the rules that have been laid down. That has been known publicly for a considerable time.

Mr Hayden-Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. This answer is inconsistent with the'statement the Prime Minister made in this House on 9 April.
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable Leader of the 'Opposition is debating the matter, he is not making a pOInt of order.
Mr Hayden-Either he'misled the Parliament then or he is misleading it now.
Mr SPEAKER-The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr Hayden-Either his system does not work or he has covered over an important point.
Mr SPEAKER-OrderI The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The honourable gentleman knows quite well that the declarations that Ministers need to make refer to their position at the time they become Ministers. If there is anything in their possession at the time they become Ministers they undertake forthwith to set in train processes to bring them within the guidelines. If there is any need for a Minister to do that, he does. For the honourable gentleman to make suggestions about the ownership of shares which might or might not have been held by a person before he became a Minister and needed to accept those obligations is a total irrelevancy, and the honourable gentleman knows it. I am also aware, and was aware, that some other Minister at some other point had, over a long period of years, owned shares but had divested himself of them long before this particular circumstance arose. Therefore, I was perfectly happy in my mind that the standards set had been maintained. The honourable gentleman would do much better to read the Bowen report and understand that Ministers are entitled to have some privacy for their familiesfor their wives and for their children.
Mr Hayden-The problem is that we have to accept your word, and we know how much value it has in the current market place. We can listen to the honourable member for Kooyong if we want to find out how good your word is.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Honourable members well know that the Leader of the Opposition was in a little trouble in Caucus this morning because he did not allow the honourable member for Wills to speak yesterday. The honourable member for Wills would have done so much better than the Leader of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition wants some diversion from this morning's Caucus meeting, he has chosen a very poor vehicle by which to obtain it.

GENERAL AVIATION STUDY
Mr EWEN CAMERON-Is the Minister for Transport aware of the concern being expressed by the general aviation industry about some of the recommendations made in the general aviation study he released on 13 March? Will the Government give the industry adequate time to provide an input before decisions are taken?
Mr HUNT-In 1978 the Government set up a study by the Department of Transport and the Bureau of Transport Economics into the general aviation industry and the level of cost recovery that should be obtained from that industry. That report has been made public and is currently in the hands of the general aviation industry. I am well aware of the concern being expressed by sections of the industry about the possible serious impact of those recommendations on the general aviation industry should they be implemented. At a meeting of the Aviation Industry Advisory Council recently I advised the industry that it should endeavour to make a report upon the study by 30 April. I have since had representations from most of the constituent organisations of the general aviation industry seeking an extension of time because they have not yet been able to make a formal response to those recommendations. I have decided that they should be given until at least 30 June to make a formal response to that study.
I would like also to give an assurance that the Government will not be taking any actions at all that will cause serious damage to the general aviation industry. It is a very important element of the civil aviation industry in this country. However, we have adopted the principle of cost recovery. We are applying it to international aviation and to domestic civil aviation. We are cost recovering to the extent of about 30 per cent in regional aviation. Currently the level of cost recovery in general aviation is of the order of 14 per cent. I recognise that there would be very serious problems if we endeavoured to recover the recommended amount. I am sure that the Government will take those considerations and observations of the industry into account before making a final decision on the study.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: ANTI-TRUST ACTIONS
Mr LIONEL BOWEN-Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that the Australian National Line, a company owned by the Australian Government, is one of four companies being sued in what is called the latest anti-trust actions instituted in the United States? Further, is

the Minister aware that for the first time the sovereignty of the Australian Government has been called squarely into question in a United States court? Accordingly, I ask: What protests has the Government made concerning the attempt by the Americans to impugn our sovereignty and to exercise jurisdiction over Australian companies for alleged offences which occurred outside the United States?
Mr STREET-The detailed carriage of this matter--- the extra-territoriality of United States legislation-is mainly in the hands of my colleague the Attorney-General. I am aware or the problem to which the honourable gentleman has alluded. We have made our concerns known to the United States Government. I will get from my colleague the precise terms in which that has been done and let the honourable member know.
POLITICAL PARTIES: FUNDING
Mr CARLTON-My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the provisions for public funding of political parties being introduced this week by the New South Wales Government. Will this action affect the availability of Federal funds to the New South Wales Government?
Mr HOWARD- -As honourable members will be aware, some legislation which will provide access to the public purse for the Labor Government of New South Wales for its party political purposes has been introduced into the New South Wales Parliament this week. Whilst I do not believe it would necessarily establish a healthy precedent and therefore would not be something that the Government ought to entertain as a reason to make some adjustment to grants to the New South Wales Government because of the cost of that legislation, I think nonetheless the introduction of that legislation indicates the potential expenditure of several million dollars for blatantly party political purposes. Both the Liberal and National Country parties in New South Wales have declared their total opposition to that legislation and have indicated that they will not register as provided under the legislation and will thereby not receive the benefits of public funding of political campaigns provided for in that legislation. The legislation happens to be significant.
Mr Keating-l raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. If the Government bankrolled the New South Wales Liberal Party with half the Commonwealth Budget it could not beat Wran.

the individual-is significantly more draconian than had been believed at the time the in-principle decision was announced. It involves the appointment of inspectors by a commission. Those inspectors will have the power to enter premises belonging to political parties and to inspect records. The inspection of those records will not be restricted to records of donations over and above the threshhold by which people are obliged--
Mr Keating-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. This has nothing to do with the Treasurer's portfolio. It is not relevant to the question. The Treasurer was asked whether the Government would adjust the reimbursements to New South Wales to compensate for expenditures under electoral legislation. The Treasurer is now using this as an opportunity to berate the New South Wales Government which won a mandate for this policy at the last election.

Mr Hayden-Does this mean that a Minister can say anything he wants to say in relation to questions he is asked?
Mr SPEAKER-The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
Mr HOWARD-It is a very interesting commentary on the economic priorities of the New South Wales Government,that, notwithstanding a recent public opinion poll which showed that 75 per cent of the Australian community was opposed to the proposal, including 65 per cent of Australian Labor Party supporters, the New South Wales Government believes that there is sufficient economic priority and urgency to expend the amount of money from the public purse which is involved in this legislation.

The financial priorities in every area have to be taken into account. The information available to the Government would indicate that the Homes Savings Grant Scheme, and

Questions Without Notice

Mr UreD-That is what they are complaining about. Because of the nine months delay it does not help them. It only pays for the furnishings.
Mr MALCOLM FRASER-I understand that the honourable gentleman has that point of view. The information available to the Government indicates that the program is widely supported and is of considerable benefit to many people building their first home. The honourable gentleman is entitled to his own judgment which can run counter to that. The Government believes that the scheme is a good one. It was modified as a result of the last election and it is working to assist many families into their first home.
DEREGISTRATION OF BUILDERS LABOURERS FEDERATION
Mr ROCHER-My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Does the Government still intend to seek deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation? If so, will the Minister inform the House what stage preparation of his case has reached?
Mr VINER-I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I know he has a keen interest in this subject because of his past involvement in Western Australia in the building industry-and very successfully, I might say. I welcome this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's determination to proceed with the application for deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation. I think honourable members are well aware that the decision which the Government has taken is a most serious one, but it is an appropriate course when we consider the history of this union and its industrial record since it was federally reregistered in 1976. I think that by any standards the community would be appalled at that kind of industrial record of a union which seeks registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order to obtain the benefits which that Act bestows upon it.
As soon as I took over the portfolio of Industrial Relations I obtained a briefing on where we stand in the preparation of the case. I have since had a more detailed briefing. I expect to be meeting with counsel engaged by the Commonwealth in Melbourne on Friday, when I will go through with them the voluminous evidence which has already been obtained. As the honourable member for Curtin is aware, we are dependent to a considerable degree on the assistance of those employers who have been hurt and damaged by the industrial action of the BLF. Notably, we are obtaining the assistance of the Master Builders

Federation. I had intended to meet with representatives of the Federation tomorrow; but unfortunately, because of the airline strike, that will not be possible. I have been assured by the Federation that it is as anxious as the Government to gather the evidence together and put it before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
In many respects it is a mammoth task. A great deal of detailed evidence has to be analysed, recorded and then put into proper legal form by way of affidavit. I cannot say that the application will be made within the next week or so, but I can assure the House that I will be proceeding with this application as expeditiously as I can and with the utmost seriousness. I conclude by mentioning that the Prime Minister in the last day or so has written to all Premiers seeking their support in seeing that this union is properly isolated in the industrial movement of Australia in the event that it is deregistered.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr GILES (Wakefield)-Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.
Mr SPEAKER-Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?
Mr GILES-I do. My personal explanation refers to a report in this morning's Australian which quotes my views on the speech made yesterday by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I want to make it perfectly plain, as a matter of personal honour, that I spoke to neither Mr Russell Schneider nor any other member of the Press after the speech made by the honourable member for Kooyong. I therefore made no such statement. If the remark were construed as referring to yesterday's debates, that might be another matter.

Mexican Embassy approached the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1979 to raise the question of a formal science and technology agreement between our countries. With discussions under way, Mexico further demonstrated its interest in the possibility by sending a science delegation to Australia in May 1980, visiting various research establishments in several States. The delegation included a number of high level Mexican scientists, and the visit generated strong interest in and support for closer links with Mexico from the Australian scientific community. The visit was followed up in November 1980 when a member of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation executive visited Mexico to examine areas of mutual scientific interest for exchanges of scientists and for setting up cooperative research programs.
The Australian Government has now agreed in principle to enter into a formal science and technology agreement with Mexico; discussions on the text and substance of the agreement are now in progress. Areas of co-operation can be expected to include solar energy research, agricultural and animal husbandry studies, dry land farming, work in arid zones, marine research and industrial science. It is planned that as the level of co-operation grows between Australia and Mexico, the basic agreement will be supplemented by a series of specialist protocols between co-operating agencies, and these will serve further to strengthen and expand the developing bilateral relationship. The Australian Government welcomes the forthcoming science agreement, the first and so far only bilateral agreement to be concluded between Australia and Mexico, as an indication of the importance attached to closer relationships between the countries.

AGREEMENT WITH MEXICO ON CO-OPERATION IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY
Ministerial Statement
Mr STREET (Corangamite-Minister for Foreign Affairs)-by leave-The governments of Australia and Mexico have agreed in principle to enter into an agreement on co-operation in science and technology. The possibility of concluding a science and technology agreement with Mexico has been under active consideration since late 1979. Before then Australia and Mexico had encouraged contacts at individual scientist and inter-agency levels with the aim of promoting and fostering ad hoc bilateral relationships between the scientists of the two countries.
In recognition of the trend towards closer cooperation between Australia and Mexico, the

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) -by leave-The Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) of the arrangement to enter into an agreement with Mexico on co-operation in science and technology. We note that the matter has been under consideration for more than a year, and accordingly we expect that a detailed agreement could be ready for signature in the not too distant future. I add that the Australian Labor Party pioneered a most active policy of relations between Australia and the Latin American states when it was in office. Those initiatives were based on our realisation of the growing importance of the whole region which stretches south from the United States of America to Cape Horn. In that large area of the world, the nation which has grown faster economically and emerged on to the world scene more rapidly than any other is

Mexico. Mexico is now the fifth largest oil producer in the world and has the sixth largest oil reserves in the world. Like Australia, Mexico is a major energy producer.
Similarly like Australia, Mexico has large areas of tropical and desert regions. It has a population of 70 million, which population is growing rapidly. It currently has an impressive annual economic growth rate of about 8 per cent. Its foreign trade runs into billions of dollars a year. But in that context the two-way trade between Australia and Mexico was only $40m. Clearly there are great economic opportunities in the AustraliaMexico relationship. It is to be hoped that the science and technology co-operation flowing from the proposed agreement will be followed by other bilateral agreements to expand and strengthen relations between Australia and Mexico. Australia has special knowledge in a variety of fields. It could be of benefit to Mexico. There will be many benefits, not the least of which would be solar energy research, arid zone agriculture, the livestock industry and industrial science.
We note with pleasure that Mexican technicians and students are already studying in Canberra, Brisbane and Adelaide in fields such as agriculture, livestock, dairy production, dry farming techniques, astronomy, economics and mathematics. We also note that the Mexican's are interested in upgrading their sheep breeding facilities. Australia could certainly assist in that regard.
We welcome the agreement. We note that there should be opportunities to do more. We hope, for example, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will instruct his officials to investigate the possibility of establishing a bilateral cultural agreement if he has not already done so. The Labor Party believes that science and technology agreements and cultural exchange arrangements are some of the most effective, if perhaps unspectacular, ways of strengthening the fabric of international co-operation. We urge the Government to be most active in these fields. In conclusion, we welcome the agreement. We wish Australian and Mexican scientists and technologists success in their future co-operation.
MONETARY POLICY Discussion of Matter of Public Importance Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilJar)-Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:
The developing credit squeeze resulting from the Government's doctrinaire monetary policy.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.
More than the number ofmembers required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-
Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (3.17)-For some time now interest rates in this country have been at record high levels, the highest in our history. This, in itself, is disturbing enough. But it is tremendously disturbing that in addition, instead of signs that interest rates will fall in the near future, there are instead more and more indicators that the general level of interest rates will rise further in the near future. Indeed, reports of particular interest rate rises occur almost daily. It is increasingly clear that such rises are attributable to the Government's attempt to impose a restrictive monetary policy on the nation. Indeed, for those borrowers without substantial economic power-that is, low and middle income earners, home buyers, small businessmen and consumers-a credit squeeze is very much in place. The imposition of that credit squeeze is not attributable simply to the operation of market forces and therefore beyond Government control. Rather, it is very much the result of this Government's monetarist policies and its associated foreign investment policies.
The evidence of increasing interest rates is undoubted. Over the last year bank home mortgage rates have risen by 2 per cent. Bank interest rates for small overdrafts-that is, for amounts less than $100,000--have risen by about 2.5 per cent to three per cent. Bank overdraft rates for large overdrafts over $100,000 which are not controlled by the Government have risen substantially and are still rising. The prime rate for borrowings by major corporations is up to 15 per cent and may well go further as the seasonal liquidity squeeze accentuates. Building societies and finance companies have also generally matched, if not bettered, the increase in bank interest rates. The prospect of a further rise in home mortgage rates charged by the banks and building societies is indicated by the fact that since the rise of one per cent in the bank mortgage rate last December there have been various further developments.
Bank deposit rates have increased substantially after being decontrolled by the Government in December of last year. Building society deposit rates have tended to rise as a consequence. The rise in the Australian savings bonds rate of 0.75 per cent a month ago has increased the competition for funds. Banks are now in the position where they can lend to a prime corporate borrower at 15 per cent but can charge 'only' 11.5 per

Monetary Policy

cent for a home mortgage loan. The pressure from banks for a further rise in the mortgage rate is therefore very substantial. There is, accordingly, increasing expectation of such a rise. Indeed, only yesterday a major economic commentator in Australia, Mr Allan Carroll, speaking at the housing industry conference, forecast a further rise of between a half and three-quarters of a per cent in mortgage interest rates later this year.
The impact of increasing interest rates on home buyers in the building industry is substantial. The effect on home buyers is to put lower income earners out of the market. Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) got round to acknowledging that fact yesterday in a speech which was read for him at the Housing Industry Association Conference in Sydney. The Housing Industry Association has calculated that 4,000 potential home buyers are put out of the market for every 0.5 per cent rise in interest rates. So the 2 per cent rise in the bank mortgage rate which has occurred over the last year means that 16,000 potential buyers per annum have been put out of the market so far. This, of course, is because the level of repayments has been increased so substantially by the increase in interest rates. On a typical $30,000 loan over 25 years, monthly payments have increased by $43 so far-that is, over the last 12 months with the 2 per cent rise in
interest rates.
Each 0.5 per cent rise in interest rate adds $11 a month to the monthly repayments on a $30,000 loan over that period. So with such substantial increases in repayments, many workers are simply unable to buy a home or maintain payments on a home. 1 am sure that members of parliament have by now received protests from people who have been put in the position where they feel they have to sell their home because of the increase in interest rates that has occurred and their total inability to meet the repayments which have been increased as a consequence. Thus inevitably the number of home loans has already begun to fall. The total number of loans by building societies in February of this year was 36 per cent less than in February of last year. Total lending for home purchasers from all sources was 7.2 per cent less in February of this year than in February of last year. It is clear, therefore, that interest rate rises are having a substantial impact already and any further round of mortgage rate rises will do great damage to the building industry and to the prospects of the average Australian being able to buy a home.
A further development of importance-of course this is a closely associated development-is the slowing in the rate of growth of the money

supply. Since the election in October last year the Government has undoubtedly set about intensifying or applying a monetary squeeze to slow the growth of the money supply considerably. It was therefore found that over the three months to February of this year the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of Ml, one of the measures of the money supply, was in fact negative. It grew at a rate of minus 6 per cent. In other words, there was a substantial decline in the actual level of money supply as measured by Ml. In March the rate of growth increased, but that was not because the Government wanted that increase; rather it was because of a large capital inflow in that month which added substantially to the money supply. Even so, for the three months to the end of March the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of Ml was still negative at minus 1 per cent and M3 growth, which is another measure of money supply, was only 9 per cent which is anything but rapid growth. Thus, the money supply figures show that the volume of money in the community has been severely restricted in recent months, thus making it more difficult to obtain credit. This creates increased pressure for interest rates and also denies credit to many who would like to obtain it.
The reasons for these developments are principally centred on the Government's policy. It is not something which is attributable to the mystical workings of the market, but it centres directly on the Government's monetary policy and capital inflow policy. The Government has pursued a monetary policy for this year which aims at the rate of growth of money supply being kept in the range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent. It has also pursued, as part of its monetary policy, a process of deregulating interest rates-that is, taking away the regulations which apply to bank interest rates in respect of deposit rates so far. Of course, that occurred last December. In addition, the Government's capital inflow policy has been to encourage unlimited inflow or foreign capital to finance resource development in this country.
The Government has been successful in encouraging a very large increase in private capital inflow. In the nine months to March last year the amount of net private capital inflow was $660m. In the nine months to March 1981 that figure went up to $3,943m. That is a tremendous increase which has implications for the rate of growth of the money supply. It tends to add to the money supply. I say 'tends' because it is otTset to some extent by the balance of payments current account deficit, which has been substantial this year. Therefore, the full impact of that capital inflow has not fed directly into the money supply

The reason for that private capital inflow having such a significant impact is that not only do we have that feeding into the money supply but also it is in the context of the Government maintaining a set monetary target.

There the Minister for Industry and Commerce is acknowledging that the funding of this large capital inflow for resource development is taking away the possibility of funds being available for the housing industry, thus providing problems in that area. Of course, this is a tremendously important development.

from overseas we will still have only a 9 per cent to 11 per cent increase. That means we must chop back on the amount of credit which is developed domestically. We then have to apply more intense pressures on banks to limit their lending and we brought about a situation in which interest rate increases are far more likely to occur. The cutback in bank lending and the increases in interest rates are not at all surprising; they are directly attributable to Government policy.

We must also bear in mind that the Government's policy in respect of applying tight monetary targets is based on a belief about the working nature of monetarism which simply is not upheld by the experience of countries which have applied it or, for that matter, by economic theory. No country which has applied the Friedmanite policies this Government is increasingly adopting has been able to point to dramatic economic success as a result. Certainly they have not been able to

In that situation, to be operating a monetary target of 9 per cent to 11 per cent and insisting on achieving it, as the Government appears intent on doing, certainly is restrictive indeed because it leaves little or no room for the financing of economic growth.

How are we to say that these monetarist policies will work? They simply have not worked anywhere and they will not work in the future. To adhere to them in the rigid and doctrinaire way which this Government is increasingly tending to do means that all we will do is bring about spiralling interest rates, restrictions on the rate of possible economic growth and higher unemployment.

those factors have been important.
I note here that if, after the Campbell Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System reports, the Government decides to deregulate bank lending rates, we must expect a very substantial rise indeed to occur in home mortgage rates. If we have deregulation of bank mortgage rates at the same time as bank mortgage rates are way below the rates being charged in the unreg!llated area, then we must expect as a conse quence the banks to take action to increase those mortgage rates considerably. The Government's inadequacy in this area is enormous. Its response to this whole area has simply been to say that the situation is regrettable, that it is concerned, but to claim that no alternative policies are available. Tme prevents me from spelling out detailed alternatives at this stage. Let me say that the pol icy response of saying that what we have to do is to cut back in the public sector to overcome this interest rate pressure is an absurdity, which I hope I will have more time to expound on at some future date. Let me simply say that there is no evidence whatever that increased public sector activity is causing higher interest rates at this time.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)
Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr SAINSBURY (Eden-Monaro) (3.32)-I
agree with the last point made by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis): There is not necessarily a correlation between an increased public sector and interest rates. But this does de pend, as I will no doubt hear the honourable
member for Gellibrand say when he eventually expands on this matter, on the way in which the Government will raise its money. There was quite a lot in the speech of the honourable member who just preceded me in the debate that is worthy of comment. He has made a speech which belies the general attitude of the Australian Labor Party in that he appears to be responsibly looking for sol utions which would enable more money to be available for people for investment and for the development of Australia. If that is really what he wants then that is also what I want. We want to
have enough money around to accommodate the growth that is very strong in this society at the present time. I am not running away from that.
Almost at the end of his speech the honourable
member talked about what he calls Friedmanism.

Of course, we saw Professor Friedman in this country in the past two or three weeks and we lis tened to some of his theories. We are fairly well aware of what they are. Certainly, one of the things that he has said-the honourable member for Gellibrand seems to disagree with this-is that there is a correlation after some time lag between an increase in the money supply and inflation. If there is one thing that has been proved in this country-I think it has recently been proved also in the United Kingdom, despite what the honour able member for Gellibrand has said-it is that there is after a time lag an increase in inflation following an increase in the money supply. I do not propose to go into the mechanisms that bring that about. The mechanisms are documented. What ever they are, the process works. Maybe the honourable member for Gellibrand at some time in the future will be able to show us graphs which demonstrate that on some occasions it does not work. The fact is that it does work. The bitter fact of experience in this country is the prime reason the Government is very keen to see that the money supply does not blow out too far.
We do not want to accommodate rising inflation for all the very good reasons that on so many occasions this Government has enunciated. We see inflation as being a very destructive factor in our economy if it is allowed to run rampant. We saw what happened in the early 1970s when it was allowed to run rampant. I use the word 'allowed' advisedly. We saw inflation creating havoc in this economy, not just because of the way in which it reduced the levels of savings of old people who had put some money away but because of the very reduction in confidence and investment that it brought about. People frankly found that they needed more money every month to invest in pro ductive enterprises for the future production of this country. As I said, inflation is a chaotic indi cator to which we must address ourselves. It is the very first thing that we must get rid of. If we do not, we will never succeed in having the sort of good growth in the economy that we are sustain ing at the present time.
Of course, if one were cynical one would say that the Labor Party wants a higher money supply in order to sustain higher wages. Whilst I do not have any worry about higher wages I say that what we really need is higher wages as a reward for higher productivity. I am not referring just to the wages of wage and salary earners; I am talking about the wages that flow from profits. Surely, that is what we are looking for. Higher wages just in money terms are, in fact, counter-productive. Again, in accordance with those points that I made about inflation they just slow down the

1704 REPRESENTATlVES 29 April 1981

economy in the long run, leaving more people worse off, in particular through increased unemployment. Again, that is experience; that is not something that we are theorising about. It is an experience that we in this country can look back on over many years. We can look at the numbers, look at what has happened and look at correlations.

growth going right across the country. It is our policies that are ensuring that that is happening at the present time. The Australian Labor Party has an identifiable policy. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Gellibrand raised this matter today and appeared to want an increase in the money supply for the good of the people, I really do not think that he does.

J just wonder in any case whether the Labor Party is really interested in an increase in the money supply, despite what the honourable member for Gellibrand has said, for the purpose of allowing people to borrow. After all, it is the Labor Party, or certainly a very big section of the Opposition, which deplores profits, deplores people making profits, deplores companies increasing profits. After all, profits are in general use in this country for further investment and the creation of employment. The Labor Party has this great political hang-up in this area. I suppose it arises from the very roots of the party when there was a genuine confrontation between the haves and the have-nots. That situation does not apply any more as one learns when one visits countries such as Japan and Germany.

Admittedly, under our Government the money supply has been relatively tight recently, and the figures show that. It is a seasonal occurrence which we expect every year; there is always a rundown in liquidity. It happened last year, the year before and the year before that. It has happened in most years. Of course things were much more bumpy under the Labor Government. In 1973 the money supply expanded by 26 per cent, whereas in 1974 there was a terrible credit squeeze. Thank heavens, under the present Government we are managing to keep the money supply on a much
more even keel so that people can make decisions with a bit more confidence. But I agree that at the present time there are conditions in the economy
which, if not managed carefully by a responsible administration, could cause problems.

People who work for companies in free societies, first of all, have the choice to get out of that situation and start their own businesses. That is what traditionally has happened in many cases in Australia. Secondly, people ought to understand that if the company for which they are working is making a profit they in turn benefit. They benefit through better job opportunities and through better real wages. It is this productive capacity of the country in which the Liberal Party and the Country Party are so interested. The attitude of the Labor Party seems to differ from ours as has been shown by the actions it has taken. Really the record of the Labour Party just demonstrates that it has in the past-it was in power for three years-discouraged investment. It has not had the feeling that it is good for people to save, that it is good for people to make profits so that investments can be made. That lack of investment in the early 1970s really was one of the very major factors in slowing down this economy.
Thankfully private investment is up very strongly at the present time. In the December quarter last year, for instance-I just cite a statistic-expenditure on non-dwelling construction was 36.5 per cent higher than a year ago and expenditure on other plant and equipment was 17.8 per cent higher. That increase is much higher than the rate of inflation. That is the sort of productive capacity through investment that this Government is looking for. What we are really interested in is full employment with strong

The run-down is accentuated a bit this year because of much higher levels of company taxes and provisional taxes than we expected. Basically that means that that amount of money will go out of the banking area and into the Government's coffers. The Government will be running a very strong surplus, as it has traditionally in this quarter. In that respect, money is being sucked out of the system and into the Government's
coffers.
Against that, there are two or three ameliorating circumstances. First of all, even though provisional and company tax levels have risen strongly this year because of better profits made last year, as of today only about half of what we think will be coming in has been paid across. About $2 billion has been collected and about another $2 billion is to come in. So at least some of it is there. Also, the major trading banks are running at a seasonally high liquid and government securities asset ratio of about 22 per cent, so they have three or four per cent that they can run down under the normal arrangements and that will be available. In addition to that, the private sector overall is fairly well prepared for the June quarter tax payments because in the next four months about $4.5 billion in Treasury notes and Government bonds will mature. That will make some funds available-again on a seasonal basis-- that are not available as of today. We think that, although the money supply will be fairly tight
within these constraints on money supply of a

Monetary Policy

growth rate between 9 per cent and 11 per cent for the full financial year, there will not be undue strain on the system. Nevertheless, I reiterate that the Government is concerned, as it should be concerned, to ensure that, whilst keeping the ~oney supply tight for the reasons that I mentIOned earlier, enough money is available for people to make reasonable demands for growth.
As I believe I said earlier also, what we are trying to do is to accommodate the strong growth in production in Australia. The latest figures indicate that non-farm product may be rising at a rate of over 4 per cent, which in historical terms is really very good-it is certainly the best figure for quite a long time. We need to accommodate that, but we want to remember that we have to bear down on the inflation problem. The inflation rate is probably under 10 per cent although as the honourable member for Gellibrand just said, the level of the implicit price deflator appears to be a bit higher than that, so perhaps 10 per cent is a bit lower than the true situation. Whatever the true situation is, it is a fact that this Government wants to keep bearing down on inflation. It is something we cannot tolerate, nor do I believe any other party should tolerate it. Of course, the history of the Labor Party indicates that it was quite happy to have rampant inflation.
The honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned the interest rate rise as something which perhaps should not have been allowed to occur. He appears to fear that we may be approaching-I must say I hope we do-a situation in which interest rates are basically deregulated. He fears that because he sees a deregulated interest rate structure necessarily pushing up interest rates. I think he sees banks or anybody else lending money as greedy and having some power over the market. He sees the effects of deregulation leading to higher repayments for people borrowing money. Again, we all agree that we do not want people to have to pay any more than necessary to borrow money, perhaps especially the people purchasing houses, who are committed long term, who usually have limited resource bases-in other words, normally one or two salaries or wages are earned in a family.
We understand quite well that a one or two per cent increase in housing loans interest rates is absorbed with great difficulty by the private sector, but what we do not want to run away from is that when interest rates were increased we were in a situation in which the small fellow, the battler, who was seeking to borrow money through the bank simply could not get any money. The banks were in a situation in which, because of the price

they had to pay for money outside, or the encouragements they had to give people to leave money with them, they could not find money for the small borrower. They were being forced into the higher interest rates area of the banking system of offering loans of over $100,000, or into channelling money through their finance companies so that they could obtain an even higher rate of interest. The sooner we realise in Australia that we should free interest rates, that we should allow interest rates to meet a market level, the better off we will be all round. When one holds out against a change that is obviously necessary it is particularly difficult when it does occur.
One thing that we could do to lower interest rates would be to let the mO'1ey supply blow right out. It is a matter of balance. What should we do? Should we bring interest rates down now by suddenly increasing the money supply and making it far more available, perhaps by printing money, or should we adopt a more responsible approach? Should we say: 'Let's keep bearing down on inflation; let's worry about people's investments; let's worry about jobs in the long term and let's worry about the overall growth of Australia'? It is that latter option that the Government chooses. That is why money is not completely freely available. Bearing that in mind, I reiterate that the Government is keeping a very close eye on the situation. We are in roughly the same situation with respect to borrowing as we were in last year. I could talk about quite a number of other things in relation to who is getting the money and who is not. But, basically, we do not see that there will be undue strain in the system in the weeks ahead, towards the end of June. Of course, that is what is to be expected under responsible management.
Mr ARMITAGE (Chifley) (3.47)-The House is discussing this matter of public importance:
The developing credit squeeze resulting from the Government's doctrinaire monetary policy.
In other words, we are discussing the extreme monetarist policies of Milton friedman, of which the best examples in the world today are the policies of the Thatcher Government in the United Kingdom and the Fraser Government here in Australia. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) would have known that one of the major issues to be discussed in this matter of public importance would be interest rates, the fact that interest rates in Australia today stand at the highest level ever in the history of this country. Yet, on this very important economic policy issue, the Treasurer has abdicated his authority. He has slunk out of the

be priced out of the market by this Government's high interest rate policies and by its deliberate credit squeeze restricting the amount of funds available for home mortgages.
In the last year interest rates on home loans have increased three times. They are now 2 per cent above their level in March last year. This has meant an extra $43 a month or $10.70 a week in repayments by home buyers with very modest loans of $30,000 over 25 years. These are the issues which we are bringing to the House today. It is extraordinary that on these important issues, the interest rates being charged today which are the highest in the history of the country and the draconian credit squeeze dictated by the policies of Milton Friedman which are followed by this Government, the Treasurer has completely abdicated all responsibility. He has refused to come in to the chamber to answer very important charges about the hardship that he is causing through the policies that he has introduced. He has let a minor backbencher protect him.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Millar)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr CARLTON (Mackellar) (3.58)-It is always interesting to hear the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) working himself into a lather over economic matters. He criticised my good friend the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) for leading for the Government in the debate. The closest the honourable member for Chifley has ever got to an economic argument is the name of his electorate. I think that the former Labor Treasurer and Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, would turn over in his grave if he heard the extraordinary potpourri of ideas and issues that has been put before the House this afternoon by the honourable member for Chifley. The Labor Party is engaging in its annual seasonal charges about interest rates and the tightness of credit. Opposition members say that the big credit squeeze is coming. The last big credit squeeze occurred in 1974 when the honourable member for Chifley and his friends were in office. It was an enormous credit squeeze. It put many people out of business and caused the biggest lift in unemployment the country has seen since the Depression. It followed an expansion of the money supply in 1973 in a manner which was totally auncontrolled and which led inexorably and inevitably to an increase in inflation and unemployment.

Currently the situation is well under control despite an alarmist headline in the Australian Financial Review yesterday which stated 'Government losing the money battle'. If that headline were anywhere near true it would make a total nonsense of the suggestion in the matter of public importance that the Labor Party has put up today. The article in the Australian Financial Review accuses the Government of moving in precisely the opposite direction by increasing the money supply far too quickly. The honourable member for Gellibrand and the honourable member for Chifley say that we are squeezing credit and we are squeezing the money supply in a doctrinaire manner allegedly dictated by Professor Friedman. The Government's policy on money supply has been quite consistent over the last five years. There has not been a credit squeeze since the 1974 credit squeeze of ill-fated memory. It is absolute rubbish to say, as the honourable member for Gellibrand said, that everybody is about to fail to get a loan. Last week, in the property section of the Sydney Morning Herald the Property Editor, Mr John Rich, said:
However, a spokesman for the Australian Bankers Association said that it was not true to say that money was tight.
Australian banks had loaned $359m to owner-occupiers of houses in February compared with $328m in February 1980. This $39m extra had more than offset the $16m decline in home loans by building societies during the month.
What did the building societies say? The article continues:
A spokesman for the NSW Permanent Building Society said there was no doubt that less finance was available from societies because of the drain on their deposits as users fulfilled tax commitments.
This was seasonal. All the indications were that it would soon be easier to obtain money.
Every schoolboy knows that at this time of year businesses have to pay large amounts of money in tax. They go to their bankers and they say: 'We want to use up some of our overdraft because we have a big tax bill'. Obviously that puts a bit of a squeeze on the borrowing system. Many borrowers always find it harder at this time of year to get money, to get their overdrafts extended. That is as it should be because other borrowers are coming in ~easonally and it is necessary to try to maintain an even control over the flow of money. This Government could take the advice of the Opposition and panic at this stage as the. Labor Government panicked in 1973. We could let a,lot more money out to meet this seasonal demand. If we did this we would be doing it at the same time as there is a big union campaign to get wage increases much higher than productivity increases.

If there were not an inflow of foreign capital to assist us with our development does the Opposition think we would have as much money as we now have for housing projects? Where would the money come from? The Government has quite sensible controls over foreign investment. There are rules as to how

The whole business of controlling the money supply is not a doctrinaire matter; it is a matter of practical experience where we have to keep judging it carefully all the time. In the last Budget the Treasurer (Mr Howard) set down a target for the increase of money supply in Australia of between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. That was the target range. Because of the increasing rate of development in Australia which is showing up in more jobs and in more people doing things we are at the upper edge of this range. The Government is certainly finding it difficult to stay within that range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent. Bear in mind that we are at the upper end of that range because it is recognised that there is a lot of extra activity and there is a need not to bring in what the Opposition

much foreign investment there can be in any company. There are rules over property purchases by foreign investors. There are sensible rules designed to ensure that Australians retain a stake in the ownership of this country. If we want to cut that off even further we would have to find more local capital for these projects; we would have to squeeze heavily on the housing sector; and we certainly would not be able to buy as many houses or get as much money for housing as we can now. The honourable member for Gellibrand comes up with a whole lot of disconnected requests. There are contradictions in them. If the Opposition wants to stop foreign investment, fair enough, but we will not get development, we will not get more jobs and we will not have as much

DESIGNS AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Second Reading
Debate resumed from 7 April, on motion by Mr Thomson:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
Mr THOMSON (Leichhardt-Minister for Science and Technology)-Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, the Patents Amendment Bill 1981 and the Trademarks Amendment Bill 1981 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these three measures? There being no objection, Twill allow that course to be followed.
Mr BARRY JONES (Lalor) (4.9)-1 would like to pass on my abundant thanks to whoever was responsible for bringi?g on thc::se Bills. th!s afternoon instead of at 10 0 clock tomght whIch IS what I was told. That saves me and the House from the danger that the subjects will be stale when I speak on them. At least I will have the advantage of freshness in dealing with the matter now. The Designs Amendment Bill 1981 follows the recommendations of the Designs Law Review Committee chaired by Mr Justice Franki. I assure the House that there has been no precipitate haste in rushing into this legislation. There has been haste in bringing it on this afternoon, but not in preparing it. The commission was given to the Franki Committee by the Gorton Government on 13 October 1970. The Committee reported to the then Labor Government in February 1973. Now, a mere eight years later, legislation is brought into the House. The parent Act is the Designs Act 1906. The Act has been amended from time to time since 1906, as recently as 1979. No substantial amendments have been made since 1968 and this Bill constitutes a fairly comprehensive revision of the Act. Its purpose is to extend patent protection to designs. Since 1906 the whole concept of design had broadened but on the whole the Committee reported in a fairly conservative fashion. For example, in the 1906 Act the definition of 'design' was as follows:
. . . an industrial design applicable, in any way or by any means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of an article, or to any two or more of those purposes;
The definition adopted in this legislation is an amalgam of the recommendation of the Franki Committee and the words found in the United

Kingdom Registered Designs Act 1949. The proposed definition in the Bill is as follows:
- "Design" means features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament applicable to an article, being features which in the finished article can be judged by the eye . . . but does not include a method or principle of construction.'
In the original Act 'article' means 'any article or substance'. In this Bill 'article' will mean:
any article of manufacture and includes a part of such an article if made separately.
There is a slight broadening of the definition. It has to be made clear that the legislation covers only manufactured articles-that is to say, design in a comparatively narrow sense. It does not cover artistic designs such as television logos that are not capable of being affixed to a specific article. That is covered by section 17 (2.) of the 1906 Act, which provides:
. . . that the regulations may exclude from registration designs for such articles or for articles included in such classes of articles, being articles that are primarily literary or artistic in character, as are specified in the regulations.
That, of course, would cover much of design, as we commonly use the term, for example as found in television or in computer software operations and so on.
The main purpose of the legislation is to bring up to date the Act of 1906 in conformity with the changes in the law that have been partly brought about in Great Britain as a result of case law. The most important, I think, has been the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Utilux Pty Ltd v. Amp Inc., reported in (1972) R.P.C.l03. In that case it was held in effect that if an article was made in a certain shape, not in order to make it appeal to the eye of a customer, but solely to make the article work or to perform functional requirements, no design exists within the meaning of the definition in the Registered Designs Act. The Franki Committee report stated:
It seems likely that these events will induce more manufacturers in the United Kingdom to seek to rely on copyright protection rather than design protection wherever a design incorporates any functional features. We have taken account of the judgment of the House of Lords in our recommendations with respect to the definition of design and the recent decisions of the Chancery Division have had a material effect on our views with respect to the problem of dual protection.
The report went on in paragraph 255 to state:
It seems to us that a person should be able to make whatever use of an article he pleases if, in accordance with the usual practice in the industrial field, he finds on a proper examination of the records that the article is not covered by any patent or design protection in Australia. We think it ,:"ould be highly undesirable for a manufacturer to be placed In a position where, having found that no current letters patent or registered design would prevent him from manufacturing an article it would nevertheless be unsafe for him to proceed because there might be in existence an artistic work in which copyright might subsist. In addition, at least in most countries, there is no copyright register that can be searched and so there

1710 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Designs Amendment Bill

is no way a manufacturer can ascertain the position concerning copyright. This position is made even more unsatisfactory by the fact that copyright might continue to subsist for a very long period, if not indefinitely in the case of engravings and photographs, where the period is dependent upon the date of publication. In cases where the date of publication is relevant, it may be very difficult or, for all practical purposes, almost impossible for a prospective manufacturer to ascertain whether copyright subsists or not, particularly in view of the requirement that a publication that is merely colourable shall be disregarded. In our view a manufacturer should be able to ascertain with a reasonable degree of certainty whether he is free to manufacture an article or not. The existence of the problem of uncertainty has been forcibly brought to our notice by certain comparatively recent cases in the United Kingdom, and several people drew our attention to the problem during public sittings of the Committee.
The major subjects dealt with in the report of the Franki Committee have been, firstly, the definition of design and the treatment to be accorded to functional features; and secondly, the requirements for registrability of a design, the extent of protection afforded by the expression 'fraudulent imitation' and the protection if any under the Copyright Act which designs applied to industrialised articles should enjoy. This is often referred to as dual protection.
There is an important addition to the Act in proposed new section 18, which is found in clause 11 of the Bill. It states:
An application for registration of a design shall not be refused, and a registered design is not invalid, by reason only that the design consists of, or includes, features of shape or configuration that serve, or serve only, a functional purpose.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be diverted to hear that this amendment comes out of a decision of the English Court of Appeal in what is known as the rocking horse case. There was a shifting of one rocking horse from one base to another. It was held that nevertheless it was appropriate for it to be covered by the design legislation, despite the change of base.
I turn with mild relief to the Patents Amendment Bill 1981, which amends the Patents Act 1952. Its main aim is to amend section 160 of the 1952 Act to provide for extensions of time to be granted where there is a failure to file within the 12 months priority period which is described by international Convention. This, it is hoped, will cover situations such as the disruption of mail by airline strikes or by the mail hold-ups such as the legendary delays at the Redfern Mail Exchange.
The issue of absolute priority in granting patent rights is an extremely important subject. I draw the attention of the House to an article in the Scientific American for January 198 I, by David A. Hounshell, entitled 'Two Paths to the Telephone'. It records the extraordinary coincidence,

something which abounds in the history of invention, where virtually identical inventions of enormous significance were filed in the patent office on the same day. I refer, of course, to the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray both submitted the telephone-that invention which has had such an enormous impact on us all and made the life of politicians miserable-within hours of each other on 11 February 1876.
Mr Bradfield-Was it the same office?
Mr BARRY JONES-Yes, the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. That case can indicate more dramatically than anything else, I think, the enormous significance there is in obtaining a priority in patenting. The name of Alexander Graham Bel I has been immortalised and the name of Elisha Gray is one of those extraordinary historical might-have-beens-a character who has been virtually forgotten and pushed to the sideline, like members of the Australian Democrats.
There is another point about patents that I want to draw to the attention of the House. Patent protection has been enormously significant in encouraging the development of invention. The classic case, which is often mentioned and worth repeating, is that of penicillin. When Sir Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 he thought it would be of some significance to the world, but declined to patent it; he thought it should be available to all without cost. He did not want to benefit financially; he thought it better that penicillin be given freely to the people of the world. Because it was not patented, absolutely no interest was shown in the commercial development of penicillin throughout the 1930s. There were a few minor experiments conducted with it but it was only after it was patented during the Second World War that there was a serious interest in the exploitation-I do not use that word in its pejorative sense-of penicillin. It has been asserted that since the Second World War penicillin has saved more lives than were destroyed in that war. It has had an extraodinary impact on the world since 1944, when it became available in large commercial quantities. Whilst I am not an unqualified supporter of the pharmaceutical industry, I am very conscience of the significance of patent law and the importance of securing adequate rewards for people who develop new processes.
I draw the attention of the House also to probably the most important recent case on patent law, Chakrabarty'S case in the United States. Its full name is Sidney A. Diamond, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Petitioner v. Ananda M.

Designs Amendment Bill

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1711

Chakrabarty et al. The citation is the United States Surpreme Court Reports 65 L Ed 2d~that is, the second edition~ 144, 100 S Ct. This is a terrible system of citation and much more complex than ours. The case was decided on 16 June 1980. The summary of the case note reads:
Decision: Live, human-made micro-organism, held patentable . . .
SUMMARY A microbiologist filed a patent application relating to his invention of human-made, genetically engineered bacteria capable of breaking down multiple components of crude oil, a capability possessed by no naturally occurring bacteria. A patent examiner rejected the microbiologist's patent claim, ruling, among other things, that the bacteria, as living things, were not patentable subject matter under 35 USCS § 101, which provides for the issuance of a patent to a person who invents or discovers 'any' new and useful 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter.' The United States Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals affirmed, but the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals ultimately reversed, holding that the fact that micro-organisms are alive is without legal significance for purposes of the patent law (596 F2d 952).
On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. In the opinion by BURGER, Ch. J., joined by STEWART, BLACKMUN, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., it was held that a live, human-made micro-organism is patentable subject matter under 35 USCS § 101, such a micro-organism constituting a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' within themeaningof§ 101.
Under Australian law it seems certain that the capacity to patent micro-organisms or other living things already exists. It has always been the practice under Australian law to allow for the patenting of hybridisation of plants or breeding of animals. It is true that many people do not avail themselves of the protection of the law. Nevertheless, it has been the practice of the Australian Patent Office to accept such patents. All the Office asks is that there is an element of originality in what is actually done, that it has some commercial significance, that it is essentially new and that it is capable of replication. If those criteria are present then it is possible to patent things relating to the creation and the development of life forms.
That opens the door to the biotechnology industry, about which my colleagues have heard me utter one or two words in the last few weeks. I hope that it will be possible before long for the House to have some understanding not just of the legal significance of biotechnology vis-a-vis the patent law, and also that it will be possible for us to understand and investigate through a parliamentary select committee what the long term significance is, including the ethical issues such as the implication of cloning, aging and genetic engineering. Section 160 of the Patents Act 1952 is amended to provide a new sub-section (3) as follows:

(3) The time for the doing of an act or the taking of a step may be extended under sub-section (I) or (2) for a further period although-
(a) that time has expired; (b) that time has previously been extended under this sec-
tion or another provision of this Act; (c) the act or step is in relation to a patent application that
has lapsed; or (d) that further period has expired.
(3A) In determining whether to grant an application under sub-section (2), the Commissioner shall have regard to-
(a) the nature of the error, omission or circumstances, as the case requires, upon which the application is founded;
(b) the reason for that error or omission or those circumstances, as the case requires;
(c) the time at which the application under sub-section (2) was made;
(d) the length of period for which the extension is sought; and
(e) such other matters as he considers relevant.
The amending Bill goes on under a further proposed sub-section (3) to state:
(3) A person who made application under section 160 of the Principal Act before the commencement of this section for an extension of the time within which to do an act or take a step, being an application that was refused before, or is refused after, the commencement of this section, shall not, by reason only of the making or refusal of that application, be prevented from making a further application under any provision of the Principal Act as amended by this Act for an extension of the time within which to do that act or take that step.
1 now turn to the third of the Bills being debated, which is the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 1981. This amending Bill is based on the parent Act, the Trade Marks Act 1955. I must confess that I find myself less happy with this Bill than with the others. Essentially it is are-writing, and I think an extraordinarily cumbersome rewriting, of section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955. It follows a report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. I was fascinated to count that the original section 103 of the principal Act runs to 31 lines. The amendment runs to 260 lines and Tcannot for the life of me think that those 260 lines represent an improvement. I think it is one of the most abominable pieces of drafting that I have ever read. I am glad that the team that drafted this legislation was not given the task of drafting the Lord's Prayer, the Gettysburg Address or the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. It is a very bad piece of drafting. It intends to amend the provisions of the Trade Marks Act in respect of prohibiting the importation of goods and, if applicable, services bearing a registered trade mark. This Bill has also been considered by a committee as has the Designs Amendment Bill which went through the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. The Trade Marks Amendment Bill also went through a committee under the chairmanship of John Stonier. On page 39 of its report that

1712 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

committee sets out a whole series of recommendations, I think quite elegantly, in five paragraphs. To save the time of the House I ask leave to incorporate that page in Hansard. These recommendations set out what the committee thought should be done to section 103.

Leave granted..

The document read as follows-

PART III: RECOMMENDATIONS
In the light of what is set out above this Committee makes the following recommendations-

3.1 The provisions for seizure and forfeiture of goods under Section 103 should be confined to goods the importation of which infringes a trade mark registered in respect of those goods.

3.2 The entitlement of the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark to invoke Section 103 by notice in writing to the Comptroller-General of Customs should be continued and should be available to every such person, whether or not he is a manufacturer, dealer, or trader in Australia.

3.3 A similar entitlement should be available to a registered user of a registered trade mark where he has called upon the registered proprietor to give such a notice and the registered proprietor has refused or neglected to do so within two months after being so called upon, but not in any other circumstances. In cases of this kind, the registered user's notice shal1 cease to have effect (except with respect to already seized goods) upon a Section 103 notice subsequently being given by the registered proprietor.

3.4 The seizure machinery under Section 103 should be operative on the basis of a general notice of objection establishing to the satisfaction of the Comprol1er-General of Customs the identity of the trade mark as a registered trade mark and of the person lodging the notice as the registered proprietor (or a registered user who is entitled to give such a notice in accordance with 3.3 above).

3.5 The procedures which are available and apply fcil1owing the seizure of any goods pursuant to a notice of objection given under Section 103 should be as set out in paragraphs 2.41 to 2.54 (inclusive) of this Report.

Industrial Property Advisory Committee 7 October 1980

J.STONIER Chairman

Mr BARRY JONES-I thank the House. There are five parts to the original section 103. Of those five parts 103 (1) is found in proposed new sub-section (3), 103 (2) is found in proposed new sub-section (11 ) - -

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr MilIar)- Order! The Chair is reluctant to interrupt the honourable member but the Chair, in turn, would be derelict if it did not draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that we are addressing this Bill in the second reading debate. Therefore, he should refer to the general provisions of the Bill and not to matters of a detailed clausal nature.

Mr BARRY JONES--The point I want to make is that I find that in this nine-page Bill, section 103 occupies six of those pages. In fact, the whole substance of the Bill concerns one section.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member is perfectly free to make that observation.

Mr BARRY JONES-I do make that observation. The Bill is an extraordinarily cumbersome piece of work. The intention of the Bill is to try to make the law somewhat more flexible concerning the importation into Australia of goods which bear an Australian trade mark and which, in fact, have been made overseas by Australian companies. As we know, in the last few years under the deplorable policies of the Fraser Government many Australian firms have moved off-shore-possibly 600. So it would not be too surprising if we saw a product coming in which bore, for instance, a Dunlop Australia Ltd trade mark but which was known to have come all the way from Indonesia or somewhere else in South East Asia. It would be understandable if there were some confusion.

The new Bill provides that, where goods have been seized. the Comptroller-General of Customs gives the owner of the goods an opportunity to object and to explain the circumstances under which the goods have been seized. If the person who is the true owner of the trade mark objects and gives notice to the Comptroller-General of Customs that he will institute proceedings, the goods can be held. If the true owner does not so proceed, then the Comptroller-General may exercise his discretion and release the goods. Proposed new sub-section (12)-a very important subsection-of proposed new section 103 states:

The Comptroller-General of Customs shall release goods seized . . . to the owner on the expiration of the period of one month after the giving of a notice . . . to the objector or the objectors unless an objector has, before the expiration of that period-

(a) instituted an action or proceeding for infringement of the relevant trade mark in respect of the goods; and
(b) given notice in writing to the Comptrol1er-General stating that that action or proceeding has been instituted.
In other words, the obligation is on the proposed objector. If the proposed objector does not seek to enforce his own rights in the court there is no reason why the Comptroller-General should have to carry the bag for him. So it is a matter of putting responsibility where, I think, it should properly lie. Another provision states:

Without limiting the relief that a court may grant apart

(a) may, at any time, if it thinks just, make an order, subject to such terms . . . as the court thinks
fit . . .
I draw the attention of the House to the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). I am sorry that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is at the table at the moment because I raised this matter personally with the Minister for Science and Technology. I thought that the Minister was given a bum steer in his second reading speech. The main argument that is put in the speech--it is put twice-concerns the common law remedy known as 'passing off'. I point out to the House that there is no such thing in common law as a remedy called 'passing off'. Passing off is the offence. There is a remedy in common law against passing off. One cannot describe passing off as a defence. I find it extraordinary-perhaps not so very extraordinary considering how badly drafted the Bill is-- that material has been fed to a Minister of the Crown which shows a complete misunderstanding of the nature of a Bill. At common law there is an offence of passing off. But if a plaintiff wanted to secure damages as a result of such an action he would have to prove that his products were identified with the trade mark. He would have to prove that he was going to suffer some loss and prove somebody else was holding himself out as a rightful user of the trade mark when he did not have the right to do so. The legislation means that instead of going through that procedure, which I agree is somewhat cumbersome, it would be possible for this to be handled administratively.
On the whole, I am not terribly keen about procedures whereby things are taken away from the courts and handled bureaucratically within an administrative system. I think, in this case, it has the merit of common sense. In the circumstances and to the extent that we are able to understand what the Bill actually means, we propose to let it go through. It ought to go back to someone else who could have another look at it and perhaps between here and the other place it could undergo some redrafting. I understand the Senate is doing a lot of redrafting in another matter which is now before that chamber. I do not see why this Bill should not join the queue.
Mr BRADFIELD (Barton) (4.38)-It is my pleasure to follow the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in this debate. He is very knowledgeable, particularly on matters of history. I have certainly enjoyed his running through some of the historic events associated with these amending Bills. In fact, there are certain historic reasons why these Bills are before the House today. Because of the expansion and the rapid

advancement in technology since the turn of this century Bills associated with design, patents and trade marks are necessary. J will come to that matter later.
When we look at the oldest of the Acts concerned, the Design Act 1906-1 know it has been amended since 1906-it shows why Bills such as these became necessary at the turn of the century. Business has now become more international and has expanded to a great extent. There are greater complexities in deciding who owns designs and who owns patents and who is able to obtain designs and who is able to obtain patents. Of course, the Bill dealing with trade marks is necessary to protect the rights of people who design and manufacture goods. We have a very international situation in business today. That situation will become even more international. Therefore the Bills and the protection that they will afford to various people will become more important. Of course, there is a strong relationship between the Designs Amendment Bill and the Patents Amendment Bill because they both protect inventors, designers, manufacturers and the people to whom inventions and designs have been assigned. These Bills will give significantly greater protection to the consumer. J think we in this Parliament will have to give more time to the question of protecting the consumer, the people who need protection in these complicated situations.
I would like to devote most of my time to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill. Strangely enough, this is the Bill that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said that he was least happy about. Yet this Bill can give a great deal of protection to the Australian consumer. The Trade Marks Act, which this Bill seeks to amend, is a tool which has been used by many Australian manufacturers to stop imported goods being made available to the Australian consumer. At times goods can be brought in at a price cheaper than that of the same product manufactured in Australia. Yet, the imported goods are of the same quality and bear the same name as the goods manufactured in Australia. Often the legislation has been used by Australian companies to protect their monopoly situation in Australia from overseas companies which belong to the same international group as the Australian companies. It is for this reason that I offer my congratulations to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) for at last bringing this Bill into the Parliament. I intend to give some recent instances of where the Trade Marks Act has been abused.
Mr Barry Jones-What do you think about the drafting of it?

pertise than mine. I am more interested in the practical application of the Bill. Regardless of whether the drafting is lengthy or not I am sure for practical purposes the Bill can certainly do the job for which it was designed. Like the honourable member for Lalor, I must refer to section 103 of the Trade Marks Act simply because this is the main section of that legislation with which this Bill deals. Indeed, basically the whole of this Bill is concerned with section 103. That section, of course, deals with the importation of goods bearing trade marks. It deals with the protection that is afforded to the Australian manufacturer the name of whose product is registered in Australia and bears the same name as an imported product.

I would like briefly to congratulate the Minister for introducing this legislation. I think the Australian consumer will benefit considerably from the protection afforded the Bills. I think the legislation can only be of advantage for Australian industry. I support the three Bills introduced by the Minister. They are complicated Bills but they are very necessary. They are necessary in particular because they will keep business in Australia competitive and protect the Australian consumer.
Mr HOWE (Batman) (4.47)-1 must say that when I agreed to speak in this debate J thought we would also be discussing a fourth Bill which is associated with the three Bills before the House-- the Industrial Research and Development Incen-

I would like to give a few instances of how the legislation has been used. I would like to refer to the motor tyre industry as an example of the way in which goods have been protected or kept from the Australian consumer. Before I was elected to this place I happened to be employed in that industry. I know of many instances in which high quality imported tyres bearing the same name as the Australian manufactured product were all of a sudden seized on the wharf. The Australian manufacturer, using the trade marks legislation, had the goods seized. The imported goods were of high quality and usually available at a cheaper price to the Australian consumer. That is probably the reason they were purchased overseas in the first place. Yet, the consumer has been denied a quality product which has a price advantage over the Australian product. The Australian business which chose to import the goods has been financially disadvantaged because the goods were seized. As a result the Australian manufacturer of

tives Amendment Bill. I understand that that is not the case. Therefore I shall confine my remarks to the three Bills which have been referred to by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and other speakers. The legislation, which obviously goes to particular questions of industrial design, patents and trade marks, is of some importance because it touches on the question of industrial innovation and technology and the need to provide appropriate protection for people, particularly in relation to design and patenting for innovation and changes that might be brought about. The honourable member for Lalor 'spoke about the importance of looking at this legislation within a national context and the need to protect Australian industrial design and Australian patents against what clearly is a highly competitive situation internationally. Very often companies and designers in Australia are not able and have not been able to achieve that protection within the parameters of existing legislation.

The two areas around which it has been suggested that the Australian economy ought to be restructured, and in which it has a comparative economic advantage, are the areas of resource development and the development of high technology industries. It is that second category which is more relevant to this legislation. It is of concern to me that historically we have not been able to develop technology in this country for a number of reasons, some of which are related to the systems of protection which exist, including the extent to which a technology development in Australia can be protected against international competition. To some extent these Bills deal with legal matters related to that. As I suggested, one cannot separate the legalities of a situation from economic policy, market forces and property relations. Property relations are not simply a matter of trade marks-not simply a matter of the registration of a design. They also involve access to capital and the way in which capital may be integrated internationally. I think the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) referred to the way companies were able to operate through their

the health area to maintain the high quality services we have all come to expect. Clearly, if this level of quality is to be maintained, given priorities in other areas, every effort must be made to ensure that the resources allocated to the health area are used in an efficient and cost effective way. It is not an exaggeration to state that the health care delivery system could become a bottomless pit down which an ever increasing proportion of the gross domestic product could be poured without any real increase in the health standards of Australians. All of us, whether we be providers or recipients of health care, should be conscious of the cost of health services. For example, health professionals should become aware of the high cost of some individual services that they provide or seek access to when simpler procedures would be as effective. Equally individuals should become aware of the cost of the services they use by contributing to the cost of such services. Those responsible for the operation of health institutions must also be fully responsible for ensuring that they provide services on the most efficient basis possible.

Health Care Services

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1717

. . . the Cost-Sharing Agreements have rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient and have perpetuated rather than solved some of the main problems in Australia's health system.
I should point out also that even in those States which have made attempts to remove waste and inefficiency, there is still much more work to be done. Today, the members of the community cannot be expected continually to support, by way of taxation and their own personal expenditures, any wasteful and inefficient public hospital systems in Australia. In the face of the evidence produced by Jamison and earlier inquiries, failure by the Commonwealth to ensure that efficiencies are effected would mean that it would be abrogating its proper responsibilities. The Commonwealth cannot stand on the sidelines and see taxpayers and health fund members bearing increasing costs because of inefficiencies, inequities, and unnecessary duplication in public hospitals. On the basis of its criticisms of the cost-sharing agreements the Commission of Inquiry recommended that the agreements due to expire should not be renewed. The Governmen t has accepted that recommendation.
In its consideration of the funding arrangements that should replace the existing hospital cost-sharing agreements the Commission found that a major factor behind such inefficiencies was the divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and States. The Commission therefore recommended that the States should be required to take up their full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health care services. The Commission also recommended that the level of Commonwealth funding for the States' health services should be altered so that the amount of funds provided was based more closely on States' needs-as determined by their respective populations and taking into account recognised measures of efficiency. The Commission recognised also that there was a need for States to be able to use health funds provided by the Commonwealth for priority areas in their health service system rather than be confined to narrow program type funding.
The Government has been considering a range of options aimed at overcoming the problems highlighted by the Commission in this vital area. It agreed with the Commission that the responsibility of the States should be more clearly defined and that they should be required to take up their full responsibilities for the provision of health services. It also agrees that a new method for determining funding levels should be introduced. In reaching this decision the Government has been

mindful of the warning of the Commission of Inquiry that one should hasten slowly. Quite clearly in a situation involving hospitals where there is a large capital investment and where some communities have become used to facilities or services-even when they are not neededdramatic changes cannot be made overnight. The Jamison report stated:
. . . sharp, sweeping changes can be disruptive and impractical . . . Much can be gained from continual small measures, rather than from sweeping structural change.
The Government has therefore decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme should be included in general revenue grants. This will afford the States the greatest possible freedom as to how the moneys to be allocated are spent. There will be no requirements laid down as to the services to which they should be allocated. The States will be totally responsible for making such decisions. Further, the Government has decided that, at least for the initial period of the new arrangements, the amount to be included in the general tax sharing arrangement should be identifiable as representing the Commonwealth's contribution to the cost of the health services provided by the States.
In view of the importance of ensuring that funds for health services allocated to the States are appropriately based, the Government has also decided that the determination of an appropriate mechanism for allocating funds between States in the longer term should be referred to the Grants Commission. The Commission will be asked to look specifically at relativities between States and to design incentives for States to correct inefficiencies in their health systems. The Commonwealth firmly believes that the peoples of each State will, as taxpayers, fully support the Government's decisions since the proposed measures are designed to ensure the maintenance of the high quality of health care delivery systems in Australia while protecting the position of all taxpayers by ensuring that the greatest value possible is received for each dollar spent on health services provided by the States.
I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Commonwealth has decided that the position of eligible pensioners and their dependants should be protected at all times under the proposed funding arrangements. The Commonwealth will continue to meet this responsibility in the hospitals area by requiring States to provide free public hospital accommodation and treatment for such pensioners. The Commonwealth will also ensure that free hospital services will continue to be provided to the disadvantaged. The Government will consult

assistance under this scheme. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement of the main details of the new arrangements to apply in this area.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows-
SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH
Definition of the Disadvantaged
Under the Commonwealth definition of the disadvantaged the following would be included:
Migrants and refugees in the first six months in Australia-(no income test);
Current unemployment and special beneficiaries (including dependants) with private incomes below the PHB limits.
This group would not become PHB 'pensioners' and would not qualify for other Commonwealth 'fringe benefits';
A married couple who have a joint income less than the cut-out point for unemployment benefits for a married couple (rounded up to the next whole dollar) plus $20 and twice the rate of additional benefit for each child. On this basis the income limit is $160 a week for a married couple plus $20 for each child.
For a sole parent, with one child, the income limit will be the same as for a married couple. For each additional child, the limit will increase by $20.
For single people, without dependants, the income limit will be 60 per cent of the income for a married couple i.e. $96 per week.
Overall approximately I million persons are expected to be covered by the new arrangements.
Mr MacKELLAR-Honourable members will be aware that the assistance provided by the Commonwealth to help cover the hospital and medical bills of eligible pensioners is considerable. The cost of such assistance on the medical side alone is now running at $300m annually. Despite this the Government believes that further assistance should be given to protect the aged and chronically ill in relation to the cost of nursing home care. It has therefore decided that it will take over full responsibility for the payment of nursing home benefits from 1 September 1981. At present the Commonwealth pays nursing home benefits only for uninsured persons.
The estimated cost of this decision is $120m annually. This is expected to take the Commonwealth assistance to nursing home patients to about $560m in a full year.
The Government has also decided to increase its assistance for the aged and the chronically ill through greater support for organisations providing home nursing services. The Government believes that such services increase the quality of life of people receiving them and help contain costs by keeping people out of institutions when there is no medical reason for them to be there. As honourable members may be aware, a number of

home nursing services have expressed concern at the restriction imposed in 1976 on the number of nurses the Commonwealth will subsidise under the Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme. Recognising the important work carried out by these organisations, the Government has decided that this restriction on the number of nurses subsidised by the Commonwealth should be lifted as from 1 July next. The immediate effect of this will be that additional Commonwealth subsidies will be paid in respect of about 195 nurses. The estimated full year cost of this decision is $lm.
Health Insurance
As I stated at the outset, the Government "believes that health insurance should be available to all Australians at a reasonable cost and should have a wide coverage of the population in order to support the community rating principle. Regrettably, the combination of free public hospitals to all people irrespective of their incomes and the existing Commonwealth medical benefit arrangements has resulted in a gradual erosion of health fund membership and, as a result, of the community rating principle. If this trend were to continue it could threaten the Government's health insurance policy, the viability of the health funds and the position of those dependent on insurance-taking special account of the aged, the chronically ill and families with children.
In order to arrest that trend and bring about an increase in the numbers of people insured the Government has decided that the following major changes should be made to the present health insurance arrangements: Firstly, tax rebate separate from the existing concessional rebate arrangements will be introduced for the cost of basic hospital and medical insurance with registered health funds with effect from I July 1981. The rebate will be set initially at 32 cents in the dollar. Full details of this decision are to be announced by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) later today. Secondly, Commonwealth medical benefits will be restricted to those people with at least basic medical cover with a registered health fund. Thirdly, a flat rate Commonwealth medical benefit of 30 per cent will apply to all scheduled medical services and the existing 0-$20 arrangements will be abolished. Fourthly, the Government's payment to assist health funds to help cover the hospital costs of the chronically ill will be set at $100m. Fifthly, the basic level of medical insurance will be increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the schedule fee with a maximum payment of $10 per service and, sixthly, current insurance tables classed as optional to basic will be prohibited. Unless

The Control of Health Services Costs

In addition the Government has decided that it should enter into urgent discussions with the health funds to establish a mechanism to protect members of registered health funds in the event of the collapse of such a fund. The Government is concerned to ensure that health fund members are not financially disadvantaged should any funds cease operation. However it would expect that such a mechanism would be fully financed by the health insurance industry.

As I stated at the outset, the Government is keen to ensure that health services are not unnecessarily requested by consumers or ordered by providers and that abuses do not occur. As part of this the Government has been carrying out an ongoing review of the Commonwealth medical benefits arrangements for some years now to ensure that benefits are paid only where services are reasonably required for medical treatment and to prevent abuse.

administration of hospital systems is primarily a matter for the States.
Conclusion The overriding aim of the Government's health policy is that all Australians should have access to high quality health care. At the same time, individuals should be encouraged to be more responsible for their health care needs. The system must be equitable, paying particular attention to the capacity of individuals to contribute towards their health costs. But it is also important that all governments ensure that the high costs involved in maintaining that system do not cripple the general community. The Government's health policy, therefore, should also be responsible, providing adequate checks and balances to prevent abuses. The decisions T have speIt out today will ensure that both these objectives are met through special assistance to help cover the hospital and medical costs of those in genuine need; ensuring that those who are in a position to do so should contribute towards the cost of the health services they receive; the promotion of insurance for those providing such a contribution through subsidy arrangements financed through the adoption of health service funding arrangements designed to minimise waste and inefficiency in costly institutions; and acting to ensure that consumers and providers of hospital and medical services do not abuse the health care delivery system. I commend the statement to the House. I present the followingpaper:

widely welcomed and will, it believes, be of particular benefit for Australian families. In considering the introduction of this new concession the Government has given very great thought to the question of tax indexation.
As indicated in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of September 1980 the existing policy of half-tax indexation will provide taxation reductions of about $500m in a full year commencing in July next. As honourable members will be aware, there are significant arguments for and against tax indexation and 1 shall not weary the House today by canvassing all of those arguments. it is true, as members of the Government have frequently stated in the past, that tax indexation does oblige governments to legislate tax increases and, to that extent, has been a discipline. It could equally be said, however, that to the extent to which either expenditures or revenues are automatically indexed, the Budget flexibility available to a government to respond to changed economic circumstances is thereby reduced.
The Government has now decided that discretionary adjustments to taxation scales and allowances are preferable to tax indexation. However, the Government is conscious of the precise terms of what was said in the Prime Minister's policy speech and accordingly 1 confirm that halftax indexation will apply from J July next, thus providing in full the benefit of some $500m foreshadowed in that speech. However, that tax indexation adjustment will be the last indexation adjustment. Future taxation adjustments will be determined-usually in the Budget context-on a discretionary basis and in accordance with economic considerations.

TAXATION-HEALTH INSURANCE REBATE AND INDEXATION Ministerial Statement
Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Treasurer)-by leave-As my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) has just informed the House, the Government has decided to introduce a new concessional rebate for health insurance contributions. My colleague has explained the nature of this new concessional rebate, which will be rebatable outside the $1,590 rebate block at the standard rate which is presently 32 per cent. I emphasise that the tax savings from this new concession will not depend on a taxpayer's total rebatable expenditure exceeding $1,590.
The Government believes the introduction of a concessional rebate for health insurance will be

As with similar rebates in respect of special categories of expenditure the medical insurance rebate will generally speaking be received on assessment. As a consequence, the revenue impact of introducing this new concession will be negligible in 1981-82. The full-year cost of the new concessional rebate for health insurance will be in the order of $600m. Legislation providing for the half-tax indexation adjustment will be introduced into the House later this session. I shall also, at a later date, be providing details of the half indexation factor to apply in respect of 1981-82 and details of the impact of half-tax indexation on taxation scales in that year. I present the following paper:

That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Bonython speaking for a period not exceeding 30 minutes.
Dr BLEWETT (Bonython) (5.27)-1 want to place the two statements that have been made today in the background of the last 18 months of indecision in the field of health. In a sense tonight's decisions flow from the problems of that accumulating indecision. These problems flow from 18 months in which no decisions of any significance in the health field have been made despite considerable disquiet amongst most health care organisations. Throughout 1980 we were assured that no decisions could be made because the Government was waiting on the Jamison report. Certainly the Government displayed great impatience to get the Jamison report, compelling the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals to report prior to effective completion of that report. There is the pathetic note in Volume 2 of the report:
Because of time constraint for the presentation of the Report imposed in the Letters Patent, this Volume is not in a form as refined as the Commission otherwise would have arranged. Detailed editing and normal proof reading have not been possible.
Anyone who has read that massive document knows of its state of incompletion and knows that there was not an opportunity to finish it off as the commissioners would have preferred. The Government was impatient to get that report in December 1980. But has displayed no impatience whatsoever in the past four months. It has had that report now for four months. We know that it

has caused deep internal divisions within the Government. We gather that the manic obsession of one man to get his own way within the Cabinet has led to conflicts between him and his Minister for Health of which I shall give examples in a moment. Of course, it has been climaxed by this afternoon's confusion because this statement has been put off again and again as the Minister's office tried to put together all those last minute pieces of paper reflecting last minute revisions in the document.
The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) told us in his statement concerning the Jamison report:
I believe that the Commission's report has provided a sound basis on which to develop an equitable and responsible health policy.
Anybody who has read the Jamison report knows that the statements that have just been made derive not at all from the Jamison report. Indeed the Government has deliberately ignored the major findings of the report in the two major decisions that the Government has made. In this gobbledegook-that is what the first half dozen of these pages are-the Minister has assured us that that report has provided a sound basis for his policy. Let me just take the two major examples. Jamison opposed the absorption of hospital costs into general revenue grants to the States. Yet the Government has ignored him. Let us see what the Liberal Minister for Health, Mr Borthwick, in Victoria-he is no friend of the Australian Labor Party-had to say about the way the Jamison report has been used by this Government. Let me quote from a statement published in the Age on 14 April 1981. It states:
He said it suggested that Mr MacKellar had used the Jamison inquiry into hospitals, released in January, "as a cynical exercise and not as a genuine method of arriving at more efficient and equitable means ofhealth funding".
And this is the important point:
"The Jamison inquiry was a joint exercise between the Commonwealth and the States aimed at finding a rational basis for the funding of health services. Your Government's proposal to make critical decisions in this area without consulting the States is outrageous," . . .
The important point is that the Jamison committee was a joint committee. Its terms of reference 'were provided by the States and the Commonwealth to find an agreed and rational policy on hospitals. Yet this Government has rejected the major finding of the Jamison report on hospitals.
Secondly, regarding health insurance, even the Jamison committee, during its discussions on all the reactionary alternatives that it could find, did not contemplate a general deductibility health insurance scheme, but the Government has opted for one. Let me make it quite clear where this

Health Care Services

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1723

Government stands in relation to Jamison. It has ignored the major recommendation in relation to hospitals. The proposal which the Government has come up with in relation to health insurance was not discussed by the Committee.
Let me outline what-the Minister has done in relation to hospitals. His general assumption is stated thus:
The Government has therefore decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme should be included in general revenue grants.
That proposal has been opposed by Jamison. Let us look at what Jamison said about that proposal. He opposed the proposal on the following grounds:
The Commission's view is that the existence of some form of identified funding for health services has come to be generally accepted as a means of ensuring that a high standard of health care is available across State boundaries for the Australian population.
That was the basic reason. Because of a concern for a national hospital provision Jamison opposed the major proposal which the Government has made this afternoon. Of course, it is not just Jamison. Every major national health organisation is this country has opposed the proposal. Let me start with the Australian Medical Association. The AMA recommended:
The present Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing arrangements be replaced by special purpose grants rather than the absorption of the health budget into general purpose payments to the States. These special purpose grants are designed to maintain national health care standards.
So the AMA in its submissions to the Government quite clearly opposed what has been the major proposal today regarding hospitals. The Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia also opposed what has been the Government's major proposal. It said:
The proposal for absorbing hospital funding into the general revenue grants to the States would seem to have serious disadvantages. Without the Commonwealth placing conditions upon its hospital grants to States there would no longer be a national hospitals policy.
The Australian Hospital Association also opposed the proposal. It stated:
The AHA supports the end to the Cost-Sharing Agreement, but only when an adequate block grant formula is developed.
So there we have it. All the major national organisations oppose the proposal that has been introduced.
Mr Donald Cameron-Are you saying the States are stupid?
Dr BLEWETT-lam just discussing it. The Jamison committee also opposed the proposal but, even more interestingly, it appears that the Minister opposes the proposal that he introduced

this afternoon. In the Age on Friday, 27 February, the Minister is reported to have told a back bench committee of his own party something which has not been denied in the Age, even though the Minister has had some months in which to do so. Numerous other statements have confirmed his position. Let me quote the article at length. It states:
Mr MacKellar told Wednesday's back bench committee meeting that there needed to be a national approach to hospital care. If hospital grants were absorbed, a national approach would be destroyed, and standards and conditions would vary.
Mr Donald Cameron-Who wrote that? Dr BLEWETT-The honourable member can check with Michelle Grattan. The Minister is reported to have stated that a national approach to hospital care would be undermined if there were an absorption of grants. The statement has never been denied. So there we have the reported, undenied view of the Minister himself. Jamison and every major health organisation in the country is opposed to what has been announced today. Even the Minister seems to have doubts about his own policy. It is, of course, no doubt to be explained by what we were told in the House yesterday-that one man in the Government has an obsessive determination to get his own way despite the views of his Ministers and despite the views of most informed national providers of health care in this society. Those groups and the Minister for Health, I think, have very good reasons for the positions they took. Let me suggest some of the reasons why it is unwise and likely to be disastrous for this country to abandon a major Commonwealth input to priorities in relation to hospitals, the community health programs and school dental services. First of all, the point has been made in numerous statements that there should be a national provision. Surely, at the end of the twentieth century we should have advanced sufficiently far to have some notion that in the field of health there is a need for a national provision, a national overview, of hospitals and health services in this country. This is undermined by the decision that has just been made. Secondly, if one is concerned with efficiency in health services then surely the system of insurance or health cover, which is a Commonwealth responsibility, should also be linked with responsibility in relation to the hospitals themselves. As we know, at the moment many of the problems arising in the hospital sector are arising because of problems and faults in the health insurance system. Those two have to go together. For the Commonwealth Government to go on retaining the

1724 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Health Care Services

health cover system while handing back the responsibility for hospitals to the States is clearly to introduce inefficiencies into the system. This divorce between the responsibility for national health cover and responsibility in relation to hospitals will clearly lead to inefficiency. Let us admit quite clearly that there will have to be, however it is done, an interdependence in these responsibilities. But this Government is giving away major elements whereby the Commonwealth can make an effective contribution to an inevitable interdependence. As things are at this stage in this society, we will never get rid of Commonwealth involvement in the health field. But by these decisions, we are giving away a major way in which the Commonwealth can participate effectively in that inevitably interdependent relationship.
Again we see this interdependence in another weakness that has arisen. We will have the most complex administrative procedures to ensure that the Commonwealth will cover all those patients in public hospitals who are pension beneficiaries or disadvantaged persons. I am happy with some of the decisions that have been made in that field but, because of the division ofresponsibility, there will be the most horrendously complex system whereby the Commonwealth will meet its funding commitments to all those groups for hospitals which are now fully in the hands of the States.
Of course, the decision on absorption will also lead, quite clearly, to the ending of the free public hospital system in this country. No doubt some members on the other side of the House will be happy that the experiment in free public hospitals in this country has been brought to an end. Quite clearly, it is the intention of the Government to enforce, squeeze and compel the States to charge for in~patients-a proposal that was opposed by Jamison-and to charge for out-patients. There will be a deliberate squeezing on the hospitals. On the Minister's calculation, he hopes to squeeze back about $250m, which the States will have to make up in charges or, as some State Ministers are contemplating, covering costs by hospital levies and hospital taxes. The Government probably will get its dual taxation out of this, in a sense, by the back door. But if we look at the figures, making allowances for inflationary expectations, something like $250m will be squeezed out next year. That means that something like five million bed days will have to be paid for by people who do not pay for them at the moment. Two million of those bed days will be in Queensland because Queensland, as honourable members know, has one of the most developed public hospital systems in this country. So it is not surprising that State

Ministers are fairly critical of the way in which they are being squeezed by these policies. As I have suggested, it may not be just hospital charges that are affected; it is known that many of the States are looking to add hospital taxes and levies to the program.
Another consideration is that by putting the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme into the same grant, quite clearly the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme will be deeply disadvantaged. The reason they will be disadvantaged is because of the institutional demands of the hospitals. It is inevitable that the kinds of pressures under which the hospitals exist and the influence they will have with State governments will mean that those smaller and less institutionalised programs, such as the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme, will tend to go to the wall.
Mr Donald Cameron-The States will decide that.
Dr BLEWETT -But they will be forced to. If honourable members understand the sorts of pressures applied to the limited funds by high-cost institutions, such as hospitals, honourable members will see that the inevitable victims will be those weaker, smaller and much less institionalised services. Of course, that contradicts what the Minister says in other parts of his statement. At various parts of his statement the Minister made the point that he wants to encourage deinstitutionalisation. Yet the effect of this hospital decision will be to threaten the whole development of the Community Health Program and, I think, to undermine the position of the School Dental Scheme.
It is not surprising, therefore, that, the Minister for Health in Queensland-in another non-Labor State Government-has said:
It has been stated by the Commonwealth that the states will be forced to means test at public hospitals. This statement would indicate that the commonwealth has absolutely no idea of what's involved in the running and operation of a public hospital system.
Queensland, over a period of 35 years has exercised stringent, but successful, cost-containment measures in the administration of its public hospitals and this factor must be recognised by the Commonwealth Government in any new funding arrangement.
Of course, it is not recognised in the funding arrangements announced tonight.
One might also ask the Treasurer (Mr Howard) whether he has thought through the economic effects of these redecisions. If one examines reports from Canada and the United States of America it is clear that general revenue grants, compared with specific purpose grants,

development of health services in the country at this time. But the Canadian evidence shows quite clearly that under these general revenue grants current spending may be affected but that capital spending tends to go up.

Jamison asked a much narrower question which no doubt was conceived by the Government: What is the best way of propping up the private insurance industry in this country? The answer that he came up with was a series of sticks

People who have looked at these proposals have suggested that even .if it is intended to move to absorption into general revenue funds, clearly it should have been done over a number of years. If that were to be done, and if there were a commitment to some notion of gradual change and to making sure that the changes were deliberate and considered ones, then a timetable should be worked out for this move, rather than having a dramatic and dislocating move. I think honourable members will learn tomorrow and in the next week the kinds of dislocations that this move provides to the whole health scheme.

Secondly, the Government envisages the imposition of hospital charges. I do not quite know how some of these charges are to be imposed. The problems are pretty daunting and this was one of the reasons why Jamison refused to go along with such a proposal. We have seen some of the things that have happened recently in America in relation to the notion of injured and sick people turning up at hospitals and not being admitted until they have shown that they could pay for the treatment. This process is now being adopted in this country, except in relation to the very poor. I admit that the Government has made that special provision, although, as I said, it has quite horren-

charges will apply not only to in-patients but also to those people who have been using the outpatient services. A lot of private doctors have been very worried about this use of out-patient services because people have been flooding off to the hospitals. I do not deny that this causes problems in the hospitals, but I do not believe that imposing these sets of charges is the way in which to solve the problem.
By denying Commonwealth medical benefits to the uninsured and by imposing hospital charges, and possibly by means of other results of the Government's decision on hospitals, the Government hopes that people will be forced to insure. As I have said, I think it is very likely that the Community Health Program in the States will be completely undermined by the decision because of the effective institutional pressures of the hospitals. So again we will have another pressure forcing people towards insurance as a result of the demise of the community health centres. On the carrot side we have some classic carrots because the Government decided that it could not just beat people into private insurance; it had to provide some inducements as well. First of all there is the minimum inducement of increased basic cover: That is, instead of a 75 per cent return on insurance, 85 per cent of the standard fee will be returned and there will be a maximum contribution of only $10 per service. So there is an improvement from 75 per cent to 85 per cent so it will be somewhat more worthwhile to have insurance.
Of course the real carrot, the great and outstanding carrot, is to have a separate tax rebate of 32c in the dollar. This will cost some $600m. While the rebate system in itself is not individually regressive or individually unfair, in aggregate to the community, it is quite clearly regressive because of the pattern of insurance in this society, a pattern which will basically continue whatever these inducements and sticks. I think the Government will have some success but, I suggest, not very much success. If we look, for instance, at the present rates of medical insurance we find that only 52 per cent of people with gross weekly incomes of between $120 and $159 are insured. At the well off end of the scale people receiving gross weekly incomes of $300 and more, 83.5 per cent are insured. That means that the use of this rebate in aggregate across the community favours the rich as against the less well off. We will leave the really disadvantaged alone because there is a separate provision for them. But, this kind of rebate is a redistribution to the better off in aggregatethat is, in total across the community. We have a pattern of health insurance in this couJltry which

is now culturally entrenched and will not be much changed by these measures. There is a close correlation between one's income and whether one has insurance.
Mr Donald Cameron-What about the rebate? It is evenly applied.
Dr BLEWETT-;-I will deal with what the re~ bate does in a moment. I am glad the honourable member asked that question. Let me finish the point I was making. In this society there is a relationship between private health insurance and income. It is an almost perfect-but not quite perc fect-correlation. The higher one's income the more likely one is to be insured; the lower one's income the less likely one is to be insured. So this kind of tax rebate system is over the whole community regressive and inequitable.
Let me tackle the question that was asked by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron). The cost of this rebate amounts to $600m. One thought the Government was being generous. For one moment one thought that some strange shaft of lightning had hit this contemptible government. But we find the explanation for its actions if we look at the statement by the Treasurer. We now learn that half tax indexation will last merely for this year. The Prime Minister made a promise during the election campaign on half tax indexation adjustments. I said in the very first statement that I madein this House that with this Prime Minister we had to read the fine print of every pledge. If we read the fine print of the pledge made by the Prime Minister in September 1980 we will find that the reference to half tax indexation did refer to the next 12 months only. It was suggested-certainly the headlines suggested-that it was a much more extensive and generous promise. If we look at the fine print we will discover that it was to last for 12 months only. Now we are told it will apply for only 12 months because it involves almost exactly the same amount of money as this rebate scheme.
Half tax indexation is to disappear next year and the money involved will be taken up or covered by this rebate scheme. There has been a switch. We have been given the rebate and the half tax indexation has been taken away. The Government has not added at all to its commitment to the taxpayers of this society. It has simply done a con trick. It will go out tomorrow-the Minister is probably out already-talking about the Government's great generosity. But quite clearly it is a con trick because it has cancelled out what was a clear promise made by the Prime Minister which most people accepted would involve a pursuit of half indexation for at least the three

Health Care Services

29 April 198] REPRESENTATIVES 1727

years of this Parliament, whatever the actual fine print of the Prime Minister's pledge. But no. The money is needed in order to fund this rebate.
Let us go one step further to answer the question of the honourable member for Fadden. If we consider most of the implications of these changes we find that health insurance rates will have to go up. It is impossible for me to calculate tonight what the percentage of that rise will be. I will not suggest figures because it is difficult given that I have had the statement for only an hour and a half. Let there be no doubt that there will be a distinct increase in health contribution rates. The obvious reasons for that happening are that all hospital charges will go up and the medical rebate has been raised from 75 per cent to 85 per cent. There is no way of escaping an increase in contribution rates. When the whole exercise is finished we will probably find that with half-yearly indexation gone, and the increase in the contribution rates people will be even more disadvantaged than the proposal would appear to mean on
the surface.
What have these proposals achieved? They are primarily designed to benefit private hospitals, private insurance and the well off sector of the community and to provide a limited protection for the clearly disadvantaged. On the other hand the result of these proposals will deny effective free public hospital treatment to the people of this country. They are regressive and unfair across the great broad swath of income taxpayers. They have been proposed-as nearly every proposal has been proposed by this Government in the health field-not in pursuit of a better health care provision for this country but simply in terms of the limited financial vision of this Government. This is why the fifth Fraser health scheme will be as much a failure as the previous four.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jarman)- Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m.
Mr HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition) (8.0)-The health services arrangements which have been announced to the Parliament by the Government today are nothing more than a great medical confidence trick. They represent a snide strategy to promote the fortunes of private medicine, private hospitals and private health insurance organisations. The arrangements will be a bonanza for them. But the people who will have to pay will be not so much the poor people as the people who are not so well off in the community, who will be unable to insure themselves, who will take the risk of not insuring themselves and who

will therefore not have available to them the various forms of government subsidies and concessions announced tonight but who, nonetheless,
through the taxation system will subsidise these changes. The most miserable aspect of the proposals which have come before us is the shoddy way, the deceitful way, in which the Government has sought to shoot through the last rites on tax indexation on, believe it or not, a health insurance Bill.
I will go through a number of the objections which the Opposition has to these proposals. First, the proposals will set back health services
funding by more than a decade. They will take us back to the pre-1970s period when the community was expressing widespread dissatisfaction and anger at the deficiencies in the health insurance and health services arrangements. We will go back to the situation in which, because of the high cost of health insurance, the people who are less well off but who will miss out on the benefits of cover as pensioners or as disadvantaged persons
will play Russian roulette with their health, will face the risk of catastrophic health charges confronting them at some stage in their life. That is no ~xaggeration, that is not drawing a long bow; that IS a replay of the conditions which arose in Australia in that period before the introduction of the original Medibank program. The complexity of the arrangements will ensure, as did those circumstances applying to health insurance more than a decade ago up to the introduction of the original Medibank scheme, that particular groups will be massively disadvantaged by the new complex system-people such as migrants, who will not understand the processes.
I move to the more substantial objections that we have. Those I have mentioned are substantial enough, but these are the ones that outrage us. These proposals are a golden handshake for private medicine and private hospitals in this country. They are nothing more than an hydraulic lift to promote the fortunes of those groups. Let us look at what will happen with these changes. If the Government has its way, some two million people will be locked out of the public wards of public hospitals. Where will they go? Will they go to the private wards of public hospitals? More likely, as a result of certain changes I will mention in a minute, they will go to private hospitals. It means very simply that if they go to either of those sources of treatment private medicine will derive much greater profit. No wonder the Australian Medical Association tonight was trumpeting its
satisfaction with what the Government has done.
To the extent that people will be forced out of the private wards of public hospitals into private

tals a better proposition for many people. Again, there will be a generous increase in subsidies for private hospitals-a 75 per cent increase in the bed day costs of those private hospitals. That will make it more attractive to go to those places. That will pump up costs in an unbelievable way. It is bad medicine. It is bad health services planning. As the gentlemen from the Department of Health would well understand, it will do nothing to contain the increases in health services costs in this country. That is where the rip-off is taking place. As those gentlemen will understand, what it will do will be to promote the surgery mills, the playgrounds.9f the sporting surgeons in this country.
Mr Hodges-Rubbish.

We already have the Hospital Corporation of America moving, into Australia-a big multibillion dollar transnational health services corporation. It has been brought into several Australian hospitals so far. Of course, the director with his special skills was brought straight from Kentucky Fried Chicken in the southern states of the United States of America to become director of this health services organisation. It is a big money winner. That organisation is operating in Adelaide, among other places, with a $3.5m hospital with 68 beds and elaborate facilities. Of course, it charges like a wounded bull. It will be able to charge even more woundily as a result of the proposals because there will be more subsidies. The price of

ripping out clean organs to make profits for the hospitals and for the doctors using them. Let us look at conditions in Australia, at the extraordinarily high rate of elective surgery procedures undertaken. The Australian rate for tonsillectomies is about 20 per cent when the rate should be only about 6 per cent. Why? The reason is fee for service and the small private hospitals. It is profitable to perform them. The more they take out, the more they make. If we have too many doctors they will undertake too many procedures. An article by Paul Ormonde in the Melbourne Herald stated:

Nothing in the proposals attends to the problem of cost escalation. They will make public hospital private treatment much more expensive. On my calculations there will be an increase of at least $20 a day. The objective of the Government is to lift the charges from $50 for shared accommodation and $75 for single accommodation for private rooms in a public hospital to $150 a day or thereabouts. The average cost of a bed day is about $150. I repeat: The proposals will push up health insurance costs, they will allow private hospitals to push up their prices and they will push patients out into commercial medicine. They

and public hospitals, is very bad in terms of medical training in this country. It will mean that at teaching hospitals the range of medical experience available to undergraduates at our medical schools will be enormously limited and in consequence, their skills, their qualities and their abilities will be diminished. As I said, there will be a tremendous boost to private health insurance. Commonwealth medical benefits will be available only for those in funds. So much for the great freedom-loving Government which is opposite; so much for freedom of choice and individual rights. What the Government is doing is holding a gun at everyone's head and saying: 'Get into a fund or we will not give you a Commonwealth benefit even though you paid it with your taxes'. That is the most obnoxious part for me. The arrangement is going to punish those who pay their way but who pay their way without joining a fund. They will get no Commonwealth subsidy, but they are going to be told that they will have to subscribe to the cost of that arrangement.
There will be savage penalties imposed on States like Queensland. I will tell the House what is going to happen in Queensland. About one million bed days of public ward treatment will be either terminated to meet the demands of the Government or else met at the cost of the State Government of Queensland. An average additional cost of $70 a day will work out at $70m a year. That is the sort of penalty that this Government, which claims it is concerned about cooperation with the States, is going to impose on Queensland where we have had for more than four decades free hospitalisation which was introduced, I might add, by a socialist State government, but which has been preserved by a succession of governments regardless of their colour. The Government wants the standard of services in Queensland turned back by more than four decades. Let us see what the Liberal Party Health Minister in Queensland said tonight. A newspaper report states:
The Federal Government had brutally and deliberately set about wrecking the public hospital system, Queensland Health Minister Brian Austin said tonight . . .
The Queensland Government was now faced with its greatest crisis in health care since federation, he said in a Brisbane news release.
That is what the Government is trying to achieve. Its action will have devastating consequences on that State.
The retreat from any direct involvement in the provision of the nation's health services is inexcusable. One thing we sought to do in government was to provide not only universal cover with the original Medibank health insurance program but

also to involve ourselves co-operatively-that is, in support of the States-to provide improved community health services, improved public hospitals, the initiation and the development of community health centres and the provision of school dental health services. All these are vital areas, especially in the more needy suburbs and communities of this country. The funding is all going to be buried into general funding arrangements with the States. We know what is going to happen in the conservative States which give a much lower priority to the needs and the rights of people in this country. The promotion of improved quality and comprehensiveness, adequacy and satisfaction in those services will expire.
I mentioned that this will be a more costly program. The cost of health insurance is going to increase. The contribution rates of hospital insurance will increase by about 40 per cent. Medical insurance rates will increase by about 15 per cent. The increase will be about $2 a week. Of course, there will be some offsets with the tax rebate, but at best it will be of the order of SOc to 60c a week. It will not get one anything better than a one way trip on the Manly ferry, and I doubt that. In June contribution rates are to go up and probably this will eliminate any benefit. Certainly with other cost increases there will be disadvantages. I mentioned that it will be more costly. It will raise private hospital fees by $20 a day. The effects of the health insurance changes in one quarter will be to add half a per cent to the consumer price index. On top of that, hospital fees will add further to the consumer price index. It is a poorly thought out arrangement. [t is an arrangement which not only disadvantages people but also works quite contrary to the management of the economy as the Government declares its intent.
The Government will, in some respects, give a windfall gain to some States. For instance, if the Government is determined to destroy free public ward treatment against the wishes of the State the result will be that where the patient was fully cost shared between the Commonwealth and the State he will be pushed into private accommodation. It will mean that the States will pick up half of the contribution-half of the $50 a day or whatever it is at the moment. It will mean that the Commonwealth will have to meet 30 per cent of all the medical charges where before it was cost sharing. That is a much more unsatisfactory way. It will mean that the States will make savings because private medical practitioners are providing services for those patients.

1730 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Health Care Services

When we put all these things together, they are the ingredients of even more confusion, more dissatisfaction and clear evidence that the Government once again, with the latest in this long chain of changes to health insurance, has not thought through properly the implications of what it has put forward. The explanation is simple. The explanation is this: There has been, not uncharac, teristically within the ranks of the Government, a massive brawl as to exactly what the changes were to be. The Minister had been proposing that there ought to be block grants identified for health services purposes. (Extension of time granted). I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). The Prime Minister, in his well-established, obstinate way, was determined that the money should be absorbed in the general allocations to the States. The Prime Minister, after brawling last night and brawling this morning-they will all be punchdrunk the way they have been brawling latelywon out. The consequence is that we have those proposals before us. They will be as confusing and as unsatisfactory as have been all the other changes in the past.
I come to the tenth point I want to make, and that is the shockingly snide effort of the Government to try to slide through, in the course of the deliberation on health services and health financing Bills before the House, the termination of tax indexation. Taxpayers are going to be some $500m a year worse off. They are not losing full indexation,but they are going to lose half tax indexation. We all remember the promise of the Government in 1975. The Prime Minister in his policy speech said:

We will encourage people's initiative and enterprise, not batter them into the ground with punishing taxes.
He went on to say:
We will reduce the tax burden.
Further, he said:
We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years.
He added for good measure:
It will make government more honest with your money. They will no longer be able to rely on the secret tax increase of inflation.
Fancy anyone believing the Fraser Government would be more honest with one's money or honest with anything. Look at its record. What happened, of course, was that we got the warningthe Gold Coast by-election. The Prime Minister in a television interview on Channel 7 said:
I think one of the problems of full indexation is that! don't believe people understood it. I think the reductions in tax went passed almost unnoticed . . . you have to expect politicians to want people to understand that when they have reduced taxes, when the election comes around they will remember it . . . I think everyone had forgotten it by the time the election actually took place.
So that is the basis upon which the Government makes great decisions of principle. The consequence is that there will no longer be any tax indexation. The facts also are that we have never had full tax indexation in the history of this Government. It has been much, much less. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the effect on taxpayers of the elimination of any tax indexation at all.
Leave granted.
The table read as follows-

Mr HAYDEN-This is a totally unsatisfactory response to our national health services needs. It does nothing to contain costs; indeed it will aggravate those cost problems. It totally ignores the problem of excess doctor supply, excessive medical treatment initiated by private practitioners and the lack of control over private hospitals. It promotes private health insurance funds in spite of public dissatisfaction with them. Every second Australian believes private health insurance does not give benefit for money and two out of three

flatly oppose the present system. It will be much more expensive for the public, but the Government does not care. It is shifting most of that cost onto the shoulders of a long-suffering people.
This is the latest change to a seemingly endless chain of confusing alterations to health insurance in the past five years. We repudiate it. We will, in the near future, announce a new universal health system to replace this shoddy, patched-up arrangement that punishes people and promotes the

NATIONAL HEALTH (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS)
AMENDMENT BILL 1981
Bill presented by Mr MacKellar, and read a first time.
Second Reading
Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah-Minister for Health) (8.20)-1 move:-
That the Bill be now read a second time.
The Bill seeks to give effect to a decision of the Government to establish an independent tribunal to determine the remuneration to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Under present legislation, the rates of remuneration payable to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits are determined by the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrange ments. This Committee comprises four represen tatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and four Government representatives under an independent chairman. The framework within which the Joint Committee must operate has proven difficult in relation to the formulation of chemists' remuneration. There have been three inquiries into pharmacy earnings, costs and profits since 1964-65 and no agreement has been possible between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on the results of any of those inquiries. The Government believes that the most appropriate mechanism to overcome the existing problem is the establishment of a tribunal sitting in a public forum.
Honourable members will recall that during 1980 the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts conducted a detailed inquiry into the 'Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-Chemists Re muneration'. In its report tabled in this House on 17 September 1980, the Committee recom mended amongst other matters, that a tribunal be established to replace the existing Joint Committee. The Bill now before the House reflects the Government's acceptance of the parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendation on this particular matter. The Government currently has the other recommendations of that Committee under consideration.
The Government believes that there are a number of advantages to be gained by establishing a public tribunal. First, it will remove from the political arena the question of the level of fees

paid to chemists for the dispensing of pharmaceu tical benefits. Both the chemists and the Government will be bound by the tribunal's decisions. Secondly, it will provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case whilst ensuring that the levels of chemists' re muneration are determined by an independent body. Thirdly, it will remove the need for the Government to finance cumbersome and costly inquiries of the sort that have been conducted since 1964-65.
I inform honourable members that the results of the latest inquiry in 1977-78 were not accept able to the Pharmacy Guild and an interim settle ment was arrived at. Under that settlement there was to be a study of alternative methodologies for determining chemists' remuneration and a review of the level of remuneration to be completed by 1 July 1981. However within the existing frame work it has not been possible to reach agreement on methodology. I would draw honourable members' attention to clause 10 of the Bill, which provides that the Tribunal shall complete its first inquiry and hand down its findings and the reasons for them by 1 July 1981. I am aware that this will place a large workload on the Tribunal but I think that it is essential that the earlier promise to pharmaceutical chemists be kept.
The Bill provides that the tribunal is to consist of a chairman, appointed by the Governor General, and two other members appointed by the Minister for Health. The Bill also provides that the chairman is to be a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The other two members will necessarily be per sons who have business and accounting skills so that they can make a worthwhile contribution to the deliberations of the tribunal. Proposed new section 98BB does however allow the tribunal to continue to perform its functions in circumstances where one or both of the members other than the chairman have not been appointed. In order to ex pedite the first review, which as I have said must be completed by 1 July 1981, the tribunal in the first instance will be constituted only by the chair man. I can inform honourable members that the Government would be in a position to submit a name to the Governor-General for appointment as chairman as soon as the Act receives royal assent.
The function of the tribunal, as provided for in proposed new section 98B, is to determine the manner in which the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascer tained for the purpose of payment by the Government to approved chemists for the supply by them

It is proposed that the tribunal will decide the criteria that it considers appropriate in determining the fees or other amounts to be included in the Commonwealth price of pharmaceutical benefits. In deciding the criteria the tribunal shall take into account any principles determined by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being appropriate for fixation of award wages or salaries.

There are two other matters which I should mention. First, the Repatriation Act is also being amended to allow the tribunal to consider the level of chemists' remuneration for pharmaceuticals dispensed under the Repatriation Benefits Scheme. The second point is that the tribunal will be serviced by the Department of Administrative Services. This is consistent with that Department's present servicing role of the two existing independent tribunals established under the Remuneration Tribunals Act. Finally, I would draw honourable members' attention to the provision in clause 3 of the Bill which would amend the definition of British Pharmacopoeia. This amendment

That the Bill be now read a second time.
The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Repatriation Act 1920 in relation to pharmaceutical benefits and to reduce delays to certain applications for review by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. In the first instance, the proposed amendment will enable the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, that is to be established by the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1981, to determine the level of remuneration payable to pharmacists who dispense prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme currently administered under the medical treatment provisions of the Repatriation Act 1920. To achieve this, the Bill inserts a new section in the Repatriation Act 1920, section 109, which empowers the Minister formally to establish a Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to provide pharmaceutical benefits to persons eligible to receive medical treatment under the Repatriation Act and associated legislation.
The Bill empowers the Minister to request the proposed Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to extend its inquiry to include the level of remuneration payable to pharmaceutical chemists under the Repatriation Scheme. The Bill will provide for the retrospective application of the Tribunal's function to I May 1980. This is to honour an undertaking given by Mr Justice Ludeke, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements, that should a subsequent inquiry modify his decision to reduce dispensing fees they would be adjusted accordingly.

(1) That, for the purpose of choosing a person to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the death of Senator John William Knight, a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, until the expiration of the term and in accordance with the provisions of the Senate (Representation of Terri tories) Act 1973, as amended by the Senate (Representation of Territories) Amendment Act 1980, the Senate meet with the House of Representatives in a joint sitting.
(2) That the place and time of the Joint Sitting be the
Senate Chamber at I 5 minutes past 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 May,
1981.
Motion (by Mr Sinclair) agreed to:
That the message be taken into consideration forthwith.
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the
House) (8.33)-by leave I move:
That the House concurs in the resolutions transmitted in message No. 70 of the Senate relating to the time and place of the Joint Sitting for the purpose of choosing a person to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the death of Senator John William Knight.
I comment very briefly that this will be the first Joint Sitting of the Parliament for a purpose related to the appointment of a senator to replace a deceased senator in either of the two Territories. The only other occasion on which the two Houses have met for the purpose of joint consideration of

matters has been within the terms of the Constitu tion. This procedure that we will be embarking on on 5 May, therefore, is unique and has something of an historical significance for that reason if for no other.
It was felt by the Government that it was ap p ropriate, as the purpose of the meeting is to elect a senator, that the meeting should take place in the Senate. However, as the House of Representa tives is the paramount House within the Australian Constitution it was felt that it would be ap propriate that Mr Speaker sit alongside Mr President during the proceedings. Of course, it will be a matter of each member having a right to exercise the same rights and privileges and, of course, voting capacity as if he were in his own chamber. That means that, significantly, the members of this House will have a major part to play in terms of the result of any proposals that might be put to the Joint Sitting of the two Houses in the Senate.
I see that there is a peculiar significance in the reasons for this meeting, it being for the purpose of electing a senator to replace one who has died. In those circt.mstances the Government has felt it appropriate that the meeting be held in the Senate. Of course, it is only relevant to mention that the other occasion on which the two Houses met conjointly they met in this chamber. Then, of course, it was for a matter related to the purpose of this chamber which we felt was appropriate at that time and we agreed with the proposal of the then Government for that reason. I commend this motion to the House.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith)
(8.35)-The Opposition concurs with the motion. It is important to note-the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has already drawn this to the attention of the House-that the proposal to have a Joint Sitting in the Senate next week is certainly different from the proposals that we were obliged to consider in 1974. 1 think it ought to be placed on record that the proposal for next week is to fill a casual vacancy caused by the untimely death of the late Senator John Knight. It is to fill a Senate casual vacancy in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. Accordingly, it is appropriate on that basis that both Houses meet in the Senate.
I immediately disabuse the minds of some who feel that the important House of the people-the House of Representatives-is being somewhat usurped for all time and that future joint sittings will necessarily have to be held in the Senate. Again l agree with what the Leader of the House has said. That is not the case. We need to draw the distinction between a casual vacancy in the

Senate being filled pursuant to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act and a Joint Sitting which is obliged to be held pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. We have the constitutional requirement that, where there is disagreement between the Houses, particularly in respect of legislation, and where there has been a double dissolution and there is still a disagreement, there be a proposal for a Joint Sitting pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. The precedent established in 1974 would be, I submit, continued; that is, Joint Sittings for that purpose would be held in this House. The rules pertaining to Joint Sittings adopted in 1974 would continue to apply.
The appointment of a chairman of that sitting would be the subject of resolution of those present and entitled to vote at that time. I just make that point because it was thought by some people, even those in the Parliament, that perhaps there would be some change of operation in the future. I just draw that distinction. The procedures for a Joint Sitting in respect of a double dissolution pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution do not apply in this case. This matter relates to a vacancy in the Senate for a territorial senator. The rules proposed on this occasion merely relate to that matter specifically.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
JOINT SITTING: RULES FOR CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
Message received from the Senate acquainting the House with the rules adopted by the Senate for the conduct of the Joint Sitting with the House of Representatives pursuant to section 9 of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973.

Conclusion of Joint Sitting
11. Upon the declaration of the person chosen to fill the
casual vacancy in the Senate, the Chairman shall forthwith declare the Joint Sitting closed.

(2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it with
the rules adopted by the House of Representatives for the conduct of a Joint Sitting with the Senate.
I briefly advert to some of the contents of the rules because I think it is worth drawing the attention of honourable members to them. Item No. I sets down the purpose of the meeting; that is, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has identified, to choose a person to hold a vacant place in the Senate caused by the very re grettable and tragic early death of our former col league, the late Senator John Knight. No other matter shall be considered at the Joint Sitting. The second matter within the proposed rules to which I might also draw the attention of honour able members is that, in any matters of procedure that are not specifically provided for in those rules

now presented to this House, the Standing Orders of the Senate shall be followed as far as they can be applied. Honourable members will recall that in 1974, although the meeting was held in this chamber for reasons that have recently been adverted to, the Standing Orders of the Senate were applied. As I said, the Chairman will be Mr President or, in his absence, Mr Speaker. It has been suggested, and I believe it is appropriate, that Mr Speaker should sit alongside Mr President during the conduct of the Joint Sitting. The Clerks and matters relating to the minutes are identified as well as the procedures for the election of the person to hold the vacant place in the Senate. As I said, on any question arising in the Joint Sitting, each senator and member, including the Chair man, shall have one vote. The procedures and rules have been drafted by the Clerks of the two chambers. They are akin to those that were set down at the time of the 1974 Joint Sitting. The second occasion for a Joint Sitting, therefore, puts into folk lore the proposed rules. This House might well consider it suitable that these be adopted, perhaps with some modification, in our Standing Orders. Whether that would be appro priate I suggest is a matter that the Standing Orders committee might well consider at a later time. I commend the motion to the House.
Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (8.41) The Opposition agrees with the motion. We have looked at the proposed rules for the con duct of the Joint Sitting. We can see no reason to have any objection to them. As the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has explained, the Joint Sit ting relates to the filling of a casual vacancy. Our party, of course, does not even expect a contest for the filling of that vacancy. We accept the nominee. There will be no problems about the Joint Sitting, nor should any votes be necessary. We assume that there will be no other candidates. I can envisage circumstances in the future, when a vacancy involving an independent senator or member with no party affiliation may have to be filled. That may create some interesting problems. We agree that the matter ought to be speedily dealt with so that there can be effective represen tation in the Senate for the people of the Australian Capital Territory.
Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Leader of the House) (8.42)-in reply-Mr Deputy Speaker, I failed to mention one matter. A problem we have is knowing at what time this chamber should assemble immediately after the conclusion of the Joint Sitting. There is no way we can determine how long the Joint Sitting will take. It was felt ap propriate that the bells should be rung for five

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith)

That the Bill be now read a second time.
The purpose of this Bill is to amend three pieces of legislation to cover the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which is to be held to choose a senator for the Australian Capital Territory in the place of the late Senator Knight. The three Acts involved are the Evidence Act, the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act and the Parliamentary Papers Act. These three Acts were amended in 1974 in relation to the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which was then held pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. The amendments then made were limited to Joint Sittings pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution and do not apply in relation to the Joint Sitting to be held pursuant to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act. That Act was amended last year to provide for the filling of a casual vacancy in respect of a senator from the Australian Capital Territory by the Senate and the House of Representatives.

(8.46)-The Opposition has no objection to the Bill. The legislation has already passed the Senate where the Opposition concurred with the terms of the Bill. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) said, it is necessary to amend the existing Act in order to provide for the judicial notice and the protection that is already applicable in respect of Joint Sittings held pursuant to the Constitution. As I have said in earlier debates, the proposed Joint Sitting will be held pursuant not to the Constitution but to an Act of Parliament, namely the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973. The operative words are that the Joint Sitting will be held pursuant to an Act of Parliament. Accordingly, as this has never been done before, we ha'{e to make provision, as the Minister said, to cover the broadcast of proceedings, the Hansard record and the Parliamentary Papers Act. By doing so we give protection to the broadcasting and televising of proceedings. We provide authority for the publication of the record of proceedings and give protection in respect of

The effect of the present Bill will be to extend the changes made in 1974 to cover any Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives pursuant to an Act. The effect of the changes in relation to each of the three pieces of legislation concerned will be as follows: With regard to the Evidence Act, the effect of the amendment will be to provide for judicial notice of the signature of the officer presiding at a Joint Sitting held pursu-

any legal proceedings in respect of that publication. We give judicial notice of the signature of the officer presiding over the Joint Sitting to provide for copies of the official record of proceedings, as such, to be admitted as evidence in relation to the parliamentary proceedings generally.

That this House resolves that it be a rule and order of the House of Representatives that, at a joint sitting with the Senate, pursuant to the Senate (RepresentatIon of Terntories) Act 1973, as amended by the Senate (RepresentattOn of Territories) Amendment Act 1980, the proceedl.ngs are proceedings in Parliament, and tha~ the powers, pnv!lege~, and immunities of Members of this House shall, mutatIs mutandis, be those relating to a sitting of the House of

The substance of this motion is that it is intended to confer the powers, privileges and immunities of members in the same way for a joint sitting as for a sitting of the House of Representatives. I commend the motion to the House.

Question resolved in the affirmative.
DESIGNS AMENDMENT BILL 1981
Second Reading Debate resumed.
Mr HOWE (Batman) (8.50)--Prior to the adjournment of this debate I was saying that I thought underlying these Bills was an important theme of technological sovereignty. It is important at the present time that Australia seeks to achieve national independence in relation to technology as a fundamental goal. The legislation is not inconsistent with that end and in particular cases it will benefit the end. Perhaps the reason the original designs legislation was introduced in the early part of the century was that at that time there was within Australia a strong spirit of nationalism, a commitment to the development of all its resources, including human resources, and, therefore, a recognition of the importance of design not only in terms of industry and commercial application but also as an expression of the initiative, intelligence and creativity of the Australian people. I was suggesting that, of course, this legislation will not be enough to achieve that objective. It is important that resources be provided to those people who have a capacity to design and who have original ideas. Australia has a long history of people who have been inventive and creative, who have not had resources given to them initially, at a time when they are developing an idea, or perhaps even after the idea has been demonstrated they have not been able to develop that idea to the maximum extent because they have not been able to get the kinds of resources that are available to major corporations.
In recent years a great mythology has been associated with so-called economies of scale. In this country we have seen firm after firm consolidated in terms of takeover bids, and giant firms have been created. In the process, very often as a result of that consolidation of firms, technology

and ideas that have been developed in a particular firm have been either lost in a larger firm or they have even been transferred overseas where transnational corporations have been able to make use of Australian technology. Ultimately the benefits have not come through to the Australian people. One ought to recognise that very often the greatest creativity is to be found in the smaller firm. Creativity and initiative are not always associated with the largest and more dominant firms. Indeed there is some evidence to suggest that major corporations very often have had an interest in the prevention of the development of new technology and new designs because they would perhaps run against the interests of that corporation in a narrow economic sense.
I think also of the great example of the Australian Aluminium Co. which was an Australian Government corporation established at Bell Bay in Tasmania by the Chiftey Government which went on to develop a basis of an aluminium industry in this country. Unfortunately that company was sold off in the 1950s by the Menzies Government to Coma1co Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd which, as we all know, is a derivative of a multinational corporation. People think of it as having some Australian character, but it is simply a subsidiary of overseas corporations; I think the Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation Ltd of the United Kingdom and the Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation of the United States of America. In a very interesting article which I read as a result of a paper presented at a conference 1 learnt that before the Australian Aluminium Co. was taken over and became part of a multinational company it was leading the world in terms of technologies in relation to aluminium refining. Tn buying that company the multinational corporation was able to get access to technology in relation to that industry which at that stage was very much in advance of its time.
The absurd situation arises at this point in our history where we are paying hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of dollars to expand the aluminium industry in this country, almost completely in a situation of foreign ownership and control. Tn the process we are buying back technology to establish that industry; whereas if we had gone on in the aluminium industry with a government corporation which we started in the 1940s we would be in a much stronger position than we are at present. We would have much greater control of the aluminium industry at a time when obviously there are very good reasons for developing an alu-
minium industry in Australia. I take that example, which is a bit remote, I admit, from the legislation,

1738 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Designs Amendment Bill

simply to make the point that when one is talking about industrial design and the way in which designs may be registered, and when one is talking about patenting, one has to recognise that one is not dealing simply with a legal matter; one is dealing with the legalities of that matter in the context of social structure and in the context of a world in which increasing consolidation of companies into giant international corporations threatens the possibilities of innovation and makes it extremely difficult.
Countries that have had populations much less than that of Australia have been able to develop a world reputation in terms of their mastery of particular technology. I believe we ought to be seeking to learn from Sweden, Switzerland and from countries that have developed high standards of technology but very much in terms of the control of people within those societies and those national governments.
Mr Barry Jones-Tune in to tomorrow's debate.
Mr HOWE-As the honourable member for Lalor suggests, that matter will be taken up tomorrow. We ought to be learning even from a country such as Japan which has always preferred to take technology from overseas by way of licence rather than have its industry controlled by overseas corporations.
Mr Kent-The Japanese have a national pride.
Mr HOWE-Japan certainly has a national pride. In relation to these questions of design and patenting and the protection of technology Australia needs to develop some pride and some national direction. When we think of industrial design and technology we tend to think of it in terms of physical examples. When we are talking about protecting technologies we are thinking of protecting perhaps a new chemical that has been produced or a new drug or some physical process. I put it to the House that more important than any physical design is the way that we design social processes. The modern corporation is becoming an inappropriate form of social organisation to encourage new initiative and new designs. As a social process, the modern corporation is highly bureaucratic, centralised and authoritarian as a structure. Whilst very often it has resources to establish the laboratories and the capacity for producing new products in a narrow sense these major corporations tend overall to reinforce the direction in which the society has been moving.
I will give just one example which is associated with the automobile industry. In that industry we have developed over a period a form of travel and communication which has been not only highly

appropriate to urban societies but also has shaped the kind of cities that we have. Where has one seen those major companies that dominate the automobile industry looking forward to the need to find alternative forms of communication and travel? They have been much too devoted to preserving their own situation in the world and in preserving their own type of technology in a basically unchanged way over a very long period, rather than really taking us on to mon; energy efficient technologies which. will be absolutely essential in the last decades -of the twentieth century.
I believe these Bills are important in the sense that they protect design and they assist in enabling Australians to patent particular designs that they may be responsible for. One hopes that the Government in its approach to technology will take a whole issue and the whole theme of technological sovereignty seriously. One hopes that the Government will not only legislate in this area but also go on to legislate in other areas in order to ensure that the resources are provided to enable people to develop new technologies in Australia and, when it has done that, ensure that technology is not simply the subject of a takeover and transferred overseas and developed to its full commercial form so that it benefits some other country rather than the Australian people.
Mr LLOYD (Murray) (9.1)-The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), when introducing the Trade Marks Amendment Bill, referred to the necessity to protect trade marks and said that the way to achieve this is through section 103 of the Trade Marks Act. This section, in some circumstances, prohibits the importation of goods bearing a trade mark which is registered in Australia. The Minister then detailed the correct and incorrect use of this prohibition power. I wish to quote his comments. He said:
The registered proprietor or registered user of the trade mark can notify Customs that he objects to goods bearing the mark being imported. This objection enables Customs to seize such goods. It is not hard, for example, to see the value of this remedy where pirate goods bear forged or falsely applied trade marks. Section 103 effectively protects the proprietor or registered user against encroachment on his rights by unscrupulous overSeas manufacturers. However, the use of section 103 to prevent the import of genuinely marked goods has caused concern. This includes cases where the trade mark was applied overseas by the same company which is the registered proprietor in Australia.
Many object to this use of the section, saying it goes too far beyond the ideas behind protecting trade marks and abuses the purpose behind protecting trade marks by registration. The use of section 103 in relation to importation of goods was therefore referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee for review. That Committee's recommendations have generally been accepted by the Government. This Bill is designed to amend section 103 to implement the report. The Committee's key recommendation is that the provisions for

Designs Amendment Bill

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1739

seizure and forfeiture of goods under section 103 should be confined to those cases where importation infringes a registered trade mark.
Section 103 will no longer be available to prevent the import of goods bearing a genuine trade mark applied overseas by the Australian registered proprietor.
I hope the Minister's assurance is correct. My involvement with this section of the Trade Marks Act began some two years ago when a constituent of mine wanted to import second hand Cessna aircraft from the United States. He received a letter from the Rex aviation company, the proprietor or controller of that trademark in Australia, an importer of Cessna aircraft, saying that the company would use section 103 against anybody who imported Cessna aircraft without the company's authority. I understand that other agents and registered trademark holders of other makes of light aircraft sent out similar letters. The threat of that legal action made it impossible for anybody to import a second hand aircraft, even though it was the genuine article-a genuine Cessna or a genuine Beechcraft.
To me, my constituent and others, that was a completely inappropriate use of that section. It was a restraint of trade rather than a protection of a genuine trademark. I complained to the Minister of the day, as I know others did. I am very pleased that the Ministers involved have acted, that a review has taken place and that we now have this amending legislation before the House. I congratulate the Ministers involved, including the present Minister, for their action. I say again that I hope that this inappropriate and unfair use of that section of the trade marks protection legislation will not stand-that is, people will not be prevented from importing goods.
If it were to continue some absurd situations would develop. A person who actually is the owner of a second hand piece of machinery, aircraft, car-whatever it may be could be prohibited from importing what is his own article. It would mean that the Ford company, for instance, as the holder of the Ford trademark of Australia could prevent any Ford motor cars, new or second hand, from being brought in to the country by the owners of those cars. A person returning from overseas could not even bring a Slazenger tennis racquet or a Roller camera into the country if that provision were carried to the absurd lengths that applied to the second hand aircraft which my constituent wished to import. Therefore, I strongly support the legislation. I hope that the amendments have been drafted in a way that will overcome the problem I have raised. I congratulate the Minister.

Mr THOMSON (Leichhardt-Minister for Science and Technology) (9.6)-~in reply-l thank the speakers who have taken part in this debate. The Designs Amendment Bill, the Patents Amendment Bill and the Trade Marks Amendment Bill are complex Bills. They are important Bills, as everyone has agreed. I am delighted at the degree of unanimity that all speakers have shown in this important debate. I hope that it heralds a bipartisan view on the importance of increasing our technological base in Australia. I do not always agree with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), but I agree with the points that he made about the importance of industrial property Bills and their influence in increasing technological independence in Australia. It is an aim which I will pursue as hard as I can because I believe we must achieve a much better technological base so that we can compete on the export market with new products, new processes, and be independent of overseas technology. We should encourage our own technology. We are a very inventive nation-we have always been an inventive nation-but up until now we have not been a good entrepreneurial nation. The inventions are here. Xerox is a single example which I think the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has quoted. It was invented in Australia but is not used in Australia.
Mr Barry Jones-I do not think so.
Mr THOMSON-The honourable member does not think so. We need to do much more entrepreneurial development of our own inventions. We need to protect our own inventions against someone filching them. These three Bills will help in that respect. I congratulate the honourable member for Batman for his statements on that particularly important subject.
The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) made some very good points on the Trade Marks Bill. Tcan assure the honourable member for Murray that the cases he cited can no longer occur under this legislation. The legislation can no longer be used as an artificial tariff barrier. That is what it was. The legislation has been carefully drafted, I am assured, to prevent that from happening. A number of honourable members will have had representations from people who would want this artificial barrier to continue. When this Bill becomes law what has happened in the past will no longer be possible. I thank those two honourable members for their comments. The honourable member for Barton made some very interesting comments on the tyre industry and the effect the Trade Marks Act had on the industry.

I know he had very little warning that the Bills would be brought on-I might say that I had the same problems as the honourable member for Lalor-but he made a good speech. I commend him, particularly for his comments regarding the problems of the patentability of living organisms. The subject of the patentability of living organisms has been specifically referred to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee on its review of the whole patent system. But it is already practice that the Australian Patent Office patents methods which use microorganisms for new processes. The production of antibiotics is one, and a simpler example is the production of bread and cheese in other forms. There have been a number of cases involving patents. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has mentioned one in the United States of America.

Australia joined the International Patents Cooperations Treaty which has been used predominantly by small businesses in Australia. The International Patents Co-operations Treaty provides a simplified method of applying for patents in overseas countries. It is just one other way in which we can help small businesses. Small businesses have many problems. One is in obtaining venture capital, and the Government is looking at ways and means in which venture capital can be made readily available to small firms which wish to innovate and produce new products and processes. I thank those who have spoken in this debate. I am pleased to see interest being shown in this complex matter, but the speakers in the debate realised that it is an important matter for Australia and for our technological independence in the future.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.

Mr Barry Jones-The Chakrabarty case.
Mr THOMSON-Yes, the Chakrabarty case. There have been cases in Ireland and Israel and a number of other countries. But the situation in Australia seems to be clear: The invention of new living organisms is a patentable product in Australia. I will be interested to read the Industrial Property Advisory Committee's report on this matter as it will go into the matter much more deeply than we have done in Australia before as it is a new field.
Mr Barry Jones-We ought to have a parliamentary committee on it. It is such an important issue.
Mr THOMSON-I have noted the comments of the honourable member for Lalor on that matter. I make special mention of the work done by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. I have found it invaluable in giving me advice and in solving very complex problems by bringing a wide range of expertise, knowledge and devotion to solving these problems. I publicly thank it tonight. The Patents Amendment Bill has been given unqualified support by industry and user groups in Australia. I thank those groups for that support. I hope that the Bill will assist in the aims that were stated so carefully by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield)-this is not a combative Bill-and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) in their speeches.
I was also interested in the comments made about the importance of small businesses in the innovative process. There is no doubt that small firms must innovate to survive. This year

Third Reading
Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.
Motion (by Mr Thomson) proposed:
That the Bill be now read a third time.
MrBARRY JONES (Lalor) (9.14)-The first point I raise with the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) concerns the Designs Amendment Bill. The report of the Designs Law Review Committee-the Franki report indicated that the Bill was not intended to cover fashion design, which is a very important area of industrial property. Can the Minister give some indication as to where he thinks protection is found for design, for example, of clothing? This is not made at all clear. I suppose that in a way one could read it into the words of the Designs Act as amended, but the Franki Committee considered that it should not be covered in that Act. I would like the Minister to make some comment on that matter. The second point I raise is a fairly complex one which concerns the Patents Act. I direct the attention of the Minister to what he said in his second reading speech. When dealing with the provisions in the Bill he said:
Time limits should not, however, be inviolate. An applicant who fails to observe them may incur the loss of all or part of the potential rights to a patent.
Provisions already in the Patents Act allow the Commissioner of Patents, under certain conditions, to extend the times laid down.
This is the paragraph to which I want to draw the Minister's attention:
The most important of these is section 160, which allows time extensions in circumstances beyond control or through

Designs Amendment Bill

an .error or omission by the person concerned, or his agent or attorney. It has been drawn to my attention, through the courtesy of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), that there is an inconsistency there. He has received a letter from a patent attorney from Adelaide. I will read the relevant part of that letter. It reads:
On page 4 in the marked paragraph the Minister indicated that the Government accepted the IPAC recommendation that extensions should be granted for the Convention period if failure to file in time was beyond the control of the applicant, his Agent or his Attorney. In fact that is not quite how Sectio? 142AAA reads in the Patents Amendments BIll of 1981, and If you read the marked paragraph 2 - -
The marked paragraph 2 is the one I have just readyou will see that there is apparently a drafting error requiring that the circumstances should also be beyond control of the Agent or Attorney. Even this is trivial alongside the inconsistency whereby an extension can be obtained if the error was an error or omission on the part of the person concerned or the Agent or Attorney, if the Convention application passes through the relatively new PCT route, but not if it passes through the old traditional route.
I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the wording of section 160 (2) of the 1952 Act which is retained; it is not altered by the amending Bill. It states:
(2.) Where, by reason of(a) an error or omission on the part of the person con-
cerned or of his agent or attorney; or (b) circumstances beyond the control of the person
concerned, an act or step in relation to an application for a patent or in proceedings under this Act (not being proceedings in a court) required to be done or taken within a certain time has not been so done or taken, the Commissioner may, upon application extend the time for doing the act or taking the step.
Honourable members will find in proposed section 142AAA (2), these words:
For the purposes ofsub-section (1)-
It is similar to the earlier partcircumstances shall not be taken to be beyond the control of a person or persons unless the circumstances are also-
I repeat the words 'are also'-
beyond the control of any agent or attorney of that person or of those persons.
It looks as if in section 160 (2) there is a single precondition and in section 142AAA (2) there is a double precondition set-up. I would like the Minister to resolve that point. The final point, the Minister will be relieved to know T want to raise concerns that infamous section 103 of the Trade Marks Act 1955. Sub-section (5) reads:
Where an application has been made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, whether before or after the commencement of this sub-section for a review of a decision of the Comptroller-General of Customs made under sub-section (2),

a person is not entitled to appeal to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs against that decision.
I quite understand that there needs to be some change in relation to that matter. It is no longer in the empire of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs; it is part of the empire of the Minister for Science and Technology. I assure the Minister that sub-section (5) has fallen down the memory hole completely. I have been through it many times and there is no comparable proposed sub-section in the Bill. Whilst I can understand that there needs to be some alteration of wording, mutatis mutandis, I cannot see why it has been dropped out altogether. It seems to me to be a reasonable provision and I cannot see why it is not in the Bill.
Mr THOMSON (Leichhardt-Minister for Science and Technology) (9.20)-in reply-The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has asked three questions. The first related to the design of clothing. That is covered by the Copyright Act. The second related to an inconsistency in the proposed new section 142AAA of the Patents Act. There is, in fact, no inconsistency. The Commissioner of Patents has a discretion to decide whether an error or omission on the part of a patent attorney is, in fact, an error or omission. Those discretions are as wide as provided in section 160 of the Patents Act because proposed new section 142AAA is legislated outside the Paris Convention. It allows for grounds for an extension which are not allowed for in the Paris Convention.
Mr Barry Jones-Is the word 'also' perhaps unnecessary?
Mr THOMSON-It is covered by the discretion of the Commissioner of Patents. He can decide. I think that is a sensible way of dealing with it. Carelessness or a lost file is not a ground for the operation of that Act. He could decide that something more serious may be grounds for allowing the extension of time in relation to an error or omission on the part of a patent attorney. On the third question, matters relating to goods infringing Australian trademarks under proposed new section 103 would now go to the courts for determination as to whether those goods should be forfeited. Appeals to the Minister are no longer needed because the decision will be made by the courts.
Mr Barry Jones-Is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal out of it altogether?
Mr THOMSON-! gather that it is. These matters now go to the courts for decision on forfeiture of goods which have been seized.

Before the debate is resumed on this matter I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this motion and the motion to take note of the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard).

I want now to cite some figures showing what happened with health costs in three years under a Labor Government and in the ensuing three years, under a Fraser Government. This will remind the House of how dangerous the policy of a

cent increase in that three-year penod. In the following three-year period under the Fraser Government there was a net reduction of 1.7 per
cent.
It is true that there was some shift of those costs from the public to the private sector. This clearly spelt out to many people their total health costs. Under the proposals that the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) announced today there will be a further movement towards people at least understanding more fully where health costs are. The Jamison inquiry was set up about 18 months ago. It looked at scores of options which were considered and canvassed. From its considerations and from the Government's consideration of the recommendations and findings of that inquiry has come the package which the Minister for Health announced today. Health costs will not go away but the public must be made more aware of the cost of health services. Under Labor's Medibank, as I said earlier, health costs got out of hand. Services were free at the point of delivery. Of course, we know what happens when that situation exists. People have no appreciation of the costs. In addition, the deliverers of health services also tend to be rather lax. As a result overall costs get out of
hand.
There is ample evidence in Western countries that the health of a people will plateau and regardless of extra money spent the mortality and morbidity rates will not reduce. There is a mistaken belief in our community that money will always buy good health and longer life. I do not believe that is the case. Therefore expenditure must be watched closely, efficiencies introduced and value obtained for the health dollar spent.
I want to outline some of the clearly stated general objectives in health care in the Government's very acceptable statement that was presented in the House today. First of all the States should be more responsible. They have the constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services. They ought to be able to determine their own priorities, and that is what this Government is working towards. Individuals should be responsible for health care and aware of health costs. Welfare and help should be directed to those in need. The handout mentality must be diminished and eventually stamped out. People who can afford to pay for their health costs should be made to pay for those costs. Health insurance should be available to all, and community rating should be pursued. The healthy and the young healthy in particular should support the rest of the community by contributing to health insurance. There ought to be government assistance directed only

to the insured. This, of course, will be a considerable incentive for people to take out hospital and health insurance. The private sector must remain strong. 1 think this is an important plank of the free enterprise system. Indeed, it was the private sector in particular that came under strong attack by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in his speech tonight. Deliverers of health care must be more aware of the costs of the services they order. There is no doubt in my mind that so many deliverers of health care in this country are not aware of the extent of the costs of the services that they order.
Hospital costs, of course, virtually come under two headings-the capital cost of establishing hospitals and the recurring costs of running them.
r believe there has been too much political patron-
age in the States in relation to the building of hospitals and, indeed, the rebuilding of some hospitals. In many areas throughout the Commonwealth hospitals are situated in close proximity to other hospitals. Many examples of this can be found in all States. We all know of small towns with 20 or 30-bed hospitals which are located just four or five miles from each other. The States, mainly I believe for political reasons, seem to want to build or rebuild some of those hospitals. I do not believe the Commonwealth ought to be involved in that sort of operation. Hospitals have become what one might call sacred cows. Apparently they must remain whether they are needed or not. The cost sharing arrangements that the Commonwealth had with the States have been far too open-ended. It has been too easy for the States to include in their Budgets extra personnel and items such as cars and other equipment. Of course, the States are paying only 50c of every $1 expended. The States have been spending too many 50c dollars with the open-ended 50 : 50 cost sharing arrangement which has existed now for a number of years.
Under the new arrangements the Commonwealth's contribution to the States will be included in the general tax sharing arrangements although the amounts will be identifiable as a certain percentage. The allocation of funds to the States in the longer term will come under the scrutiny and control of the Commonwealth Grants Commission which will determine relativities between the States. I believe the Grants Commission is an ideal body for this purpose. It is a body that has been highly respected in this place and, 1 believe, throughout the Commonwealth. It is respected, non-political, independent and, I believe, free from political influence. I look forward to the implementation of the arrangement under

speakers in this debate. This matter concerns hospital accounts. I believe fully itemised accounts should be provided to all hospital patients whether or not they pay that account. In other words, a pensioner or a disadvantaged patient who does not pay an account ought to be aware of the extent of the costs that he has incurred as a patient of a hospita1. There ought to be an awareness not only from the patient's point of view but also from the health workers' point of view. The doctors and the nurses who order and administer the treatments should know the costs. It is not uncommon these days for a patient who is hospitalised for three or four days to receive an account in excess of $1,000. Of course the cost depends on the extent of the diagnostic tests, the

Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (9.40)-I rise to make some comments on the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) supplementary to that made by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). His statement and my comments relate to matters of taxation. The two tax matters referred to by the Treasurer were the introduction of a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar for health insurance costs and the abandonment of tax indexation. The first point I make is that the benefit of the introduction of the 32c in the dollar tax rebate will depend on the extent of the rise in health insurance charges. So, whether it will be of particular benefit to families, as the Treasurer says it will be, highly dubious.

year before he will be able to take full advantage of the rebate. So, this tax deduction is not one which will be available in full to many low income earners. A third reason for a tax deduction rather than a higher subsidy is clearly to reduce the size of the public sector; that is, it is based on ideology rather than practical common sense and equity.
In a system of subsidies, as we have in this area, why should we not give all the assistance in that way rather than do it partly by way of subsidy and partly by way of tax indexation? If a government is to promote activity in some areas-such as assisting people to take up health insurance-where it can give subsidies or tax concessions, it does seem curious for it to give both. Why do it on both sides? No real reason for doing that is put forward in either of the statements by the Minister for Health or the Treasurer. It means that we will have an administratively cumbersome approach because we are giving assistance in two ways rather than in one way. It means also that the initial cost of health insurance will be much higher when the assistance is given partly in the form of a tax concession or rebate rather than in the form of a subsidy. It has both an inflationary impact and an impact in regard to the taking up of health insurance by low income people.
If the Government takes the approach of giving all the assistance by way of subsidy, then quite obviously the cost of health insurance will be less than it would be if the assistance were given partly by way of subsidy and partly by way of tax deduction. With that lower cost there will be less impact on the consumer price index and will be less inflationary inpact, which should be of interest to a Government which says it is concerned to beat inflation first. As the Government is anxious to get people to take up health insurance, the lower the initial cost of that insurance, obviously the greater the likelihood that people will take it up. In view of the large initial cost of health insurance a tax concession may still not be enough to induce people to take up health insurance. They are frightened by the initial high cost and therefore are likely to take the gamble. Under this new system, they may face horrendous bills for their health care if they do gamble, as I am sure many of them will do when faced with the large health insurance costs which otherwise they would have to pay. The Opposition has a number of reservations about providing assistance to people in the area of health insurance through tax deductions. It would be much better to offer a higher subsidy, as happened previously.

The abandonment oftax indexation is an extraordinarily important development. The Government has attempted to hide it away in a supplementary statement on the matter of health finance. Presumably the Government hopes that by hiding this statement in this fashion the political flak from the abandonment of tax indexation will be considerably reduced. It is obvious that tax indexation has nothing to do with health finance, so why has the Government attempted to do it in this way if it is not simply to hide from the Australian people what is going on? Of course, the Government hoped that it would be able to reduce hostility in this way but, as we have already mentioned, this tax rebate must be seen as compensation for increased health costs, not as compensation for the loss of tax indexation. There can be no argument that it must be associated with the tax rebate. Saying it is a tax rebate which is compensation for the loss of tax indexation is an absolute absurdity. The tax rebate for health insurance is a compensaion for the increased costs of health insurance which will come from the other measures announced by the Minister for Health. The abandonment of tax indexation must be seen as something which is not in any way compensated for by the tax rebate. It is something which should stand on its own. The Government's attempt to associate it with the tax rebate is simply a diversion.
Indexation is a very important aspect of taxation in this country. If applied in full it prevents the proportion of income being paid in tax from increasing automatically because of inflation. This happens because under a progressive income tax system the higher the income, the higher the proportion of income paid in tax. If incomes go up with inflation and there is no adjustment to the tax schedule through tax indexation then taxpayers automatically move into higher tax brackets and therfore pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. If tax indexation is fully applied, the tax schedule is adjusted in accordance with inflation and taxpayers whose incomes move up in line with inflation do not move into higher tax brackets and do not pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. That is the theory of tax indexation. The Fraser Government in its early days was very strong in its support for tax indexation. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said earlier tonight, the now Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made great play of tax indexation when stating his policy in the 1975 election. He promised:
We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years . . . It will make government more honest with your money. They will no longer be able to rely on this
secret tax increase of inflation.

tax indexation never applied in any year even though supposedly full tax indexation was introduced in 1976.

come in income tax than they paid in 1975 arises because of a discretionary change to the tax system which was introduced in 1977 and which gave substantial tax concessions to high income earners. The rest of the taxpayers are paying more of their income in tax because of the small measure of benefit they received from that discretionary change and the secret tax of inflation which has occurred through the non-application of full tax indexation in any year in the five years of the Fraser Government. In future the nonexistence of tax indexation will have a severe impact on taxpayers unless there are fully compensating discretionary changes.

The Prime Minister has made the point also that tax indexation is a supportive mechanism for an anti-inflation policy. He claimed this in 1976. So, his abandonment of it now means that he is walking away from something which he originally said was important the prevention of inflation. The abandonment of tax indexation has been announced thin this House tonight without reason. There is no reason in the Treasurer's speech for abandoning tax indexation-a system which was said by the Prime Minister to be of enormous importance to the economic health of this country. Yet now we see it abandoned without any rf!ason being given at all. There is simply a canvassing of

the reason is that the Government sees political value in going back to the old system of secret taxes by inflation because it is not getting enough credit, as it sees it, for tax indexation. It prefers the old system of tax increases by inflation.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)
Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr HARRIS (Chisholm) (9.55)-1 welcome
the statement of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) this afternoon. It is the product of a great deal of thought and much hard work. It re sponds to the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in a way that that report clearly dem onstrates was required. The fact is that spending in the health area over the last decade has been increasingly unrestrained and uncontrolled. There has been, regrettably, a great deal of waste of money. The community and governments hoped that that maney was spent in areas of real need and areas that required these huge sums of money. The percentage of the gross domestic product spent on health has steadily increased without, regrettably, an equal improvement in the health services provided. As the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) said in his speech, more money does not necessarily mean better health services. Anyone who has any doubt about this ought to make reference to the Jamison Report.
I cite just a few examples from the report which I think leaves nobody who has read it in any doubt as to the need for reform. For example, the report
states:
Information provided to the Commission shows a general over-supply of hospital beds in Australia, significant differences in total provision between States, mal distribution of beds within the States and a close relationship between the supply and use of hospital beds and facilities.
The report states further:
The Commission has sufficient evidence to show that medi cal technology is proliferating, without proper assessment, and that avoidable variations in staff numbers exist between hospitals of equivalent size and function.
The report also states:
The States have been encouraged by the hospital cost-sharing agreements in particular to devote a large share of their health budgets to hospitals.
The report further states:
The present budgetary processes are cumbersome and time consuming.
The Commission has had evidence of the year-end spend up by hospitals irrespective of needs so that funds will not be reduced in the following year.

I interpolate that that is a common syndrome in many publicly funded institutions. The report goes on to state:
. . . the attitudes and efficiency of some hospital adminis trations has not been impressive. The Commission has evidence of ridiculous and unsubstantiated demands for ad ditioal staff, inefficient allcation of stl;l.ff and rostering of overtime, and reluctance to mtroduce measures with proven cost savings such as contract cleaning. Other examples of wasteful practices include rosters deliberately organised to ensure that certain employees had a guaranteed overtime component in their wages, whether the hours needed to be worked or not, and arrangements for payment of salaries and allowances in excess of award provisions, sometimes with authorisation from the hospital's board but commonly with out approval of the appropriate health authority. The Commission regards these as manifestations of poor managerial control and of a total lack of appreciation of the managerial function in publicly funded institutions.
It is no surprise that the Commission as a result of that and many other pieces of evidence was led to conclusions similar to those following a nation wide survey of the health services. It found:
. . . health authorities and hospital managements in general hve not taken enough trouble to promote cost
constramt-they must take more action; financial efficiency as tken second place to spending in many hospitals-this SituatiOn must be altered; the present system of funding encourages-
I repeat the words 'the present system of funding encourages'-
and promotes expenditure with little consideration of need need must always be the main consideration;
No doubt when this Parliament and the State parliaments have voted sums of money for the de livery of health services they had hoped-they ought to have hoped-that those sums were based
 on the needs of the community. Regrettably, as
the amison report manifestly demonstrates, that has JUSt not been the case. This uninhibited spend ing, of course, as the report says, has been based upon the fact that those who deliver the health services have not had to consider the source of their money; they have had to think only about the spending of it. As the honourable member for Petrie remarked, the cost-sharing arrangement has meant that the States and the hospitals have
been spending only 50 cents. They have had no in hibition upon them. The new arrangements will ensure control. The States will know the amount they are getting to spend. They will know that an upper limit is provided. The set percentage means that there will be a finite sum for them to spend. At the same time time they will, in a sense, have greater fiexibility. In the areas of public hospitals, commum_ ty health and the school dental health service they will be able to decide how the funds are to be spent. We hope that they will spend them where the need is greatest. The new arrange ments will encourage them to spend carefully.

Mr LEO McLEAY (Grayndler) (10.8)-The proposal which has been brought into the Parliament this afternoon by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) is the fifth Fraser health plan. I say it is the fifth Fraser health plan because it is obvious that the proposal is not one with which the Minister for Health is happy. The decision has obviously been made in the Cabinet by the supporters of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm

there is very little else that the Government can

give away either to the private sector or the

States. I think that is a very sad thing.

The Minister talked about the important role of the private sector in health care delivery. It is this obsession with the private sector which, in my view, has caused a number of problems for the Australian community. The Government has attempted to prop up the health insurance funds over many years. Recently I received a letter from the Minister for Health in which he said that the Government's hospital reimbursement fund would make the health funds viable. Obviously it has not made them viable and the Government has now decided on a plan which will compel people to be members of health funds. I find it interesting that the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Harris), who came into this place as the doyen of the private enterprise sector, is now suggesting to us that there should be no free enterprise in the private health plan area; people either join a fund or they make sure that they do
not get sick. There will be no middle ground any
more in this country if these proposals are put into

effect.

Earlier this evening the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) stated in this Parliament that 3t million people in this country at present are not insured. If this Government has its way it will make sure that every last man, woman and child gets themselves insured. Of course, that will mean that many of the Government's friends who are doing quite well out of these health insurance funds will do a lot better than they have been doing in recent years. In fact it does not take one long to cast one's mind back to the scandals that one read about in regard to the large health funds-how they were buying jet aircraft to pilot their executives around the country; how they were entering into massive superannuation payments with regard to the chief executives of a couple of the health funds in Sydney. After the fat was removed from a lot of them they had to cut back on these perks that they were giving to their executives. Honourable members can be assured that when this plan is put into effect they will be back on the gravy train once again. It is rather ironical that even in the days when Bob Menzies was Prime Minister of Australia at least one could get the Commonwealth benefit if one went into hospital, even if one was not in a health fund. Under the free enterprise Fraser Government a

taxpayer, if he is not in a health insurance fund, will not even be able to get back in the form of a Commonwealth benefit the money that he has paid to the Commonwealth Government. I think that is a ridiculous situation. It is a terrible proposal for a government which says it believes in freedom of choice to put forward. In the health area there will be very little freedom of choice.
The Minister for Health said how important it is that the private hospital sector should be encouraged. Previous speakers have said that as well. The Government and the Minister should have taken cognisance of the overseas studies that have looked at the private sector of hospitals, par ticularly in America. I commend to the House an article in the annals of the American Association of Social and Political Sciences entitled 'The Pol itical Economy of Nursing Homes'. That article points out quite specifically how the private nurs ing home and private hospital operators manage to rip off the system very well. In fact they got to the extent where even the Nixon Government in America was doing its very best to curtail their operations. We have been very fortunate that large American private hospital operators have not really got their hooks into the Australian hospital system.
The Jamison report very trenchantly came out in opposition to allowing large private hospitals to have a big say in the Australian health delivery service. This is not what the Minister for Health has proposed tonight. Under that proposal private hospitals will be not only given as much help but also as much money as they need. The Minister has proposed doubling the daily bed benefit to private surgical hospital entrepreneurs. That is a sad state of affairs when the profit motive will be what determines whether or not people are interested in health care. I thought health care was about care, not the maximum amount of money that one can take from people in beds. This Government has done a terrible thing to the Australian population by putting the health ser vice of this country into that sort of situation.
We heard from the honourable member for Chisholm some suggestion about the disadvantaged and who they are. The fact that the Government has continued to use that word suggests that we are back once again to the old nineteenth century proposal of health care as a charity-the old hospices that were run by charitable institutions for the poor people. The Government is getting back to a definition of what that would be health care as a charity, not health care as a right, as if it is not the right of every Australian to have a fair chance to receive medical aid if he needs it
 not whether he can afford it. The fact that one ca

That is what the Minister said happened. The reason he gave was the number of people who had been claiming the bulk bill disadvantaged proposal through their local doctor had increased. This was not because there had been an overutilisation of the service. The reason was that after six years of this Government there are many more disadvantaged people in this country than there had ever been in the past.

The Minister has not been very precise as to how that definition will be arrived at and who will arrive at that definition. To bring down an important statement such as

would have a small group of advantaged people such as the Prime Minister and the wealthy people, and the rest of the people could not even afford to become ill or to take their children to the doctor if they needed treatment.

The definition of who is disadvantaged really is at the nub of what we are going to be providing in the health care delivery service in this country. If, as the Minister said, it is about whether the people have an income test that is equivalent to the pen-

The Government cannot even accept its own definitions at times. We have heard from the Minister and from previous speakers that we have to be able to define who are the disadvantaged; we have to have some sort of formula. Honourable members can bet their lives that the formula would exclude anyone who is in dire straits. The Government has said in the past: 'We will allow the doctor to be the person to decide'. After all, if someone comes into a doctor's surgery, in many instances the local doctor knows that person's economic and family circumstances. Ministers have on many occasions in this House said that the doctor is the one who should make that decision. Now the Government is saying that the doctors cannot be trusted to make that decision

sioner health card, how does that help a single income family with eight or nine children? How does that help low income families who have been hardest hit by the policies of this Government and who, it would appear once again, will be hit even worse? How can they afford the $600 or $700 per annum that it costs to insure oneself under a private health scheme? If one has young children, under this scheme that the Government is proposing, one must ensure that one does that. A person who has a number of children who become ill-if the Government has its way by making the States charge what are to be their costs in the hospitalsand who is on a low or medium income in this country will be unable to afford these costs if they are not insured.

any more; we are going to have some bureaucrat in the Health Department in Canberra, the most affluent city in the Commonwealth, making a decision about who is going to be disadvantaged in Sydney, in the Kimberleys, in Melbourne or anywhere else in Australia. That is a ridiculous situation. It does not quite gel with what the Minister said in his speech. He said:

The Minister said in his speech that the States should be pressed to ensure that they charge the real cost of hospital care. We are all aware that the real cost of hospital care is about $150 per head per day. That is considerably more than the $50 a day that is now charged for public beds or the $75 a day that is charged for shared beds. The cost of being in a hospital under these proposals

of work and those who are on the lower social income levels.
In fact, the Government has even recognised that by undertaking to give some benefit back to people who insure themselves. The Government has looked at giving back a fiat benefit of 32c in the dollar on the tax scales. It has also said in the statement which was made at the same time by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that it will take tax indexation away from people but will give them 32c in the dollar back on their health insurance. Of course, that gives a disproportionately higher amount of return to a person on a high income than it does to a person who has a large family and is earning $120 to $150 a week. A rebate of 32c in the dollar will not be of much value to that per son. It would be of much more value to the people who are on incomes in excess of $20,000 and $30,000, as are most of the Government supporters.
The main area in which I am interested regard ing the issue which we are debating tonight is the way in which Government has absolutely sold out to the private hospital and nursing home proprietors. It has given a paltry $1m for home nurs ing services and $120m to nursing home proprietors. The Minister for Health has successfully covered up the report of the Auditor-General that showed there was iniquitous massive overcharging of the Commonwealth in the nursing home area. I am sure, from the statement brought down by the Minister tonight, that the proposed inquiry and the moves to request repayments from those people will not be proceeded with. The private hospital and nursing home proprietors in this country will sit back tonight and throw cham pagne parties while they live off the people who are in their establishments.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Milal r) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mr LLOYD (Murray) (10.23)-The attitude of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) to private hospitals and the improved arrangements for them as announced in the policy statement presented by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) rather surprised me because the greatest amount of criticism of the present disadvantage suffered by private hospitals comes from the Catholic hospital sector. I think that it quite genuinely and correctly comes from that sector because of the difficulties it has. So it surprises me very much that the honourable member should be so ignorant of the situation confronting the Catholic hospital sector as a part of the general private hospital sector.

Mr Leo McLeay-What has that got to do with it?
Mr LLOYD-I think it has a lot to do with it. If the honourable member cares to talk to some of his Catholic hospital administrators about the problem, he would be informed of the problems they face in trying to survive under the present arrangements.
Mr Leo McLeay-It is rather offensive when one suggests that a person's religion ought to colour what that person says in the Parliament.
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no sub stance in the points of order.
Mr LLOYD-I suggest that the honourable member should check the real situation of private hospitals a bit more before he enters into that sort of general abuse of the private hospital sector.
I commend the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, Mr Jamison, and the other two com missioners, Dr Yeatman and Mr De Boos, for their comprehensive inquiry and report. That is the basis upon which the Government has made its changes to hospital financing arrangements, and medical and hospital insurance arrangements. I commend the present Minister for Health for his patience and perseverance during this difficult decision-making period.
The most significant recommendation that has been made by the commissioners-it has been ac cepted by the Government-is that the open ended 50-50 cost sharing arrangement provided by the previous Labor Government has to go. Under that arrangement there was no financial responsibility-or, one could say, the Commonwealth had all financial responsibility but no authority. With the various ruses that the States were able to operate, it was not a 50-50 arrangement. It was more like a 60-40 arrangement. There was no incentive for the States to be efficient or accountable. I am not being critical of t he States in that regard. If that sort of arrangement were provided, any level of government or any organisation would naturally take that option.
When the decision was made to end the cost sharing arrangements, when considered together with the federalist philosophy of this Government that hospitals are a State government responsibility and, therefore, should be allowed and encouraged to be responsible, it was inevitable that either the absorption or general revenue grant approach or specific purpose grant approach, or a combination of the two, would be introduced. I think it is this compromise between

At present, as pointed out in the report of the inquiry, per head payments in the highest State can be almost double the Commonwealth commitment in the lowest State. The States should also be forced to charge a more realistic amount for hospital beds and generally be more efficient and responsible.

Of course, the organisation is masquerading as a religious organisation. Many fine young Australians, both girls and boys, are being spirited into the Children of God movement. They are lost to their families forever. Let that be a warning to parents of young people to warn their children against having anything to do with that society. It is a filthy, rotten organisation and should be banned from this country.
Mrs CHILD (Henty) (l0.39)-In this Year of Disabled Persons we continually hear members on the Government side of the House detailing what should be done for disabled people. They do not really do anything but they do make a lot of noise. Tonight I challenge the Government, the Liberal-National Country Party coalition -1 am glad to see that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is at the table-to stop talking and start doing, to remove the duty and sales tax from imported wheelchairs and accessories. I specify the Amigo chair, which looks more like a golf buggy than a conventional wheelchair. It is highly mobile and can be turned in limited areas, such as in a lift. Its seat resembles that of a normal office chair. It can be rotated through 360 degrees so that it can be backed up to a table and the user can turn the seat through 180 degrees to sit at the table in a chair which looks very little different from any other dining chair or conference chair. Furthermore, it is powered by a battery called a gel-cel which re-

for moving from one place to another in a selfdriven car, for attending conferences or for air travel. The heavier Australian chair is designed largely for outdoor use. It is heavier, sturdier and far less easy to transport by air. There is no similar or equivalent wheelchair manufactured in Australia. So, if the duty and sales tax were removed we would not be creating unfair competition with the Australian manufacturers. No Australian product remotely resembles the Amigo chair, nor has it the flexibility for plane or car travel.
1 think in the Irtternational Year of Disabled Persons the Government could make some generous gesture-it has not made very many lately-and take the sales tax and duty off these wheelchairs. They cost $1,600 to manufacture, but with the duty and sales tax they come to $2,700. That puts them out of the range of the average person who struggles to buy one. We stand up and put one foot in front of the other without thinking about it. But if we could not we would start thinking about using a wheelchair in which we could get around in a manner similar to other people. Dr Ford, who works at the Caulfield Hospital, has an Amigo chair. He is a man who for years has battled strongly against a disability, and it was not really until he got the Amigo chair that he was able to walk-he calls it walking in his chair-as we do.

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATTVES 1757

There has been a great deal of alarmist nonsense talked about this matter by the Western Australian Government and, recently, the Australian Government. In the first place the action, even if totally successful, would not stop bauxite mining in the south west. From the parent company's point of view, the worst possible thing to happen would be for .it to ~e obliged to sell ,up its 51 per cent holdmgs m the AustralIan company. One can readily imagine a number of companies operating in Australia which would be willing to buy. As I have said, that is the worst possible and most unlikely outcome of the case from the company's point of view.
Secondly, it has been argued that it will affect the North West Shelf project by reducing south west demand for gas. That is more nonsense. At the very worst, it might cause a rescheduling of the State Energy Commission's allocation of gas which might indeed produce a windfall for the SEC if that gas is bought at something like today's prices and delivered to the consumer in the 1990s at the then prices. The Attorney-General has a concern for Australian sovereignty. He ought to extend that concern to a much wider range of Australian controls over aspects of foreign investment in this country and to what amounts to individual sovereignty in our domestic legal system. It is time that this Government and the Western Australian Government recognised that this problem is a direct product of an inadequate access for Australian citizens to their own courts for a reasonable range of what are commonly called class actions. The type of class action attempted by the Conservation Council in the United States Federal Court ought to be available to it here. The Government has had before it quite an extensive review of the matter in a discussion paper by the Law Reform Commission which was printed in June 1979. One of the interesting features of that document is that it points out that current permissive American law on class actions and the more restrictive Australian law on representative actions-or the rather toothless power of intervention by government agencies such as the Trade Practices Commission, in a state of demise, and various consumer protection authorities-stem from common roots in the British judicial system of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
The evolution of class action type procedures in the Australian judicial system was largely curtailed by a British case in 1910 which severely restricted the use of representative actions to secure damages. As a result of that court case there has been very little attempt to change Australian judicial procedures in this direction either by legislation or by the interpretations of courts. The

matters which the Law Reform Commission raised are complex. I do not deny that.
But, as the Commission pointed out, the matters are not intractable. The Government ought to press the Commission to a conclusion and bring down a final report on the matter. Better still, it ought to present to the public evidence of its own intention to improve public rights in this area, I suggest that this would be a far more sensible and constructive way for it to proceed in this matter than the way in which it has chosen to proceed to this point. What goes for the Australian Government on this matter, as I said, goes for the Western Australian Government as well.

Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 December 1980:
Has the Government accepted the recommendations contained in the report by the Women's Advisory Council entitled 'My Child was Born Disabled', relating to the revision of the handicapped children's allowance to provide (a) all parents of disabled children with allowances regardless of their income level and the nature of their child's disability, (b) parents with information on the guidelines given to medical officers for differentiating between the classifications of handicapped and substantially handicapped under the allowance, (c) an additional allowance for single parents and those in financial difficulties, (d) periodic adjustment of the allowance in line with the consumer price index, (e) for continuation of the allowance to parents when the child is placed in a hostel or other facilities for short-term stays and (f) an increase in the allowance to cover the costs of equipment, medication and treatment; if so, when will the changes be implemented; if not, why not.

The recommendations of the National Women's Advisory Council have been carefully studied; those concerning the handicapped child's allowance will be taken into account in any review of that program. The following specific comments are offered:
Recommendations (a), (c) and (f) would involve a fundamental change in the purpose of the handicapped child's allowance. Currently the allowance is paid to assist parents who have a severely or substantially handicapped child in need of constant care and attention to care for the child at home rather than place him in an institution. The allowance is not in the nature of compensation. Neither is it intended to meet the full cost of caring for handicapped children; rather, it is to assist in meeting the special costs involved.

1760 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Answers to Questions

Recommendation (b) concerns assessment guidelines devised by the Department of Health. The question of whether a child is severely handicapped or substantially handicapped is assessed by a medical officer on the grounds of information supplied by the parents and the child's own treating doctor as to the child's medical condition and his capacity to cope. Where appropriate, further examination may be sought. The nature of the assessment involved is thus a matter of professional judgment.
Recommendation (d) would also involve amending the Social Services Act; at present the rate of the allowanCe is reviewed each year in the Budget context.
Concerning recommendation (e), entitlement to the allowance is generally not affected by the child's absence from home provided the absence is of a temporary nature and the institution concerned does not receive handicapped childrens' benefit or nursing home benefit for the child for the same period.
Coal Developments
(Question No. 413)
Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
Does the Government accept the recommendation in report No. 10 of the National Energy Advisory Committee that Governments should give closer attention to the impacts of equity participation by foreign consumers in new coal developments, particularly in relation to the terms of contracts and prices negotiated by such joint venturers; if not, why not; if so, what action will the Government take, through which authority and when.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
In examining proposed foreign investments in new coal projects, including proposals that incorporate equity participation by foreign customers, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Government give full consideration to all of the benefits and costs associated with customer equity participation, including arrangements for the sale of the output from the projects. As part of this examination process, advice is sought from all Government departments and bodies whose responsibilities may be affected by the proposed investment, including the Australian Taxation Office. The Government is well aware of the implications of foreign customer equity participation, and in order for such participation to be approved it must comply with the foreign investment policy requirements and must not be contrary to the national interest.
Further scope for protection of the national interest against any adverse export pricing implications of foreign customer equity participation is provided by Regulations 9 and 11 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. These Regulations prohibit the export of certain raw or semi-processed minerals and metals, and of hydrocarbons and nuclear sensitive material unless permission is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources or an authorised person. This export control power may be used if the need arises to ensure, amongst other things, that fair and reasonable world market prices are paid in respect of exports of Australian coal.
Additional protection is provided through the taxation arrangements applicable to joint ventures involving customer participation. Where, for example, non-arm's length sales are made, Section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the Taxation Commissioner has power to determine a taxable income so that an appropriate amount of income tax is payable.

International Charter Flights
(Questions No. 421)
Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
(1) How many applications were made for international charter flights (a) to and (b) from Australia during 1980.
(2) Which companies made these applications.
(3) Which applications were approved.
(4) Which rights were taken up.

(6) Have any applications been made for charter rights in 1981; if so, by whom and for which dates.
(7) Have any applications for J981 been rejected.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honorable member's question is as follows:

Cimetidine (Question No. 495)
Mr Holding asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the article headed
'Stomach drug linked to cancer' (Age, 12 January 1981,
page 1).
(2) If so, what quantities of cimetidine have been dispensed in Australia since its introduction.
(3) Have there been any reported cases of stomach cancer in people using cimetidine in Australia.

Stomach Disorder Drugs
(Question No. 496)
Mr Holding asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
(1) Has his attention been drawn to the article headed 'US.
may ban sales on 16 stomach disorder drugs' (Financial Review, 21 January 1981, page 17).
(2) If so,how many of those drugs named have been dispen sed in Australia in each of the last 5 years, giving both quanti ties and value of prescriptions.
(3) Are any of the drugs named currently under suspension in Australia; if so, which ones and what is the reason in each case.
(4) Are there any plans to suspend the use of any of these
drugs on the grounds of unproven effectiveness or any other grounds; if so,what are the details in each case.
Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable
member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) Only three of those drugs named are currently available on the Australian market. These are Librax, Bentyl with Phenobarbital and Valpin. Librax and Valpin are available on prescription only in all States while Bentyl with Phenobarbital is available in syrup form on prescription only in Queensland,
asmania, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Ter
ntory and as an over-the-counter preparation in the remain ing States. Since none of these products is available as a phar maceutical benefit I am unable to provide any details regarding the quantities and value of prescriptions.
(3) No.
(4) Not at this time. In respect of the three drugs which are currently available on the Australian market, details of the basis for the proposed action have been sought from the Food and Drug Administration in the USA. and when available will be referred to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee for consideration.

(4) In view of the potential problems following the use of cimetidine,are there any plans to withdraw the drug from the Australian market,on either a temporary or permanent basis.
Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable
member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes.
(2)My department does not have details of the quantities of cimetidine dispensed in Australia since its introduction.
Since cimetidine was listed as a pharmaceutical benefit on I
August 1978 there have been 125,883 pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions for cimetidine tablets 200mg (each for 150 tab lets) processed for payment up until 28 February 1981. This figures does not include supplies of cimetidine from hospitals or under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or on private prescritpion.
(3) The Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee has not received any reports of Australian patients suspected of having developed stomach cancer while using cimetidine.
(4) No. None of the evidence reviewed by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee to date supports the view that cimetidine causes cancer. Nevertheless that Committee and its sub-committee, the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee, will continue to monitor reports and review the literature on this subject and the honourable member may be assured that appropriate action will be taken as considered necessary.

Answers to Questions

Mr Hodgman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I am informed by my Department that information can only be provided on those tourist attractions administered by the Department. They are-
Lanyon Homestead National Botanic Gardens Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve GovernrnentNursery, Yarralumla The relevant information in respect of each is:
Lanyon Homestead(1) lOam to 4 pm Tuesday to Sunday and Public Holidays.

(4) (a) Yes, following which closing times extended during period of daylight saving. (b) No.
National Botanic Gardens: (1) 9 am to 5 pm daily. Closing time extended to 6 pm on
weekends during period of daylight saving.

most outstanding research projects are supported to the limit of available funds. On this basis of scientific merit, the NH&MRC has provided the following funding for direct research into SIDS:

1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981

$ 40,000 100,000
110,000
130,000 180,000 280,000

To this must be added a portion of a $237,000 Program Grant awarded to Professor G. D. Thorburn of the Department of Physiology, Monash University, which will be expended on SIDS research.

There are however other research projects throughout Australia related to SIDS funded other than from Commonwealth Government funds, e.g. a 3 year grant of $146,349 from the US. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to Dr D. Megirian of the University of Tasmania. I do not, however, have detailed information as to the extent of such research.

(2) No. (3) Yes. See (1)

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Research
(Question No. 513)
Mr Beazley asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
(1) Is it a fact that more than 500 babies die each year as a result ofsudden infant death syndrome.
(2) What sums have been made available by the Federal Government for research into sudden infant death syndrome in each year since the assistance commenced.
Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The most recent figures available indicate that 414 babies died in 1978 as a result of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

(2) Will he also take action to have wheelchairs, and their repair and maintenance, made available free of charge to all patients needing them, upon production of a doctor's certificate.
Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) lind (2) Under the hospital cost-sharing agreements between the Commonwealth Government and each State Government, whereby the Commonwealth Government meets 50 per cent of the agreed net operating costs of recognised (that is, public) hospitals, the States have undertaken to provide surgical aids and appliances free-of-charge when these are considered necessary by the hospital in the ongoing treatment, care, rehabilitation, etc., of in-patients and registered outpatients of recognised hospitals. The types of aids and appliances supplied differ to some extent among the States.
Each State has decided and listed the items to be provided generally to patients of its recognised hospitals. Those items have been accepted for the purpose of the cost-sharing arrangements. The Commonwealth has always given consideration to any reasonable State request to extend or vary the list of agreed items.
According to the agreed lists, the position in each State regarding the supply of catheters, stomal appliances and wheelchairs to patients of recognised hospitals is as follows:
New South Wales

(2) I should make it clear that the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) does not itself initiate research but responds to applications made by researchers. These applications are assessed by an independent scientific committee, and, after this peer review process, the

This new program is currently being developed by my Department with a view to its introduction later this year.
Items to be provided under this new Program of Aids for Disabled People include aids for incontinence and wheelchairs (the latter on loan indefinitely). They will be available on prescription and without charge to enable disabled people to live in the community, whether their disability is permanent or of indefinite duration.
War Service Pensions: Eligibility
(Question No. 519)
Mr Beazley asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
(1) Has the Minister seen correspondence in the West Australiatl of 6 December 1980 from Mr H. O. White of Rushbrook Way, Thornlie, Western Australia, on the question of rights to war service pensions for volunteers for overseas service who were not sent to war zones.
(2) If so, will the Minister consider extending war service pension eligibility to persons who accepted the possibility of service overseas during World War II by joining the Australian Imperial Forces.
(3) Is it a fact that eligibility is apparently extended to servicemen, whether or not they were volunteers for overseas service, on Rottnest Island, Western Australia.

(4) Has eligibility been extended to servicemen serving on other Australian island possessions; if so, which ones.

Mr Thomson~The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

(I) Yes.

(2) The service pension was introduced for those veterans who served in a theatre of war to compensate for the indefinable and intangible effects of war service. Eligibility for the service pension is, therefore, dependent upon service in a theatre of war which is defined in section 23 of the Repatriation Act 1920 as follows:

, "Served in a theatre of war" means served at sea, in the

field or in the air, in naval, military or aerial operations

against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of

war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy

was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war

by the person so serving.'

.

The extension of eligibility for the service pension to persons who did not serve in a theatre of war would be contrary to the purpose of this benefit.

(3) Members of the Forces, regardless of the terms of their engagement, who served on Rottnest Island, may he regarded as having served in a theatre of war, provided service there was for a continuous period of not less than three months between 3 September 1939 and 5 May 1944.

(4) Eligibility may be conceded to a member of the Forces who served during World War II on other Australian island possessions at a time when danger from hostile forces was incurred in the area concerned. The declaration of certain areas at certain times as theatres of war is related primarily to known enemy activity in and around these areas. In many cases, an island itself was not subject to enemy activity and may be considered not to have been a theatre of war. However, a veteran who served on such an island may be deemed to have served in a theatre of war, not because of actual service on the island, but because the veteran's passage to the island may have been through an area of known enemy activity. In determining eligibility for the service pension, on the basis of such service, it is necessary to consider each case on its individual merits. For this reason, and because there are a number of islands involved, it is not practicable to provide the precise information requested by the honourable member.

Visual Display Units: Commonwealth Public Servants
(Question No. 545)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
Will he or the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet:
(a) establish a Committee, composed of both public servants and officials of public service unions, to investigate any occupational health and safety problems likely to be encountered by Commonwealth Public Servants in the operation of visual display units,
(b) keep a register of staff users and time spent in operating VDUs, and
(c) conduct regular eyesight tests on staff users ofVDUs.
Mr Viner~The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

1768 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Answers to Questions

(a) The health and safety problems likely to be encountered by Commonwealth Public Servants and others in the operation of visual display units have been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council which has produced an occupational health guide on 'Vision and Eyesight Tests for Visual Display Terminal (VDT) Operators' and a draft occupational health guide on the 'Use of Screenbased Equipment'. The Standing Consultative Committee on Occupational Health Services (which comprises representatives of Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities and staff organisations and makes recommendations to the Director-General of Health) has taken an interest in these issues and has been closely watching progress on the development of the guides.
(b) While the suggestion to maintain a register has been noted, the need to compile and maintain such a detailed record has not been demonstrated.
(c) The occupational health guide, 'Vision and Eyesight Tests for Visual Display Terminal (VDT) Operators', referred to in paragraph (a), recommends the introduction of a program of eyesight tests for staff using VDU's. Some departments have commenced testing programs and the Public Service Board, in conjunction with the Department of Health, is currently examining the feasibility of introducing a servicewide program.

as a direct result of federal election related activities; employment of locally engaged staff to work wholly on federal election related activities at the busier overseas posts, e.g. London,
Port Moresby, Singapore, Athens; overtime worked by locally engaged staff as a direct result of additional work load created by federal election related activities; air freight of election material to overseas posts; advertising costs associated with
advising potential electors of the election and of the availability of postal voting facilities at overseas posts; hire of accommodation and equipment at some posts; printing of postal vote application forms and posters advertising the availability of postal voting facilities in London; miscel1aneous payments for postage and stationery, as well as the cost of supplying updated microfiche electoral rolls for use at posts where Assistant Returning Officers were appointed.

Voting Facilities: Overseas Posts
(Question No. 580)
Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 24 February 1981:
In respect of each of Australia's overseas posts on the occasion of the Federal election of 18 October 1980 (a) what was the cost of providing voting facilities for electors, (b) what would have been the cost of providing voting facilities in those posts where facilities were not made available and (c) how many requests for voting facilities were received by posts where facilities (i) were available and (ii) were not available.
Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
At the time of the 18 October 1980 Federal election there were 95 Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Trade posts overseas.
The Australian Electoral Office, on the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs, appointed Assistant Returning Officers to issue and receive postal voting papers at overseas posts where such appointments were considered necessary to meet the needs of potential voters-54 such appointments were made. The appointment at Bonn also serviced the Cologne post and for the purpose of the election the two posts were treated as one. Appointments were also made at Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands and the RAAF. Base Butterworth.
All other overseas posts (excluding Tehran) were supplied with Postal Vote Application Forms (and with Street Lists and Lists of Pol1ing Places, to assist potential voters to determine the Subdivision and division for which they were enrolled). These posts were instructed to forward any completed Postal Vote Application Forms to the nearest post at which an Assistant Returning Officer had been appointed, for him to issue the appropriate postal voting papers direct to the voter concerned.
The following statistical information and cost details in respect of the 18 October election have been compiled from information supplied by the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources and the Australian Electoral Office. The cost details include overtime worked by Australian based staff

SiemensAG
(Question No. 582)
Mr Holding asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:
Is he able to say whether the West German electrical company, Siemens AG, is involved in any construction projects in Australia; if so, what are these projects.
Sir Phillip Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I am advised that neither Siemens AG nor its Australian Subsidiary, Siemens Industries, is a principal contractor in construction projects for the Commonwealth at present. I am unable to say whether either company is involved in commercial construction projects in Australia, nor the extent to which either company is involved as a major contractor in State Government construction projects.

Tax Avoidance
(Question No. 621)
Mrs Darling asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:
 Is there a need to attract highly qualified personnel from
private industry to fill key positins in the Pu lic Service such as on ministerial staffs and can thts best be achteved by monet ary inducements; if so has the Government considered paying top level salaries to corporate tax lawyers in an attempt to de tect and dismantle tax avoidance schemes.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
Senior positions in the Commonwealth Public Service are commonly advertised as open to persons in the community at large when it is considered desirable to attract people with a variety of experiences and differing backgrounds, where special expertise is required or where there is a shortage of people with appropriate skills.
The salary applicable to a position may be an important factor in determining its acceptability; other factors, such as job location or job content, are also relevant.
The continuing practice of the Australian Taxation office is to recruit persons academically qualified in accounting, law, commerce or economics to administer the taxation laws. They then receive formal and on-the-job training which equips them to carry out tasks requiring a unique mix of legal, ac counting and investigative skills.
The analysis of tax avoidance schemes is carried out by teams of highly skilled and experienced officers located in all taxation branch offices and advice on remedial legislation is given by senior qualified officers of the Head Office of the Commissioner of Taxation.
In these circumstances, it is not considered necessary or de sirable to hire corporate lawyers, but the opinion of outside counsel has been sought when the occasion was seen to require that course.
Social Welfare Supplementary Assistance
(Question No. 624)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:
(1) When was rent allowance renamed supplementary as sistance and for what reason was it renamed.
(2) In order to stem any confusion surrounding the purpose of providing supplementary assistance, will the Government call it rent allowance.
(3) Will the Government consider paying supplementary assistance separately from pension to avoid any confusion.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

(1) Supplementary assistance was introduced for pensioners in 1958 and a similar payment, supplementary allow ance, was introduced for long term sickness beneficiaries in 1970. Neither has been renamed.
(2) There is little evidence of confusion about the purpose of supplementary assistance and it is not merely a rent allow ance. It is provided as a supplementary addition to the pension for what is seen as a particularly needy group of pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries viz. those who pay for rent or for lodgings and who have little or no income apart from their pension.
(3) No. The administrative overheads and additional post age involved in issuing separate cheques for pension and sup plementary assistance would outweigh any advantage this procedure might have. However, pensioners are notified when the rate payable to them includes supplementary assistance.
Rosemount Repatriation Hospital
(Question No. 630)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:
(I) How many wards at Rosemount Repatriation Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, have been opened to patient care dur ing the last 12 months.
(2) How many patients have been at Rosemount Repatriation Hospital for each week since October 1980.
(3) On which occasions were all wards full at Rosemount Repatriation Hospital.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) During the past 12 months the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital had four wards open for patient care.
(2) The daily average number of beds occupied at the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital for each week during the five month period from 7 October 1980 to 10 March 1981 is as follows:

Mr Holding asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 26 February 1981:
Will naval personnel who served in the Vietnam theatre during hostilities there be excluded from the epidemiological survey being carried out by the Commonwealth Institute of Health; if so, why.
Mr Thomson-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
Members of the Navy allotted for special overseas service in Vietnam will be included in an epidemiological study conducted by the Commonwealth Institute of Health. However, it may be necessary for the data on naval personnel to be considered separately from those in the main study.

Coastal Surveillance

Nugan Hand Bank
(Question No, 653)
Mr Willis asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 March 1981:
Has he requested, or directed someone to request on Australia's behalf, that the large stock of information reportedly held by American intelligence authorities on the activities of the N ugan Hand Bank be made available to facilitate an Australian investigation into the collapsed bank.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
Allegations concerning the possible criminal activities of the Nugan Hand group in Australia are being investigated by Commonwealth and New South Wales authorities. I refer the

honourable member to my reply on II March 1981 to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Hansard, Pages 701-702).
Should the New South Wales/Commonwealth Joint Police Task Force on Drug Trafficking investigations involve a need to obtain information from abroad any such request for information would be taken up through appropriate law enforcement channels.

Newspaper Industry: Ownership and Control
(Question No. 715)
Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 5 March 1981:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the inquiry being conducted in Victoria into the ownership and control of the newspaper industry.
(2) Is he able to say whether the inquiry was prompted by the attempted take-over of the Herald and Weekly Times Group by News Limited.
(3) Has his attention been drawn to the report of comments attributed to the Managing Director of the David Syme Group of Companies to the effect that the current mergers provisions of the Trade Practices Act are almost totally ineffectual.
(4) Is there any substance to these comments; if so, will he take necessary steps to ensure that (a) amendments to the Trade Practices Act are introduced to make sure that mergers involving companies which have a large share of substantial markets are regulated in the .public interest (b) the Trade Practices Commission is given adequate staff and resources to speedily and expeditiously investigate any such proposed mergers and (c) the Australian media does not become more heavily concentrated in the hands of one or two individuals or companies.
Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1), (2) and (3) Yes.

(4) In the proposed take-over referred to in the question, the Trade Practices Commission in fact stated its intention to take proceedings for a contravention of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to prohibit the take-over. In the event that action was not taken because the acquiring party decided not to proceed with the proposed take-over.
Integrated Power Grid for South-east Australia
(Question No. 731)
Mr Burr asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 March 1981:
( 1) When does he expect to receive the report from Sir David Zeidler concerning an integrated power grid covering south-east Australia.
(2) Will he ask Sir David to provide an interim report as a matter of urgency in view of the breakdown in negotiations between Tasmania's 2 Houses of Parliament over power development in Tasmania.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generation and Sharing of Power Resources in South-East Australia has been acquiring information relating to its terms of reference since its inception in Aprill980. In view of the technical complexity arising from these terms of reference it is not considered likely that the Committee's report will be available before mid 1981.
(2) As a relatively early final report is anticipated from the inquiry, there would be little advantage in asking it to produce an interim report. While the inquiry is directly concerned with the possibility of further integration of the particular States existing and planned electricity systems, the future pattern of development of the electricity supply system within a particular state is primarily a matter for the State Government concerned.
Commonwealth Offices at Port Augusta, South Australia
(Question No. 738)
Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 10 March 1981:
(1) Who received invitations to the official opening of the new Commonwealth Offices at Port Augusta, South Australia, on Friday, 20 February 1981.
(2) What (a) Federal and (b) State Members of Parliament were invited to the opening and did the invitations include the wives of Members who were invited.

(2) If SQ, what follow-up action has been taken by his Department to implement the recommendations of that meeting that (a) special funding be provided and a National Captioning Centre be set up (b) decoders be provided for eligible hearing-impaired individuals through the Department of Social Security's Rehabilitation Service, (c) research be initiated into problems and options for the introduction .of a capitoning service and (d) a policy regarding the standardisation of a video text technique be adopted.
Mr Sinclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes
(2) No formal recommendations were adopted at the meeting which took the form of exploratory discussions concerning captioned television for the hearing impaired.
Agreement was reached at the meeting to conduct research into the needs and priorities of the audience for a closed captioning system, standardisation of hardware and software, the possibility of using imported captioned material and the demand fDr a centralised captioning service.

(4) (a) and (b) France: One Warrant Officer Assistant appointed concurrently with Defence and Naval Attache; Japan: One Assistant Defence Attache (Translator) (Major Equivalent) appointed; United Kingdom: Several changes over the past five years have resulted in a net increase in Australia-based staff of one (from 42 to 43); United States: Several changes over the past five years have resulted in a net increase in Australia-based staff of three (from 88 to 91 ); Burma: One Warrant Officer Assistant withdrawn concurrently with Defence Attache; New Zealand: One civilian Defence Officer withdrawn; Thailand: One Assistant Attache withdrawn then subsequently reinstated.
(5) The requirements for Defence representation overseas are under constant review and at any one time a number of specific increases or decreases in representation is likely to be under consideration. It would not be appropriate, however, to identifiy a new position until it had been formally established and the agreement of the host country obtained.
The only new position for which host country agreement has been given in principle but to which an appointment has not yet been made is that of Defence Attache to the People's Republic of China. The selection procedure has been set in motion but I cannot yet say when an appointee will take up this position.
IrianJaya
(Question No. 785)
Mr Howe asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 March 1981:
(I) Has he received any reports of the repression of indigenous people in Irian Jaya.
(2) What evidence is there that Irian Jaya is being managed as a colony of Indonesia.
(3) Is he able to say whether (a) decisions about the management of Irian Jaya are being made by the Indonesian Army in close co-operation with the police, (b) the procurements budget is made and approved in Jakarta, (c) outsiders handle nearly all business and (d) compulsory acquisition of land for trans-migrant settlement is deeply resented by the indigenous people.
(4) Will he investigate these matters and report his findings to the Parliament.
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) There have been a number of press reports over a period of years concerning alleged repression of the indigenous people in Irian Jaya. The information that the Government has received indicates that Irian Jaya continues to be faced with serious problems of underdevelopment, isolation and low living standards, which the Indonesian Government is aware of and attempting to overcome.
(2) and (3) Irian Jaya is a province of the Republic of Indonesia and administered as such.

(4) In view of my answer to (2) and (3) above, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the matters raised by the honourable member. As part of its routine activities the Australian Embassy in Jakarta reports to me on, and makes occasional visits to, Irian Jaya, as it does in the case of other Indonesian provinces.
Toxic Shock Syndrome
(Question No. 789)
Mr Howe asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 11 March 1981:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to reports of the so-called toxic shock syndrome which it is believed may be associated with the use of Carefree and Meds tampons manufactured by Johnson and Johnson.
(2) Is he able to say whether there were 725 registered cases of the disease in the United States of America in 1980 and that 8 per cent of registered cases had been fatal.
(3) What research has been published in the USA or in Australia which might assist in defining the precise causes of the disease.
(4) What efforts has he made to investigate the safety of tampons manufactured by Johnson and Johnson.
(5) Will he ensure that these products are withdrawn from the market until (a) these investigations are completed and (b) there can be a public inquiry to determine their safety.
Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) My information is that approximately 725 cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome (T.S.S.) were reported in the USA. during 1980. The overall case fatality rate was 7.8 per cent.
(3) Most information is derived from American experiences and reports. Reports have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, the British Medical Journal and other medical journals, as well as official publications of the Centre for Disease Control, Atlanta, and the Department of Health and Human Services, USA.
These articles have traced the recognition of the syndrome and its link with staphylococcal infection, menstruation and tampon usage, research into the characteristics of the causative organism and its toxins, factors associated with tampon use and detailed case reports.
All cases confirmed in Australia have been reported in the Communicable Diseases Intelligence Bulletins, published by my Department.
(4) Samples of all tampons manufactured by Johnson and Johnson on sale in Australia have been submitted to chemical and bacteriological testing. Samples of tampons made in New Zealand by Johnson and Johnson were extensively re-tested in Australia and New Zealand following reports of the first two cases ofT.S.S. To date there has been no evidence of contamination of unused tampons by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This confirms similar findings in the United States and Canada. Inspection of the manufacturing processes has been carried out.
(5) (a) All New Zealand made tampons were voluntarily withdrawn from sale by the manufacturers. On completion of the tests and in the absence of any positive findings the withdrawal was lifted on 5 March 1981.
(b) Investigations are proceeding and withdrawal from sale pending a public inquiry is not considered to be warranted.

Answers to Questions

River Murray Salinity Control
(Question No. 822)
Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 12 March 1981:
(1) What is the current estimated annual cost of salinity control in the River Murray to (a) industry, (b) agriculture and (c) water reticulation authorities (i) along the river and (ii) in South Australia.
(2) To what figure will this cost rise if salinity levels in the River Murray continue to increase at the present rate.
(3) What is the Government's estimate in years of the remaining period of viability for present forms of irrigated agriculture in the Riverland area of South Australia.
(4) Is the cost of salinity control borne disproportionately by South Australia, and has South Australia no control over actions taken by upstream States which worsen salinity; if so, will the Commonwealth provide compensation to South Australia or seek it from the States upstream for the cost burden imposed by additional salinity problems they might create.
(5) Has the Government examined any legal obligations it might have to compensate South Australia for diminished water quality flowing into that State; if not, why not.
(6) Will the Commonwealth Government provide finance for alternative sources of water or desalination measures to supply South Australia, should River Murray water continue to decline in quality; if not, why not.
(7) Has the Government made any costing of these alternatives to River Murray water; if not, why not.
Mr Anthony-The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) and (2) There are no estimates available on a common basis of salinity control costs in the various categories of uses of River Murray water. However, this financial year the Commonwealth is providing assistance to the three States on a dollar-for-dollar basis for salinity control works to implement the Maunsell plan of action for dealing with salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley, as follows: New South Wales $2.23 million, Victoria $1.473 million, and South Australia $2.325 million. In addition, the River Murray Commission has budgetted for an expenditure of $118,000 this year on salinity control works within this area of responsibility.
(3) There is no evidence to suggest that irrigated agriculture in South Australia is likely to become non-viable in the foreseeable future. To the contrary, salinity control works now being undertaken in all three States, together with proposed new water quality functions for the River Murray Commission, could lead to a gradual reduction in salinity in River Murray water used for agriCUlture in South Australia.
(4) Estimates are not available to enable the costs to South Australia of salinity in its water supplies to be compared with those of the other States. The Commonwealth does not have responsibility for advising what control South Australia has on action of upstream States which worsen salinity in the Murray nor for paying compensation or secking compensation from other States in relation to salinity problems in South Australia. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is making a significant financial contribution towards the cost of improving water quality in South Australia by funding salinity control projects in all three States, works undertaken by the River Murray Commission and by assistance towards the cost of filtration plants for Adelaide's water supplies.

(5) Yes. I have been advised that the Commonwealth has no legal obligation to compensate South Australia for water quality problems in the River Murray in that State.
(6) and (7) Action now being taken by the Commonwealth and the States in the control of salinity in the Murray Valley and proposed water quality responsibilities for the River Murray Commission should tend to ensure that river water quality in South Australia does not decline to a point where alternative sources of water or desalination measures are necessary.
Aborigines: Discrimination
(Question No. 828)
Mrs Darling asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 12 March 1981.
Further to his reply to my question without notice of 26 November 1980 (Hansard, page 53) concerning the document entitled 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices submitted to the United States of America Congress by the US. Department of State, have misgivings been expressed officially or unofficially by his Government to the Government of Queensland that propagation of the fact that Queensland has been accused of administering certain laws relating to Aborigines in a way that has the effect of discriminating between the rights of white and black Australians (a) will have a pernicious effect on Australia's international relations and reputation, particularly with Third World countries and (b) will jeopardise the participation of some Commonwealth countries in the 1982 Commonwealth Games to be held in Brisbane.
Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(a) and (b): The Government will continue its policy of consulting with Queensland on matters which affect Aboriginals. It is my understanding that African countries are keen to come to the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. I am aware that the possibility of a boycott to the Games has been raised in the context of domestic and external events. However, I believe that African nations are presently more concerned with events outside Australia.
Women's Refuges: Confidentiality of Addresses
(Question No. 834)
Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 12 March 1981:
(1) Did a delegation consisting of a large group of women workers from all the women's refuges in Victoria visit Parliament House, Canberra, on Tuesday, 10 March 1981, and deliver strong submissions to him for the retention of the confidentiality of the addresses of these refuges.
(2) Will he agree to the women's submissions and allow the practice of confidentiality to continue; if not, why not.
(3) Does the Government intend to stop funding the refuges if his request for the address is not acceded to.
Mr MacKellar The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) I received no submissions from any delegatIon of workers from women's refuges in Victoria on 10 March. I did meet a national delegation of women's refuge representatives on 11 March, but recall no discussion on the confidentiality of addresses of Victorian women's refuges at that meeting. In Melbourne on 19 March, I met representatives of Victorian women's refuges specifically to discuss the provision of addresses of Victorian women's refuges to my Department.

(2) My Department will continue its present procedures under which confidentiality is strictly applied to any residential addresses of women's refuges which it holds.
(3) The question of what action may be taken is currently under consideration.
Student Assistance Programs
(Question No. 835)
Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 12 March 1981:
(1) Is his Department currently conducting an overall review of all student assistance programs, as stated in the draft 1979 Survey of Tertiary Student Finances, Final Report.
(2) If so, (a) what is the purpose of the review, (b) what kinds of information are being collected and utilised for thereview, (c) when is it intended that the review be completed, and when will he make available the results of the review and (d) will he consult with student representatives, including the Australian Union of Students, before any policy changes are implemented.
Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
( 1) All Departmental student assistance programs are reviewed regularly. Projects currently in progress as part of the Department's Review and Evaluation Program concern the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS), the Postgraduate Awards Scheme, and Isolated Children's Assistance Scheme.
(2) Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS)-
(a) The purpose of the review is to determine patterns of income and expenditure of tertiary students, and to obtain information on the socio-economic background of students, on social mobility, and on course progress and attrition rates.
(b) Some information has been (or will be obtained) from questionnaires. Additionally, interviews will be conducted with randomly selected samples of students.
(c) The reports arising from the various components of this evaluation will be issued as a series entitled "Studies of Tertiary Student Finances". Volumes 1, 2 and 3 are expected to be published in the first half of 1981. Subsequent volumes will be available during 1982.
(d) The Australian Union of Students has participated in the planning of the evaluation. In addition, the views of student representatives, including the Australian Union of Students, are taken into account in the review of TEAS conditions which takes place each year in the Budget context.
Secondary Allowance Scheme-
(a) The purpose of the review is to discover the level of awareness of the scheme amongst students and parents potentially eligible to receive an allowance and to determine the extent to which the allowance influences decisions to continue schooling through the final two years of secondary education.
(b) Data collection involves questionnaires and interviews with Queensland metropolitan and country students and their parents; it also uses information collected for Sydney secondary school students for another research study.
(c) The final report is expected in mid 1981.

(d) It will not be possible to consult organisations representing secondary school level students. However, the nature of the review ensures that the opinions of students and their parents have been canvassed.
Postgraduate Awards Scheme-
(a) The purpose of the evaluation is to examine to what extent the scheme has met its objectives and to review these objectives.
(b) The in-house component of the study examines the progress of award-holders who commenced study in universities and colleges of advanced education in the mid-seventies. The externally commissioned component of the study will concentrate firstly on Research awards and will examine the effectiveness of the Scheme in meeting its objectives as well as the appropriatness of present objectives.
(c) The internal component will be completed before June 1981 and it is expected that the external evaluation will be completed by 1982.
(d) The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations is represented on the Steering Committee guiding the external study.
Assistance for Isolated Children-
(a) The purpose of the review is to analyse the elfects of the scheme on individuals and schools, to report on any anomalies in its administration and to make recommendations for its future development in relation to general developments in rural education.
(b) Information will be collected from administrative records, and from surveys and interviews of parents of beneficiaries of the scheme. Some schools and hostels will be approached. The study will cover Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales students.
(c) The report is expected to be completed by June 1981.
(d) The appropriate body to be involved in this study is the Isolated Children's Parents Association. This body has co-operated with the researchers in gaining parent participation.
Aluminium Industry
(Question No. 837)
Dr Everingham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 March 1981:
(I) Has the High Court ruled that Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation is in Australian hands and therefore cannot be taxed on profits at market rates received by its Hong Kong subsidiary for Australian alumina.
(2) Did Comalco structure its prices so that Australian profits, taxed at 47.5 per cent, were low, and Hong Kong resale profits, taxed at 12.5 per cent, were high.
(3) Did the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in July 1980, criticise Australia's apparent undue subsidies to the aluminium industry by below-market pricing of coal for power generation and inclusion in electricity tariffs of historical capital costs instead of replacement costs, so that future consumers will have to finance borrowing for plant replacements.
(4) Does the Government accept the OECD conclusions that these subsidies could lead to poor allocation of resources, and the claims of other economiSts that efficiency, profitability and employment levels can be expected to suffer in other industries which are more labour-intensive and are attempting to increase Australian exports or increase their competitiveness with imports.

1780 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April J981

Answers to Questions

(5) Will the Government insist on adequate returns to Australia for our minerals and energy considering world prices, taxation law and government incentives to exporters.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The decision of the High Court in F.C. of T. v Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Limited is reported in volume 80 of Australian Tax Cases at page 4373.
The report discloses that the case involved the application of section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Commissioner of Taxation. That section applies where, among other things, an Australian business is either controlled principally by non-residents or is carried on by a company which controls a non-resident subsidiary and, because of those circumstances, the business produces less taxable income than might otherwise be expected.
The High Court held that the provisions of section 136 did not apply to the particular facts of the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case. The majority of the Court found as a fact that, in the years in question, the business of the company was controlled principally by directors who were residents of Australia.
As I indicated in my statement to the House of 12 March 1981, section 136 is under review with particular regard to the above mentioned case.
(2) There is no information on this matter contained in the published report of the case. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that he is precluded by the secrecy provisions of the income tax law from commenting on it.
(3) The last OECD Survey of the Australian economy, released in June 1980, canvassed a number of issues relating to the pricing of energy resources and concluded that ". . . the pricing of some energy forms, particularly electricity, may not in some areas be ideal for proper resource allocation and would appear to involve undue subsidies" (p. 55).
(4) This conclusion by the OECD reflects its concern that the pricing of energy resources in general, including electricity, should be such as to ensure efficiency in the allocation ofthose resources.
The Government believes that resource allocation issues should be properly taken into account in energy pricing, as is evidenced by its policy of import parity pricing of indigenous crude oil.
The determination of the terms and conditions under which electricity is made available to particular consumers by State electricity authorities is the responsibility of the State Governments concerned.
(5) The Government is anxious that a fair share of the income generated by projects developing our minerals and energy resources accrues to Australians or is otherwise spent in Australia. Such projects, of course, generate considerable expenditure in Australia for the purchase of goods and services and the payment of wages and the effects of this flow on to the economy generally. Beyond that, the Government's foreign investment policy stipulates that, wherever practicable, Australians should have the opportunity to participate with foreign investors in major projects and this is a significant avenue for a share of the benefits arising from the development of national resources to accrue to Australians. Taxation of the income generated by major projects-both at its source and again if repatriated abroad-is another important avenue through which benefits accrue to Australians. The States, too, have a role to play through the tenns and conditions applying to the provision of projects' energy and infrastructure requirements.

Navigational Aids in Hazardous Areas
(Question No. 865)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
(1) Has the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report on oil spills that the Minister for Transport review, as a matter of urgency, the provision of navigational aids in hazardous areas, with particular reference to the addition of two telemetric gauges in the Torres Strait, been carried out.
(2) What specific innovations to marine navigational aid technology have been implemented by his Department since 1978.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The provision of navigational aids in hazardous areas has been reviewed and a number of actions have been planned or taken since 1978. It is expected that tide monitoring and telemetry equipment will be installed at Turtle Head, Hammond Island in the Torres Strait by the end of 1981. Consideration is also being given to the installation of additional tide monitoring equipment at other locations in the Torres Strait.
(2) The more significant innovations which have been implemented since 1978 include the introduction of a standardised range of low maintenance lattice towers for supporting equipment in cyclonic areas, the installation of a solar powered light and the installation of a wind driven generator for powering a light.
Safe Oil Tanker Operating Procedures
(Question No. 866)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
What number of ships' personnel have undertaken short courses since 1978 in safe oil tanker operating procedures, either through the Australian Maritime College or through a training program initiated by his Department.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
A total of II tanker safety courses have been conducted since 1978.
A total of 139 ships' personnel have been identified as having attended these courses.
The next series of tanker safety courses commences at the Australian Maritime College on 11 May 1981.
Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service
(Question No. 867)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
What progress has been made towards the implementation of the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on its report on oil spills that the Hydrographic Service of the Royal Australian Navy widen the recommended tracks on navigation charts covering the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

Answers to Questions

29 April 1981 REPRESENTATIVES 1781

There are marked differences of opinion among pro fessional mariners familiar with the waters of the Great Barrier Reef on the safety issues which the adoption of this rec ommendation would create. While on the one hand broadening the recommended track may lessen the chances of a collision, it may on the other hand increase the risk of grounding.
A working party consisting of senior representatives of Commonwealth and Queensland Departments and some of the major users of these waters has been convened by my De partment and is working to find the safest solution.

1979-80Accurate figures for the total health expenditure by source of finance is dependent on receipt of information from other Government sources. As the information
required has not yet been received, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of expenditure by source. The information that
is available, however, suggests that total health expenditure will be of the order of $8,800m.

What steps have been taken toward the Australian Government's ratification of the International Convention on Train ing Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable
member's question is as follows:
Australia signed the International Convention on Stan dards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Sea farers, 1978 (STCW}, subject to ratification, on 30 November 1979. The Convention relates to both international and domestic shipping. It is necessary, therefore to ensure that not only Commonwealth legislation but also State and Northern Terri tory legislation gives effect to the requirements of the Conven tion before Australia ratifies the Convention. Action is pro ceeding through the Marine and Ports Council of Australia (MPCA) to develop the appropriate legislation.
The Commonwealth enabling legislation is contained in Navigation Amendment Act No. 98 of 1979 and subsidiary legislation in the form of regulations and orders is well under way.

Additional Payments to Pensioners
(Question No. 876}
Mr Good luck asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
What would it cost the Government to pay an additional week's payment to all pensioners one week before Christmas.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
The cost to the Government of paying an additional week's payment of pension and allowances to all pensioners (including supporting parent beneficiaries) is estimated to be about $115 million, based on current rates of pension and numbers of pensioners current at December 1980. This cost would of course be greater if the additional week's payment was made in December 1981, as the numbers of pensioners and the rates of pension will increase during the year.

The States and the Northern Territory are also working towards adjustment of their legislation which will comp lement the Commonwealth legislation to give complete cover age for all of the requirements of the STCW Convention and thus allow for its ratification by Australia. It is hoped that this will be possible by the end of 1982 or early 1983.
The Convention will enter into force 12 months after the date on which it has been ratified by not less than 25 countries, the combined merchant fleets of which constitute not less than 50 per cent of the world tonnage. The latest report indi cates that 9 countries, representing 39 per cent of the world tonnage have ratified the Convention.

Mr Les McMahon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 March 1981 :
How many applications for invalid pensions have been (a} received and (b) rejected by the Department of Social Se curity in the last 5 years.
Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
Separate statistics on claims received for invalid pensions are not available, only combined totals for age and invalid pensions are maintained. Separate information is, however, available on claims determined.The numbers of claims for invalid pension determined, and the number rejected, by the Department of Social Security during the period January 1976 to December 1980 inclusive, was respectively 388,800 and 69,400.

Cost of Reducing Age for Eligibility for the Male Age Pension
(Question No. 903)
Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
(I) What is the estimated (a) savings or (b) cost to revenue of reducing the age for eligibility for the male age pension to 60 years, during periods of high unemployment.
(2) What is the method of calculating the range of final figures.

Mr Hunt-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
(1) and (2). It is not possible to estimate with ac~uracy the additional cost of paying an income tested age pension to men aged 60 to 64 years because of the lack of data on their income distribution. In addition, it is not known what effect the lowering-of the pensionable age would have on workfo"ce participation rates of men aged 60 to 64 years.-
It is also not possible to -estimate with any accuracy the extent of any savings that would result from younger unemployment beneficiaries getting jobs consequent upon any reduction in the workforce participation of men aged 60 to 64 years. It is expected, however, that substantial additional costs would be involved. The estimated cost of paying an income test free pension to all men from age 60 gives some indication of the order of magnitude of the maximum gross costs which could be involved in lowering the pensionable age for men from 65 to 60.
The additional cost of paying an income test free pension to all of the 288,000 residentially qualified men aged 60 to 64 years would be about $550 million in a full year. This cost is additional to the estimated $300 million annual cost of existing payments to some 110,000 male invalid and repatriation service pensions and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries aged 60 to 64 years. These costs are based on the estimated number of residentially qualified males aged 60 to 64 years in the population, and male pensioners and beneficiaries aged 60 to 64 years as at December 1980, and pension rates applicable from November 1980. The costs are gross costs in that they make no allowance for the additional revenue that would resuIt from the inclusion of the payments in income for the purpose of income tax.
The actual gross costs that would be involved in lowering the pensionable age for men from 65 to 60 could be expected to be somewhat lower than the maximum cost set out above, particularly in the short-term since many older people would have already planned their retirement on the basis of age pension eligibility at age 65.
Budget Car Rentals
(Question No. 90S)
Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1981:
(1) Has his attention been drawn to a claim by Mr R. G. Ansett of Budget Car Rentals that Trans Australia Airlines is paying $5m more than Budget for an identical facility at airports.
(2) Is there any substance to this claim, if so, what is the reason for this difference.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) Yes.
(2) The results of tenders for car rental positions at Commonwealth airports were published in the Commonwealth Gazette on 9 October 1979. The two national facilities were won by Kay Rent-a-Car Pty Ltd, (operating as Hertz) with a guaranteed minimum bid of $8,014,435 and Budget Rent-aCar Pty Ltd, with a guaranteed minimum bid of $3,167,060, both over five years. Both companies are also committed to pay an additional ree based on the level of business conducted at airports over the five year contract period. Consequently, the difference in actual payments by the two national operators will not be known until the contracts have terminated. The respective bids, no doubt, reflect the commercial judgement of the two tenderers.

(3) During the years in question, there has been no fixed formula governing the distribution of Commonwealth road grants among the States. However, allocations to individual States have taken account of assessments of relative road needs undertaken by the former Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. The proportion of the Commonwealth grant provided to South Australia has generally been slightly in excess of the share recommended by the Bureau of Roads in its Reports 'Roads in Australia 1973' and 'Roads in Australia 1975'.

Tax Evasion (Question No. 917)
Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 March 1981:
(l) Has the Australian Taxation Office undertaken any studies into the extent of tax evasion in Australia; if so, what are the estimates of the loss to revenue due to tax evasion.
(2) Has the Office compiled representative income profiles of various groups of non-Pay-AsYou-Earn taxpayers; if so, which groups are involved.
(3) How are these profiles used to prevent tax evasion and are they proving effective.
(4) Has the Taxation Office undertaken an investigation into tax evasion in the building and construction industry; if so, what is the extent of tax evasion in this industry and what is being done to prevent it.

(5) Are other measures being employed by the Taxation Office to prevent tax evasion; if so, what are the details.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable
member's question is as follows:
The Commissioner of Taxation has provided the following information:
( l) Research is currently being undertaken with the object of developing methods of estimating the extent of tax evasion.
(2) Profiles, or more correctly, analyses indicating the dis tribution of taxpayers according to specific criteria, e.g. industry and occupation, region, level of turnover and net profit, are compiled from data extracted from the income tax returns of all non-corporate business and professional taxpayers.
(3) These analyses provide a means, albeit elementary, of assisting field staff in the screening of income tax re turn data with a view to the selection of taxpayers for audit/investigation examination. Although the ana lyses are considered to be quite effective in achieving this purpose, research is being carried out to develop more sophisticated screening methods.
(4) In recent years taxation officers have carried out a number of specific projects designed to detect in stances of tax evasion in the building and construction industry. While these projects have been spread over a wide area of Australia it was considered that the re sults obtained would not form a sound basis for measuring the extent of tax evasion in the total industry.
(5) In addition to audit and investigation operations, the Taxation Office undertakes a number of information matching programmes whereby data (e.g. details of dividend and interest payments) are obtained from exterior sources and matched with information disclosed in income tax returns. The purpose of these programmes is not only to detect tax evasion but to en courage the highest possible level of compliance from taxpayers through the knowledge that such pro grammes are conducted. Enforcement activities also include action to detect persons who are obliged, but who have failed, to lodge income tax returns.
Statistics relating to the revenue results achieved from all enforcement programmes were detailed in the Commissioner's 59th Report to Parliament.
Australian Diplomacy

Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 March 1981:
(1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the 'Week end Australian', 7-8 March 1981, page .B of the magazine section, entitled 'Australia's role in UN Tower of Babel'.
(2) If so, does the article point to weaknesses in Australia's diplomatic voice due to factionalism, deliberate nationalism, nepotism, sexism, lack of expert advisers and under represen tation and feelings among the staff of alienation from Australia to the detriment of Australia's interests especially in the use of outer space and the high seas.
(3) Will the Government set an example to other nations by giving an official role in UN negotiations to appropriate representatives of grass-roots Australian organisations, including experts in international law, satellite technology, mar ine studies and peace studies.

1784 REPRESENTATIVES 29 April 1981

Answers to Questions

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(1) Yes.

(2) and (3) As I understand the article, the allegations con-

cerning 'factionalism, deliberate nationalism, nepotism (&)

sexism' refer to the permanent staff of the UN secretariat and

not to any 'weakness in Australia's diplomatic voice'.

.

As for the alleged "lack of expert advisers and under rep-
resentation", it will be appreciated that it is not possible, given the need for financial restraint, for Australia to be represented at all United Nations conferences by specialists. In 1980 there were over 200 UN conferences and this figure does not in-
clude meetings of the specialized agencies. No member state is represented by specialists at all UN conferences. This is a fact of life not only for Australia but, to varying degrees, for all members of the United Nations.

In this respect, the question refers in particular to the fields
of outer space and the high seas. The chairman of the major sub-committee of the United Nations Committee on Outer Space is Professor J. H. Carver of the Australian National University, who is only one of a number of experts who rep-
resent Australia at UN conferences on outer space. Australian delegations to sessions of the Conference on the Law of the Sea include specialist representatives drawn from the Depart-
ments of Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Defence, Trade and Resources, Primary Industry, Attorney-General's, National Development and Energy, as well as from State Governments and the Australian mining industry.

The article also refers to Australia's non-representation on the "committee which is drafting the final agreement on rights of the sea". I believe that this is a reference to the Drafting
Committee of the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea. This Committee has only 23 members, and Australia is not one of them. However, Australia is a member of other important committees of the Conference, in accordance with the UN practice whereby membership of key committees is distributed equitably among all UN member countries.

On those occasions when it decided not to send a specialist representative from Australia to a United Nations Conference, members of our permanent missions to the United
Nations, who themselves have considerable experience-and often specialist training-are guided by detailed briefs which draw on expert advice available in Australia.

Toxic Shock Syndrome
(Question No. 923)
Dr Blewett asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 26 March 1981:
(I) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the National Watchdog, 23 March 1981, that a senior officer of the National Biological Standards Laboratory visited the United States of America in October 1980, with his fares and expenses being paid by Johnson and Johnson Pty Ltd.
(2) Is the officer referred to Dr D. J. McKay, and is he the head of the Bacterial Products Section of the National Biological Standards Laboratory.
(3) Is the Bacterial Products Section of the National Biological Standards Laboratory currently undertaking an inquiry into bacteriological aspects oftampons in relation to the toxic shock syndrome.
(4) Is it a fact that Johnson and Johnson Pty Ltd and their subsidiary companies manufacture more than 80 per cent of the tampons used in Australia.
(5) Did Dr McKay disclose, according to the prescribed procedures, any interest which conflicts or might reasonably

be thought to conflict with Dr McKay's public duty or improperly to influence Dr McKay's conduct in the discharge.of the doctor's responsibilities in respect of some matter With which Dr McKay is concerned.

(6) Did Dr McKay inform his Chief Officer of the potential conflict of interest.

(7) Is the potential conflict of interest recorded (a) in the departmental subject file relating to the matter in respect .of which the conflict exists and (b) on a central record of conflict
of interest declarations and decisions maintained within his Department.

Mr MacKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) Yes. Dr D. J. McKay, in charge of the Sterility Unit of the National Biological Standards Laboratory (NBSL), attended the 2~~ In~ernational ~ilmer Memori~l Conference on The StenlisatlOn of Medical Products, 111 Washington, USA on 16 and 17 October 1980.

The conference, amongst other matters, reviewed the
official requirements for sterilisation and sterility testing used in different countries. Dr McKay (and his official counterparts from USA, Canada, Great Britain and a number of other countries) attended so that industry could be ad-
equately informed of Australia's official requirements. Fares and expenses for the officials from other countries as well as Dr McKay, were met, it is understood, by Johnson and John-
son Ltd.

In addition, the following two organisations are members of the Non-Aligned Movement:
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO); South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO).
Kampuchea's seat in the Non-Aligned Movement has been kept vacant since 1979, pending a resolution of the competing claims by the regimes of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) and the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). Chile has not attended NAM meetings since the overthrow of the Allende regime in 1973, but has not been expelled from the Movement. At the NAM Foreign Ministers' meeting in N~w Delhi

in February this year, St Lucia was welcomed to NAM membership. Also at that meeting, Belize (formerly British Honduras, which is expected to attain its independence this year) was granted special status (honorary membership) with the right to address the meeting. Malawi was not represented at the New Delhi meeting. Burma withdrew from the NAM after the Havana Summit meeting in 1979, and at present appears to have no intention of rejoining the Movement. Moves by some members to have Egypt expelled from the NAM have not succeeded.
(2) The following countries have concluded treaties of peace, friendship and co-operation with the Soviet Union:
Afghanistan, Angola, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic People's Republic of Yemen, Ethiopia. India, Iraq, Mozambique, Syrian Arab Republic and Vietnam.
(3) The Soviet Union has bilateral agreements with many countries, the full details of which are not readily available from Departmental records. To research all of these would he particularly time-consuming but if the honourable member has in mind particular countries or types of treaties, I would be pleased to furnish further information.

Temperature Readings, Hobart
(Question No. 988)
Mr Good luck asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 April l981:
(1) In what locality does the Bureau of Meteorology deter mine the daily temperature of Hobart, Tasmania.
(2) Has his attention been drawn to the fact, that if the
temperature is gauged on the leeward side of Mount Welling ton, this tends to register the lowest temperature which has a detrimental effect on tourists wishing to visit Hobart and also on the morale of the local people.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) The Bureau of Meteorology's official temperature ob servations for Hobart are taken at the Tasmanian Regional

Office of the Bureau which is located about one kilometre to the south of the Hobart city centre. The site is well exposed in all directions.
(2) The prevailing wind streams over southern Tasmania
are westerly and therefore the observing site is often on the leeward side of Mount Wellington. However 1 am informed by the Director of Meteorology that the flow of air over mountains often leads to a warming of the air on the leeward side. This effect, known as the Foehn wind effect, is character istic of nearly all mountain areas and would tend to make the temperatures registered in Hobart higher than on the wind ward side of Mount Wellington.
Statistics on temperature at various locations in the Hobart area show there is very little variation from the readings obtained at the Bureau site and these official recordings are therefore a good representation of the temperatures experi enced by the majority of the population of Hobart.

Oestradiol-17B
(Question No. 999)
Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 1 April 1981 :
Is it a fact that the use of oestradiol-17B in a form known by brandname as Compud08e avoids the concerns that have been associated with compressed tablet anabolic implants in livestock.
Mr Nixon-The answer to Mr Kerin's question is as follows:
The product known by the brandname Compudose consists of a silicone rubber implant impregnated with oestradiol-17B and is designed to allow removal prior to the slaughter of the treated animal. It is claimed that this form of administration

ensures that the oestradiol levels in treated animals are not in excess of natural levels at the time of slaughter. The product has not been evaluated for use in Australia by the relevant subsidiary committees of the Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. These committees make recommendations to the States which have the responsibility for the registration and control of veterinary drugs.

Aircraft Noise
(Questiou No. 1029)
Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 1 April 1981:
(1) Did the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, dated October 1970, recommend that as a noise abatement measure, the glide slope at Australian airports should be standardised at 30 wherever possible.
(2) On which runways at Kingsford-Smith Airport is an Instrument Landing System (ILS) operative.
(3) What is the glide slope on each runway served by the ILS.
(4) What procedures have been introduced to ensure that the angle of the glide path is observed by pilots (a) when using the ILS and (b) when using a visual approach.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes.
(2) Runway 07, Runway 16 and Runway 34.
(3) The angle of the glide slope on each runway is 3 degrees.
(4) The following instruction (in Aeronautical Information Publication, Terminal Area Procedures, page TMA-4-2, Paragraph 1.7) has been issued to pilots. Pilots are not to make approaches to land below the visual or electronic glide paths for the runway in use.

Aboriginal Voter Education Program
(Question No. 1036)
Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 7 April 1981 :
(1) Will the Aboriginal voter education program conducted by the Australian Electoral office be sending a team to Western Australia during 1981.
(2) If so, to which communities and on what dates will it be
sent.
(3) What does this program involve.
(4) Is it possible for Aboriginal people in the remote communities to obtain assistance from the voter education unit in enroliing for State and Commonwealth Electoral rolls.
Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes.
(2) The team will be visiting Aboriginal communities in the south west of the State up until the end of June 1981 and will then move its activities to communities in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions. Specific dates of visits cannot be given since the team's itineraries are only worked out several weeks in advance after consultation with the Aboriginal communities in the areas to be visited.
(3) The program seeks to inform Aboriginal people about Commonwealth and State parliamentary and electoral systems. Using a range of specially developed audio-visual teaching aids the program covers the role of parliament, the

qualifications for and process of enrolment and the procedures for casting a formal vote. The actual content and level of the program varies from one community to another depending on the previous experience of individuals and their understanding of the electoral system.
(4) Yes.
Australian Taxation Office: Issue of Taxation Notices
(Question No. 1047)
Mr Kent asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 April 1981:
(1) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that the introduction of computers into the Australian Taxation office resulted in the issuing of taxation notices to businesses earlier than in the past thus requiring payment of taxes at an earlier date.
(2) Will he consider allowing small businesses a longer interest free period to pay taxes than the 33 days currently allowed in view of the changed arrangements and having regard to the high rate of bankruptcy among small businesses.
Mr Howard-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) The Taxation Office has used computers to issue notices of assessment since 1966. The rate of issue of notices is marginally higher in 1980-81 than it was in 1979-80 but the reasons for this are more related to earlier lodgment of returns and growth in the taxpayer population than to the use of computers to prepare the notices. The overall effect of these changes is that slightly more tax becomes due for payment by 31 March which is the earliest due date for payment by persons subject to provisional tax. Most taxpayers have not been affected but some have been required to pay a little earlier than in previous years.
(2) In performing his statutory functions, the Commissioner of Taxation must have regard to the fiscal requirements of the Budget which are framed on the assumption that taxpayers will meet their obligations as they become due and that most of the tax due in a financial year will be collected within that year, i.e., by 30 June. For these reasons it is the established practice to grant extensions of time to pay only to those taxpayers who are able to demonstrate that they are experiencing serious financial difficulties caused by unforeseen circumstances. This procedure seems to be no more than fair to the great majority of taxpayers whose financial affairs are arranged so as to enable their taxation commitments to be promptly met.
Cyclone Prediction
(Qnestion No. 1052)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 April 1981:
Further to his reply to my question No. 526 (Hansard. 12 March 198 ~, page 803) concerning a joint Austrahan/Amencan cyclone research program known as Project Stormfury, for what reason has agreement not been reached with the Government of the United States of America on the conditions under which the project could be undertaken.
Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Australian Government has not been able to agree with the United States Government on the arrangements for sharing liability in the event that damage is perceived to have occurred from any activities under the project.

Concessional Bus Travel for Children
(Question No. 1055)
Mrs Kelly asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 7 April 1981:
What concessions exist in each State and Territory for bus travel by children.
Mr HuntThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The information sought by the honourable member is not held by my Department, as the provision and regulation of bus services is primarily the responsibility of the State and Territory Governments.
Canberra-Sydney Rail Link
(Question No, 1056)
Mrs Kelly asked the Ivlinister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 April 1981:
(1) Have negotiations been undertaken between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments in relation to the development and upgrading of the Canberra-Sydney rail link; if so, what are the details and has any costing or feasibility study been completed on this malter.
(2) In relation to the feasibility study of the electrification of the Melbourne-Sydney line, is a spur line to Canberra being considered; if not, why not.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(I) I am adviscd by the Minister for the Capital Territory that negotiations betwecn him and the NSW Minister for Transport and by officers of their Departments are continuing. The outcome of the negotiations will have to be considered by both the Commonwealth and State Governments and it is therefore not possible to provide details at this stage.
(2) The study examining the proposal to electrify the Sydney to Melbourne railway also examined the electrification of the Goulburn to Canberra railway. The study found that the economic return on the electrification of the Goulburn to Canberra railway was significantly less than for the Sydney to Melbourne railway and recommended that the decision on electrification of the Goulburn to Canberra railway should be deferred at least until the completion of the electrification from Sydney to Goulburn.
Housing Construction Program at the Warmun Community in Turkey Creek, Western Australia
(Question No. 1063)
Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Housing and Construction, upon notice, on 2 April 1981:

Australian National Railways Concessional Freight Rates
(Question No. 1076)
Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 7 April 1981:
(\) Does the Australian National Railways offer concession freight rates to the major road hauliers for the transport of their containers and road freight vehicles on railways operated by ANR
(2) If so, how do these freight rates compare with rates charged to individual consignors of similar type traffic on ANR.
Mr Hunt-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(\) Yes. The Australian National Railways Commission makes special contract container and pick-a-back rates available to all customers who are able to satisfy the minimum requirement of the Australian rail systems in regard to annual tonnages and terminal facilities. Under the provisions of the Australian National Railways Act my approval of these rates is not required.
(2) The relationship between rates charged under forwarding agent contract conditions and rates available to customers who do not satisfy the requirements associated with those rates is a matter for the commercial judgement of the Commission, or, in the case of intersystem consignments, of all the railway systems co-operating through the Railways of Australia Committee.
Distillate Prices: Effects on Prawn Exporting Countries
(Question No. 1089)
Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 7 April 1981:
(1) Was he recently presented with a report prepared by the Northern Fishing Companies Association (NFCA) showing the effects of rising distillate prices on the prawn exporting companies.
(2) If so, did this report state that unless relief was given to prawn exporting companies during the next 12 to 24 months there would be business failures in the fishing industry amounting to tens of millions of dollars.
(3) What action has he taken in response to the representation by the NFCA.

(Question No. 1117)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 7 April:
(1) Can he say whether (a) Algeria, (b) Bangladesh, (c) Brazil, (d) Guyana, (e) the Ivory Coast, (f) Nigeria, (g) the Philippines, (h) Sweden, (j) Tanzania, (k) Venezuela and (1) Yugoslavia are given greater pre-eminence in world affairs than Australia.
(2) Is he also able to say why those countries have been invited to attend a summit meeting to be held on 22-23 October 1981 and not Australia.
(3) Is it widely accepted in the world community that Australia's foreign affairs position is now so indistinguishable from that of the United States of America that the US. representatives, alone, adequately represent Australia's interests.
(4) Will he seek to gain admission to the summit meeting through diplomatic representatives, or otherwise.
Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) to (4) The countries which are to be invited to the summit meeting to be held in Mexico on 22 and 23 October were selected with the intention of providing a balanced representation of regions and of developed and developing countries. There has been no suggestion that the list of invitees represents the countries of greatest pre-eminence in world affairs or that any country will act as the representative of Australia. As an active and responsible participant in the North-South dialogue and in particular as host country of the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Australia will take a keen interest in events at the summit meeting in Mexico.
Examination of the Commonwealth Electoral Act
(Question No. 1123)
Mrs Darling asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 7 April 1981 :
(1) Further to his reply to my question No. 349 (Hansard. 25 February 1981, page 216), in the course of the examination by him and the Chief Australian Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, will he call for public submissions or submissions from Commonwealth members of parliament and senators, or will the inquiry be closed.
