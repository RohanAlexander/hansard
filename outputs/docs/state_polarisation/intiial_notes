Taddy polarisation method, but not between parties, instead between state you’re from - how are the Senate and the HoR different?



Rohan Alexander:
	So - I had a thought about polarisation.
Monica Alexander:
	okay
Rohan Alexander:
	All these people are doing polarisation on the party dimension - are the parties speaking more differently etc etc.
Monica Alexander:
	yes
Rohan Alexander:
	There’s a whole bunch of analysis tool kits that have been developed around this e.g. Taddy on the Econ side and millions in the pol sci side.
	But why tho
	(Do the kids say that?)
Monica Alexander:
	I believe so
Rohan Alexander:
	More specifically - why consider it on the basis of party?
	That tells you what you already know.
	Instead, in an Australian context, why not consider it based on which state you come from.
	Are the states getting more polarised?
Monica Alexander:
	Oh, fun
Rohan Alexander:
	(You’d expect not).
	But is there a difference between the HoR and the Senate?
	Senate is meant to be a states house, but I bet it’s not.
	Does Tasmania or Queensland stand out in particular?
	There’s a whole bunch of interesting things that you can do.
	We already have a plan to have the data.
	And the analysis tools are being developed for other purposes and could be adapted.
	What do you think?
Monica Alexander:
	I think it’s a great idea
	Seems like an easy twist on what is already being done 
Rohan Alexander:
	Okay. I’ll add it to the next paper stack.
Monica Alexander:
	Golly 
	There’s a stack 
Rohan Alexander:
	Well, there’s the females, and then incumbency effect and now this.
	Is this, a research agenda?
	(Insert meme here)
Monica Alexander:
	Lol you’ve got a more developed research agenda than most people I know 
	Take it to the market mate 







## Hansard sources {#hansardsources}

Hansard records are available from a variety of sources, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:hansardsourcestable}.


```{r hansardsourcestable, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

hansard_sources %>%
  kable(
    booktabs = T,
    align = c('l', 'r', 'r', 'r'),
    caption = "Hansard sources and notes") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)

# Break cachee

```

In Appendix \@ref(word2vec), we include an alternative approach that follows @Taddy2015 by using word2vec, which more closely uses words, rather than topics, as an input.
