1,Mr Speaker Took The Chair At 2.30,"the Minister representing fche PostmasterGenerali f some steps cannot be taken to render more regular the postal service in the country districts of Victoria. Owing to the recent trouble in the Railway department of this State, a number of people find themselves almost entirely cut off from postal communication with the metropolis. In many cases numbers of letters are left lying within a few miles of their destination for as much as 24 hours before being forwarded. In the town of Avoca, where over twenty mails are made up each day, they have Only three mails a week instead of a daily mail as heretofore. Sir EDMUNDBARTON say that Ministers Very much regret that, through force of circumstances, the postal services of the State of Victoria have been so disarranged by recent events; but every effort is being made to bring them back to the conditions prevailing before the railway service was dislocated.

If the Government bave no objection, it will be competent for him to move, on notice, for their production, and even if the Government did object, he would still be at liberty to take that course if he desired to do so. There is no reason why a question such as this should not be asked. Home Affairs, upon noticeWhether in view of the allegations of extravagance concerning the visit of Federal members to Western Australia, he will state what was the total cost of that visit to the Commonwealth ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :The only cost incurred was for the conveyance of Federal members between Adelaide and Fremantle, Defence, upon notice1. Has the Government had communication with the Imperial authorities regarding the claim of Major Lenehan, of the New' South Wales Military Forces, regarding arrears due to him ; and, if so, what is the result of that communication V 2.

If so, what is the nature of the reply ? 3. W ill the Minister lay a copy of any correspondence aud papers connected with each of the foregoing matters on the table of the House? 4. Did Major Lenehan report himself to Major General Sir Edward Hutton on his return in March last year? 5. Has Major Lenehan discharged any military duties since his return ? If not, why not ? the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. 2. The Government is in possession of the record, but not of the evidence. 3. The communications are not yet complete ; and, as it is not in the public interest to lay the papers on the table, I will ask the honourable member not to press for them at present. 4. Yes. 5. No, pending result of communications. upon notice1. When is the Federal Patent Bill likely to be introduced'! 2. Is the Government aware that numerous inquiries are being made from all parts of the world as to when the Federal Patent Bill is likely to come into force? 3. Is the Government aware that numerous inventors in all parts of the world, as well as in the Commonwealth of Australia, are not filing applications in the States because they are waiting for the Federal Patent Bill to become law ? 4. Isi t a fact that many of the indices and records in the several States' Patent Offices are in a state of incorrectness and incompleteness; and, if so, is it the intention of the Government to take immediate steps to rectify and consolidate these indices before the Patent Bill is passed? 5. In reference to the fourth question, has the Government considered tbe advisability of appointing a small commission of gentlemen, with the requisite technical and departmental knowledge, to investigate, rectify, and consolidate -I;] 72 10s. these indices and records, prior to the PatentB i ll becoming law, so that the publio may thereby be put to the minimum of inconvenience when the Federal Patent Ofiice is opened ? C. Has.the Government considered that unless some immediate steps are taken to rectify and « consolidate the indices and records, prior to the passing of the Federal Patent Bill, the department may, from the start, be in a state of chaos, and the public be hampered in their investigations as to the novelty of their inventions ? PatentB ill is likely to be introduced into the Senate within a month. The other Minister for Trade and Customs. honourable member's questions are as follow :2. There have been some inquiries on the subject. 3. Probably some inventors are pursuing this course. 4.

However, I am sure that the honourable member for Gippsland need feel little alarm, because even when the excise rebate of £ 2 nothing with which to find fault in the Gopart of last session, I consider that this is one of the measures that is absolutely reI was not astonished. quired to complete our Constitution. The question whether the court sliall, as sugconstitutional law, involving an enormous I mentioned that yesamount of work, can be dealt with by our have expended a great deal of money upon the machinery of this Federation, and we should not now "" spoil the ship for a ha'porth o' tar,"" and lose dignity as a",14,Paper
19,Mr A. Mclean,"Federation by having to resort to a casual court constituted of the Chief Justices of the States. A t the time when Federation was before the electors', a promise was made that a High Court should be constituted of Judges, appointed subject to the will of both Houses of Parliament, and removable only for misconducta courfc to which the people might have easy and speedy access, at a cost much smaller than that which is now involved in carrying appeals before the Privy Council. I think this promise should be carried out, and I shall therefore give my hearty support to the Bill foreshadowed in the Governor General's speech. Of the other measures to be introduced, the one next in importance is that for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission -Here, again, is another missing link which is urgently requiredfcocomplete our Constitution. Many questions of'the utmost importance can only be properly and fairly dealt with by such a body. Matters involving rival railway rates, fair trade and commerce, and the use of river waters are among these. It was stated yesterday that, although every effort had been made, by fair means and by friendly approaches, to bring about an understanding between the Bailways Commissioners of the various Stafces as to the rates charged on their respective lines, in several cases, notably in Western Australia, preferential railway rates were still in existence, and there is no possible means of dealing with this question except by the appointment of an lnter-State Commission. I need only direct attention to the two sections of fche Constitution dealing with the fnter-Sfcate Commission to show that it is absolutely necessary that such a body should be established. Section 101 can hardly be termed permissive. It reads as followsThere shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration sis the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within tlie Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. Section 102 readsThe Parliament may by anj' law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, anj' preference or discrimination by anj' State, or by anj' authoritj' constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable or unjust to anj' State, due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by anj' State in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways. The concluding paragraph is the most importantBufc no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged bj' the Inter-State Commission. I do not think thafcI need go further to prove the absolute necessity for proceeding at the earliest possible moment with the Government proposal. The next in order of importance in the Government programme is a measure which most honourable members will welcome, namely, the Defence Bill. We had a measure before us last session, which was ultimately withdrawn, and I think it was well that ifc should have been so dealt wifch. We are now promised a new Bill, and from whafc I can learnfchereis every prospect of it proving workable. Ifc is urgently required, because, judging from the state of affairs i u South Australia, a great deal of dissatisfaction exists regarding the manner in whicli the defence forces are being managed. The feeling there has become so strong that manyold and valued omcers who havedevoted years of their life and hundreds of pounds of their own private money to the service of the State have, in spite of their love for their profession, handed in their resignations. I know that South Australia is not alone in this respect, and that the same conditions exist to a greater or less degree in other States. Under these circumstances I shall indeed welcome thenewBill. Following upon this item in natural sequence, we come to the proposal for a new agreement in regard to the naval subsidy. We have not yet had an opportunity of seeing theexacttext of the agreement, and I think it is rather a pity that we should not have received fuller information. However, as this is' an occasion upon which we can deal with the subject only in mere, outline, we must be content with the statements which have been made in reference to' its conditions. I have heard opinions expressed by some very able naval and military authorities in favour of the establishment of a purely Australian navy, but I have come to fche conclusion that the time is not yet ripe for this young community, of .about 4,000,000 of people, to contribute the money necessary to provide a navy. There are more reasons than one why we should not do this."" First of all the expense would' be enormous at the outset, and we should have continuous made upon us to renew ships and armament as the old vessels became"" obsolete. is one of the strong arguments in favour of our continuing to rely upon the protection of the British navy in a somewhat better form than we have had it in the past. The additional contribution nothing compared with the expense to which we should be put if we dared at the inception of the Federation to start a naval defence of our own. I know that a very large section of the community, with their patriotic ideas, are very keen upon the establishment of an Australian navy, but when the question of cost comes to be considered, together with the new conditions under which our contribution is in future to be made, I feel sure that the balance of the argument is all in favour of the naval agreement. having had an opportunity of very carefully studying the proposed I am relying upon the outline of it which has been published in the newspapers, and upon the statements of the Prime Minister, so that if the agreement proves to contain different terms those which I have been led to expect, I still reserve to myself full liberty to alter my opinion. On the other hand, if-as has .been stated-it ditions for the training of our own men and cadets, and for a thoroughly efficient defence of our coast line, I shall give it my hearty support. The matter of the uniform patent legislation has already been dealt with by questions, and honourable "" members are promised that a Bill dealing with it will be introduced at an early date. were answered to-day regarding the condition of the patent indices in the various States. 1 am able to answer those inquiries, at any rate, so far as one State is concerned. In South Australia the indices are in a hopeless state of confusion, and it is absolutely impossible to ascertain what patents have been registered and what have not. I know of several inventors who are merely waiting until they can take advantage of patent laws, under reasonable conditions, which will be uniform throughout tralia. Another important subject with which Ministers have promised to deal-although somewhat indefinitely, I suppose when the time suits them-is the conversion or taking over of the States' debts. subject is not a new one. It was Mr V. L. Solomon. demands considered in the Federal Convention, aud was the subject of attention in some of the This State Parliaments even prior to that. The advantages to be gained by the conversion of the States' debts have already been put before both Parliament and the people by able financiers who understand the subject is a mere very much better than I do. Amongst the great benefits which would be derived by taking over the various States' debts would be the ability to convert them as they became due, and not before, into Commonwealth stock at a 'considerable saving of interest. The total indebtedness of the Commonwealth to-day is, in round figures, about £220,000,000, and the urgent necessity for dealing with this question at the earliest possible date is evidenced by the fact that from the return of the debts due by the various StatesI I say this, however, without find that during the next seven years-that is, up to 1910a sum of approximately agreement. £28,000,000 will become repayable. Something approaching that amount will have to be repaid by tlie different States for existing bonds and stocks. Unless we arrive at some arrangement with the States from it will be rather awkward if we find three or four of them each requiring £1,000,000, £2,000,000, or £3,000,000, simultaneously going upon the London money market at a contains reasonable conbad time, competing against each other, and eventually being forced to pay for their accommodation, in the way of interest, a great deal more than they are paying ab the present time. other? Questions MrV . L . SOLOMON --Yes. We know in the past how anxiously the Agents General of the different States have watched each obher, like so many cats watching a mouse, in au endeavour to be first upon the London market with a loan of £1,000,000. Unless some arrangement is made by which the Commonwealth can take over the States' debts, how much worse will the position be with £28,000,000 falling due within the next seven years, and with the knowledge on the part of the foreign bondAusholders that the States are bound to have the money' with which to redeem their existing liabilities 1 Instead of having to pay 3 J per cent, interest it is quite upon the cards that they will be required to pay per cent. This Of course if we take over the whole of the liabilities of the States, we have the security",15,Governor General S Speech
20,Mr Kingston,"B y bidding against each-as was pointed out by one speaker yesterday-of the Customsrevenueforthe payment of the interest. But another question arises in my mind-namely , whether the foreign bondholder will not want to know that the Federal Government possesses as security the assets upon which the great bulk of this £220,000,000 has been loanednamely, the States' railways. The bulk of this money was borrowed for the construction of the railways, and it may be considered that they should not remain in the hands of the States when the liability upon them has passed over to the Federal Government. This is a question which I leave to wiser heads than mine to consider, but it is undoubtedly worthy of close attention. plicated in that way, any arrangement will be postponed for I do not know how many years. MrV . L . SOLOMON I recognise that that is a difficulty, and I thank the leader of the Opposition for the hint. I recognise also that there would be perhaps considerable delay in arriving at an arrangement States for a transfer of the railways. Complications would arise as to their original cost and their earnings, and there would also be present a jealous feeling on the part of the States thab by handing over their railways to the Commonwealth they might be prevented in the future from extending them within their own territory for the purposes of development. StillI put the position fairly, in order that it may be considered. Personally I think that the whole of the Customs revenue should constitube quite a sufficient security, and if the States can be induced to hand over their debts to the Commonwealth, and at the same time to give an assurance that no further borrowing will be undertaken by them without the consent of the Federal Parliament, a very large saving could be effected. that would have the effect of postponing any settlement indefinitely. MrV . L . SOLOMON -To my mind it is a stipulation that ought to be made. It would be folly upon the part of the Commonwealth to take over the whole of the liabilities of the Statesi f any individual State might subsequently for the purpose of undertaking perhaps some fancy public work which might not be reproductive, go upon the money market again and pile up a new list of debts against its taxpayers. member think that we ought to do something to knock out the underwriting system which is applied to State loans 1 MrV . L . SOLOMON -That is a mere matter of debail. The underwriters have proved very useful upon some occasions. They haveCsaved many a loan from failure. The leader of the Opposition suggests that it would be difficult to obtain the consent of the States to refrain from further borrowing. I am not at all certain that ifc would, because I believe that their position presently in regard to the repayment of loans will become so difficult that the If the matter is to be comelectors in the various States will force fchem to accept the proposal of the Commonwealth Parliament-if we are willing to undertake the work-and to hand over their debbs to the Federation. I do not see that much harm could result to them from the adoption of such a course, because, after all, if they wished to raise money for any purpose of reasonable development the Combetween the different monwealth Parliament would be only two anxious to assist them, and, moreover, the Federal Government would be able to obtain the necessary money for them upon very much better terms than they could secure for themselves. However, thafc is one of those questions which I should be pleased to -see taken up with a great deal of energy, not only in this Parliament, but in every Stabe Parliament throughout Australia. NowI come to some questions of administration. The administration of the Customs department has been specially commented upon in the various newspapers, and so many cases of harshness have been cited that I desire to say a word or two upon it . I can do so with a very much clearer conscience than can some honourable members, because at .the time the Customs Bil l was being considered I think I can be credited with having exhibited a very lively interest in it, and with having warned the House again and again thafc its provisions were altogether too stringent. Those provisions might have been suited to the requirements of England 50 years ago, but they were utterly unsuitable to the present state of our commerce. I fought the question of the imposition of a minimum fine as strenuously as I could, and went so far as to call for",17,Governor General S Speech

22,Mr Reid,That is another stipulation,18,Governor General S Speech
23,Mr Poynton,"Does not the honorabledivisions upon that matter. I attempted to secure a reduction of the minimum penalty for an infraction of the Act from £ 5 to £ 2 . I also urged that no minimum fine should be provided, but that magistrates should be vested with absolute discretion as to whether they should fine an offender either Is. or £100 . Had my proposal been carried, instead of men who are guiltyof merely technical offences being fined a minimum amount of £ 5 , we should have witnessed a magistrate in some of the prosecutions instituted by the Customs department imposing a fine of Is. without costs. Theu the disgrace of 'the police court prosecution would have disappeared. The presiding magistrate could have expressed his opinion upon the merits of any case. He could have said, "" This is merely a technical offence, and I fine the defendant Is., and will not allow any costs."" I am sorry that that course was not adopted. present limitation of a magistrate's powers. ""VVe may provide a maximum penalty, but to limit him to a minimum fine is ridiculous. I wish to quote one or two cases in this connection. One of the first casesa very stupid one-whic h I remember, goes-to prove the absurdity of imposing a minimum fine. It was the case of a well known and highly-respected gentleman in Adelaidea horse-owner and a breeder of horses-wh o received as a little present from a friend in India, a bottle of mustard oil for the treatment of horses. This oil came by ordinary ship, and, after inquiry, it was proved to have been manufactured in an Indian prison. the bottle. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Yes ; there was no attempt at fraud, but the man was prosecuted, and the minimum fine of £ 5 was inflicted, although the bottle represented a value of Is., or less. similar offender would have been fined under the law in England. MrV . L . SOLOMON I do not know what is done in England, but I do not think we should do anything so foolish as to fine a man -under such circumstances. A good many of -the-sections of the Customs Regulation Act were, taken from the old English law, which was extremely useful in the old days of the Coastguard, when small quantities of goods, used to be smuggled into England from Erance, Germany, and Spain. I refer was passed in 1899. MrV . L . SOLOMON -That is not my point at the present time, but I know that one has only to touch on a subject like this in order to stir up the honourable and learned member for Corio. I have no desire to see prison-made goods imported into Australia, and I am merely showing the absurdity of compelling magistrates to inflict this minimum fine when it is felt that no fine should be inflicted, and when, but for the stringency of the law, it would not be inflicted. If the Government had acted in the same spirit that they did in regard to the boy Tingey the other day, this fine ought to have been refunded. Bible; there was a difference in the Cabinet about that. 1 I do not believe in the MrV . L . SOLOMON -In order to give another instance of the peculiar anomalies of the Act, I wish to refer to section 53, which readsNo spirits, opium, tobacco, snuff, cigars, or cigarettes shall be imported, except in packages as prescribed. Penalty : AM 00. The Minister has the power of prescribing the size of the. packages by regulation, and this provision is also taken from the old English laws, which, as I say, were highly useful at one time, but are now absolutely ridiculous when it is considered that every article imported has to be manifested and remain in the charge of the Customs until the entry has been passed and duty duly paid. Why should not a man be allowed to import a package of tobacco weighing less than 20 lbs. ? ShouldI desire to import a package of 5 lbs., that package would be held under the Customs seal until the manifest and invoice had been examined and duty paid. I have shown the absurdity of the law, and now desire to show the absurdity of the administration. I received a telegram a few days ago, which I am sorry to say I have mislaid, from a solicitor of Port Darwin, informing me that a Chinese storekeeper there had imported 40 lbs. of tobacco in one ship, but,, for convenience sake, had divided the commodity into two packages, one containing 25 lbs. aud the other containing 15 lbs. The packages were duly manifested, and the invoice was produced, but the storekeeper, on seeking to clear them, was informed that while he",18,Governor General S Speech

It is absurd that a Customs official should be so absolutely without dis-. cretion as to be guilty of administration of this sort. Does the Minister say that this storekeeper deserved to have any fine inflicted on him 1 hotter under English legislation. MrV . L . SOLOMON -No doubt he might have "" got it hotter "" under Kussian legislation. to be compared to that of Russia? MrV . L . SOLOMON -Our legislation is getting pretty close to that of Russia; at any rate, I should say thafc a man could not be worse treated in fchat country. If the Minister cannot see his way to give his officers a little more discretion,fchesooner the House takes the matter in hand and amends the Acfc the better. I am sure that the common sense of many members would support an amendment in reference to such cases as that of the cartridgesfcheother, clay, in the direction of allowing more discretion in the administration of the Act. In the case I have mentioned I am sure no ordinary magistrate or justice of the peace-and we have some curious specimens of the latter-woul d have dared to fine a man £ 5 for an offence so nominal, if the law allowed any discretion. While saying all this, I must, acknowledge that the Minister has had to perform most difficult work. As a Customs agent for many years, I can appreciate the difficulties with which he has to contend. Even in one State, wifch one set of officers, those troubles would arise, bufc when dealing with six States and six sets of officers the difficulties must be enormous. tration for which the Minister cannot be personally responsible, unless he can put a week's work into a day. bility ; I have very good officers. MrV . L . SOLOMON I knowfchatthe Minister has to take all responsibility, and he' may have very good officers, but they must be lacking in discretion or afraid of being dismissed iffchey,infcheslightest degree, lean to the side of justice. Everything the Minister has done has been with a view of conserving the revenues of the Q Commonwealth, and his task has been a hard one; and I am sure that if any one else had occupied the position, probably just as many mistakes would have been made. I say this with the idea of inducing him to give his officers more discretion in removing some of the anomalies I have pointed out, and permitting them to treat trivial cases as such, and not as subjects for police court prosecutions. ber mean that the cases should be treated departmentally ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -No; there have been great abuses under that system.

L . SOLOMON -No w I come to the Immigration Restriction Act, though I am not going to deal with the six hatters, of whom we have heard enough. I shall refer to that case only in order to point out that when sub-section (g) of section 3 was passed, I for one was quite ignorant of the extent to which it would be used. very carefully to the debate, and later took some part in it myself. Sub-section (</) of section 3 was inserted on the motion of the leader of the labour party, and provides thatAny persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour witliin the Commonwealth shidl be regarded as ""prohibited immigrants."" The object of the insertion of those words was, I understood, to prevent the introduction of large numbers of men under contract to perform work at unfair rates of pay, and to prevent interference during the existence of some strike or labour trouble. The lionorable member for Bland, speaking in support of his amendment, saidWhenI first gave notice o{ fchis amendment I proposed to cover all classes of labonr performed in the Commonwealth. presentations made by some honourable members, ifc is, I think, desirable for the time being to reto persons-whethe r English, Irish, Scotch, strict the classes prohibited to artisans and labourers. There are oue or two other classes of labour it would have been advisable to cover by the sub-clause, but the difficulty of providing for efficient exemptions of classes fchafc should be exempted, and the possibility, perhaps, a little later, of a number of new industries being com' menced within the Commonwealth, point to the necessity of minimizing the operation of the amendment in the meantime. The amendment will cover most of the classes of labonr likely to be affected through people being inveigled into . unfair agreements in ignorance of the conditions obtaining in Australia. that statement. MrV . L . SOLOMON -That argument undoubtedly obtained the sympathy of honourable members on both sides of the Chamber. In speaking to the amendment the Attorney-General stated thatThe persons to whom the honourable member alluded when he made his concluding reference to the possibility of the establishment of new industries in the Commonwealth are excluded under the amendment as it now stands, and it is necessary to make provision to permit skilled labourers to enter the Commonwealth if they are of such a character as to be able to add to the industrial wealth of the community. That is the interpretation to be placed upon the proviso which, on his motion, was added to the amendment. What has occurred, is very much to be regretted. I am sure that a blunder has been committed, and that it was not the desire of the Prime Minister that the men concerned should be treated as they were. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, speaking on the same subject, saidThere is no desire to exclude men who volunI listened tarily seek to make their home here for the purpose'of engaging in manual labour or anything else, so long as they belong to a civilized white race, and are themselves desirable immigrants. As I understand it , we have never in Australia taken up that narrow view of saying that we musfc keep Australia for o\u-selveswand our children. That was the belief under which I , for one, consented to allow the clause to pass. It is difficult to know how the A ct can be amended so that it will still contain the safeguards desired, and yet give an opportunity for desirable immigrants to enter the Commonwealth ; but I think that it should be amended so as to attain that end. There is another matter in connection with the administration of the Act to which I wish to draw attention. It was never intended But, in view of reby Parliament that the operation of the Act should be retrospective, so as to do injustice Chinese, or Japanese-wh o were living within the Commonwealth for years before the inauguration of federation. But a case has occurred in which injustice of that kind has been 'done ; and although I have.directed the attention of the Prime Minister to it , I have not yet heard his decision upon it, and so far he has been adamant to my representations.

They were engaged in business there during the whole of that period, and liad the cleanest of records; and certificates were obtained by them from both the police and European merchants in the town as to their respectability and integrity. They applied to the Customs officer at Port Darwin for domicile certificates to enable them to visit their original homes in China for a few months. The officer did not see any difficulty in the matter. He told them"" I cannot give you certificates, because' they have to be sent from the head office in Melbourne; but I have no doubt that there will be no difficulty in the matter."" Acting upon that assurance, the men left their business and went to China.

Moreover, I think that it is unwise to ask the electors to devote their attention to federal politics upon two occasions divided by only a few months.

62,Mr Watson (Bland),"I intend totliis session, nnd the number of very important measures forecasted in the Gorvernor-General's speech renders it necessary that we should address ourselves to business at as early a date as possible.' Bevery largely in excess of the arrivals ? fore passing to the matters dealt with in the Governor General's speech, I should like to refer to one or two matters of administration. One of these is in connection with the Immigration Restriction Act, not in regard to the admission of the six hatters, but in reference to the question of coloured immigration. I notice from a return published a few days ago,, that a considerable number of coloured people have recently been admitted into tlie Commonwealth notwithstanding the operation of the Immigration Restriction Act ; and it seems to me that if we can do no better than the return would indicate under the law as it stands, the minority of the members of this House who asked that the colour line should be drawn absolutely, and, that all coloured aliens should be excluded, ' took the proper course. In the first place, I find that over 30 coloured immigrants passed the education test. These included Burmese, Eurasians, Filipinos, Hindoos, Japanese, Mauritians, South Sea Islanders, West Indians, and one black from St. Helena. I understood when the Act was under discussion that the Government intended to exercise such discrimination in the application of the law that no person would be able to pass the education test so long as he was held to be an undesirable coloured immigrant. strong step when we changed the test every fortnight. were assured by the Attorney-General that the test could be made so restrictive as to exclude undesirables with as much efficiency as the course.proposed by the labour party. I submit that the A ct would not have passed in its present shape if it had not been for that assurance, which weighed with some honourable members. immigrants leave again after' a short stay in the Commonwealth ? no exclusion. persons were excluded, but the A ct is not effective whilst any number of undesirable persons come in. able friend observe that the departures are but I do not see that it assists the case of the Government in the slightest degree. It does not show -that we should admit anj 7 more of these undesirable races than we can possibly avoid. It merely evidences that no increase has taken place in the number here, but that is not all that was asked b j ' the people of Austraha when the matter was placed before them. Another fact which requires some explanation at the hands of the Government is that a total of 1,300 odd Chinamen have been admitted during the j'ear covered by the last return, irrespective of those included in the 33 I have mentioned as coming in under various proprovisions of the law. In this connection I would point out that 1,079 were admitted upon State permits, 564 upon tonnage regulations, and 168 in conformity with the Immigration Restriction Act I presume that the 168 consisted of those who had been previously domiciled in Australia. inember quoting from the returns regarding any particular race ? relating to the Chinese.

We abrogated that portion of the State Acts when we passed the Immigration Restriction Bill. gate it, but we left those Acts to be applied in addition to the new Act. We applied the new Act. There may be some cases in which Chinamen can comply with the educational test, and consequently the necessity arises for the application of the tonnage regulations. Some of the State laws were very lax. in that respect, and did not prescribe any poll-tax. the law is very lax indeed if it will permit of Chinese coming in under the tonnage regulations. I admit that the presence of 50 or 100 Chinamen does not make any very great difference to Australia, but it is as well to stop a leak in the beginning, lest it may assume large proportions at a later stage. W it h regard to the admission of some 500 odd Japanese, I understand that 246 of them came in under a treaty which is now void a treaty which was made between the Governments of Queensland ancl Japan prior to federation. I should like to ascertain whether the equivalent number of Japanese had left Queensland to allow of the 246 individuals in question coming in under that treaty, which provided that the Queensland Government would raise no objection to the admission of sufficient Japanese to maintain the maximum number tliat had previously been there. Queensland wereassessed atacertain number. number was not to be exceeded. Is the House to understand that there had been an emigration of 200 odd Japanese prior to the admission of the 246 in question 1 involved the admission of those who had passports from the Japanese Government, and included some who had permits to return from the Queensland Government. A t the time we thought that the total number of these was 208, but it has now proved to be 246. Mi-. WATSON -Of course that is a satisfactorv statement, but it cloes seem to me that the Act might be administered with a great deal more stringency than it appears I should like to ask the Prime Ministo have been during the past year. I think that a number of honourable members who voted for the Government proposal, in the belief that it would prove effective, would be relieved to know that the Ministry are now taking such steps as will absolutely exclude these undesirable people from Australia. Another phase of the Act upon which a great deal of attention has been bestowed has reference to the admission of the six hatters. It is somewhat refreshing to hear the confessions of parliamentary ignorance and innocence which are put forward as excuses under the plea that honourable members "" did not know it was loaded."" I have a very vivid recollection that the amendment which I proposed appeared upon the business-paper for a very considerable time, not exactly in the same phraseology as that in which it was eventually carried, but the principle involved was before the Chamber for a protracted period. When the matter came up in a concrete form, the debate upon it occupied eight pages of Hansard. So far as the leader of the Opposition is concerned, I wish to' point out that though he was not present when the amendment was actually carried, he was present while the proposal figured upon the business-paper, and also upon the recommittal of the Bill, when the very clause in question was under discussion. The right honourable member therefore 'had every opportunity of protesting against either the principle involved or the phraseology employed in giving effect to it . But not one word was uttered by tlie right honourable member against the proposal. It was practically passed unanimously, although the honourable member for Wentworth gave to it only a qualified sort of approval, and the honourable member for Capricornia did, I understand, offer some objection to it. So far as I am concerned -and I think the remark is also applicable to the members of the party with .which I am associatedI have no objection to any number of Britishers or other white people coming to Australia to make homes for themselves, or to assist in the development of the country.

A very large proportion of those who come here of their owu free will are supplied with sufficient means to maintain themselves till they get an opportunity of taking part in the development of the country.

Instances have occurred in New South Wales-on e at Joadja Creek, and t v o others near Newcastle-in which men were imported from England under contract to work in the mines. In one case the men ' went to gaol rather than carry out their agreement, whilst in another they were only prevented from leaving their employment by the fear of imprisonment, because they found, upon their arrival, that the conditions obtaining were not such as hacl been represented to them. Some of them absconded rather than work under tliose conditions. better to have such an agreement abrogated than that tlie men should be bound by it after their arrival. l h a t suggestion, however, would not meet the case, because if men are imported under contract, they might practicidly be paupers upon arrival. Landingi n a new country without'friends, prospects or advice, what would be the result if the contract were rendered void ? In nearly every instance, unless some organization got hold of them, they would reenact it on Australian territory and it would be as operative as if they had entered into an agreement outside. Tlie men would never have an opportunity of learning the nature of the conditions of their employment before the alternative was presented to them either of starving or accepting the conditions under which they were imported. It does seem to me that the outcry which has been raised in regard to the case of the six hatters is somewhat farcical. In the first place, it was a presscreated trouble. Most of the newspapers, were naturally anxious to take advantage of anything which could be used as a lever against the labour party, and some of them, animated by a similar desire against a Government of which they do not approve, were only too ready to manufacture a boom of indignation against the treatment meted .out to those hatters. This agitation was raised only by the press and a few politicians, whojiad every opportunity of voicing a protest in this House, and did not take advantage of that opportunity. The leader of the Opposition at Maitland got into a seething state of indignation at tlie treatment accorded to these Britishers, and said"" We require administration with discrimination."" We have hacl in New South Wales a number of instances of discrimination in administration, and we found that the discrimination was in favour of the big people rather than in favour of the ordinary citizen, and I do not think too much discrimination is a good thing for the working of our administrative departments. Allowing, however, that we do require discrimination, the leader of the Opposition at Maitland went on to say that if he had been Prime Minister when the collector reported the detention of these men at Sydney, he would have immediately -mar k the phrase-""flashe d across the wires "" an order to release them. Is that discrimination ? Does discrimination in. In my judgment, it would be volve inquiry, or does it not ? Can there be discrimination if no inquiry is made,'and there is no attempt to ascertain what the conditions are? That is administration without discrimination, and administration againsb the law.

It is quite possible that Mr Anderson when he first made arrangements to bring these men from England was not aware what the provisions of the law were, but surely, when the question was raised, if he were anxious to have the men exempt, he shonld have looked up the law and made application at once. Instead of doing that, he allowed, I think, five or six days to elapse before he made any application to the Prime Minister. for the newspaper agitation. that something else is involved or was involved apparently in tlie attitude of Mr Anderson, besides the mere desire to get these men admitted. That gentleman a few months previously had stated that rather than pay duty, he would send back to England the machinery he was then importing for his hat factory. I do not say that Mr Anderson was not justified in being annoyed at having to pay 12^or 15 per cent, duty on his machinery-that is a matter for-him-bu t he was evidently so incensed against the Government for their administration generally that he took up the attitude that he would not be bothered, or would not humble himself to make application to the Prime Minister-that he would insist on these men being liberated without the law being complied with. down the independence of these men. is always subjectto the law of the country, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who is a prospective Judge of some court or another, ought to remember 'that fact. The law states that exemption has to be applied for, ancl under the circumstances I can conceive of no Minister refusing exemption if requested to do so. If the Government, having been asked for exemption, hacl refused to give it, they would' have been worthy of blame at the hands of honourable members ancl the public. It was specially for instances of this kind .that the amendment or addition to the section was made on tlie proposal of the Attorney-General. That proposal was that persons possessing special skill, and necessary in the Commonwealth, should be admitted j and I , for one, have no quarrel with that position. However, as I have indicated, some gentlemen have attempted to work up an extraordinary amount of indignation over this matter, and ainongsb those the honourable member for Gippsland, who stated last evening that it was a desecration of the terms "" free men "" ancl "" bondsmen "" to apply them to the case of the six hatters. I do not know whether the honourable member thinks that a person is free, or has any liberty remaining in him, if he signs such an agreement as these men ing them on the one side to serve Mr Anderson for three years at what is admittedly a fair wage, but leaving the determination of the agreement at any moment to Mr Anderson. That seems to me a most one-sided sort of agreement, when it can be terminated at. a moment's notice after the arrival of the men. there must be reasonable notice given or cause shown. ally provided that Mr Anderson might dismiss the men at any time, if they did not give him satisfaction; and it is clear that they might cause him dissatisfaction at any moment. Even the fact tliat a man curled his lip up instead of down might not satisfy Mr Anderson, and then the agreement could be made null and'void. On the other hand, however, the men were bound for three years, or for as long as Mr Anderson chose to keep them in that period, no matter what their own feelings might be. On this question the honourable member for Gippsland strikes me as having suddenly become a free-trader. He believes, as a protectionist, I understand, in shutting out the cheap goods of other countries, even though the goods may have been manufactured in the great motherland, unless a heavy duty is paid. But he does not believe, on the other hand, that there should be the slightest inquiry as to the conditions uncler which workmen from Great Britain are allowed to land here; and that to me seems a most inconsistent attitude.

This is not merely a question of men coming here, but a question of the terms and conditions under which they come. We do not believe in men being brought here under any false impression as to the conditions obtaining, and it is impossible for them to get a proper idea in England. It is only in Australia that they can get all the information as to the cost of rent and food and the standard of comfort which is maintained here.

The staff is still costing, I think, some £15,000 a year, ancl those who insisted on retrenchment in the military forces are' being blamed for all the trouble that is occurring in connection with the forces in New South Wales and other parts of Australia. Personally, I take no responsibility for the disposition of the money which was placed at the disposal of the Minister for Defence. He had under his charge a sum in excess of the amount available for defence a few years ago, when tlie departments were under State control, but he seems to have spent a very large part of it upon the almost useless features of a military force. While I am convinced it is not necessary to spend in the training of men more than, if as much as, the sum now allotted for that work, I believe that it is necessary to expend a very considerable amount in improving our defences. A great number of our forts have obsolete guns. We have compara tively few modern rifles, and no effort has been made, notwithstanding a half promise by the Government some time ago to establish an ammunition factory within the Commonwealth, though it has been stated in the press that a contract is about to be entered into with the Colonial Ammunition Company for the supply of some 12,000,000 rounds per annum. a contract which cannot be broken, and which extends over a number of years. affects the ""Victorian supply of ammunition, and would not prevent the Government from establishing factories in other parts of the Commonwealth. I think that they sliould have already taken steps for tlie establishment of an ammunition and also of a small-arms factory. It is imperative for the adequate defence Of Australia that we shall have arms to put into the hands of our people in the event of war occurring. We are training a large number of men more or less efficiently; but, if war came, most of them would have to. be armed with obsolete rifles, and, although the Minister for Home Affairs has told us thafc a Martini-Henry rifle is a dangerous weapon if one comes within range of ib, we cannot be sure that an enemy would do so be-fore attacking with guns of a longer range. The Minister for Defence ought to be able to assure the House that he has prepared [28 MAY , 1903.] Address in Reply. 251 some scheme for providing the Commonwealth with an adequate supply of rifles, ammunition, and other munitions of war. I shall resisb any proposal bo give the Colonial Ammunition Company a larger order for ammuuibion than they now receive. Major General Hutton, I understand, has recommended that factories for the supply of ammunition be established in different places throughout the Commonwealth. tion from the press. If such a recommendation has not beenmade, I think that something of the kind should be done. We should not rely upon one factory. I do not know if the Colonial Ammunition Company make the cartridges which they turn out, or only roll and fill them with material brought from abroad. If they do the latter, the existence of the factory does not make us independent of oversea supplies, and the people are being lulled into a false sense of security. thing but the cordite which they use, and it is made under patent in Victoria. here 1 tories capable of making everything necessary for ammunition, and we should supply them with sufficient work to keep the employees efficient.

116,Mr Watson,"We should have facnavy. To make our position sure, we should have to provide for naval defence upon a scale which our financial condition is not likely to warrant for some years to come, and it is worse than useless to depend upon an inadequate defence. That being so, I think our better plan is, first, to insure that we have a sufficient, efficient, and properly-armed land force, and, secondly, that our ports and exposed posi' tions are defended by position guns, and by other means of defence such as modern science is continually inventing. It may not be a completely demonstrated fact, but it seems nearly certain that submarine vessels provide a port defence which is superior to the older methods. In conjunction with them we might, if necessary, utilize gunboats of light tonnage but of a fairly heavy armament. It would be hopeless to expect one squadron to efficiently protect 8,000 miles of coast line. squadron would have to defend only the capital cities of Australia. could be better done by preparations such as I have just referred to.

Supposing the Australian squadron contained six or eight vessels, they could not be separated without weakening the fleet so materially that one portion or other of it would be liable to annihilationaccount of themselves to the attacking vessels when they met them. hold their own; but to guard the whole coast line the ships would have to be separated, and separately they could do nothing against an opposing fleet. If they were not separated, and I do not think they should be, I fail to see how they could adequately protect our shores. That being so, I do not think it worth our while to sacrifice other means of coastal defence to inadequately protect our sea-going commerce. greater than it was worth. that we can more cheaply defend our ports, coaling stations, and exposed position's by land defences, with the assistance of -torpedo boats or similar vessels, than by a squadron of cur own, or provided by the Imperial navy. We cannot expect Australia to have much money available for the purposes of defence for a long while to come. For many years we shall be constrained by circumstances to contribute more, proportionately, to the other expenses of government than many other communities do, because of the greatness of our territory and the sparseness of our population. That being so, we should adopt those means of defence which are most likely to prove effective for the money spent upon them. 1 see no immediate prospect of the formation of an Australian navy. I believe that we I apprehend that the can get Australian seamen to work for the protection of our ports against hostile attack ; but I dp not think that an efficient naval defence for Australia is practicable. I believe that that Therefore, I feel under no obligation to vote for the proposal to increase the contribution to the support of the Imperial navy. It is our business to provide as well as we can for our own defence, ancl if we do that we shall have done our duty to the Empire. If we relieve those in power at home from about the protecanxiety as to our position in time of trouble, we shall do all that can reasonably be expected from a small community settled in an immense territory. I think, therefore, that we should expend what money we have to spend for purposes of defeiice in efficiently protecting our ports and other exposed positions. There is another feature of the proposal to which I object. It seems extraordinary that, although we are asked to increase our contribution to the Imperial navy, the squadron is to be liable to be called away from Australian waters, so as to leave us without any protection for our sea-going commerce. worse than what the houorable member is suggesting. every pound we give as a contribution towards the Imperial navy will have to be deducted from the amount available for safeguarding our own ports. no communication with the outer world.",30,Governor General S Speech

Concerningcourtsof conciliation, as an addendum or preliminary to the court of arbitration, I may say that the unionists in New Zealand, to whom I spoke in reference to their working, seemed to be satisfied that they were doing good. They said that in quite a number of instances the issues had been narrowed down by the courts of conciliation. tribunals did not in all cases settle the trouble, but the issues were narrowed down so as to minimize the amount of work which had eventually to be done by the court of arbitration. Australia any court of arbitration would have to embrace the entire Commonwealth in its operation, it will be seen that anything that will tend to minimize the issues that come before that court is a step in the right direction. sary, I think, to have one court only as a supreme head, otherwise we shall have varying decisions under similar circumstances in different parts of the Commonwealth. We want something in the nature of uniformity in laws such as these, and therefore I feel there may be a reason for courts of conciliation in this connection that does not exist to the same extent in any single State. I trust that the Government will see the necessity'of pushing this matter forward, because I assure them that .the whole question of the equal competition of people in the various States under a common tariff will never otherwise be satisfactorily settled. It is possible that the High Court may rule that we have not' power to deal with cases such as those I have mentioned, but I believe that even under a reasonable construction of the Constitution we have that power, because it must be manifest that if the wages paid to the women workers, of whom I spoke, in Brisbane are so low as to constitute sweating, that fact must affect the wages paid in Sydney, Melbourne, and every other town in the Commonwealth. them 50 per cent. less. them considerably less. I do trust that the Government will push this matter forward. It is desirable that the lack of method in the conduct of public business which was displayed last session shall not be exhibited this session. I hope that we shall take up one Bill .and dispose of it, instead of discussing several measures, dropping them, and again taking up their consideration at a later stage. It must be remembered that although we transacted a large amount of business last session, the period occupied in accomplishing it was extremely long, and I believe that we could have economized time to some extent if measures had been proceeded with consecutively. However, that is a matter for the Government themselves Those to arrange, and I refer to it only because I believe that this session we should endeavour to curtail as much.as possible the time occupied in considering the various subjects which will come before us with a view to When we consider that in accomplishing a maximum amount of work.

Honourable members have already seen this Government in the most complaisant moods, and we know that it is a matter of the greatest difliculty to induce them to make up their minds concerning either their legislation or their administration.

If the object was patient investigation of the requirements of the whole of the Australian postal service, the General must be a very marvellous man if lie did what the Prime Minister alleges. But the Postmaster General's handiwork is already beginning to show that he cannot have made any such patient The regulations which are placed on the table from time to time become more irksome as they multiply, and something will have to be done very rapidly to stop their issue if the department is to be carried on with anything like proper efficiency.

There seems a general desire in the Postal department to suppress business, or drive it away, instead of attracting it , although if there is a department which more than another is a business department, it is that of the post-office. This is the department in which, more than in any other, ordinary business methods ought to be applied ; and yet, what do we see in connection with the telephone? All telephonic extension in the country districts is stopped by a ridiculous regulation of the Postmaster-General, which requires any person who wants a telephone fixed to pay in cash three-quarters of the cost of construction, and an amount sufficient to cover five years' expenses. No man in his senses would plank his cash down in such a way. is a guarantee. requires the actual cash to be placed in old agreement, the Government will surely the bank.

I quite approve of the new arrangement made by the Prime Ministeri n taking prompt steps to limit the term of the agreement with that company; and I cannot help thinking that the step taken is an implied censure on his colleague who, when Premier of New South Wales, entered into the present absurd agreement, and signed an interminable contract with the company. I protested as strongly as I could agaitist it at the time in the press, but without avail. In this respect Victoria set a better example to the rest of Australia than New South Wales did. Honourable members should recollect what the position was. We tried, when the old subsidy expired, to obtain from the company a reduction of rates, but they would give us nothing. They said"" Before we lay down another cable we want a subsidy for a further term of twenty years, and the' old rates must continue for that period."" We could not obtain any reduction or concessions from the company, and' negotiations were berlain gave his sanction to the Pacific cable proposal, tlie Eastern Extension ' "" We will give you almost anything you want if you will give us in return the advantages we ask for."" New South Wales had no right to treat with the company, except with the concurrence of tlie TJnited Kingdom and of Canada; but the Minister for Home Affairs took the bait held out by the company, accepted reduced rates for a short year, and gave them an opportunity to fight the Pacific cable proposal, and menace its very existence. Sir George Turner was faced with the same temptation as confronted the Minister for Home Affairs, but, B z to his credit be it said, he refused to yield to it . If New South Wales had acted as Victoria did, the Pacific cable would have been placed upon a paying basis from the start, and the cable rates would have been the same as they are to-day. member admits that the Commonwealth was bound by the arrangement entered into by New South Wales. plaining of anything the Prime Minister has-done in this matter; I am complaining of what was done by his colleaguewhen Premier of New South Wales, which the right honourable gentleman has promptly set himself to undo. I have not much to say in addition a,bout the administration of the Minister for Trade and Customs, though I wonder that he has SO suddenly become dumb. During his peregrinations throughout the Commonwealth, he challenged all and sundry. He beat his breast like the Pharisee of old, and told the people of Australia that he was not like 'other Customs Ministers. He was doing tilings that should have been done long ago under State* administration. ment the Minister suggested that other Customs Ministers had winked at evasions of the law and connived at improper practices, and that no other Minister had had the pluck to do his duty.

In my opinion, the honourable gentleman is not reckoning in his boasting with human nature. It remains to be seen if we have in the Minister a heavensent administrator than whom' no one could be better. He has undoubtedly exercised a great deal of vigour in the discharge of the duties pertaining to his office, but it is too soon yet -to say that he has proved better than all the other Customs administrators who have preceded him.

If the conspiracy laws were administered as the Minister administers the Customs Act, nearly every man in Australia would be sent to gaol, because whenever two or three persons met together at a street corner they could be indicted for conspiracy. Or what would happen if the law relating to trespass were administered with the same strictness ? If one set himself to inflict every penalty possible under the law, and to diligently hunt for victims, they could be found in abundance.. The Minister should exercise a little discrimination sometimes, particularly since the minimum penalty provided in the A ct for any offence is £ 5 . fact that the Act does not allow justice to be clone by the courts. might very well refuse to set the law in motion where cases of error alone are concerned. We should then have less of the friction which has occurred during his administration. He tells us, however, that he makes no distinctions, and that that is a proof of his fairness. The Prime Minister told us that he was as ready to prosecute a man like Senator Reid as a poor man who was bringing in a Bible to give to some one else. Senator's Reid's name. typical big man whom we all have in our minds just now. I have nothing to say against the Minister for prosecuting in cases where fraud or gross negligence can be proven; but where a little investigation will show that only an error has been committed, the case should not be taken into court. The Minister himself is not clear as to the meaning of the Tariff in every case. He is feeling his way, and interpreting its provisions from day to day. That being so, we should not haul to the police court people who are groping in the dark just as he is. One is tempted to say something about the administration of the Minister for Defence, but, instead of doing so, I shall wait to hear the details of his .proposed reforms.

No doubfc a tribunal for the final determination of causes is necessary, but the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has told us deliberately that the machinery of the proposed court, and the salaries to be paid to its officials, will cost about £50,000 a year. That seems too large a sum to expend at this stage of our history. I did not mention These questions of high policy, such as. have been suggested by the honourable member for Bland, will, no doubt, come up for the consideration by the High Court; but the time for that has not yet arrived, and the High Court will be created soon enough when its work becomes quite apparent. We may not have to deal with the question of riparian rights for five or' six years, nor need we trouble our heads about matters arising out of the proposed Arbitration Bill, because the Arbitration Court may not have to give a decision for some considerable time to come. The establishment of an Arbitration Court, such as has been suggested, should be proceeded with, and we could surely make some simple arrangement for settling any questions which may arise until a Court of the proposed costly character is needed.

Nearly all the questions that call for immediate decision relate purely to trade and commerce, and I cannot understand why it should not be possible to refer these points to a more simple tribunal. entire agreement with the Government in regard to the increased naval vote. I think that a very reasonable arrangement has been made by the Prime Minister so far as the amount of the subsidy is concerned. The question as to whether the conditions for the control of the squadron are equally good is arguable, but the amount proposed to be contributed is very moderate indeed. In this connection, I cannot help being reminded of a speech by Lord Selborne, which was recently quoted by Mr John Morley, in England. Lord Selborne saidIfc so happens, that more of the money provided by the taxpayer of the United Kingdom is spent in thc British dominions beyond the seas than the British dominions beyond the seas contribute to the maintenance of the British navy. I think thafc this is a point which should appeal to us very strongly. It is important that our commerce should be policed upon the high seas, and that England should look after it for us. England could get along very well if all our commerce were swept from fche seas, but it would be a very different matter for us, and therefore we should shoulder a fair share of the responsibility involved in protecting our oversea traffic. into wars which are none of our making 1 trament of war would expose us to exactly the same disadvantages as if we had a squadron of our own. If the necessities of Empire required the removal of the Australian squadron from our coasts, no arrangement made with the Imperial authorities would enable us to retain it. Moreover, even if we had a squadron of our own, and the Empire were in danger, I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Werriwa would not decline to send it wherever the necessities of the mother Our functions are not so extensive country might require. In view of the question of sending our squadron away in case of a great Empire war is not of very great importance. The provision in the agreement for control over the squadron by the Imperial authorities simply asserts a technical right, which places us ' at no greater disadvantage in case of a great war than if we had a navy of our own. A t the same time, I am in favour of paving the way for the estabI am in lishment of an Australian navy, and I see the beginning of this movement in the provision which is made in the agreement for the training of 1,600 Australians and New Zealanders in connection with the squadron. That alone is worth the extra £94,000 which we are to pay towards the maintenance of the squadron. We shall get the ful l value for our money in the training which will be imparted to our men. £40,000 of the extra £94,000 will come back to us in the form of pay to the seamen and reservists when the new arrangement is in full operation. from mere bargaining, the growing requirements of our commerce on the high seas call for an increased contribution from us. Moreover, I see in this arrangement the establishment of somekind of balance between our naval and military expenditure. Our military Estimates now amount, roughly speaking, to about £550,000, and we are told by the Imperial authorities that the cost of maintaining the Australian squadron will be about £520,000. be £519,00U, including an allowance of 5 per cent, towards interest and sinking fund. penditure upon our naval defence will be upon a footing somewhat similar to that of our military outlay, and we shall be to some extent reproducing the balance between the forces uow existing in the old country. We are an island-"" continent, with a long coastline to defend, and we are on sound lines when we are trying to maintain some balance between our military and naval expenditure.

But, from the point of view of Ministerial responsibility, and for the sake of the prospects of the commercial life of the community, the question should be settled once for all by the people with their eyes open-a t the ballot-box. The Opposition intend, as far as lies in their power, that there shall be no more sneaking in of Tariffs, and if the people of New South Wales endorse the present imposts they will clo so knowing what the proposals of the Government really are. That is all we ask, and the sooner the question is decided the better it will be for the future of Australia. to speak ou the address in reply, had it not been for the matter of the six hatters, which has excited considerable attention throughout the Commonwealth, and has, mainly at the hands of the press, been subject to more criticism than perhaps any other public question. I am supposed, at any rate by some of the newspapers, to have had some connection with the stopping of these men from landing in New South Wales, and I consider that it is advisable that the facts of the case, from the point of view of the workers of Australia, should be put fairly before the House. The leader of the Opposition expressed the opinion that the Hatters Union could not be responsible for the action of one of its omcers, and would repudiate it , in trying to obtain from the hatters a copy of the agreement under which they came to Australia. Eurther, it has been stated by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that if these men had been coming to Melbourne they would not have been prevented from landing. I am in a position to contradict statements made to that effect, and I can further inform the House that the rules of the English Union prevent men under contract from working in any union shop, so that had these hatters landed in England under circumstances similar to those of the men whose casps we are considering, they would have had to find employment in some establishment not recognised by the union. The action of the union was taken exception to by the leader of the Opposition, but it must be remembered that these hatters were not the first who had arrived in New South Wales under agreement to Mr Anderson since the Immigration Restriction Act was passed ; eight men had previously come out from England under agreement with Mr Anderson. When that gentleman advertised for men, hatters from Victoria went to him, and others wrote to him offering their services, and it ought to be known that while the hatters who went from this State -were given only two or three days' work per week, the men under agreement worked f u l l time. The union were informed thatMr Anderson distinctly said that he intended to use the men under agreement as a means to burst up the union and decrease wages, and it was then thought high time to interfere and stop him breaking the law, which both Mr Anderson and the agreement men knew he was doing. became the catspaw of the union. I have referred were allowed to land because the Act was then not rightly administered. If the letters which had passed between the Acting Collector of Customs at ""Fremantle and the department of External Affairs were produced, it would be seen that the Act was not administered as it should have been, and as it is now administered in America. Altogether there were, I believe, thirteen persons previously allowed to come under agreement and start work with Mr Anderson, and the whole circumstances show that there was no action on the part of any Melbourne organization with the object of preventing the progress of any Sydney industry. Government had previously allowed men to come in underagreement 1 know the men were landed. pointed out to the Government 1 but the fact was known to the Government when these six hatters arrived. The Sydney Hatters Union cabled to the general secretary of the English union on 1st December, 1901, informing him that no men under agreement would be allowed to join the Australian organization. That was done before the six hatters landed in Melbourne. England1 ' tary not informed that all agreements",44,Edmund Barton I Claimed That Member May Make The Assertion But He

276,Mr Thomson,"Was the English secresigned before a given date were to be recognised 1 agreements Signed before the 1st December would be recognised by the Sydney union, and that cable was sent while the men were on the water. If honourable members see the agreement which was made between Mr Anderson and these men, they will admit that it is very one-sided. wish to point out how one-sided was the agreement which was made with the six hatters who landed in Sydney early in December compared with the agreement entered into by the boilermakers in England and the Western Australian Government. Those men, when they signed it , had no idea of the conditions obtaining in Australia at the time. Moreover, I believe they were well aware that they were breaking the law of the Commonwealth. The secretary to the Eelt Hatters' Association in England was warned in May last year that after the passing of the Act men coming to Australia under agreement would be prevented from landing. The society here has come in for a great deal of blame for the action which it is supposed to have taken. It has been asserted that they were behind the Government. Buti f any member of this House or any section of the community knows that the law is being broken, he orfchey have a right to make the fact known to the authorities, and the newspapers which have denouncedfchesociefcyforwhat they did on that occasion are those who cry out most loudly aboutlawandorder. Toprovethatthesociety here did not object to the men coming out, . but objected to the manner in which they had been brought out, I will read the first letter written in connection with the case. The secretary of the society here knew that the Act was being administered by the Customs officials,, and consequently thought that the case should be brouffht under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs; consequently he addressed that Miuister first. His letter is as follows :""May I be permitted to submit on behalf of my competent ""in his work. Also, J. J. contracts to society the following questions :1. Isi t legal for felt hatters to enter into work to the satisfaction of the said Charles agreement in England to serve employers in the Anderson. Commonwealth V -2.

T he cable stated that all The society did not set the law in motion until it found that its members were being penalized in Sydney, and were being compelled to walk about in order to find ful l employment for the contract men who were admitted in contravention of the provisions of the Act. Then they thought it time to interfere. TheI newspapers knew that thirteen individuals were admitted under contract to whom no exception was taken; but that fact was notmade public. One section of the press of Melbourne, and the principal Sydney newspapers, were anxious to strike at the Government, and they saw an opportunity to do so in connection wifchfcheaction taken in regard to the hatters. It has been said that if the Prime Minister intended to release the men, he should have released them at once, without detaining them on board the ship. As a matter of fact, they were not detained on board the ship. I have heard from those who worked wifch them that they were allowed to go on shore every day, and that they never had such a good time before in their lives as when they were supposed to be in durance vile. When the Western Australian Government imported twelve boilermakers under contract the terms of fche contract were very different. That contract specified what hours tlie men should work, whafc wages they should be paid, and what the rate of overtime should be, and stated that if the men worked for a certain period they would nofc be charged for their passage out. The contract with the hatters was a very different one. It was in these terms1. Charles Anderson agrees to engage the said J. J., as plauker and hardener, for a term of three years at a weekly wage of £ 3 per week, and the said Charles Anderson advancesfcothe said J.

Those were the hours worked there when I was in that countiy. great changes since then. society in my pocket, and if the honourable member likes to read them he will see that the hours worked in 1894 are thc hours worked now. These men practically put themselves beyond the pale of their own union in signing the contract. Had they returned to England to work for any employer under agreement, they would not have been allowed to enter any union shop. Thejtried to take advantage of the fact that the union in Sydney is not very strong. When the press was making such a noise about the matter, it was stated that they had been promised by the trade organizations bere a hearty welcome to Australia in February. A t that time, however, the only organizations were those in Melbourne and Adelaide. There was none at all in Sydney until May, and I am positive that the men cannot produce any letter showing that a welcome was promised to any men uncler contract. have looked through the association's letterthat if it will pay tlie expense of bringing book here to find if sueh a letter was sent, and I am satisfied that the only letter sent was the warning I have mentioned, enclosing a copy of the Immigration Restriction Act. A paragraph was published in the newspapers circulating in every felt hatter's diswho imported the men make a contract with trict, that men coming out here under contract would be breaking the law. ing the law. Of the first batch of six hatters, two were practically unknown men, and their expertness is not sworn to in any affidavit produced to this House. Anderson nor Mr Sharpley would swear to-day what they swore then, that the men .were experts such as could not be obtained in Australia, since some of them have already been displaced by other men who have gone over from Melbourne. The man whose clearance was read out by the leader of the Opposition was made foreman of a particular branch, but he was displaced by another man brought from this State to take his place, so he could not have given satisfaction in that position, and he has since gone to New Zealand. members can ascertain the accuracy of my -statement by telegraphing to Sydney. M.r. CONKOY -Did he go to New Zealand of his own accord 1 interviewed by the Sydney Daily Telegraph I have the rules of the as to his expert ability and the qualifications he held, and who stated that he thought the country was a grand one, and tliat he would send for his son to come out, too. I presume that when he was displaced by a workman from this State, he preferred to leave Sydney rather than submit to the humiliation of being pointed out as the man about whom so much bragging was done. My object to-night is to show that the union was justified in the action they took. They were willing that men should come here to compete in the market on the same conditions as themselves, free to get their discharge, and to accept work in any shop they liked. The men in dispute preferred, however, to come out under a contract in which there is no stipulation to the effect that the union conditions either of England or of Australia shall be observed. I ber know that the union has been told these men out here the contract will be cancelled, and that that offer is still open ? to that effect. But why did not the person them on terms similar to those contained in the Western Australian contract 1 I maintain that the organization of which I am a member was justified in the action it took, and that the Government was right in preventing the men from landing until theiremployer had asked for an exemption. He did not do so until l l t h December, and the men were released on the 13th. But accordNeither Mr ing to the facts in my possession, he was not entitled to obtain an exemption, and, to prove that statement. I will read part of his statutory declarationMy foreman in my hut factory, one Walter Sharpley, is an Englishman, and learned his trade and became au expert in felt hat making in .'England, and prior to writing to Messrs. J'epsou Bros, us aforesaid, 1 consulted him and asked him to make a list of the best men lie knew of in England, in the branches of the felt hat making for which I required experts in my factory. The said Wulter Sharpley thereupon compiled a list of the best men he knew of in England, and Honourable whom he could recommend as thoroughly expert. Of the twelve in all who were brought out under agreement, Sharpley has sworn that",46,Edmund Barton I Claimed That Member May Make The Assertion But He

284,Mr Ttjdor,"I have heard a rumourhe knew only seven. Honourable members are mistaken if they think that only six were brought out. There were another six following those six. If you admit six men in. defiance of the provisions of the Act, you might as well abolish the law altogether, as to my mind there is no difference between six and sixty or six hundred, because you will afterwards have to admit every one who chooses to come. men they will be of value to the community. right that we should allow them to come here under conditions which will tend to make things worse for those men who have been here for many years, and have helped to build up our industries. The Hatters Union were quite willing that any number of men should come in here, provide.d they were free to accept work wherever it might offer, and to leave any employment with which they might not be satisfied. The first letter which I read made tliat clear. not prepared to permit men to freely pass from one country to another. as the men were not under engagement. As a matter of fact, the men who came out here under contract could not pass freely from one State to another. not, for instance, leave New South Wales with a view to seeking more profitable employment in Victoria. able member's own story, one of them went to New Zealand. and could, if his employer had chosen, be brought back again and compelled to work. I believe that the workers should have the same free conditions as the honourable and learned member for Werriwa would desire to see apply to the importation of goods. I hold that a workman should be free to go where he chooses, and to sell his labour as he likes, and to obtain the best conditions possible, and that he should also be protected against entering into agreements which would prevent him from siding with his fellow-workers in time of trouble. member permit apprentices to be bound 1 bound under indentures in the hat trade all over the world so as to learn the trade properly. the profession which is adorned by the honourable and learned member apprentices, or their equivalent, have to be bound under articles. Mr Sharpley says, with regard to the first six rhen, that he knew only four of them. He saysI know, ancl am well acquainted, with Messrs. Joseph Joules, Frank Pollitt, Fred.' Davies, and William Gee, who are at present detained on the ship Orontes in the port of Sj'dney, having worked and been associated with them as a felt hatmaker in England. 2. Of my own knowledge of these men, I say that they are each specially qualified as felt hat makers, and are skilled artisans iu that industry. If the leader of the Opposition had been attacking the Government for admitting the hatters, he would not have failed to point out that the evidence upon which they were adjudged to be specially qualified was utterly insufficient. A t least two of them were not known as experts. certificates. showed that tliey were members of the union. The honourable member' for North Sydney remarked that the Hatters' Union had practically made an attempt to "" boss "" They could the Prime Minister, but that was not correct. They became aware that the law was being broken, and they considered it their duty to bring the fact under the notice of the Prime Minister, and to ask him to enforce the Act. The union officials did not object to the introduction of workmen, but they had strong reasons for opposing any wholesale importation of men under fixed agreement. Mr Anderson himself said that he was arranging for. the introduction of several more batches of men to follow the six regarding.whom all the fuss was made, and the union in the light of their knowledge at the time took an absolutely straightforward course, which subsequent events fully justified. and extracted their agreements from their pockets. the honourable they entertained the men or not.

The party of "" l aw and order "" had no hesitation in asking the Prime Minister to set aside the law when they thought it was operating to their disadvantage.

That is a nice sort of declaration to accept as evidence regarding the fitness of these men for admission to the Commonwealth special engagement, and would not be accepted in any court as evidence, and I can imagine how the leader of tlie Opposition have pulled these statements to pieces if he had been attacking the Government from a stand-point opposite to that adopted by him. There was no reason for bringing these men into the Commonwealth, because there was a sufficiency of labour already here. is no desire on the part of the Hatters' Union to retain the work for themselves, but they want any tradesman who comes here to be at liberty to pass freely from shop to shop, or from State to State; and they consider they were justified in fighting for a principle. tirely misled in this matter. The union men were not actuated by motives of jealousy, nor did they desire to prevent the hatmaking industry in Sydney. most anxious that hat factories should flourish there, as their position will be improved if other factories are started, where they can go for employment.

Under the terms of the agreement the men could Mr Tudor. be compelled to work for any number of hours. member knows very well that could not happen under the provisions of the Arbitration Act in operation in New South Wales. not regulate the number of hours to be worked by the men in the hat trade.

The industry there has been enmust be a matter of surprise to free-traders that a much larger number of manufactories have not been established, because they predicted that the duties which were imunder posed under the Tariff would prove prohibitive, and that local manufacturers would enjoy a most profitable monopoly. Howwould ever, the position has not developed as was expected, as we only find one factory started in New South Wales, and the predictions of members of the Opposition during the Tariff debate have not come true. It Was said that these men were There required because of their possession of special knowledge and skill, but it is singular that whilst they were being engaged at £ 3 per week, Mr Anderson was offering £ 3 10s. per week to men employed in Victoria with a view to secure their services.

There is no appeal from his decision, and thus he could, upon there last the most trifling pretext, get rid of the most expert men in the world. That would be the best way of bringing about a dispute, and the Government not only did right in detaining those men, but in my judgment they should have required furtherevidence before admitting them atall.

300,Mr Tudor,"The Arbitration Act doesMinister on thc 16 th December, and urged him to override the law upon this matter. By the way, Mr Walpole, the secretary of thafc association, who, I am informed, receives £1,000 a year, goes about the country as a paid agitator, preaching against conciliation and arbitration, and endeavouring to create disturbances. It was this gentleman who made a statement at Lilydale, when speaking there against the Factories Aet, that mar.riage was a luxury for the workers, as were also "" long sleevers,"" attending theatres, and the like, and that it was not fair to compel employers to pay for such things. This paid agitator receives £.1,000 a year for stirring up trouble between employer and employee. Yet when the workers dared to engage a paid lecturer for a few months the honourable member for Gippsland denounced the proceeding, and declared that the labour organizations obtained the best men they could from abroad. He stated that the workers had no right to adopt that course. Mr A. Hansard. the Employers Federation, if its members hold the same views as those entertained by its secretary, were anxious that these hatters should be kept in the position of bondsmen, and that all Arbitration and Conciliation Aets should be swept away or not brought into operation, because they know the workers are likely to obtain justice there, and they know that under such an Act the condition of the workerswould be improved. Indeed, at a later stage, tliey urged the Prime Ministei not to introduce a Conciliation and 1 Arbitration B ill during the present year.

Hacl they done so, even if they had been out of employment for twelve months, not one of the newspapers such a fuss about the matter would have uttered a word in their favour. I came to Australia from England, I walked the streets for about twelve weeks, ancl the newspapers did not a word in ray favour. But, because they were anxious to discredit the Government, they gave a great amount of publicity to this matter, and refused to print the full facts. Indeed, I was interviewed by a representative of one of the newspapers, and I told him that these hatters were not the first who had come to Australia special contract. question publish that fact 1 Certainly not! The press were anxious to make it appear that it was against all British tradition to exclude the men, when, as a matter of fact, I believe that a similar law operates in Canada. I know that similar legislation exists in America; there the authorities are very particular about asking a man whether or not he is under contract. has led to a lot of lying, just as I have heard that many merchants have lied with regard to certain invoices which have comebeforethe Customs authorities. These merchants might have aimed at the truth, but, if so, they were very bad shots. Before closing, I wish to say a few words in reference to the question of the promised Navigation Bill. I regret that the Government have not given more prominence to that measure. Last night the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, told the House that the mail vessels which come to Australia remain here only a week or a fortnight, and that we have no right to ask them to pay their seamen the Australian rate of wages. But I would point out that upon some vessels, which trade on our coast to the detriment of Australian ships, the crew are frequently shipped at the Islands. I might instance the Dean line, which has been trading here, month after to the detriment I trust that, if time permit, the Government will endeavour to pass some sort of navigation law, though not for the sake of the employers, who are quite able to fight their own battles. If the present unfair competition is allowed, the rate of wages for Australian sailors will probably come down. Mr Tudor. prevailing our firemen and seamen had to suffer a reduction in wages of 10s. per month on this account. Some protection ought to be afforded to our shipping industry, which, I believe, which created employs a greater number of men than any any other industry we have. When the When honourable member for Bland was referring to the agreement between the Defence department and the. Colonial Ammunition publish Company, I felt that it would be very desirable for a copy of that agreement to be laid on the table before it is finally adopted. conditions which obtain in the works of the Colonial Ammunition Company under the under present management, and I am anxious to Did the newspaper in see more protection afforded to the employees. Not many years ago an accident occurred there, and during the consequent excitement many facts were brought out in the press which were not creditable to the estalishment I should prefer to see the ammunition required for the defence forces manufactured by the State, so that we could then regulate the conditions of labour. That practice Last night the honourable inember for Grampians said he hoped that the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act regarding the mail service would receive attention, and that the inconvenience arising from the recent strike on the Victorian railways would not' be allowed to recur. In that hope I join, and I trust that the Government will go further and carry a .Conciliation and Arbitration Bill this session. Honourable members may say that the Victorian railway strike was a State trouble, but I believe that either the Supreme Courts of the States or the High Courfc when established, would rule that such a dispute did extend beyond the limits of any one State, seeing that the people of New South Wales and South Australia were prevented from travelling by rail, and had to resort to water communication.

314,Mr Ttjdor,"I know something of theconvinced than previously of the necessity of including certain powers in the Commonwealth which Ave decided to leave in the Sbates. These remarks were made on. the question of fixing bhe rabes of wages, hours, and conditions oflabour. The honourable member for New England on the same occasion, saidI havo always regarded it as a misfortune that the Constitution Act did not provide that the question of conciliation and arbitration, and the regulation of wages, and conditions of labour generally, should be left as matters for the sole control of the Federal Parliament. take. In any case, I trust the Government will at an early opportuniby inbroduce a Bill to prevent any recurrence of troubles, similar to thab lately experienced in Victoria, and I hope that during this session we will be able to do something to prevent a recurrence of this dispute, and bring about better conditions for all employees in the Commonwealth. always regarded the debates on the Address in Reply as, to a great extent, a waste of time, unless there was a motion of want of confidence before the House. On the present occasion, however, I think the debate is a little more important than usual, seeing that we are a new Parliament legislating for a number of federated States. In a short bime we shall have bo give an accounb of .our stewardship, and it seems to me thab some of the few measures we have passed will call for hard names from those for whom we have been legislating. There are two measures which most prominently stand forward, namely, the Tariff and the Immigration Restriction Act. The Prime Minisber, in his addresses in the different States, .has always urged that the Tariff should be left alone in order that the people may have an opportunity of also, I understand, claimed it, in its present form,astheresultof his Maibland speech; bub we, onthissideof bheHouse, have alsoa strong claim to be regarded as contributors to the Tariff as finally passed. In fact, I may describe the position as an alliance between a young free-trade father and an old decrepit protectionist mother. The result of that alliance is a child, of which the free-trade father is thoroughly and utterly, ashamed, while the protectionist mother, knowing full well that from her age and other s circumsbances, she will never have anobher, is determined to preserve her bantling to the utmost of her ability. My own opinion is that, as a result of the next election campaign, the protectionist bantling will die, more particularly when the Australians come to realize what they are called upon to pay as a result of its birth. I do not know whether honourable members have realized bhe resulb of this protective Tariff, and I desire to call their attention to the item of sugar. Owing to the protection given to the manuI t was a great mis-facturers or producers of sugar, the amount which the people have to pay, and which does not go to the benefit of the revenue, is over £500,000 per annum. I have carefully gone into the matter, and I find that there are, in round numbers, 8,000 persons deriving benefit from the sugar industry, and honourable members know that'there is an excise duty of £ 3 per ton, and a duty of £ 6 per ton on sugar coming in from outsidesources. by black labour is concerned, the cost practically amounts to the same as that on cane sugar produced outside Australia. I understand that a rebate will be allowed on sugar grown by white labour during the twelve months to the amount of £60,000, or about £ 2 per ton on 30,000 tons of sugar. There are something like 160,000 tons of sugar produced in Queensland and New South Wales. sumption. ber for feippsland last night stated that £60,000 was being paid to the producers of sugar by white labour, and. that when the Kanakas were deported in the course of some six years, the whole of the sugar produced, which I understand is 160,000 seeing how it works. He has tons 170,000 tons would be the total consumption. ought to have told the House how much sugar is going to be produced in Australia, or otherwise, why was £340,000 mentioned as the amount the Customs were going to lose when the full rebate was allowed 1 A t the present moment, in order to encourage the growth of sugar by white labour, and to encourage the growth of sufficient to",51,Mclean Did Ii Look At For The Man Who Is Free To Sell His Labour I N

Imported sugar is being landed and sold throughout Australia at practicidly 10s. per ton less than the price at which the Australian sugar is sold, though it is a fact that in certain cases the. price is the same. ""If imported sugar can be brought in, duty paid, and sold at such prices, then local producers ought to be able to supply the community at £17 or £ 1 7 10s. per ton. If the local producers bring the price up to the same as that of the imported sugar, it means that the people of Australia are paying to a small section of the community something like £500,000 per annum, and that payment will go on so long as the present duty continues. We -were told that this is a bonus to the growers -of Queensland and New South Wales. abolition of black labour. arises whether we can do without black labour; and in the meantime, until the Kanaka goes, the consumer is paying £ 3 per ton more for sugar than there is any necessity to pay. The Immigration Restriction Bill has excited great indignation over a large portion of Australia. I do not suppose that such a B ill would have been allowed to pass had it been thought that it would be administered as the Government have administered it . From a return laid on the table on the evening before last I find that 680 persons applied for admission under this Act. Of those, 633 were rejected because they were not able to comply with the education test, which consisted in asking them to write a certain number of words consecutively. No fewer than 33 of the men irejected were white men, and I am sorry to say ""that three or four of them were British. Now, we know that it is. only within the -last few years that the governments of the various countries of the world have devoted much time and trouble to the education of their peoples, and that there are, therefore, -a number of very able and intelligent men who in their youth had no opportunity to acquire the art of reading and writing. Ifc may thus have happened that men who would have made good colonists were rejected because fchey were not educated. But although 33 white men were rejected because they could not pass the test, the same number of coloured men were admitted because they could read and write. Therefore it seems to me that the test is worse than useless. able member say that, when he knows that 630 coloured people were rejected ? able member were the only two who strongly objected to the provisions of the Act. It is true that I supported the Government in providing for an education test rather than a colour test, but I did so upon the principle that of two evils one should chose the lesser. When the measure was under consideration I told the House that I was prepared to limit the number of Chinese and Japanese who could come here, not because I was afraid that the people of those races would come here in such numbers as to reduce wages, but because I felt that if they came here, and increased to large proportions, fchey But the question might eventually menace the safety of Australia. I am, however, no believer in the ""white Australia"" cry. I told honourable members that I saw no reason why, in order to provide for the continuance of the sugar industry, an arrangement should not be made with the British authorities in India for bringing a certain number of Hindoos or other men of Indian race here under agreement to work in the fields, to be sent back when their term of service had expired. Parliament, however, passed tlie Act which we now have on our statute book, and the result was the very unpleasant incident which has been so much discussed.

330,Mr Cameron,"If they had beenthe high rate of wages now prevailing in Australia, they were to receive better wages than they were being paid in England. Thafc having happened, I think the sooner the A ct is removed from the statute-book the better, and I trust the leader of the Opposition, or some other honourable member, will, before the session closes, take steps to secure its repeal, now that we have seen the mistake which we have made. A short Act dealing with aliens such as the Chinese, would answer all purposes, and would place Australia in a higher position in the -eyes of tlie civilized world. W it h regard to the proposals contained in the Governor General's speech, there are one or two which I shall cordially support. I have always held that, Australia being an island continent, a fleet is a form of insurance to us, so that we could not clo better than, so to speak, subsidize the British authorities, if they require a subsidy, to provide for our defence. I do not see that great prominence has been given in the speech to the arrangement for the taking over of New Guinea by the Commonwealth. I presume that what we agreedfcolast session will be ratified, and I ask honourable members who made such a howl about a white Australia a few months ago how they will reconcile their position then with their unanimous approval of the proposal to take over New Guinea? We have been told that if we allow aliens to come into Australia we shall have a piebald population; but if New Guinea is incorporated in the Commonwealth the time must come when its people must be admitted to all the rights and privileges of citizens of the Commonwealth, because it will be colonized largely by men who have gone from Australia. When New Guinea contains a large population of white people, we shall be unable to refuse them the franchise. We cannot say to ""them-""S o long as you remain in New Guinea you will be regarded as aliens, and will have no voice in the framing of the laws of Australia."" They will demand, and we shall lie compelled to yield, tlie privileges which are enjoyed by our own people. Bufc another difficulty arises. As a rule when men go to countries which are inhabited by coloured people, they to a certain extent carry their lives in their hands, ancl most of them go unmarried. Buti f they settle in such a countiy they often in course of time make alliances with the natives amongst whom they live, and in sz this way a mixed population is created. How can tlie Commonwealth call itself a "" white Australia "" when it has within its borders such a population as must spring up in New Guinea1 The thing is absurd. I do nofc intend to discuss the other Bills on the programme, because there are many other honourable members who wish to address the House; but I desire to say that I thoroughly approve of the intention of the leader of the Opposition to endeavour to obtain at the next general elections an opinion from the country as to whether we should adopt a protective or a free-trade policy As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, honourable members were to a certain extent .returned under false pretences at the last elections. Many of them were returned, not because of their fiscal opinions, but because they had occupied important positions in the State Ministries and Parliaments, ancl it was felt by the electors that the ablest men offering should be chosen. The Government have succeeded in passing a very hybrid Tariff, and one which is, I think, unsatisfactory to both parties. I have always been a revenue tariffist. I could not, like an honourable gentleman who spoke yesterday, reconcile free-trade opinions with the advocacy of a duty upon potatoes and oats. The furthest I have gone in the direction of protection-if I can be said to have gone in that direction at all-is in voting for the Bonus Bill when it first came before us. I voted then for the payment of bonuses for a certain limited period. When the Bill came before us on the second occasion, I voted against it , because it had been altered in an important particular. I trust that the battle of free-trade and protection will be fought out to the bitter end. No doubt, honourable members opposite would like the present Tariff to continue in force for a little while to see how it works. I have already shown what the consumer has to pay on sugar, and how he is being robbed. If all the sugar consumed in Australia were locally produced, the manufacturers would be able to pocket the duty of £ 6 per ton, and the consumers would have to pay £800,000 within a few years. Referring to the question of revenue tariffism, as distinguished from protection, I still feel very sore at the attitude assumed by the leader of the free-trade party with regard to the tea duties. I hold that as a revenue tariffist it was his duty to have supported that impost. One of the arguments used by the right honourable and learned gentleman was .that as duties were being levied upon nearly everything, and New South Wales would receive a far larger amount of revenue than it required, he did not feel justified in supporting the tea duty. Whilst, however, the Prime Minister, on various occasions, has twitted the leader of the Opposition upon his attitude, I say that ten times more blame attaches to the Government for the action they took. If the Government had desired to study the' interests of the smaller States, they should have callecHheir supporters together and told them that the imposition of the tea duty was a matter of policy by which they would stand or fall, and that if the interests of the smaller States were not studied to the extent they regarded as necessary, they would hand in their resignations. If they had taken this attitude a large majority of the Government supporters would have stood by them, and the duty would have become the law of the land. They, however, lefc their supporters to .do as they pleased, and in spite of the support received from ten members of the Opposition the duty was defeated. Their action was neither more nor less than a sop to the labour party. If it were not so, why in the name of decency was not the duty dealt with in the order in which it appeared upon the Tariff! It was dangled like a carrot at the nose of the donkey, and the donkey followed it and eventually had the pleasure of devouring it . adversely comment upon the Government Without detaining the House at any further length, I will conclude by venturing to hope that the remarks which I have made will bear f r u it in due season. i l r . THOMSON (North Sydney) -Whilst I highly appreciated the strong and eloquent speech of the honourable member for Gippsland, I cannot say that I was fully in agreement with him. I cannot support the high eulogium he passed upon the Prime Minister's speech. I quite agree that that deliverance was excellent, but excellent only in passages. Like the curate's egg, it was good in parts, but the parts which were bad, were exceedingly objectionable. The right honourable gentleman offered the weakest defence I ever heard, even from a barrister-at-law, in regard to his statements made during the recess as to the action of the Opposition in the case of the tea duty, and in relation to the Immigration Restriction Act. He had the audacity to endeavour tq support these statements, although, as has been pointed out, a larger proportion of the members of the Opposition than of the Ministerial supporters voted for the tea duty. number of members of the Opposition led the Government to believe they would vote for the duty, and then were wheedled into opposing it ? whether that is a fact or not, but I am not prepared to believe it. I know that when the division came on, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was looking for the Attorney-General, because that Minister had left the Housei n the face of an important division without pairing. It was a particularly audacious thing for the Prime Minister to say that there was an alliance between the Opposition and the labour party to defeat the Immigration Restriction Act, and it savoured very much of ingratitude on his part not to acknowledge that six members of the Opposition had actually saved the measure from defeat. Then, again, the Prime Minister made use of base insinuations as to the. motives which prompted the Opposition in certain criticisms of the administration. He declared that the Opposition was influenced in its criticism of the Customs administration by a desire to aid the rich importers. He further said that they were induced by a disposition in favour of black labour to action in regard to the Immigration Restriction Act. He said that they were prompted, not by honest motives, but by spiteful feeling against the Government. He charged them with having in some mysterious way originated and spread the reports in regard to the rejection of the six hatters, which caused such a commotion throughout the British Empire. That statement has been fully answered by one of the Prime Minister's supporters, who condemned the action of the administration in the strongest possible terms. The Hon. Henry Copeland, the Agent-General of New South Wales, who is reported to have stated that the refusal to admit the hatters into the Commonwealth had created a bad effect in England, is a protectionist supporterof thePrimeMinister, and protectionists throughout Australia we re at one with the free-traders in condemning",53,Mclean Did Ii Look At For The Man Who Is Free To Sell His Labour I N

332,Mr Thomson,"I do not knowthafc action. I do not intend to re-warm victuals that have become cold during recess, but I must deal wifch certain acts of administration in connection with the Customs and with the Immigration Restriction Act, because, owing to the Prime Minister's insinuations, ifc is necessaiy to give good reasons, instead of the bad ones suggested by him, for the attitude of the Opposition in each case. In the first place, however, I desire to allude to some of the leading features of the Governor General's speech. The Prime Minister stated that the leader of the Opposition had discovered very little in the speecli from the Throne with which he could find fault. The explanation lies in the fact that nearly all the proposals are with regard to machinery measures required to bring into force those provisions of the Constitution, to which effect has not yet been given. In this category I include the High Court Bill, the New Guinea Government Bill, the provision to be made for the direct representation of the Commonwealth in London by a High Commissioner, a uniform Patent Law, and fche proposal to create an Inter-State Commission. The Defence Bill is also a machinery measure, although it is being brought forward very late in the day. The work outlined in the speech is no doubt altogether too mucli to be dealt with in one session. Some of those proposals which do not come within the description I have given are not open to criticism until we have seen the Bills when they are brought before the House. W it h regard to the High Court Bill, the proposed appointment of a High Commissioner in London and the Inter-State Commission Bill, I desire to say that whilst I am as anxious as is any other honourable inember of this House to limit the expenditure of the Commonwealth, I -shall support these proposals, if a good case can be made out for them. Regarding the Inter-State Commission I have no hesitation in saying that if the proposed Bill is founded on the provisions of tlie measure which was introduced last session, it will have my opposition. I cannot agree to the absolutely unnecessary expense thafc would be involved in bringing every common carrier throughout Australia-ever y bullock driver who crosses from one State to another, and every steamer that navigates our coasts -<as well as the railways, under the control of that commission. I admit that there seems to be some necessity for the creation of the commission, because preferential rates exist upon the railways in absolute contravention of the Constitution. These rates are really a substitute for the inter-State customs duties, which have been abolished, and we must adjust matters as soon as possible. railway stations instead of afc the Customhouses. Minister says. A t the same time, I do not think we should go further than is absolutely necessary. We should appoint a commission upon the cheapest possible basis, and restrict its work witliin the closest possible limits. If , in future, it is found necessary to extend the functions of the commission, we may introduce Bills referring other matters to its jurisdiction. W it h regard to the federal capital site, I am entirely in accord with the terms of the Governor General's speech, and I hope that the Government will see the necessity and justice of pressing this matter to a decision during the present session. The honourable meniber for Gippsland alluded to the heavy new taxation which all the States would bear in connection with certain matters which he mentioned. One of these was that of the sugar excise. But in this connection it should be remembered that, although the total of his figures was a large one, it does not approach the extra taxation to which New South Wales had to submit to enter the Federation. Nearly £1,500,000 additional taxation had to be paid by the people of that State as a consequence of it entering the Federal union. but like many other people, when they found their hands full of money they became spendthrifts, and incurred expenditure after expenditure until, instead of a surplus, they had a deficiency. That they did not need it was evidenced by the fact that they were before well able to carry on without it. To induce them to accept this burden and consent to the bond of union, provision was made in the Constitution that the capital site should be in . New South Wales territoiy. That was recorded in the bond, and is one of the reasons why the site should be selected at the earliest possible moment. Then there is the matter of the establishment of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration. I am fully impressed With the desirableness of avoiding",55,Mclean Did Ii Look At For The Man Who Is Free To Sell His Labour I N

336,Mr Thomson,"They did not need it,those contests between capital and labour which eventuate in strikes; but I have yet to learn how the combined powers of legislation on the part of the States and of tlie Commonwealtli are going to work in unison upon this matter. I think it would have been better to await the results of the working of the Actsi n the different States, ment are asking is certainly not too much. to ascertain if they require amendment, and then for the Commonwealth to obtain the consent of the States to deal with the whole question. amendment has now been pretty well indicated. all the points which require amendment have been indicated. In addition to the clashing of legislative power, I am afraid that we may encourage the frequency of disputes by the multiplicity of courts. I am afraid that there will be a tendency both on the part of masters and men, when defeated in the State court, to take their case into the Federal court. Again, when a decision has been given in the Federal court in regard to an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of a State, either side may create trouble in one of those States, and the arbitration court of that State may give an entirely different decision from that of the Federal court. Of course, it is possible that the Minister may have found a means to overcome these difficulties, but if his proposals, instead of reducing industrial disputes, are likely to increase them, I shall not be found supporting him. I need not enter largely into a discussion of the naval defence question, because I agree with those who have so ably supported the contribution to the Imperial Government. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, in their opposition to that subsidy, both made a strong point of the fact that if we commit ourselves to such a contribution, we shall eventually be committed to bearing our f u l l proportion-o n whatever basis it may be determined-of the expenditure necessary for the naval defence of the Empire. I do not think that that question arises at the present stage. If it comes to that, we are already committed, because we already contribute. tribute. itself has contributed. The only thing which we are now asked to do is to contribute a little more than we have done previously, and I think there is reason for that. If we are to contribute at all, I think the amount for which the GovernI n my opinion, it is even too little. We must also remember that all the schemes for local defence which are put forward by exjierts differ entirely. What one says is necessary another declares is unnecessary. One would employ heavily-armed vessels for defence of our harbors and offings, whilst another recommends cruisers to keep off the fast armoured vessels which might attack our commerce at sea. Which of these plans are we to adopt 1 To my mind, we require more knowledge of what is required and of the important developments which are at present going on in the way of naval warships.

The adjustment proposed of the rebate of the sugar excise duty I shall be prepared to consider when the Ministry bring forward the Bil l relating to it . I know that the proposal will confer an advantage upon the State which I represent, but I am quite willing to consider other States in the matter; and, if I see good reason to oppose it, the fact that it will benefit New South Wales will not weigh with me. An other measure which is foreshadowed in the dim and distant future, and which, I suppose, is intended as the piece de resistance for the elections, is the Navigation ancl conShipping Bill.

344,Mr Thomson,"Precisely . If we dome that it is intended to support what is already growing on our coasta shipping ring and, whilst a measure to deal with rings and trusts is also promised by the Government, I think it will be found very dimcult to handle that question in such a Bill. I do not suppose that the Minister will attempt to lay it down that the rates shall sot be uniform, and if they are uniform I think tliis Bill will fail to operate, as similar measures'have done elsewhere. The only other matter to whicli I wish to allude is that of preferential trade. notice that the reference to this question is put very gently in the Governor General's speech, which readsMy advisers observe with gratification recent utterances of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, advocating the encouragement of trade relations between various parts of the Empire. If we can judge from the telegraphed reports of Mr Chamberlain's utterance-and I do not think we should hold him to them until the f u l l text of his speech is available-it is not encouragement of trade, but compulsion of trade at which he aims. The idea, is that trade shall be compelled to go in a certain direction. Now, I have a great suspicion of the compulsion of trade in any form. Just as the leader of! the Opposition, in quoting Mr Gladstone, said that we have been left free to buy our experience in any market, so we have been left free to buy or sell, our goods in any market. That is a privilege for which we ought to be grateful, ancl one which we ought to hesitate before we give up. Under the new system, if it is ever adopted, we shall not be able to decide a Tariff for ourselves in what we consider the best interests of our own country. Word will come from Great Britain and other parts of the Empire that we must not do this or that, or retaliatory steps will be taken. Instead of offering, as it is supposed to offer, grounds for more cordial relationship between the mother country and her daughters, the system offers every opportunity for dissension, disagreement, and perhaps disruption, and its adoption would be the entering on a very dangerous course. I am at one with the honourable member for Parramatta-wh o put the matter so well-in having no belief that Great Britain will adopt such a system. What would 'it nrieanl According to the telegrams it means, not merely arrangement with the States of Australia and other parts of the Empire, that he is the only honest Minister for but it also means concessions to, in return for concessions from, the other powers of Europe. That implies a Tariff so extensive and so high in Great Britain that I do not believe for a moment the people there will entertain any such proposal. As to the questions of administration to which I have alluded, I should have liked to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs before I spoke, so that I might know, after his tour through the States and his experience at different meetings-ver y I pleasant experience for the most part-and , after his interviews with different Chambers of Commerce, to what extent he is prepared to modify that administration of the Customs which has met with criticism so severe. I shall, however, have to do without the assistance which would have been rendered by that speech. In regard to the remark of the Prime Minister, about rich importers and poor sailors, I have to say that we are bound to look at this question apart altogether from the richness or poverty of those concerned. We desire to see even-handed justice extended to all, ancl to see no unnecessary interference with trade and commerce, which are the life blood of the community. conducted. that remark. l a m afraid that in this, as in other matters, Ministers who get extreme powers are inclined to use them to the fullest extent not only in extreme cases, but in the most ordinary cases. In Sydney the Minister for Trade and Customs alluded, rather unkindly, perhaps, to a member of one of these Houses, whose speeches, he said, were like the reading of tlie Riot Act, inasmuch as every one fled when they began. I do not think that was a justifiable remark, but rather that the Minister and others would have found a great deal of benefit by staying to hear the speeches. as good as the RiotA ct or "" God Save the King."" ister a Riot Act he would read it at every street discussion, judging from the way in which he administers the powers already invested in him.

There is good ground for reasonable leniency in the administration of such a Tariff at its early stages. The Tariff is difficult of interpretation, the lines that divide different 'classes of duty being narrow and vague in many cases. The difliculty is proved beyond doubt by the hundreds of decisions the Minister has given, and by the fact that many of these decisions are contrary-that a second decision cancels the first. That shows the difliculty of interpretation even by the framer of the Tariff. There have been prosecutions against iudividuals for breaches of the Act, and afterwards a decision has honourable been given by the' Minister showing that prosecutions in connection with cases where I did as soon as I got a decision was afterwards altered. memory, but I shall look up the cases.

I am sorry I have not the newspaper extract here, and I should not have mentioned the case but for an interjection, but I have it on the premises, and I can show it to the Minister. Another reason for breaches of the law is the improper system whereby duties are imposed on goods according to the use to which they are to be put. Certain articles are dutiable if they are to be used for certain purposes, and they are nofc dutiable if they are to be used for otlier purposes. Magistrates say that member give me an instance 1 article, and there are many others. I objected strongly to such duties on every occasion when they came before us. . I pointed out that an honest man who imported such goods might know that a certain quantity of them would be used for a purpose for which they were not dutiable, and another quantity for a purpose for which they were dutiable, and, with every desire to be just he would be unable to know whafc duty he should pay on the whole importation. An extremely honest man might pay duty upon everything imported, while a man who was not honest would pass the whole without the payment of the duty, as imported for a purpose which rendered them non-dutiable. That system has given an opening for the evasion of customs duties, and similar openings are given in many other directions. The first case which I will lay before honourable members does not display undue severity in the collection of revenue on the part of the Minister,.but rather laxity in that respect. A petition on the subject is already before the House. The Colonial Sugar Befining Company allege that 9,000 tons of sugar have escaped the payment of excise duty, and they have asked for an inquiry into the matter. I know nothing of it personality, but a statement of the facts has been given to me, and I will briefly recite it fco the House. The company sayThe Tariff was imposed on the Sth October, 1901, and all the sugar in our stores in Brisbane was taken possession of then and duty levied thereon as it went into consumption.

It is believed that most of this sugar had been removed from the factories prior to the 8th October, but a quantity was, we have been informed, on steamers in Queensland waters, and the remainder waa in the stock, custody, and possession of the manufacturers iu Brisbane and elsewhere. In at least one instance the sugar was, we understand, in buildings owned by the manufacturer. On the ISth October, the Collector of Customs in Brisbane was asked why. he had not levied duty on the sugar, and a few da3's later the matter was reported verbally to the Comptroller in Sydney, further representation being made to him in Melbourne on the 31st October on the subject. No considerable quantity of the sugar in question had 'by that time been disposed of, as all buyers had stocked up before the duty was imposed. As the Comptroller had stated officially that this 9,000 tons of sugar should pay duty, we thought justice would be done to us. so did not appeal to Parliament at the time ; but further remonstanees were addressed to the department during November, and on the 10th December we received a letter stating that the matter was under the consideration of the Minister. Nothing more was heard from the Customs, and, as it was generally supposed in Queensland that the duty collected on the stocks of sugar on the Sth October would be gi ven up, further action was not taken until the sugar duties had been discussed in the House, when the statement of the Minister showed that he intended to retain the money thus collected. An appeal was therefore made to the Senate for au amendment of the Act, so that the legality of the proceedings of the Minister could be tested in the Courts, but the majority voted against such amendment. the petition presented to the House? are further particulars which I asked forcharge duty upon it , and to let it go iuto It is to be noted that all proceedings taken by the department in this matter have been legalized under sub-section (6) of seotion 5 of the Excise to the department he w ill be made to pay ifc Tariff Act, which provides that the stocks liable to duty were those ""subject to the control of the Customs, or to excise supervision, or in the stock, not collect the revenue upon this sugar if it custody, or possession of, or belonging to any has been allowed to go into consumption. brewer, distiller, or manufacturer, or refiner thereof. "" The only sugar under the control of the Customs in Queensland was that on board steamers; what we had was seized. It is said that a portion under the circumstances ifcean be recovered. of the 9,000 tons was on steamers at Bundaberg, However, it would have been better to or in Brisbane, or between these ports ; if so, this was not taken for duty.

This was not, howcollect it was nob taken. I am nofc responever, to our knowledge, done in any instance, and sible for the accuracy of this statement, the Brisbane collector was allowed to override the Comptroller, who, as before stated, regarded the sugar as subject to duty, and held that its exemption was an injustice to otlier manufacturers who Were compelled, to pay. The .view of the department on this point is set forth in the following ruling, of which a copy has been forwarded to us : "" If this sugar was manufactured before the Sth October, .1901, and on that date still belonged to the manufacturer, it is undoubtedly dutiable under paragraph {b) of section 5 of Excise Act 1902. This applies to all sugar belonging to the manufacturer thereof on the Sth October, 1901, notwithstanding it may not be in his possession on that date, or afterwards returned to his possession."" It is clear that in the last sentence "" in his possession,"" sliould be read as meaning "" in h is premises,"" because the minute referred to certain sugar which had been removed from a mill in September, 1901, and returned thereto a year afterwards ; and it shows that the department considered all sugar so removed was dutiable. Why, then, was not anj' effort mode to collect the d uty on the 9,000 tons? The sugars seized in Brisbane and elsewhere in Queensland, which belonged to us, were in every instance in buildings free of Customs or Excise supervision at the time the Tariff was introduced. The suits entered by us against the Customs are to determine the legality of the seizure on the Sth October, aud raise a number of difficult points of law.

Before the Minister spoke in Sydney the managing director of the Colonial Sugar Befining Company wrote a letter to the Sydney newspapers, drawing his attention to the matter. The letter repeats some of the statements which I have already read, and which I will not read over again; but the writer goes on to sayOur first petition was to the Senate, and all that the Government could advance against it was a remark by Mr JR. E. O'Connor that our clear statements of bare fact were impossible and incredible. To the next petition, which was sent to the Governor General [i.e., the Executive), the reply was that the Minister of Customs-a t whose door the charges were laid-ha d ascertained that no discrimination was exercised by his officers in the collection of the excise duty. That is not a reply at all. I think that the -truth or otherwise of the non-payment of duty on the 9,000 tons should have been alluded to. It should have been stated whether the sugar existed tp the knowledge of the Customs' officials, and why, if it so existed, ifc was nofc charged with duty. there had been discrimination. The officer reported that nothing of the kind had occurred, and information was given accordpay duty, a discrimination was shown. ing Company did not send any one to the. Miuister to represent their case in a proper manner. the next step taken-the passing of a resolution by the four principal chambers of commerce in Australia, calling for an inquiry into the matterI might point out that the members of those bodies we're no more interested in the people who paid the duty than in those who did not pay. The writer of the letter savsThe third step taken was a representation by the four principal Chambers of Commerce in Australia, to the Prime Minister, that an inquiry was called for in the matter, and it is S gnificarifc that after several months Sir Edmund Barton has not been able to find a word of justification or even apology for his colleague's action. Another Minister has, however spoken-the Attorney-General-wh o last week in a newspaper interview is reported to have said, first, that we were moving in the matter because we wanted the money paid by us to be returned, and, secondly, tliat so long after the event it would be difficultfcoprove anything. MrL . E. GKOOM -Did they ask for a refund of the duty ? that question. Mr Knox writesAs to the first remark I have to sa}' that it is not true. This refers to the suggestion that it was desired that there should be a refund of the 1 dutj'. Mr Knox proceeds to sayMr Deakin ought to know that the Customs cannot return any duties which have been legally levied. That is so. The company recognised thab if the duty were legally levied they would have no right to escape their responsibility for its payment, on the ground that the authorities had not made a similar levy upon others who might be equally charge-' able, and they knew that the question as to whether tlie duty could be legally levied afc all was one to be determined by the courts. The letter which I have read is a very strong one, which should receive the attention of any Minister. It is as much in the Minister's own interests as in the interests of the Customs administration generally that I bring this matter forward. The whole question should have been inquired into at an earlier date. Requests haA'e been made for an inquiry, and yet the Minister has not taken any action. If he is able to say that he has done so, I shall be only too pleased to hear him. nation exercised in favour of any one. My instructions were to collect any duty that was available. there was any intentional discrimination, but if the facts are stated correctly discrimination was exercised.

406,Mr Thomson,"I did not say thafcfor his officers in the same way as merchants are held responsible for the acts of their clerks. There is fche strongest reason for inquiry into the points whether the sugar was in store as reported, whether the Comptroller stated that it was liable to duty, and whether the duty has or has not been collected. I do not vouch for the correctness of the statements which I have read to the House, but I have given them as they were conveyed to me. At all events, the case is one which calls for the closest inquiry by the Minister, and information should be furnished to the House as early as possible as to whether that duty was collected. If it was evaded, we should be told why the officers of the Customs or the Minister allowed the evasion, when the matter was reported to one of their departments on 10th October, further reported at a later date, and again on the 31sfc October, whilst correspondence .and petitions been passing on the matter ever since. There is another point to which I desire to direct the attention of honourable members, namely, the dangerous system thafc has arisen, partly under the powers given by this House in connection with the Tariff, of allowing what is practically legislation by the Minister. them very-long classed as minor articles for use in manufacture. quoted under this heading where articles are required to pay a duty if they are designed for one purpose, and are admitted free if they are said to be intended for use in manufacture. haphazard from a list extending at least two columns of the Commonwealth Gazette, which were uncler the heading of "" Manufacture of Vehicles."" "" Couplings (shaft and pole): hinges (concealed and butt); joints (concealed);""shacklesj seat slides ; staples (breeching). a number of other articles appearing under the same headings will leave hardly any of the component parts of a vehicle subject to duty. power for any Minister to exercise. we come to the taxation of and I think the Minister has taken a wrong view of his duty in this respect. I tested this very question in New South Wales, and a decision in favour of the view to which I am about to give utterance. Articles which were well Mr Thomson. known at the time the Tariff was introduced, should nofc be taxed as substitutes for other articles. AVe had the power to tax such articles when the Tariff was before Parliament : and if the Minister desired them to be included in the dutiable list, he should have applied to Parliament for the necessaiy authority. If these articles were well known to the Customs at the time the Tariff was passed, they ought .not subsequently to be taken as substitutes for other known articles. Just consider for a moment how far the system adopted by the Minister might extend. An y food preparation might be held by the Minister to be a substitute for some other food, and he might in this way impose duties upon articles which had been left free. I have not time to go through the whole of the Minister's decisions upon this point, but I have noticed two articles which, according have to the Customs authorities, come within the category of substitutes, but which I say should not be so regarded. For instance there are mica chimneys. These articles have been imported for years, and were well known tb the Customs at the time the Tariff was under consideration, and should then have been taxed if they were considered to I find list after list, some of be fit subjects for duty. Another article is ones, exempting goods curled fibre, which is also well known, and is now regarded by the Customs as a subScores of instances mighb be stitute for curled hair. AVe had an opportunity of taxing this article if we had chosen, but the Minister did nofc ask us to do so. Now, however, it is declared to be taxable as a substitute. The case of cartI took several articles ridges and the shot contained in them has alover ready been mentioned. UnderfcheTariff cartridges were declared to be non-dutiable, but enumerated shot was made dutiable. I quite'.agree fchat there is some inequality in this, and if the Included among these areMinister brings in a measure to make dutiable the shot contained in cartridges, I shall support him on the ground of justice. These, and But when. the matter was before Parliament it was decided, notwithstanding the fact that they might contain shot, that cartridges should not be dutiable. In spite Now, that is a very dangerous of this the Minister has taken upon himThen self to legislate, not merely outside the substitutes, authority of Parliament, but in the face of the decision of Parliament, and has endeavoured to impose a duty upon the shot contents of cartridges. It has been was . secured pointed out to me that cartridges appear upon the free list in the Tariff guide prepared by the Customs department, and yet a duty was sought to be imposed upon them. I am very glad that the Minister has issued the Tariff guide, upon which a great deal of work has been expended, and which will prove very useful, to the trading community. I do not intend to weary the House by reference to the various autocratic actions of the Minister to which exception has been taken from time to time. If honourable members want to find instances, let them refer to Senator Pulsford's lists. In regard to many of the complaints, no reply has been given by the Minister, and no doubt Senator Pulsford will direct attention to these cases in another place. I shall refer to only one case, in which a gentleman in Sydney .was concerned. This gentleman endeavoured to obtain a hearing at the recent meeting of the Ministeri n Sydney, but he was not allowed to speak. I do not wonder at his indignation. The facts are these-The Fuller Carrying Company passed an entry for an invoice relating to 22 cases containing 441 separate items. There were two mistakes in the entry, one being an error in excess to the extent of 25s., and another fin error under which the duty paid was 17s. short. Balancing one item against the other the department still stood-with Ss. to the good. The importer, however, was brought up to the court on account of the shortage of 17s., and was fined. I believe that the Minister has stated that the fact of the over-payment was not brought to light until the case came into court. payment was brought to light the case was not withdrawn, and the man who had actually paid the Customs too much was fined. Not only so, but before he could get delivery of his goods, although he had overpaid 8s., he had to enter into a bond, and obtain sureties, that if the goods were forfeited their value would be paid. Further, although the goods were landed in October .last, the bond was only cancelled by the Collector of Customs on the 28th of last month. fche fine 1 when he spoke in Sydney the other day. turned. nature naturally provoke indignation. I do not intend to quote any more of these instances, because they are very numerous, and it would only occupy the attention of the House unnecessarily. A t the same time. I must admit"" that the Minister is to some extent moving from the untenable position which he assumed when he first undertook the administration of the Tariff. I do not complain of that, because I think fche right honourable gentleman is moving in the right direction without endangering the revenue. But I would point out that the change which he is making, is, in itself, an indication that injustice has been done in the past. A t one time the right honourable gentleman said that no discrimination oughfc to be exercised, that the courts should decide whether the cases which came before theminvolved fraud or merely error, but that he would not take it upon himself -to decide the matter. Only the other day, however, in replying to a deputation from 'the Sydney Chamber of Commerce-and I congratulate him on the spirit which animated him on that occasion-h e said that a discrimination is being exercised. Mr Rogers remarkedIfc was only the intention of Parliament that those extraordinary powers should be exercised, not in cases of trivial error, but in cases where there is an attempt to defraud. rect report. but I think that I saw -the statement recorded in both newspapers. told the deputation was thafc importers must declare to the authoritiesfchenature of the goods ancl their value. saidHe (the Minister) should be satisfied with genuine invoices giving the proper values and discounts, supported by a bill through a bank. importer should be prosecuted for a mistake in the duty, and I have put thafc in the letter to you.

The offence is theAs to any error in your duty or any error that maj'' enter into a declaration, my clerks are there to check your statements."" In transactions between different merchants, if an overcharge is made by one to another, there is no part of the British Empire where that is treated as a crime and the man is taken into a court. The clerks of the other merchant are there to check, and as long as honest data upon which the calculation is formed are given to the Customs the Minister need require nothing more. If it is thought necessary to discourage error in the calculations based on each data, let there be fines for mistakes, and let them be imposed at once, as a matter of rule, b j ' the officers receiving the entry. The Minister has power to impose fines. Let there be fixed fines imposed. The Minister can if he likes fine merchants 10s., £ 1 , or any other sum for each error that is made. That is one way to secure correctness. If he demands f u l l disclosures both of goods entered under fixed duties and ad valorem duties he has full security, and then if mistakes are made let him fine the individuals concerned indiscriminately' without dragging them into the police courts. If a person commits an offence with the post-office by insufficiently stamping a letter the receiver is fined. Why should not the Customs adopt the same practice ? There would be nothing in it which would assist evasion of duties on the part of those dealing with the Customs. Let the Custom-house be conducted on the most rigid lines as to honesty, but there is no need for all this friction, disturbing the good relations which should exist between the trading community of Australia and the Customs authorities. There are dishonest persons in the community who -will t i y by everj' means and sj stem to rob the revenue of large sums. 7 A t present the proceedings of the Customhouse suggest to me that the Minister and his staff are so busy catching mice that they cannot catch tigers-and the tigers are those persons in the community who will seek by. every device to rob the Customs. We want those persons to be exposed, not a multitude of trivial errors which will occur in business. As to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, the Prime Minister states that his administration is in accordance with the intent of Parliament, and absolutely in accordance with the terms of the law. He says that he intends to administer the whole Act in strict accordance with the law. I interjected while he was speaking that I did not recognise the accuraej* of that statement. I will now endeavour to show that I was right in my view. If we look at the debates on the occasion of the introduction of that measure we find this statement, which was made by the Prime Minister, and which enabled him to get the powers which the Act conferred upon him. The right honourable gentleman said, alluding to a previous speaker. He also knows that Governments must be credited with common sense, or it is no use committing to them the administration of suoh measures at all. This amount of common sense and discretion must be credited to the present Government and its successors. 1 Then he says further onI have told honourable members why we think it necessary to take large power, namely, because large powers are necessary to deal with the cases which we have to meet, and also because it is necessaiy to give a large discretion to the Government in the belief that they will not act harshly in those cases which are not within the evil we wish to meet. That is the common covering request which secured the passage of the A ct in its present form. *Of course the amendment was not then in the Bill, but what did the Prime Minister say as to the object of the amendment. He saidAs to the other question, I think the amendment is a fair one. It tends to prevent the admission into the Commonwealth of persons who especially if they are not well educated, will be probably-o r may be at any rate-brough t here in ignorance of our industrial conditions, and who will thus enter into bargains which tliey would, not have made if they had had the opportunity of observing the working of our institutions. That is one thing tlie Prime Minister siiid ; here is anotherMoreover, this legislation has the further disadvantage of guarding against the making of agreements of which the workmen who made them would repent as soon as they landed on our shores. I think the amendment is a fair one. and shall, therefore, support it. These are the assurances given to us by the Prime Minister, and the intention of those who passed the measure was never that it* should be exercised in the way it has been exercised. Other honourable members have quoted extracts which show that this was the opinion current in the House. When the Prime Minister says that if that is not the intent of the A ct it is the law, and that he will administer the law to the letter, I reply that he will not do so, and thafc he is not doing so ; further that if he in order to find out who are undesirable did do so, then we should have to take out immigrants, of the classes I have just menof his hands, or the hands of any Minister, a tioned. measure that would work such trouble and be so decidedly objectionable.

He might have announced that it would contain duties ranging from 10 to 15 per cent., or from 30 to 30 per cent., or from 40 to 50 per cent., as thc case might require; but not one word was said as to the real weight of the Tariff, although questions were asked on more than one occasion. Either it had not been decided upon, or accurate information regarding it was withheld from the public. Therefore it is perfectly reasonable, now that the Tariff has been brought forward and put into force, that the people whom it affects should have a chance of expressing their opinion regarding it If honourable members do not give the people that opportunity, they will take it for themselves. know that in New South Wales the electors will not be content to bury the Tariff question, and I am quite in accordance with the leader of the Opposition in his determination to bring it forward.
