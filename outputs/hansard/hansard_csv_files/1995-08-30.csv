A The following papers were deemed to haveWednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 879 Wednesday, 30 August 1995 Justice Statement Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the papers. Statement and to take note of the paper. The Justice Statement, released recently by the government, is part of the ongoing changes in Australia's justice system. In the acknowledgments to the statement, one notes that the process of reform began with the initiatives of the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr), in establishing the Access to Justice Advisory Committee way back in October 1993. Over 130 submissions were received in response to the Access to justice report and these contributions were invaluable in developing the initiatives and reforms announced in this statement. The Justice Statement focuses on 11 key areas and I think it is important to note them. These areas are: families; resolving disputes; lawyers; courts and tribunals; the national women's justice strategy; legal aid; accessing laws; consumer protection; tackling crime; human rights; and access across cultures. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the time allocated to me, I do not wish to speak on all these areas, valuable though they are to the issue of justice. Rather, I would like to concentrate on the following four aspects of the statement, which are perhaps more relevant to my electorate than to others: families, resolving disputes, the national women's justice strategy, and the issue of legal aid. In my mind, these four areas are inextricably linked and, as I speak to them, I will wander across and through the four areas. Over the life of this federal Labor government, we have set out to ensure that all Australian families, irrespective of where they reside, irrespective of their race, colour, creed or socioeconomic circumstances, are catered for within Australian society. In my mind, families are a fundamental national resource-the life blood and future of our great nation. It was interesting to note that, at the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship meeting this morning, we were challenged in some of the thoughts that are behind that simple statement. In my lifetime, there have been huge changes to the structure, nature and operation of families, and the lines of responsibility have become extremely blurred. I guess I was lucky to have been raised in a typical family of the 1950s and 1960s. Dad was the sole breadwinner, mum raised the four children and there was a clear delineation on what constituted the role of parents and the extended family. The extended family all lived in close proximity to one another. The roles of school, the church and the local, state and federal governments were clearly delineated in that time. These days, families may be a range or mixture of adults and children, old and young, sometimes with one parent or, in some cases, where one relationship has broken down and another started, there may be three or more parents responsible for children. A family can now",124,Notices Veterans Entitlements Act Instruments 1995 Nos

487,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.00 A.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the JusticeMC 880 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 be a complex mix of relationships. Even if children are raised in the same style that I was raised, they are also very much aware of the different types of families that interact with them. This federal government believes that all families need to be supported and strengthened and this is one of the key issues in this Justice Statement. This statement is all about treating families fairly, whatever their set-up. Through this Justice Statement, we have set aside $160 million to try to achieve that end. The complex nature of families is recognised, and the government has responded by providing more places in relationship courses to make sure those courses are particularly related to Australian couples. I know that, in Tasmania, Relationships Australia-which was previously named the Marriage Guidance Council-has an excellent reputation and record, and the demand for that service is continually growing. This should be seen as a real positive within our community: that couples and families are recognising the complexities and pressures within and around them and that they want to deal with them in a positive manner. It is that need and that desire by Australians to be constructive about their relationships and their day-to-day lives which this government is responding to. Family support has been an invaluable service to the communities that I represent in my electorate. I am lucky to have seven or eight of these family support services, in Gagebrook, Geeveston, Warrane, Clarendon Vale, Risdon Vale, Rokeby and the Maranoa Heights in Kingston. Particularly in these broadacre public housing areas, family support in conjunction with the neighbourhood house programs has provided not only personal support to families, but respite when it is needed for those parents who simply need a break away from the family structure. The family support workers have been called upon in difficult situations involving couples and their relationships with children, requiring visits to homes, arranging for additional assistance through other agencies and providing families with the security of knowing that the family support workers are there when they need them. The federal government, through the Justice Statement, will provide greater access to such family support programs throughout the nation. Financial counselling is another existing service in our community that will benefit from the Justice Statement. In my electorate of Franklin, Anglicare has provided a superb service to assist families going through financial difficulties by providing advice on how to better manage their household income and how to structure their whole financial set-up. Before financial counselling came into operation there was an incredibly high number of people who simply saw bankruptcy as the only solution to their financial problems. To me, that is a real concern. In my five years as an electorate officer there were numerous times when I met with families and talked them out of choosing bankruptcy. Financial counselling will be expanded through the Justice Statement and I am well aware of the positive benefits that service will bring to families right across our nation and, more especially, in my electorate of Franklin through the services of Anglicare. Resolving disputes for families is certainly an area for which this federal government believes it should have some responsibility. This government is prepared to intervene and provide assistance in this area of mediation, both within the family and in the neighbourhood context. This is a really positive way of making the community more understanding and coherent. It is also a way of keeping people out of the court system. Too often in my electorate Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 881 cases appear before a court which could be sorted out through mediation and negotiation. What a waste of time and money some cases have been when they finally come to court. The Justice Statement provides for more adolescent, mediation and family therapy centres. It boosts funding by 50 per cent for family skills training services to assist an additional 12,000 families. To my mind, this is money very well spent. It is about the government being prepared to recognise and tackle those problems that require assistance in our community in a very constructive and positive way. This is an area we will not tum our backs on and leave to the law of the jungle. I am fortunate that in my electorate there are some existing agencies controlled and operated by women for women and that the benefits they are providing to the women are incredibly important to the fabric of our society. I would like to mention the Women's Room, operating in the broadacre public housing areas of Bridgewater and Gagebrook. This is a group of local women who initially began without any funding because they recognised that women in their community required extra assistance and special assistance that could be provided only by women who lived in the area and who knew the local conditions. The national women's justice strategy will be a boon to groups like the Women's Room. The strategy recognises that women have particular needs in relation to justice and access. Existing agencies like the Women's Room, or new groups like the one operating from the Geeveston Neighbourhood House in the southern part of my electorate-which has been funded to provide assistance to women in rural and remote areas who, together with their children, are victims of domestic violence-will be able to utilise the national women's justice strategy. They will do this by taking their clients through new mediation programs and by seeking advice from women lawyers who are specialists in areas specific to the needs of women. Those specific needs will be addressed by the statement through pilot programs being established to explore new ways of dealing with violence ill families, to train family support staff to help women leaving violent relationships, to develop legal education pamphlets and programs to inform and assist women in rural and remote areas, and to support family legislative measures to ensure the Family Court takes full account of family violence when making child access arrangements. Following on from that, one very important measure that I can see real benefits in for women and families generally is the new hand-over centres for the safe transfer of children between separated parents if there is a family history of either violence or abuse. My office has been contacted by women in the past who have been incredibly anxious about custody arrangements with their previous partners but, through Family Law court decisions, they have had no choice at all but to be confronted by the father of the child at the doorstep of the home in which they live. For too many women, this has been a terrifying experience. The new handover centres will provide a safe buffer between parents who no longer have a good relationship, and thus provide security and safety for the women and children, and maintain access for the children to their fathers. The last issue I want to mention is legal aid, a rather contentious and thorny issue. In the Justice Statement, legal aid receives a real boost and community centres will also be great benefactors of the Justice Statement. I am lucky in the fact that I have a community legal centre based alongside my office. In some ways it is a boon and in some ways it is not. It is a boon in the fact that, rather than me and my staff dealing with a whole lot of legal issues, MC 882 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 we can now refer them to the Derwent Community Legal Centre. But, apart from just referring them to this one-stop shop for legal advice, it is very important that the legal centre be part of this whole community structure so that we do not just fragment things off. There is a sort of cohesion throughout this statement. The community legal centre provides counselling and it has an educative role in helping people to understand a whole lot of legal issues. It is not just there as the last resort where you go to have things sorted out on a legal basis. The Derwent centre was set up principally because all the lawyers in Hobart are in the CBD and are far removed from the problems of ordinary people. They are not close by when people need them and that situation had to be rectified. I think the community legal centres, in my state, have tackled this problem of access to the legal system. I know for a fact that, by strengthening these community legal centres, we will strengthen the whole process of people's understanding of the law, their access to it and issues of equity. I commend the federal government for the $160 million provided through the Justice Statement. The initiatives, if implemented properly in consultation with all areas of Australia and through all the different agencies that have been mentioned in the statement, will enable people to better understand the process. They will keep a lot of people out of the process, empower people who are currently disempowered and provide a structure which will support and strengthen families. I commend the paper to the House. I bring to the attention of the House an issue which will test the government's commitment to its stated objectives of reducing major crime, fraud and corruption. I refer to two letters that go to the heart of the crime concerns with which the government claims to be concerned. I refer to the provision of passports to an international drug trafficker, a notorious banker, and the involvement of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the curious role of Melbourne based taxation lawyer, Mark Leibler. Mr Leibler has a well-documented history of expertise in the devising of offshore tax havens, although he has modestly disclaimed interest in such activities in recent years. In his seminal 1976 paper entitled Practical applications for the use of tax havens delivered to a public accounting seminar in Melbourne, on page 41 Mr Leibler advises that: Generally speaking, Hong Kong is an ideal location for a tax haven based company because of the very substantial genuine commercial links and trading activities between Australia and Hong Kong. He further adds in that paper that: The importance of the initial choice as to the location of the tax haven corporation cannot be overemphasised. Indeed! The first letter which I refer to the Main Committee in this House today is dated 2 October 1990, under the signature of P. Zoller, Counsellor (Political), Australian High Commission, London. The DFAT directory of March 1990 confirms Mr Peter Zoller's status at the Australian High Commission. The letter is addressed to the Second Secretary, Embassy of the Republic of Suriname, The Hague, Netherlands, and is stamped 'Ontvangen', which is Dutch for 'received'.

I think that it would assist me if the honourable member could link his remarks to the matters that are before the committee. government's commitment to dealing with organised crime. I intend to show that there have, in fact, been most remiss actions on the part of the Commonwealth in tackling those very matters. I also refer to a second letter of early 1992 addressed to 'Mark Leibner' -presumably Leibler-at an Australian location code and signed by D. Toemin, Second Secretary at the Suriname Embassy in the Netherlands. The subject is profit distribution. The first paragraph of the letter refers to the provision of four receipts under separate cover for the sum of $A1,784,OOO cash, banked at the Z 328 bank, which is understood to be the International Bank of Luxembourg. Luxembourg is renowned as an offshore centre which accepts bank secrecy rules and has a mosaic of fiscal advantages, including holding companies, offshore banking systems, tax havens and shell companies. The second paragraph refers to an alleged agreement between Michael Costello and Senator Richardson to hand passports for, as the letter states: ... Bouterse and Goedschalk personally to one of the two authorised Mossad officers. That is as agreed 'in the Marshall Islands'. The third paragraph refers to dates and places 'at which foreign aid discussions will commence between Hawke and Bouterse'. something like 13 years, I think I have a reputation for allowing a full and free debate where that is appropriate.

Having been in this place forMC 884 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 it would be a travesty of the parliamentary process but, in any event, if the honourable member for Deakin wishes to pursue these matters, the other chamber is the most appropriate place to do so. I have a second point, Mr Deputy Speaker. The difficulty I have is that I have just walked into this chamber and I am not sure whether points of order have been taken. I am not sure whether you have had the opportunity of providing guidance but at the very least I think the issues that the honourable member is raising are clearly such that individuals could suffer very greatly. Unless he has something more than the material that has been canvassed in the past then it would verge on an improper use of this chamber for those matters to be pursued. I seek your guidance and your ruling specifically in the context of ruling whether issues such as this are properly issues to be raised in the context of those matters before this Main Committee. to ensure that items sent to this committee are of a non-controversial nature. As I have said previously, that does not prevent members from injecting a degree of controversy into the debate as long as that is done within the spirit of this chamber. On that matter I am not as concerned, but I am concerned-as I indicated to the honourable member for Deakin---on the matter of relevance. I think that I have been very generous. The member for Deakin undertook to relate the matters that he is raising in a direct fashion to the Justice Statement and other papers that are subject to the motion. I ask that he come to that direct reference because I am having great difficulty at the moment in seeing the relevance. that sooner rather than later. Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) is on record yesterday as being interested in that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The letter, which is on the letterhead of the Embassy of the Republic of Suriname and is similar to previous correspondence that I have dealt with, is addressed to 'MARK LEIBNER esq. NRCL-6223-3647-AB AUSTRALIA', and is headed 'Profit Distribution.' Ms CrawfordMr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order on the issue of relevance given your two previous rulings in requesting the member for Deakin to show how his statement to date relates to the Justice Statement which is in discussion before this committee. I draw your attention to that on the point of relevance. that because what is now happening goes to the first matter raised in the point of order taken by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, that it is testing the spirit of the way in which matters have been dealt with in the Committee.

519,Mr Gibson (Moreton) (10.47 A.m.),"I will be very pleased to contribute some commentsWednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 887 Statement will contribute significantly to improving that access. I do not believe the statement has gone as far as some of us would like to see it go. Further work needs to be done and further financial support provided through a range of measures, but I do believe the statement provided a very solid foundation, which we should applaud. The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) in May announced a four-year $160 million strategy to reform Australia's justice system. The Justice Statement is what I would term a classic Labor government policy, in that it reforms key legal institutions to respond to their primary purpose of delivering justice to all people on an equal basis, regardless of who they are, where they live and how well off they happen to be. These reforms are centred upon the restructuring of the court system, the legal profession itself and legal assistance measures. The Justice Statement is an unambiguous Labor government measure. It is a clear statement of policy about where we should be going as a society and about ensuring that our justice system is accessible to all Australians. It contrasts considerably with both the opposition's performance in the past and the fact that, at the moment, there is no policy from the opposition to indicate where they would in fact go in providing an improved justice system for all Australians. The Justice Statement resulted from the initiative by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee in October 1993. This committee found a widespread lack of faith in the justice system from a wide cross-section of Australians. The motivating factor behind the Justice Statement has been to initiate measures to restore confidence in the justice system and have it better serve the interests of all Australians. Several groups within the Australian community are clear-cut winners from the Justice Statement. They include families, who benefit through a range of community based initiatives to assist them to overcome their legal problems. Others benefiting include a vast majority of Australians who do not qualify for legal aid yet are not wealthy enough to afford litigation. In this category, the Justice Statement will witness significantly improved access for women, for Aboriginal Australians and for family law litigants. The government's approach reflects commitment, firstly, to resolving and preventing disputes by simple and accessible means; secondly, to reforming key legal institutions to achieve greater efficiency and consumer focus; and, thirdly, to ensuring access and equity across the legal system. I will begin with the question of resolving and preventing conflict. The Justice Statement provides much needed resources to organisations such as Relationships Australia, doubling funding for marriage and relationship education by an additional $4 million over four years. This is a very significant improvement and reflects the valuable work that Relationships Australia, formerly known as the Marriage Guidance Council, performs in our community. I believe that there is an important role to be played in these organisations in assisting couples and families to resolve their conflicts without recourse to separation and divorce. Separation and divorce have a very destabilising and very damaging impact on families, particularly on the children of those families. It is crucial that governments, both state and federal, become more directly involved in assisting families to stay together for the benefit not only of couples, but of their children. Secondly, by the allocation of an extra $5.7 million over four years, the Justice Statement extends family support programs-including relationship skills training, adolescent mediation and family therapy-into rural and regional Australia. This is another area that I am MC 888 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 particularly concerned about. I would like to see significantly more money allocated, not just for serving rural and regional Australia, but also to serve metropolitan and provincial city Australians. It is of great concern to me that this community spends a lot of money dealing with the end results of family breakdowns, such as homelessness amongst youth, drug and alcohol addiction and petty crime and vandalism. I believe that these all result from a complete breakdown in the family unit, a breakdown in communication, a lack of understanding between the parents and the children about what each other's needs are, and a general lack of direction in our society. We need to be spending a lot more money in providing counselling and support and advice to young people and to the parents of those young people before homelessness occurs, before they resort to drugs and alcohol to try and hide their problems. We need to be supporting family counselling to a much greater degree. AlthoughI welcome the amount that is allocated here, we need a larger program to assist that. For five years, I have been seeking-without success-the setting up of a youth drop-in centre and referral service in my electorate. There is not a lot of homelessness in my electorate, but I believe that many of the homeless people who wander around cities and some of the suburban areas come from communities like mine. WhatI wish to do is to provide them with a service where they can get some counselling, some advice and support, before they leap over the cliff and leave home, or participate in unsociable behaviour, such as drug and alcohol addiction. It has been a real struggle. Although everybody says that it is a great idea to have a referral service and a drop-in centre and some counselling support for people in their local communities, there is no line item in anybody's budget that will enable it to be funded and provided. This program within the Attorney-General's Department is an important program, but it needs to be complemented with additional services from Human Services and Health and from state community services or family services departments. I would encourage all of those government departments to get together to put forward such a program. The Access to justice statement also accelerates the movement in the Family Court towards mediation and counselling, by the allocation of an extra $4.3 million for mediation services and $9.7 million over four years for counselling. Every member in this place has, from time to time, had to deal with constituents who have suffered a family breakdown and who are angry about decisions that have occurred in the Family Court. They are angry about Child Support Agency matters; they feel they have not received justice. A lot of emotion, a lot of anger and hatred, is generated. We, as members of parliament, have to try and cope with that. If we could have a Family Court process that placed more emphasis on counselling and mediation, on trying to bring couples together to find fair and reasonable resolutions to these matters-without those couples having to go through the litigation and court processes, the struggles for division of property, the struggles for funding and the struggles over access to children-we would have happier people out there. There would be far less call on government resources for the Family Court, and fewer of the tragedies that occur in our community as a result of family breakdown. The Justice Statement also commits $16.8 million over four years to increase the number of community based mediators specialising in family mediation. It provides $2.3 million for Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 889 a family violence program, as well as instigating greater coordination between Family Court and domestic violence orders. All of these initiatives are very valuable and very important. The statement allocates $5.3 million over four years to a pilot program of safe hand-over centres for children, staffed by legal workers trained in dealing with family violence. It strengthens consumer protection in the Trade Practices Act with increased penalties. This has been a common area of complaint for those affected by poor legal representation. It creates a national network of specialist women's legal centres-one in each stall.. and territory-v> lLh $12.3 million over four years. Further, it establishes a safer Australia program to identify crime problem areas and develop strategies to reduce crime. This initiative is responding to growing community expectations for solutions to be found to combat fears of crime in our community. In the area of removing barriers to justice, the Justice Statement allocates $16.8 million over four years to legal aid commissions which improve their accountability standards and agree to spend the bulk of the new financial resources on family and civil cases, with an additional $6.9 million over four years for commissions to expand their legal aid services. This is absolutely vital. There is a huge backlog of demand for legal aid services. The funding, prior to this statement, nowhere near addressed the need in our community. As I said at the beginning of my comments, it is no good having a fair justice system if it is too expensive for the majority of Australians to acceS's. For justice to be served, people need to have immediate access to those services and they cannot get access to them with the incredibly expensive legal processes that we have in our country at the moment. Therefore, additional funding for legal aid is very important. Further, the Justice Statement creates nine new community legal centres with $13.9 million over four years, plus additional funding for the environmental defenders network, specialist services for children and youth, and a national human rights and discrimination law centre. It commits to removing virtually all advertising restrictions on lawyers operating in federal jurisdictions, enforcing greater competition in the legal marketplace and, ultimately, benefiting the consumer and client. This is also a very important reform that has been put in place, because I believe we do need to have an opening up of the legal profession. I am not a lawyer, but I do find the regulations and the way in which the industry operates to be very restrictive. It is important that we open it up and make lawyers have to face some of the same competitive pressures that others in our society have to face. In restoring confidence in the administration of justice, the statement allocates $2.7 million over four years to gender and cultural awareness programs for judges and court staff. This is a timely reform in respect of recent statements which have been made by a very small minority of the judiciary but which have impacted on people's attitudes towards the justice system. Some of these statements by, as I have said, a small minority of the judiciary have displayed a lack of knowledge of views and the trends of policy in our community. They have been out of step, unfortunately, with community expectations and I think this training program will be very important. The Justice Statement also provides $700,000 for a two-year program to develop charters of access and service in Commonwealth courts and tribunals, and it boosts the training of specialist Aboriginal language interpreters for the courts with $1.4 million over four years. As the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I particularly welcome this new initiative. It has been something that my committee has argued for for a long time. We are pleased to see there is going to be MC 890 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 recognition in our court system that there are tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in this country who have English as their third or fourth language, that they are not natural English speakers, and that they do need access to interpreting services for them to have fair access to justice. In conclusion, the programs outlined in the Justice Statement have been specifically targeted for the majority of Australians to enable them to have much better access and representation in the Australian legal system. It is not simply a matter of throwing money at the problem. In fact, some early criticism of the Justice Statement following its release centred upon the absence of greater financial resources to achieve a balancing of the justice scales. It is an important new reform. I welcome the Justice Statement and commend the government for it. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned. ILO CONVENTIONS IN AUSTRALIA Report Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. in Australia-f994, the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton) says that the report: ... aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard-setting activities and the role that international labour standards play protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia. It reviews Australia's position in relation to each ILO Convention as at December 1994. What the honourable minister fails to refer to is that this parliament has no real role at all in relation to ILO conventions. This parliament is not consulted when conventions are signed or ratified. This parliament does not scrutinise them except by means of an ex post facto debate like this one. Australia is a founding member of the ILO. The general conference of the ILO, normally referred to as the International Labor Conference or the ILC, has as one of its principal functions the adoption of formal instruments establishing international labour standards. These instruments take the form of either conventions or recommendations. They deal with a broad range of employment-related matters. Once adopted by the conference, conventions and recommendations become open to ratification by member states. There is no obligation on any state to ratify a convention and unratified conventions do not create any obligation in international law. Ratification is a sovereign act by the member state concerned. However, once ratified, conventions do create binding international obligations for the member state concerned. From its establishment in 1919, down to 30 November 1994, the ILC had adopted 357 standard-setting instruments: 175 were conventions, and the remaining 182 were non-binding recommendations. As at 31 August 1994, Australia had ratified 54 of the conventions. When a member state ratifies a convention, it becomes obliged to maintain its domestic law and practice in conformity with that convention. However, in Australia, no ratified convention will have any substantive legal effect in either state or federal law, unless expressly given such effect by the federal or relevant state parliament.",132,Representatives Main Committee
520,Mr Williams (Tangney) (11.02 A.m. ),"In the foreword to the Status of fLO conventionsWednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 891 The constitution of the ILO recognises that federal member states such as Australia have a division of legislative responsibility between the federal parliament and the constituent states. The ILO constitution provides that, where the subject matter of a convention falls wholly or in part within the area of competence of the constituent states, then the Commonwealth government must refer the convention to the state and territory parliaments for them to enact legislation or take other action. The 'other action' referred to contemplates, among actions, that the state parliament may refuse to ratify the convention. Most ILO conventions come into force in international law 12 months after they receive their second ratification-that is, a second ratification by a member state-but a convention in force internationally will not become binding on Australia until 12 months after the date upon which Australia ratifies the convention in question. Once ratified, the convention will bind Australia unless or until it is denounced. The Commonwealth consults regularly with the states on ILO matters, at departmental officer level. ILO matters are regularly included on the agenda of periodic meetings between state and federal labour relations ministers. These arrangements generally proceed on two bases. The first is that a convention will be ratified only when law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions is adjudged to be in compliance with the convention concerned. The second is that all state and territory governments must have formally agreed to ratification. The second condition does not apply to those conventions whose subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government alone, although in practice the Commonwealth government is still likely to seek approval from the states even though approval is not required. This consultation process is quite unusual in the context of the Commonwealth government's relations with the states and territories in the broader treaty making process. Only two of the 54 conventions ratified by Australia as at 31 August 1994 have been ratified by the Commonwealth government without the agreement of all the states and territories. The first was the Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention 1981, No. 156, which was ratified in March 1990. The second was on 26 February 1993, a date after the last federal election had been called. In fear of losing the federal election and in order to defeat the Kennett government's industrial relations legislation in Victoria, the Commonwealth government ratified the Termination of Employment Convention 1982, No. 158, without the formal agreement of any state or territory. Ratification of this convention was also unusual in that law and practice in no jurisdiction, including the Commonwealth, was in compliance with the convention at the time of ratification. While there appears to be an established practice of Commonwealth consultation with the states-with some notable exceptions, which I have mentioned-prior to ratification of ILO conventions, this is not the case with other international treaties. The power to enter into treaties is vested without qualification in the executive arm of government, meaning, in effect, ultimately the cabinet. The executive has no formal obligation to consult the Commonwealth parliament in relation to any treaty, whether an ILO convention or any other form of international agreement, to which the executive proposes to commit Australia. Nor does the executive have any formal obligation to consult state or territory governments or any person likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed treaty. One might have thought that the executive would jealously guard its right to enter into and ratify treaties on behalf of Australia, in the light of the failure to consult the parliament in any MC 892 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 way. But the executive has not jealously protected the right of cabinet to approve treaties for signature or for ratification. It has recently been revealed that, since 1990, only 49 agreements or treaties have received cabinet approval for final consent, while 186 were approved only by relevant ministers or by departments acting in accordance with what were believed to be policy established by ministers or by cabinet. Fewer than a quarter of treaties entered into since 1954 have been formally approved by cabinet. The coalition has proposed a raft of reforms of the treaty making process. The reforms include involving the state and territory governments and interest groups in consultation. This, it is pleasing to note, is something that already occurs in relation to ILO conventions, with very few exceptions. The coalition proposals provide expressly for the involvement of parliament in order to achieve wider consultation and to make the executive more accountable. It is appropriate that consideration should be given to the possibility of parliamentary ratification or a procedure for parliamentary disallowance of treaties. The practice of the executive in dealing with parliament in relation to treaties has not, over the years, been uniform. Where a treaty would have significant impact on domestic circumstances it was once the practice of the Commonwealth government to seek the approval of parliament before ratifying the treaty. Between 1919 and 1963 there were at least 55 cases in which parliamentary approval was expressly sought. This procedure has fallen into disuse. In 1961, Prime Minister Menzies promised to table treaties in parliament at least 12 sitting days before the government finally committed itself to a treaty by ratifying it or acceding to it. This appears to be a modification of the British government's so-called Ponsonby rule. The Ponsonby approach is of limited practical value in that the government is not bound to find parliamentary time for debate of a motion deploring the intention of the executive to ratify a treaty. Any such motion would, of course, be private members business and would have to fight its way through the selection committee process. In one recent instance at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, the Keating government ratified a convention despite a motion having been moved in this House, but not debated, seeking the imposition of reservations on the ratification. Unless moved in the House by or on behalf of a minister, a motion or bill relating to a treaty will, as I have indicated, only be dealt with as private members business, of which only a fraction ever reaches the Notice Paper. Although the Menzies approach has never been revoked formally, it has not been honoured. In recent years, the practice of the government has been to table treaties in bulk every six months regardless of whether the tabling is before or after ratification. A high proportion of the treaties have already been ratified or acceded to and some have even come into force before they are tabled. In relation to ILO conventions, however, a different practice has been followed. Sometimes the conventions are included among the bulk tabling collections. At other times, however, they are tabled independently on the return of a delegation to an ILO conference where the convention has been dealt with. Sir Rupert Hamer, a former premier of Victoria, and Professor Leslie Zines, the eminent constitutional lawyer, both members of the 1988 Constitutional Commission, consideredalthough in the minority on this point-that there should be a statutory requirement that ratification of treaties by Australia should be conditional on either the approval of both houses of parliament or the non-disallowance by either house within a specified period. Their reasoning was that, having regard to the international and domestic consequences of Australia Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 893 entering into treaties, the accountability of the government to the parliament in the area should be strengthened. Other interested bodies have agreed. In a statement issued in January 1994, the Australian Mining Industry Council and seven other peak industry bodies proposed major reforms to treaty making processes that would give a significant role to the parliament. Firstly, the bodies recommended tabling of treaties with explanatory material well before signature. Secondly, they proposed the referral of treaties 'with perceived national or contentious impacts' to the relevant parliamentary committee for public inquiry and report. Thirdly, they said that implementing legislation ought not be put to parliamentary vote until the parliament had had sufficient opportunity to consider whether becoming a party to the treaty would be in the national interest. The Western Australian Constitutional Committee in its January 1995 report reviewed, among other things, the treaty making process. The committee saw amendment of the external affairs power in the constitution as its first preference for reform of the process. Failing that, the committee recommended that all treaties be tabled in the Commonwealth parliament and that Commonwealth legislation make ratification conditional on non-disallowance by either house within a specified period from the time of tabling. The key to the effectiveness of the coalition proposal for tabling treaties prior to ratification is to ensure that parliamentary time is allocated for debate of the treaties. The probability is that there would be little or no interest among members or senators in debating all but a handful of the treaties, and this would be true of ILO conventions as well. In addition, a high proportion of those for which debating time is likely to be sought would have bipartisan support. The best way of ensuring that parliamentary debating time is allocated is to provide for a system of parliamentary approval or disallowance. In view of the large number of treaties likely to be uncontentious, a disallowance system is clearly the more practical. Such a system would certainly improve consultation by the executive with interest groups, it would make consideration of the national interest more meaningful and, importantly, it would provide an effective means of making the executive more accountable. I look forward to the tabling of next year's Status of [LO conventions in Australia. Perhaps that report, in contrast to the one before us today, will be able to inform members and senators of an increased role of the parliament in the decision to ratify further ILO conventions. It is to be hoped that next year's report will evidence greater consultation with the parliament and greater consultation with the states. It is my belief that the resulting increase in the accountability of the executive will be a characteristic of, and one of the most significant improvements made by, the new Howard government. to participate in this consideration of the report Status of [LO conventions in Australia. The first edition of this report was in 1969. Advantage was taken of that particular year because it represented the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the ILO, which, of course, was one of those international arrangements established at the time of the old League of Nations following the First World War. When the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, the ILO was one of those, again international, arrangements which continued. I was interested to hear the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams), who always makes a considered contribution to questions of this kind. In a sense, there is some degree of departure between his position and my position. I appreciate",136,Representatives Main Committee
521,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (11.16 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am also pleasedMC 894 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 his background in law and the thinking that he brings, particularly to the legal processes and the procedures involved. Of course, that is important to the government, but to people like myself there is another dimension. I am not suggesting for a moment that this is ignored by the member for Tangney or his colleagues. This other dimension is just as important as any legal consideration, and that is the whole background to this question of International Labour Organisation conventions and recommendations which are the two primary mechanisms in the ILO's approach to appropriate working conditions. And, of course, there is a need today for national governments such as ours and particularly for governments in other countries which do not honour the need for an enlightened, humane and civilised approach to the conditions under which men and women work to address such issues. By way of example, I mention ILO convention No.5, which was adopted by the ILO in 1919. It refers to the minimum age for employment in industry. We also have convention No. 123 adopted in 1965 by the ILO. This refers to the minimum age for underground work. That one was not ratified by Australia until 1971. Of the 175 conventions of the ILO, only 54 have been ratified by Australia. I am drawing particular attention to the question of minimum age in industry and in underground work for a special reason. I want to refer to a particular example. A great mate of mine, a fellow by the name of Gwillym Williams, came out to Australia as a baby with his parents from the coalfields of southern Wales where my maternal antecedents also originated. Gwillym Williams was born in southern Wales. His father was blackballed in the coal mines there and for that reason he sought to escape those circumstances by bringing his wife and his kids here. Gwillym was a little kid when he arrived. Gwillym Williams left school at the age of 13, which was the leaving age at that time, and went straight into the coal mine at Bellbird. He became the youngest lodge officer ever to hold office in the Bellbird miners' lodge. In 1923, at the time of the Bellbird disaster, when coalminers were killed-those coalminers still lie in the sealed-off sections of that mineGwillym Williams was one who survived, as a young fellow. He died a few years ago. He said to me, on at least one occasion, that he recalled that when he was a little boy going to school-before he reached the leaving age of 13 and went directly into the coal mines-he would sometimes say to his father, 'Dad, will you help me with my homework?' His father would say to him, 'Gwillym, you go and do the work yourself. IfI help you, it won't be of any lasting value to you. You just work at it.' Then Gwillym would say, 'Dad, the other kids in my class say their fathers help them with their homework. Why don't you help me with mine?' He would say, 'BecauseI think you should work at it yourself, Gwillym.' Gwillym said that light gradually dawned on him. He said to his father one day, 'Dad, I know why you don't help me with my homework.' His father said, 'Why is that, Gwillym?' He said, 'Because you can't.' His father said, 'What do you mean?' Gwillym said, 'You can't read or write.' His father said, 'Gwillym, you're right. I can't read or write.' Gwillym said, 'Why can't you, dad?' Gwillym's father said, 'Son, I can't read or write because I never went to school. I went with my father into the coal mines when I was seven years of age. We would go down the mine in the morning before the sun came up, and we would come out of the mine in the evening after the sun had gone down. I never saw sunlight, except on Sunday. SoI didn't go to school and I can't help you with your homework.' Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 895 That fellow conveyed that message to me. It was within his experience. The point I wish to make is that we know that there are other young kids-working at looms, working in the fields, working in factories and, still, working in mines-in different parts of the world who also need to be protected. I also refer to questions of compensation for industrial accidents and industrial diseases. My maternal grandfather died when my mother was four years of age. He died of diseases that he contracted as a coal miner in Pelaw Main on the northern coalfields. He left a widow with seven children. There were no widows pensions then. There was no compensation for death by industrial diseases then. My mother's brother died the year I was born, at the age of 31, as a result of industrial diseases. He left a widow with two daughters. There were no widows pensions then. There was no family support. They survived as best they could. So there are legal processes and procedures about which we are concerned and which involve us. There are also fundamental questions behind the whole area of appropriate working conditions for men and women. Those 175 conventions by the ILO establish a very civilised and very responsible background for a determination of appropriate working conditions. Some of the particular elements of the ILO general approach are reflected in the preamble to its constitution. I want to read part of that preamble, because I find it a laudable and civilised statement about issues about which I feel very strongly. The preamble to the constitution of the organisation concerns its principles and methods. They include: ... ""the regulation of hours of work including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employmentI note that it says 'his employment'the protection of children, young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition of tile principles of equal remuneration for work of equal value, recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organisation of vocational and technical education and other measures."" This statement of principle should be read in conjunction with the Declaration of Philadelphia which was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1944. Amongst other things, the Declaration: ""reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based and, in particular, that(a) labour is not a commodity; (b) freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustain progress; (c) poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere; (d) the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of governments join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare."" I go back to principle (a): labour is not a commodity. They are dead right. Labour is not a commodity. No longer do we live in a country which refers to master and servant. Labour is not a commodity and labour should never be treated as a commodity. Production now is a social process. Yes, it does depend upon people who invest. Yes, it does depend upon boards of directors. Yes, it does depend upon managers, and yes, it does depend upon those people who still work on the factory floor, but labour is not a commodity. MC 896 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 One of the problems-and I say this recognising that private property and the institution of private enterprise are fundamental, I suppose, to the system in which we live-is that the chief motivation of all of those processes continues to be profit. People invest for profit; managers manage for profit. Directors have a responsibility to the shareholders to enlarge profit. Labour is employed to create wealth and to create profits. At any given level of production the fact remains that the higher the level of wages, the lower the volume of profit. The more that is spent on certain forms of industrial safety, the lower is the profit. For that reason, the labour movement continues to maintain its vigilance and the objectives that the labour movement set hundreds of years ago. This Australian Labor Party continues to pursue objectives that we were formed to pursue over 100 years ago. We developed the belief over 200 years ago that the market itself would never be adequate to satisfy all of the social concerns about the conditions under which people live and work and, having resolved that, the labour movement established political organisations, political movements, liberal democratic parties, socialist parties and finally won government. I remind all honourable members that the first time in the history of the world that a labour party formed a government was in Queensland. It was the result of a coalition; it was not elected to government. That was not to come about until the Fisher government was elected. That first workers' government in the history of the world in Queensland lasted for six days but the breakthrough was made. We continue to pursue those great objectives. That is the reason for our existence. It was the reason for our birth. It is the reason for our continuity. I want to see more of these ILO conventions ratified in Australia. I know that the process is not complete until, first of all, it is identified that all of the states comply with that particular convention. It is also not complete until we are satisfied that that convention is an important one for Australia to pursue. It is not ratified until it complies, as well, with Commonwealth regulations. Because we have ratified only 54 of 175 conventions, does that mean that many of those conventions do not have complying legislation in the states? They are critical questions. I applaud the production of this new edition and I look forward to the continued improvement in this whole area of industrial relations and working conditions, internationally and nationally. and industrial conditions around the world cannot deny that, without an organisation of the ilk of the ILO, it would be difficult to know how you were going to advance conditions of people, wherever they might be, in whatever country. It has long been my concern, however, that, like many international fora, I am afraid that the ILO, if you look at its membership, has a few countries whose adherence to what we would all see as reasonable standards of behaviour is a little suspect. I was interested in looking through the membership to see that countries like Zaire, Iran and Iraq are members. While I know that within the Australian workplace there are a good many who are concerned about conditions, fortunately nobody in our society is as badly affected as some in those societies. So my first concern is that there has to be a forum by which conditions can be addressed internationally. I am one of those who has long been cynical about the value of the United Nations. YetI guess much the same could be said of it as of the ILO: that, for all its weaknesses, there is no better way by which you could at least promote an alternative to violent conflict in the resolution of differences between states. I believe that the ILO is a very",139,Representatives Main Committee

They are, again, countries where I have quite real concerns about the conditions of those in the work force. The People's Republic of China is one, for example. I looked up some of the particular ILO conventions to which they are not parties and which they have not ratified-things like guarding of machinery, or hygiene in commerce and offices. They are basics, they are fundamental to human safety and health. Yet, unfortunately, it is not just China-I am just picking China out-because I notice that the Philippines has not adhered to them either and, indeed, Singapore has not. So there are many countries which have a long way to go. lt is because of the importance, therefore, of these ILO conventions that I am disappointed that we are talking about this in the Main Committee. Indeed, I have a strong objection to the Main Committee meeting while matters of substance are going on in the House. I really do not believe that, under the last few changes made to our standing orders, the procedures of parliament are given the weight they should be. I find it quite incredible that a member of the other place is under a censure motion at the moment and we are all up here. We are debating something here which is terribly important, but I think it is quite inappropriate that the Main Committee should be deliberating on something that is very important and yet down in the other place something is being done which really involves us all. SoI object strongly to the fact that the Main Committee debate is taking place at this time, particularly because it involves something that is of fundamental importance in the well-being of the Australian work force and, indeed, of workers everywhere in the world. The status of ILO conventions is well described by the minister. In the foreword to the report, he comments: The Status of [LO Conventions in Australia 1994 aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard-setting activities and the role that intemationallabour standards play protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia. And, as he continues: It reviews Australia's position in relation to each ILO Convention as at December 1994. I want to come back to some of the remarks which my colleague the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams) made on the report, but it is important that we do have benchmark standards by which progress in the workplace can be achieved. I really do not see them quite as the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) presents them. My worry is this: I do not see this as a conflict between worker and employer in the true sense of IR of the past. I believe that it is now far more a matter of trying to make sure that there are minimal standards addressed throughout the country. As the honourable member for Tangney identified, in our nation the plague of separate states and separate regimes continues to exist, and one of the reasons that many of these conventions are not in place is because of the differences that lie between states. There are too many areas where uniformity is too arbitrarily applied but, equally, the reverse also applies so that, while there are some areas where I believe that uniformity is most desirable, I do not believe that you can arbitrarily lay down one standard to apply to everybody. But, in this field of work MC 898 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 conditions, I think you should. There are far more areas where it would be better to have the same standard applying throughout the country than there are areas where it would be better to preserve the right to differ. But it is because of the consequence of ratification that it is particularly important that we note the way by which the ratification procedure takes place. There is, of course, consultation and there is a federal-state ministerial conference, and the practice has been that not only is there a report of these ILO conventions to that federal-state ministerial conference but also there is a ratification process within that conference, which I think is most desirable. I was glad that the honourable member for Tangney took that to the next step of looking at the general application of international conventions. I would like to do much the same and, indeed, I endorse the concern that he has that, for members of parliament-and for the Australian public as a result-in most instances we know nothing of what has been agreed by the Australian government until such stage as a report of this character is tabled in the parliament. I do not see that as being good enough. I was one of those, at that 1988 convention to which the honourable member for Tangney referred, who did not support the minority report that was presented on behalf of Sir Rupert Hamer and Professor Leslie Zines-although I think that that was actually in the constitutional commission; it was not a convention. But I have always had reservations about the best formula by which, on the one hand, you can determine the extent to which there needs to be power in the executive-and, hence, its participation in international conventions-and, on the other hand, you can ensure that there is public understanding and public endorsement of those conventions; and not just ILO conventions, but the whole spectrum of international agreements. The more that Australia follows those agreements and those agreements or their implications are passed into federal law, there is obviously an implication which requires the executive to report to the wider community. The honourable member for Tangney, in his presentation, talked about the absolute necessity in this ILO field, as in other international areas of negotiation, for the reporting procedure to be put in place and for there to be a ratification. As one of the members of the Menzies ministry, I certainly supported the 'Ponsonby rule', as they called it, which required at least the tabling in the parliament of the international agreement before it was ratified. At the least, that process should be followed by the present federal government. I know it has long since fallen into disuse. One of the incredible features of this government has been not only the extent to which it believes it has the arbitrary authority to do what it likes and to negotiate internationally, but also its remoteness and lack of concern for the average citizen of Australia knowing what is going on-which seems to me to be high-handed and just not acceptable. It applies as much in the field of ILO conventions as anywhere else and, if you have a look at the conventions, there is-as the honourable member for Charlton so properly said-concern out there. None of us wants to go back to the conditions to which the honourable member refers. The member for Charlton talked about the coal mining area of the Hunter Valley. I can tell you that, in the bush, exactly the same thing applied. There are far too many people in generations past who did not learn to read and write and far too many of them had to go out and work in the days of their childhood. I tell members of the wider community that, sadly, we are approaching this situation again. I know that, for other reasons-this may well be a diversion from ILO conventions-there is an enormous concern in rural Australia about the consequences of this drought. What is Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITI'EE MC 899 happening is that people are not being educated. I know of children in my part of the world who are no longer going to school. Many of the children are in the category to which the honourable gentleman refers and yet they are, supposedly, covered by ILO conventions. In other words, the minimum standards that should be applicable are not applicable because people cannot afford them. There is nothing worse than to have a youngster come along and say, 'I'd like to continue at school but I can't. I've got to go and work,' or to have children's mothers come and tell you why her children have left school. Sadly, that is happening. The standards are essential, but the point that I am trying to get to is that we need to be concerned that the public at large is aware of how we are trying to progress. Whether it is working conditions and ILO conventions or whether it is in any other field, there is an obligation to consult. There is a requirement on the federal government to ensure that conventions which it is proposed to ratify are presented earlier rather than continuing with the present system of providing this annual report to the parliament. I have had a quick look at the paper, but it is extraordinarily unlikely that most of the people in the wider community know that only now are we looking at the ratification of the minimum age for fishermen. There are all sorts of conventions-some of which may well not apply generally-but 'Plantations 1958' is not being pursued. That is quite interesting. I tried to find out what plantations are. The timber industry has been a very important employer about the bush, and one way to develop the timber industry of the future is to have more plantations. However, the paper tells us very little except for information about the work conditions for plantation workers. Whether 'plantations' covers timber plantations, I have not a clue, but the point I am making is that, firstly, we learn of all this in bulk, and I do not think that is very desirable; and, secondly, when you do look at the paper you only get a very brief analysis of what it contains. I recommend that, for future occasions, the minister goes back to the Menzies application of the Ponsonby rule, even if he does not go the next step-as the honourable member for Tangney advocated and which I endorse-to establish a parliamentary process whereby all international treaties are tabled in the parliament and whereby members of both houses are given the opportunity to debate and, if they so wish, to negate international conventions. I suspect that most of the conventions in the labour relations area will have the bipartisan endorsement of members of both houses. However, there are nuances in the conventions and the nuances need to be addressed. It is not sufficient for us to get an annual report which provides very little opportunity to study in detail matters which have a profound impact not only on the work force but also on those who are not in the work force but who would very much like to be. all the other speakers have said, that the ILO performs a very valuable and important international and national function. The ILO provides a forum through which those who are concerned about industrial relations and working conditions-employers, union officials and those concerned to administer various aspects of our industrial law-can come together to consider these issues not merely on a domestic basis but also on a global basis. I share the concerns that have been outlined by other speakers in terms of the fact that it is not good enough to have important decisions made at the ILO only to have conventions come forward and fall into a parliamentary situation where the process for dealing with them is less than adequate. So often in our parliament we hear terms like 'Australia has got to",142,Representatnes Main Committee
523,Mr Holding (Melbourne Ports) (11.43 A.m.),"In addressing this report, let me say, asMC900 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 become part of the global market'. Although we are told that privatisation of industry is a desirable way to go, that is not a view that I share. It is true that, as tariff barriers fall and despite international conventions, those nations find, both as a matter of history and in the way in which their own economies have evolved, that there is gross exploitation of women and children. Children in many parts of our own region are denied a childhood by virtue of their exploitation in manufacturing processes. There are Australian manufacturers which employ a large work force. I am thinking of those in the textile and clothing industry which were protected. As the barriers of protection fell, they found the only way they could survive was by opening up manufacturing and production outlets in other parts of Asia. There is no such thing as a stereotyped employer, just as there is no such thing as a stereotyped worker. I know of concerned employers who had successful industries in the clothing and textile industry, who were employing workers under award conditions and who found that, in order to stay in business, they had to retrench large numbers of talented, loyal and dedicated workers and were appalled when they went overseas to see the conditions under which, if they were to set up new industries, people would be employed. The very suit I am wearing, when I first bought it, was an Australian product. When I tried to buy the same product two years ago, I found it was made in China. The real question is: are the conditions under which it is produced equitable and just? Do we say that we cannot afford to employ Australian workers? If we are going to survive as employers-and I can understand that-we have to create our manufacturing opportunities in other parts of the world even though we may abhor and not support the conditions under which those workers are employed. I do not see how, given the pressures that are upon the executive and the pressures that are upon individual ministers, given the tensions that occur regularly as between certain states and the Commonwealth on the whole issue of industrial relations, we can give some of these important conventions the consideration that they deserve simply by the process of tabling the report. If we are serious about dealing with these conventions and reports, a case could be made for creating a permanent standing committee which would have the task of considering these reports as they come forward and then reporting to the parliament and the government on those conventions. That process might well mean that there is a focus which does not presently exist. There will be a focus which will bring the attention of the relevant minister and his department to those issues because, if we are serious-and I take the point that was made by the previous speaker, the member for New England( Mr Sinclair), when he pointed out that while we are debating this there are other things going on in the other chamber-we must ask ourselves whether our parliamentary processes, which are becoming more complex, and the times and pressures that are on ministers and members, are such that we are doing anything more than paying almost irresponsible lip service in order to say, 'Here is an important set of documents and recommendations from an international body. We will honour those by tabling them.' They have to be considered in the context of the way in which we see our own economy developing and the pressures upon our manufacturers and our work force, our commitment of trying to maintain some level of full employment in this community while making us as a nation competitive in a whole range of areas. Because they are so important it is not good enough simply to say, 'Well, we table this report and we hope that people will pick it up.' Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 901 It is not good enough that these important issues be left basically to the trade union movement, manufacturers and those who are involved heavily in the whole process of industrial relations. I believe we could advance the situation which all speakers to date have spoken about, with some concern, by this parliament discussing the issues for the purposes of suggesting that we have a parliamentary committee whose function it is to receive these reports, to examine them as a committee on a bipartisan political basis and to report to the parliament. On the basis of each report, matters can then be taken up by ministers and by the parliament in a way which will give these important conventions the kind of attention that they require. That is a view which would go a long way towards solving the levels of dissatisfaction that have been expressed on both sides of this chamber in terms of the lack of effective process in dealing with matters of substance. Such matters go ultimately to our capacity as a nation not merely to survive in an increasingly competitive world but to survive in a way where we see justice done to all sections of our work force, justice done to our manufacturers and justice done in that region of the world where we know that, even as I am speaking, there is a gross exploitation of children, women and those far less able to defend themselves in their own country. They do not have the mechanisms and the checks and balances that exist in ours. publication Status of fLO conventions in Australia-1994 is now available. I believe it is a very useful resource for those who are interested in Australia's status with the ILO conventions. I have found the book very interesting, with details on the various conventions, the ILO history and its implementation. The ratification of ILO conventions in Australia has involved major work by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The publication on ILO conventions aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard setting activities, and of the role that international labour standards play in protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia. The ILO attaches particular importance to the need to ensure respect for certain fundamental human rights which have bearing on the social, economic and physical well-being of working people throughout the world. These include the principle of freedom of association, the right not to be subjected to forced labour and the right to work free of discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, sex and other arbitrary criteria. We are fortunate in Australia that so many of the basic rights, some 54 of the ILO conventions, as well as 922 treaties, have been ratified by Australia. Not all ILO conventions are appropriate targets for ratification by Australia. There are 176 conventions, 54 of which have been ratified and a further 30 of which have been identified by the Commonwealth-state consultative machinery as appropriate targets, and we are working through that machinery at the present time. The remaining conventions have either been closed to ratification by the adoption of a revising convention or have been judged not to be relevant to Australia. It is essential for Australia to have a good record of ratification if we are to speak with authority and standing in the international community on labour and social matters. It would be difficult to criticise the human rights of other countries if Australia's own record was not good. We are still seeking to address certain conventions, including one of child labour, with",145,Representatives Main Commitfee
524,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.52 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak and to take note that the DIRMC 902 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 which there are some problems currently, and which have been highlighted recently in the press. Some ILO conventions have been overtaken by change and by time. We have, in fact, only denounced one convention and that is No. 45, which prohibited women from working in underground mines. This convention was adopted in June 1935 and came into force in May 1937. It was ratified by Australia in October 1953 and denounced in May 1988. I think, in equality terms, that is the reason that the ratification has been changed. I guess, if men go into mines, it is accepted that women go into mines; otherwise it would be discriminatory. Anybody who goes into a mine deserves to be protected by other ratifications of international convention and I am trying to point out how these conventions can change over the years. It is appropriate that we have changed that convention and denounced the one that came into being in 1934. The ILO states may withdraw from their obligations in respect of ratified ILO conventions during a period of 12 months every 10 years, from the anniversary of the date the convention came into force. During the 1980s, several Australian states repealed their legislation prohibiting women working in underground mines on the basis that it discriminated against women. Australia's rationale for denunciation was that conditions in mines had improved with technology advances, et cetera to the extent that the special protection of women was no longer required. It shows the changes that Australia has been through from 1953 to 1988. One convention I am particularly interested in is Convention No. 155, Occupational Safety and Health, 1981. This is rated as a suitable target for ratification, which Australia has not undertaken yet. It says: The Convention provides that each member State shall formulate, implement and periodically review a coherent national policy on occupational safety and health in the working environment. It provides that such a policy shall be formulated after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers. Its objective shall be to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with or occurring in, the course of work, by minimising, as far as possible, the causes of hazards inherent in the working environment. The convention provides, among other things, that employers are required to supply adequate protective clothing and equipment and to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, the workplaces, machinery, equipment and processes under their control, as well as chemical, physical and biological agents and substances used in the workplace, are safe and without risk to health. The convention provides also that workers and their representatives in undertakings shall cooperate in the fulfilment by employers of their obligations. Workers who report hazardous working conditions or cease work when they believe the situation presents an imminent and serious danger to life or health are to be protected from undue consequences. Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the ACT have agreed to ratification-but WA now says that it is conditional on the outcome of consultation with the Commonwealth in relation to implementation of an article. Tasmania, my state, has identified some compliance problems but believes they should be overcome with the new occupational health and safety legislation. New South Wales and the Northern Territory are looking at the issue as well. SoI think the ratification of that very important convention will come into play some time in the future. I heard some very interesting comments from my colleague the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Brown) earlier in the tabling of this report, dealing with child labour in mines Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 903 and going on to link in the importance of some of the conditions that apply still in other countries. We should be very aware of that and we should constantly bring that to the attention of world bodies and endeavour to enforce these conventions or ask that these conventions be ratified throughout the world. If we did not have conventions or opportunities or mechanisms or machinery such as this through the ILO, I believe that working people throughout the world would be in much worse conditions and have much less opportunity of overcoming the difficulties in which they work. Work should have dignity, it should have conditions of safety, it should have conditions of work and it should have wages paid which allow an individual to live with dignity, and the ILO conventions assist in reaching those goals. There are parts of the world, and some very wealthy countries of the world, where people still work as the working poor. These are issues which I believe will start to confront the world in debate over the next few years. I welcome the report and commend it to the House. take note of these kinds of issues. The ILO is a very important world body. It is one which has been around for many years, having been established in 1919. It is very important to note that this international body, the ILO, has survived many cataclysmic events that have taken other organisations of lesser standing and stature and swept them aside in the course of history. Indeed, the League of Nations is one such body. That went the way of all irrelevant bureaucracies at a national, local or international level because it did not meet or address the real needs of people and the respect of countries which it sought to serve. Those organisations which are nothing but international talk shops or international conventions where people meet only for the sake of meeting and which achieve very little of real practical purpose are readily identified by people and by countries and are swept into the waste bin of history, and that is often the most appropriate way of dealing with these things. International organisations must evolve and claim a place in society and in the world order in order to justify their repeated renewal and the funds which are placed in their care. Indeed, surrendering the initiatives in these areas to an international organisation is not something which should be done lightly. Nations, quite rightly, jealously guard their sovereignty and try to ensure that it is maintained. Some nations feel threatened by international organisations which they believe can usurp that national authority. This is not the case with the ILO. The history of the organisation indicates that that is so. The ILO clearly has a real place in the world. It has a real purpose and its work has real meaning. That it does so in a controversial area like labour relations is of great credit to the organisation and those who work within it. As I said, the ILO was established in 1919. It has a substantial number of permanent members. It is unique amongst United Nations organisations in that it is a tripartite body. While only a national government can be a full member of the ILO, it always sends a delegation which consists of two government members and representatives from the peak union or employee bodies and from the peak employer bodies. Thus, the ILO earns a great deal of respect and credibility throughout the world because it represents all who are involved in the industrial relations equation: the governments of each country-which are there to protect their national interest as well as to advance world interest; the representatives of the union movement; and the representatives of employer bodies. Thus, over the years, the ILO ha-s been able to address a number of very important issues.",147,Representatives Main Committee
525,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (12.03 P.m.),"It is very important that the House doesMC904 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 It is also worthwhile looking at the founding principles of the ILO, because they underwrite many of the conventions and recommendations it introduces in the course of its work. The ILO was founded on the principles of social justice. It is worth referring to the initial principles on which the ILO was founded and which are incorporated in the constitution of that organisation. The ILO was set up to include discussion of the following: the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of an adequate living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own; recognition of the principles of equal remuneration for work of equal value; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organisation of vocational and technical education; and other measures. If we examine some of those measures now, we can see how far-sighted the people who established the ILO were in identifying issues which would affect people over the years-not only in developed countries like our own where many of these matters are still subject to debate and disputation, but particularly in Third World countries where these things are far from as advanced as, fortunately, they are in this country. The right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair), in an earlier contribution, referred to some of the less fortunate countries which are members of the ILO but which do not have the labour standards which we take for granted on both sides of politics in this country. When you look at some of the other issues which those countries are still dealing with in the ILO, you can see why there is an ongoing need for an organisation like the ILO and why it is essential, even in a country like AustraliaA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.10 p.m. to 12.25 p.m. Representatives I was discussing the basis of the constitution of the ILO, the very important principles on which it was founded and the kinds of issues which it had been formed to take into account even way back in 1919. The importance of these issues has not gone away. While in Australia we may have been fortunate enough to tackle many issues such as child labour and other areas of oppression of the work force in times past, that is not always the case in some other parts of the world and the importance of attacking these issues will continue. There is no question that one can continue to improve these standards wherever they are fixed 3'ld there will always be differences around the world which need to be addressed. The other very important part of the ILO's founding documents-which were established, in this case, in 1944-is the statement of principles. The statement of principles also bears reaffirmation, as does the ILO, because the declaration which it passed at that time reaffirmed the fundamental principles on which the organisation is based and, in particular, established that labour is not a commodity. Freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustain progress. Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere and the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation and by continuous and concerted international effort so that the representatives of workers and employers enjoy equal",149,Representatnes Main Committee
526,Mr Martyn Evans,"Before the suspension for the division in the House ofWednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC905 status with governments and join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to promotion of common welfare. Indeed, many of these same principles are of very much importance to us today whether we are in Australia or whether we are in some of the less fortunate countries where the ILO's writ does not run or where it runs but is not properly implemented. It is very important to look at the way in which the principles of the ILO are enforced throughout the world. Firstly, of course, it is important that nations are members of the ILO. If they are-many are; there are some 175 members of the ILO-these nations have the opportunity to send people to the various deliberations of the ILO to take part in the formulation of conventions or recommendations. The recommendations are very much technical matters where the ILO formulates principles on which it believes member states should act and it fills out the details which are often left out of the conventions. It is certainly the case that, if you look at some of the conventions, they are far from detailed and, indeed, much is left to be discussed in the course of recommendations which the ILO formulates and puts forward for the consideration of member states. Where a member state is prepared to adopt and ratify a convention, then, of course, there are internal processes of law within each country which need to be undertaken by that country. The only obligation which a nation has is to draw to the attention of the relevant authority the various conventions which are adopted by the ILO. In the case of Australia and most other Western and other countries, that authority would be the relevant parliament of the country. The obligation of the state is met if it draws the attention of that parliament to the convention which was adopted by the ILO and which that country has ratified, normally through the force of executive government. Since the executive government in Australia is presumed to have received the common-law rites of the royal prerogative at the time of the establishment of the Federation of Australia, then, of course, the powers of the crown in the United Kingdom-which enjoyed very substantial powers in the ratification and negotiation of treaties-are presumed to have devolved on the Commonwealth of Australia as the legal inheritor of these common-law powers from the United Kingdom at the time of Federation. Of course, that does, in a modem context, have the potential to create some difficulties in a federated state like Australia. We have an enviable record in the number of conventions which we have adopted compared with many other federal states. Indeed, when you compare us with the countries of this region and with APEC and the like, we have a fairly strong basis for the number of conventions which we have ratified. Although it is not as strong a record as might apply in parts of Europe where those countries have been able to ratify many more conventions, if you look at the general application of the law in this country we have done quite well, although, as this report points out, we could do far more. It is important to look at the number Australia has ratified so far: 48 out of a total of 172 conventions. Coincidently, this is the same as the number for the Soviet Union, but it compares favourably with the number for other federal countries, such as Canada, 27, Malaysia, 11, and the United States, 10. But, as I said, it is not as impressive a record as countries like France, with 114, Germany, 69, Spain, 122, Sweden, 82, and Great Britain, 80. It is for those reasons that, in 1991, in an attempt to improve on this record, the government established a task force to conduct a detailed review of those conventions which were identified as possible targets for ratification. Part of that process is the paper we are taking note of now, Status of [LO MC 906 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 conventions in Australia 1994, which lists the various conventions which could well be targeted for ratification, examines those, and indicates which are possible targets and which others would have to be neglected because of the simple effluxion of time and the fact that those conventions are now well out of date. It is also important that we take into account the federal structure of Australia and the way in which, as with any treaty negotiation, it is important that Australia takes into account the interests of the various states. As a former member of a state parliament and a former state minister, I am only too well aware of the impact which conventions and treaties signed by a national government can have on the states in Australia. Of course, in the case of the ILO, the federal government has, in almost all cases bar one or two, been able to obtain the agreement of almost every state prior to implementing these treaties. This is an enviable record. It is one which I am sure we would want to continue, although in some cases it is not always practical to guarantee that. Australia's international reputation is very important. It is also essential that we show some significant leadership in these areas to demonstrate to other countries in this region that we are prepared to take leadership on the area of international labour reform, the protection of individual rights and the promotion of social justice. Those issues are quite critical and, if one or more of the states stands in the way of that process, inevitably the Commonwealth will be forced at some point to use its powers to ratify and implement those treaties through some of the other heads of constitutional power. It should preferably not be through the external affairs power; that is the one of least application in this context, I would think. But we do have many others-the corporations power and the like, the trade and commerce power, and the incidental power-which can all be used, with the endorsement of the High Court, to implement these kinds of treaties. Whenever the High Court has tested the matter of these treaties, I think it has come out very much on the side of the Commonwealth's international obligations. Indeed, how can Australia conduct its affairs in the world of national governments these days without being part of that? Our country is part of an international economy, something we cannot avoid and something which is going to grow with time, and the internationalisation of our economy is something which we must all come to grips with. I think the ILO, through its processes of international normalisation and reform, will play a very vital role in that and I would like to ensure that Australia takes its part in the Asia-Pacific region in promoting those very worthwhile objectives of social justice that the ILO promotes.

The question of the ILO, and the overall question of international treaties and their role in terms of the making of law and regulation within this country, has been an item of increasing public interest in recent years. We have heard those discussions in this place, and also in the Senate and the House, and it is a matter of serious discussion right throughout political life in Australia.

In that way I think it is a very valuable document for those who wish to go into the detail of what actually is occurring with respect to international treaty obligations with respect to the ILO. In terms of the history of the ILO, I would just like to read from the introduction to that report: The ILO was established as part of the peace settlement at the end of World War I. From 1919 to 1945 it functioned as part of the League of Nations. It survived the demise of the League and, since 1946, has operated as a specialised agency of the United Nations. The founding principle of the organisation is that ""universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice."" Article 41 of the original Constitution set out a number of ""methods and principles"" which were considered to be of ""special and urgent importance"" for the attainment of this objective. These methods and principles are now reflected in the preamble to the Constitution of the Organisation. They include: ""the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment, the protection of children, young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition of the principles of equal remuneration for work of equal value, recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organisation of vocational and technical education and other measures."" This statement of principle is to be read in conjunction with the Declaration of Philadelphia, which was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1944 and which was appended to the Constitution in 1946. Amongst other things, the Declaration: ""reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based and, in particular, that(a) labour is not a commodity; (b) freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained progress; (c) poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere; (d) the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in which the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with those of governments join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare."" I think it is clear from that that the ILO is a internationally respected organisation that is looking at key issues with respect to the overall well-being of the world, and in that respect it is deserving of strong support. The situation has been that there has been strong support for the ILO both within Australia and also internationally. Within Australia we have had a situation where coalition governments have ratified 22 of the 54 conventions ratified by Australia, including several important ones: No. 42, regarding workers compensation; No. 47, the 40-hour week; No. 88, employment service; No. 105, abolition of forced labour; No. 122, employment policy; No. 123, minimum age, underground work; and No. 144, tripartite consultation and international labour standards. Labor governments have ratified 32. There was a motion in the House of Representatives on 7 December 1994 on the issue of the 75th anniversary of the ILO. That motion received bipartisan support of the House. I would MC908 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 like to quote from the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles), who spoke on behalf of the opposition in that debate. He said: There is no doubt that the ILO has performed a very valuable service and is a very respected organisation in world social and equity terms. The Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton) also spoke in that debate. He raised the issue of several international plaudits that had been received by the ILO. One was on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the ILO in 1969. The Chairman of the Nobel Committee said: There are few organisations that have succeeded, to the extent that the ILO has succeeded, in translating into action the fundamental moral idea on which it is based ... Working earnestly and untiringly, the ILO has succeeded in introducing reforms that have removed the most flagrant injustices in a great many countries ... His Holiness Pope John Paul II gave an audience to the chairman of the ILO governing body in 1992. He also congratulated the ILO for putting social dialogue and tripartite cooperation at the forefront of its considerations. President Nelson Mandela, in contributing to a volume of essays entitled Visions of the Future of Social Justice on the occasion on the ILO's 75th anniversary, wrote: The present situation in South Africa, where a majority of the population is trying to rectify the experience of generations of systematic exclusion from the most basic rights and benefits, highlights the ongoing relevance of the ILO mandate. Many South Africans are only now recognising that lasting peace can be established only on the basis of social justice, 75 years after it was expounded as the founding principle of the ILO. The circumstances around ILO conventions are to some extent different from some other international treaties. ILO conventions are based on a partnership approach. There is, as I mentioned earlier, a tripartite structure: representatives of employers and workers have equal voting rights with governments in the various ILO forums. The ILO constitution requires employer and worker representatives to participate in ILO processes. They caucus separately from each other and from governments, and vote according to the agreement of their groups. Australian employers and workers are represented by the peak bodies, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. International labour standards are instruments which comprise either conventions, which are open to ratification, or recommendations, which simply provide guidelines to governments. These are adopted by the ILO conference, usually after a double discussion process, whereby the topic is discussed at two successive sessions of the ILO conference. Prior to each ILO conference discussion, the ILO produces a report which analyses responses to a questionnaire. These reports form the basis of discussion. The Australian government responses to questionaries and briefs to delegates, are prepared after consultation with the states and territories, the ACCI and the ACTU. The fact that a member supports the adoption of a convention at the ILO conference has no impact on the obligations of that member. The decision to ratify is made independently of the vote to adopt. This is a very important issue with respect to our actions on international conventions. Quite often I have had constituents raise with me the fact that we are a signatory to an agreement, or that we have supported some other agreement in an international forum. What that really means with respect to Australian law and to Australian society may be quite different to what is often assumed. Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 909 When we are talking about some conventions, we are talking about broad statements of principle which have a certain amount of flexibility within them, in order to take into account the particular conditions which may be faced within a particular member state. In those circumstances, the seriousness of a particular issue may well be overstated by a purely literal reading or literal reporting of what has occurred. As I said earlier, Australian delegations attending the ILO conference comprise government, employer and worker representatives. They work in concert with their own groups. The government delegation includes state or territory representatives, in accordance with an agreed order of attendance. This is funded by the Commonwealth government in recognition of the important role played by state and territory governments in implementing ILO conventions. As the previous speaker, the member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans), commented, the circumstances of the detail of the convention and how it may work, if adjusted into law, is such that the role of state governments in the implementation process is often crucial. There has to be that involvement from a state and territory basis as well-that what is in the end ratified and in the end adopted is something which is workable within the various state systems that we have within this federal system. The state or territory minister for labour and the opposition spokespersons on industrial relations are invited to attend the ILO conference for the same time as the Minister for Industrial Relations. Again, this is funded by the Commonwealth. It is usual Australian practice not to ratify an ILO convention unless two conditions are met: firstly, that law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions comply with its provisions; and, secondly, that all relevant state and territory governments have formally agreed to ratification. The caveat of 'relevant' is included because some conventions fall within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction alone. There is also a third precondition-the formal agreement of the ACCI and the ACTU. The ILO conference adopted convention No. 176 concerning safety and health in mines in June 1995. As I mentioned earlier, of the 176 ILO conventions, Australia has, at this stage, ratified 54. A further three conventions dealing with employment conditions for seafarers are expected to be ratified soon. Ratification of these conventions is significant in that it will help Australia achieve compliance with convention No. 147 with respect to merchant shipping minimum standards. So often you can have a situation where a number of conventions have to fit together-to lock in-to actually meet the conditions of another convention but, essentially, it is about trying to improve the overall safety net, often in a particular area of conditions with respect to workers as a whole or with respect to a particular industry. Obviously, the merchant marine industry, as an international industry, is a key industry for the ILO to have an interest in. I mentioned earlier the question of ILO conventions versus other treaties. The significant aspect of state consultations on ILO conventions compared to other treaties is that it is ongoing. The ILO conference is an annual event and the processes are well established. The requirement of federal member states to consult with their constituent states is unique in the United Nations system, as is the direct involvement of the social partners in the development of international labour standards and the ratification process. In the context of its inquiry into treaties, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee appeared to be impressed by the consultative processes for ILO conventions as described by the Department of Industrial Relations. Senator Ellison, the chair of the MC910 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 committee, and Senator Kemp both suggested that the ILO processes might comprise a model for all treaties. As part of that overall debate on the question of treaties and external affairs and the way that the government operates with respect to those particular issues, there has been a range of debates. A number of issues were raised by Senator Abetz as a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Senator Abetz criticised the government for consulting with peak groups rather than constituent groups and individuals within the community. Essentially, in the circumstances of ILO conventions, we are required by the terms of the ILO constitution and convention No. 144 on tripartite consultation to deal with the most representative organisation of employers and workers. The point is often made that the ACTU is not fully representative of the needs and aspirations of workers in this country. The figures on the membership of unions and the particular areas that they actually are involved in with respect to employment within Australia are raised but, again, the question is: if you don't consult with them, who do you consult with? The nature of government, the need to actually involve aspects of the community but at the same time reach decisions over time, requires government to make choices and, in those circumstances, the ACTU certainly is the most appropriate body with respect to employees. The same circumstances relate to the question of employers. The ACCI, in its own way, is not ideal with respect to this issue but it is, in fact, the best option that is available under the circumstances if you wish to consult with the employer sector about what employers see as being important in terms of any particular conventions that may be under consideration. Issues were also raised by Senator Abetz regarding, for example, Vietnam as a nation which should pay greater regard to the standards that we employ in Australia. One of the things that the government has tried to do through the ILO is to provide assistance to Vietnam in this regard by helping to translate key ILO conventions into Vietnamese and by assisting with the development of their newly adopted labour code and to improve action on the ILO conventions within that country. I commend the paper to the House. I think it has a lot of valuable information which can be used in the future in the consideration of conventions. of this paper on ILO conventions in Australia relate to the shipping industry, particularly ILO 147. Some members will recall our Ships of shame report that was tabled in December of 1992 and, in particular, what it said about conditions for crew members. We highlighted the exploitation, impoverishment and straight-out physical abuse that was being perpetrated upon crew members, particularly crew members from Third World countries. In that report we made a recommendation that the government not permit vessels to enter Australian ports if they could not prove that they were complying with ILO 147. The text of recommendation 11 was that: The Federal Government deny entry to ships which do not meet ILO 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions from trading in Australian waters. The response of the government was to say that: It is not feasible to assess whether a ship complies with ILO 147 standards prior to inspectionreferring to port state inspection-",152,Representatives Main Committee
528,Mr Peter Morris (Shortland) (12.50 P.m.),"My remarks in the context of the tablingWednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC911 which can only be carried out in port. The present system which provides for detention of non-compliant ships until deficiencies are rectified is therefore considered the most appropriate approach to ensuring that conditions on board ships are not hazardous to safety and/or the health of their crews. Our committee carried out a further review of ship safety and the matters relating to crew conditions. It presented to the parliament in November of last year a progress report in which we looked at the responses from government and industry to the recommendations that we had made. We will present a final report to the parliament at the end of the coming November. Having looked at the responses of the government, industry, ship operators, ship managers and ship owners, as a committee we remain more convinced than ever that ILO 147 should be ratified by this country and that we should be demanding proof of compliance with ILO 147 before ships are allowed to enter Australian ports. We were told that it was very difficult to ensure that a ship was meeting ILO 147 conditions before the ship came into the port, as I mentioned a few minutes ago. That is not nearly as difficult as it seems or as it is described in those words. There is always the last port state inspection that the vessel has been subjected to. Information is always available on the reputation and standard of management of the ship concerned, and information will increasingly be transmitted from port state inspections around the world through the various port state groupings, particularly the Asia-Pacific port state group. For some time we have been exchanging information about conditions on board ships and the condition of ships so that when a ship and/or its treatment of crew is substandard that information can be transmitted ahead of the ship's arrival to the appropriate port state inspection group. In Australia's case, that is the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Members may wonder why we are so concerned about ILO 147. It is the international convention that protects employment, accommodation and treatment of crews on board ships. Those who have read our Ships of shame report or have been in any way involved with some of the substandard ships that come into Australian ports will well understand. Twenty countries ratified the principal convention, ILO 147, and it had been declared applicable to 18 nonmetropolitan territories. These 38 countries covered 45 per cent of the world shipping gross tonnage. The convention involves a commitment to safety standards. From our examination of the shipping industry, the conditions, morale, care and accommodation all have a bearing on the crews' ability to carry out their tasks on board ship, the competency with which that vessel is operating and therefore on the safety of the vessel. So the convention involves a commitment to safety standards, social security measures and established shipboard conditions of employment and living conditIOns. The standards under ILO 147 should be substantially equivalent to the articles that are covered in the detail of the convention. Effective jurisdiction or control needs to be exercised over home registered vessels-that is vessels registered under the flag of the nation concerned. There must be adequate procedures for the employment of seafarers. Seafarers must be properly qualified and adequately trained. Maritime labour standards must be enforced, principally by inspection, and there should be an inquiry into any serious marine casualty. Advice should be provided to nationals and states which have ratified the convention on the problems of working on a vessel flagged in a state which has not ratified the convention. Port states may take action to rectify clearly hazardous deficiencies on board and may notify the country of registration. MC 912 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 1995 Recommendation 155, which is an adjunct to ILO convention 147, proposes the continued extension of the list of what should be considered minimum labour standards in merchant shipping and improvement in national provisions to reach a standard which is at least equivalent to specified requirements under ILO 147. In response to our recommendations, the government has said, 'Whilst we have not ratified ILO 147, we are implementing the spirit of ILO 147 through marine orders via the inspection authority-the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. So, whilst we have not formally ratified the convention, we are carrying out those tasks we would be carrying out had we ratified the convention.' We do not accept that that is good enough. The abuse that takes place on some ships coming into Australian ports is incredible. It is something that we were appalled by as a committee. We continue to be appalled by it, and it is something that none of us expected to find. For example, when we looked at the accommodation conditions we found the following: no hot water, one toilet amongst many seafarers, no lighting, water dribbling through the cabins, inadequate food, and crews being starved. One could go on and on about the details of the abuses that take place. In this scenario, Australia has to be a leader, not a follower. The ships that have these kinds of conditions on board and the nations under which these ships are flagged are well known. We now call them 'flags of shame'. The ships of shame are the substandard ships, and the nations which perpetrate these abuses, or which allow these abuses to be perpetrated on ships flying their flags, are flags of shame. The owners of the freight have to accept public responsibility, they have to accept public accountability for the treatment that is being meted out to these crew members. ILO 147 is a good convention. It needs to be ratified. The Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton) said, in response to the report, that the government was implementing the spirit of the convention, but that there had to be agreement among the states. We have not had agreement among all the states. There are three other ILO maritime conventions that we are proposing to ratify on the adoption of a statutory definition of seagoing vessels, which would ensure that their implementation depended on Commonwealth compliance alone. Those three other conventions are: convention 145, 'Continuity of Employment (Seafarers)"" 1976; convention 146, 'Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay', 1976; and convention 147, 'Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards)"" 1976-which is the one I am referring to. It is not good enough for the industry to go quietly-and here we are talking about shippers, exporters and importers-and benefit from these kinds of abuses and for the government to say, 'Well, we haven't yet got the states' agreement on all of these matters, but when we do then we could proceed with it.' What we are being advised at the moment is that the Department of Transport is considering a proposal from the Department of Industrial Relations which suggests that the Commonwealth complies with convention 147. There are two areas which require examination. Apart from the Commonwealth loan implementation question, the Commonwealth needs to demonstrate compliance or substantial equivalence with one of three social security conventions appended to ILO 147. In light of the amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 made in conjunction with the adoption of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993, the Department of Industrial Relations suggests that section 127, which addresses shipowners' liability for medical attendants, et cetera, complies with convention 55, which is shipowners' liability for sick and Wednesday, 30 August 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 913 injured seamen. Compliance with conventions 145 and 146 is based on federal industrial awards. The National Labour Consultative Council agreed in March 1988 that ILO maritime conventions should be considered in a tripartite consultative forum in the transport portfolio and the Department of Industrial Relations is asking Transport to initiate consultation with the relevant body. The Maritime Services Advisory Committee has carried out this function in the past. The states and the Northern Territory have been invited to comment on the proposal to ratify these three conventions on the basis of Commonwealth law and practice alone. So far, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have supported the proposal. Given that the states have agreed to a similar proposal with respect to conventions 69 and 73, we do not anticipate that there will be any concerns raised. The final position is that, once there is agreement from the social partners and the states and the territories that ratification may take place on the basis of Commonwealth compliance alone, once the Department of Transport agrees that compliance can be demonstrated with ILO convention 147 and once the Department of the Attorney-General certifies compliance, ratification of these three conventions may be possible. It is a long voyage that we are embarked upon. We will be looking at this matter again in the coming weeks as we conclude our review of ship safety. The convention imposes obligations on Australia in relation to loss of life and injury and the conditions under which ship crews work. There is a lot said about casualties at sea. I want to tell the committee that safety at sea is the basis of the international convention. There is no systematic recording of data on deaths and injuries. It seems from all of our research-and that is confirmed abroad-that the only seamen who appear to be counted are those who go down with their ship. So if you want to be counted in marine casualty statistics around the world then you have to go down to the bottom. If you are injured on board, maimed or hurt on board, there is no mechanism for recording those casualties. That is another major defect in the system. It is all revolving around ILO convention 147. We recommended in November 1994 that the Commonwealth government take action to ratify ILO convention 147. We still adhere to our earlier recommendation that the government not permit vessels that cannot provide proof of compliance with ILO 147 to enter Australian ports and to enter Australian waters. We feel very strongly about this. I know that the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis), as a member of the committee, has very similar views. It is difficult to track down the owners and the managers of vessels. It is difficult in Australia to do other than ensure that before the vessel leaves port it does meet international maritime safety standards. I want to give notice that we will be pursuing much more strongly the beneficiaries of those abuses on ships because at the end of the day, they are the people who have to stand up and say, 'Yes, we know what is going on. Yes, we use that ship with those abuses on that ship because we get a cheap rate from them.' That is the accountability. That is the responsibility that has to come much more to public notice. I bring that information before the committee because it is a matter about which we as a committee feel very strongly. It is Australia that has been giving a lead around the world in this major area of the improvement of ship safety. Debate (on motion by Mrs Sullivan) adjourned.
