Arbitration Public Service Act, section 8, provides certain procedure for dealing with any allegations of misconduct or unfitness in regard to him. Section8 of the Act enacts thatThe Governor General may remove the Arbitrator from oflice on an address praying for his removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour, or incapacity, being presented to the Governor General. I submit that the proper procedure should be taken. Minister takes exception to the notice of motion because of the words ""unfairness and incapacity of Mr Atlee Hunt."" I submit that a member is justified in 'bringing before the Chamber for discussion, on a formal motion for the adjournment, any definite matter of urgent public importance. Is this such a matter? I submit that it is. ""to -be attacked in the House should have an opportunity of preparing his defence. the Minister can prevent the honourable member for Bourke from dealing with this matter, even if you, Mr Speaker, rule that his present notice of motion cannot be accepted. I submit that there can be no question as to the unfairness of this officer in regard to the administration of the Act. deal with that matter when the question itself is being discussed To get over the present difficulty, I would recommend the honourable member for Bourke to amend his notice so that it may deal with the "" unsatisfactory administration of the Publio Service Act."" If it cannot bo so amended, the matter will have to be discussed under another motion. for Bourke is at liberty to move the adjournment to criticise any decision to which he takes exception, but what he now proposes to do is to make a' charge of direct incapacity against a judicial officer. argue the matter. I ask, Mr Speaker, if the honorable member for Bourko can amend his notice of motion in the manner that I have suggested 1 If that can be but the done, the subject can be discussed, and we can then proceed with our ordinary business. Mr 'SPEAKERI am afraid that what the honourable member suggests would be an unsatisfactory method of procedure if the motion involves any contemplated attackon the conduct of the Arbitrator in his judicial capacity. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) has intimated that he intends to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing certain charges, which are mentioned in his notice,, against the occupant of an important judicial position. The proper way of dealing with a matter of that kind is by submitting a specific motion.

21,Mr Speaker,"I have some doubtis that I am permitted to discuss the matter ""only in a manner which will not permit it to be discussed this session. as to that. My duty is simply to see that the proper procedure is observed. scribed by law for the removal.of a gentleman who occupies a judicial or quasi judicial position, and the proper course for the honourable member for Bourke to follow is to adopt the procedure laid down by which Judges can be attacked. The judgments of arbitrators are not above criticism, and this House has the right to criticise them as freely as it thinks f it , but under the guise of criticism it is not entitled to bring forward charges of incapacity on the part of the arbitrators. you are forcing us to submit a. censure motion. I occupy is to guide the House as to the lines which should be followed in circumstances which have arisen to-day. as to whether the Public ServiceA r b i trator can be put in the same category as a Judge, I contend that the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) is stretching, to a considerable extent, the law dealing with the matter of protecting Judges. He might just as well say that the House has no right to debate any arbitration award, even one affecting an industry outside the Commonwealth. We have discussed the award of the Coal' Tribunal over and over again, and we have criticised the awards of other T r i bunals appointed by State Governments or by the Commonwealth Government -wish to traverse the ground already It is certainly a wide interpretation of the law which the Minister, is placing before the House to-day. . ber for Bourke has submitted his notice in an amended for m eliminating the charges against Mr AtleeH u n t . He has notified me now that he intends to move the adjournment of the House to consider a definite matter of urgent public importance^ namely, "" the unsatisfactory administration of the Public Service Arbitrator Public Service of the Commonwealth."" I office. can accept a motion, in those terms, where I could not accept one in the form previously submitted. As to how the debate will develop I am not concerned at the present moment. I am not concerned Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. am sorry that I have found it necessary to move the adjournment of the House to-day, and I would not"" have done so if I had not felt that the matter which I am raising is one of great public i m portance that should be debated before the House adjourns. It was touched upon a. few days ago by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), who pointed out that in dealing with a plaint by f if t h class officers in the Public Service the Public .Service Arbitrator ( Mr. AtleeH u n t ) had abrogated his functions, nnd was practically drawing his salary in respect of a position the duties of which he was not carrying out. On being called upon to give ah award according to his judgment and good conscience upon the merits of the plaint of fifth class .officers, the Arbitrator refused In regard to the point to do so on the ground that certain legislation was pending, and, in fact, was before another place. In reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) said that it was not within his power to deal with the matter, but that if the facts were as had been stated the Public ServiceA r b i trator was certainly not fulfillin g his functions, and, as a matter of fact, could not have properly understood them. However, the right honourable gentleman went on to say that he did not think it was his place to do more than express an opinion on the point. To-day I do not covered or to reiterate the whole position as set out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I have something further to say. If this country pays a gentleman to carry out certain functions, and that gentleman does not exercise them, but practically declares his Court to be a dead Court, and refuses to give the judgments he is empowered to deliver, it is the duty and responsibility of Ministers to tell h i m that he must either exercise, the functions for carrying out which he in connection with the is drawing emoluments, or surrender his",20,Ventilati On Of Th E Chamber Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill Adjournment Formal

29,Mr Anstey (Bourke) (11.17),"Itake that view when Mr Justice Higgins went on strike. sary for me to speak on that occasion I i-hould have said exactly the same. In this connection I put a question to the Prime Minister the other day, whether, in view of his own decision and expressed opinion that the Public Service Arbitrator was not fulfillin g the functions of his office, he would refer the determination in regard to the f if t h class clerks back to the Arbitrator, and ask h i m to f u l f i l the functions of his office and deliver judgment. The answer as given by the Minister who is acting for the Prime Minister was to the effect that what had transpired in this Chamber would be referred to the Arbitrator for his consideration. The other day Mr Justice Powers, President of the Arbitration Court, expressed an opinion in regard to pending legislation which had been referred to by t he Prime Minister. He saidI t would be wrong on my part, in tlie face oE -such promised legislation, to commence new work which cannot be completed before this Court is abolished. In reference to that statement, the Prime Minister declared that it was the duty of the Judge to perform his duty and take no ccgnisance of legislation by this Parliament. tion, however, to which Judge Powers referred, there are distinct provisions which affect the Court over which he presides, and which, if carried into effect, will certainly destroy the power of the Judge, change his prerogative-prac tically change the whole structure of the Court. It was from that point of view that Judge Powers spoke, and, although the legislation referred to his own Court, the Prime Minister informed him that bis business was not to have regard to proposed legislation, but to exercise his functions and carry out the law as it pxists. If that be true of a Judge of the H i g h Court-if it be true that he must not refer to legislation which actually relates to his own Court-ho w much more true is it of the Arbitrator .under the Public Service Arbitration Act and his references to the' Public ServiceB ill now before Parliament? its early stages, but if it be carried into p.ffect it w ill not in any way interfere with the Oourt over which Mr AtleeH u n t gative or power or alter in any way the structure of his Court. Yet Mr Atlee' If it had been necesHunt, on the score of this proposed legislation, deliberately refused to exercise his functions. Whatever may be said of Judge Powers, he did not suspend the judgments of his Oourt-h e did not drive applicants away because of proposed legislation. But Mr AtleeH u n t did so, saying, "" I shall do nothing because of proposed legislation."" I submit that under these circumstances, since Mr Atlee Hunt is called upon to administer the law, and, .if not to give satisfaction, at least to decide, it is the bounden duty of the Government to say to him, "" Y o u draw £2,000 per annum of public money, and your duty is to administer the Public Service Arbitration Act, or leave the Court over which you now preside."" That is the position so f a r as I can see it . But there are other aspects of the case. The Ministerf o r Works and Eailways said this morning that we must not refer to a Judge or make any charges of in capacity against him, but there was no more definite charge of incapacity than that made by the Prime Minister himself. He said that if what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said was true, the Judge was incapable of understanding the functions of his office. In that proposed legislaThere is yet another aspect of the case. We. all know that Judges disagree; they may sit on the same Bench, and on the same evidence and facts draw different conclusions; but at least, so f a r as their own Courts are concerned, they each act upon some definite principle, and have some criterion, which serves as a,guide, even to those who appear before them. That is so well known that applicants know the particular outlook of certaiu Judges, and frame their cases accordingly. I know that when it is intended to take cases before the ordinary Arbitration Court a great deal is always felt to depend on whether Mr Justice Powers or Mr JusticeH i g gins will preside. The organization to which I belong has decided on occasions that it would be useless to take a particular claim before a certain Judge because of this feeling. Whatever Judges ThatB ill is only in mav be, whether their judgments be good or bad, they, at least, for the most part, in the exercise of their judicial functions, observe definite principles.",21,Ventilati On Of Th E Chamber Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill Adjournment Formal

31,Mr Anstey,"My accusation against the administration of Mr AtleeH u n t is that he has no principle to guide h i m ; he is mere shifting sand. There is no attitude he takes up to-day that is not altered tomorrow, there is no principle he acts on to-day that he does not renounce to-morrow, there is no authority of to-day that he does not repudiate to-morrow. A man who so exercises judicial functions cannot do other than create immense dissatisfaction amongst applicants to his Court. Mr AtleeH u n t , under the Act , is called upon to do certain things, and I shall give a few illustrations, from which honourable members may form their own opinions. simply a statement of facts. TheA ct clearly and distinctly provides(1.) The Arbitrator shall determine all matters submitted to him relating to salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service or employment of officers and employees of thc Public Service (1.) In relation to every claim or applicainto existence, if not to deal with such tion made to him in pursuance of this Act, thc Arbitrator shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case. Thc Commissioner, and the permanent heads and Chief Officers of the several Departments of State, and all persons in the Public Service, shall comply with the provisions of any determination of the Arbitrator made under this Act. No determination of the Arbitrator made under this Act shall he challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question, or bo subject to prohibition or mandamus, in any Court on any account whatever. Mr AtleeH u n t dealt with the case of the F if t h Class Clerks, in the early part of last month. I am not objecting to his judgment, but merely say he has no definite principle to guide h i m ; and no satisfaction can be given by a-Bench which fluctiiates in the way this gentleman does. In the case to which I have referred, he saidThe evidence disclosed many anomalies and the need of reform. The actions of the heads of Departments in blocking applications for transfer were many. There ought to be no bar of this kind. The right of transfer should be free to all. Having admitted the wrong, he said he had no power to remedy it because of 6ome proposed legislation. He went onThere are men in thc 5th Class holding University degrees, accountancy certificates, and other qualifications, and doing work involving discretion and initiative. member quoting? Mr Atlee Hunt's judgment in the case of the Public Service Clerical AssociationMany are doing work really more valuable than that represented by the present classification. I ask honourable members to note these remarks. Whatever might be good for the members of that Association, Mr. They need no accusation, but AtleeH u n t would not, although he could, take any action. He went onPresent conditions create dissatisfaction, and dissatisfaction leads to inefficiency. Why was Mr AtleeH u n t appointed, if not to decide on the merits of cases? Since their conditions create dissatisfaction, and dissatisfaction creates in efficiency, why did Parliament call him cases, and improve the conditions? He saidThere is no case so hard to justify as that where men are doing work of a higher class without receiving the pay of that class. I ask honourable members to note that, because I propose to show that in connection with other and higher classes of the Service, he deliberately did that which in this case he said he would not do. Finally he saidHe would have felt justified in increasing the maximum of the oth ClassBut he would not do so because of the B ill now before Parliament. One would naturally think that the proposed legislation had recently been introduced into another place. had no right to anticipate it . is what the Prime Minister said. Then, again, a few days later another body of men was before him. An y man may make errors, even Judges on the Bench, but if Mr AtleeH u n t honestly believed that the proposed legislation offered an impediment to the discharge of his functions as Arbitrator, one would think he would have treated all applicants alike and refused to act. But that he did not do. A f t e r having turned away those other men deliberately, telling them that he would not function,",22,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero

But he did not do that. of the rank and file, but when, the counter claim of the Commissioner was before him. he proceeded to deal with it by saying that all ths men at present enjoying the allowance could keep it, but all other men, who were regarded as efficient, and were fulfilling the functions of a higher grade, and to whom he would awarded an efficiency allowance but for the pending legislation, were denied any increase, and the Public Service Commissioner was permitted to deprive them, of what others were enjoying award of Mr Justice Powers. duct is not judicial, and cannot satisfaction, to the Public Service of this country. wishes of this House, or the governing his ' Later, another class of men, the postal electricians, approached him.

It would he lamentable if this Court were to . . . . refuse to prescribe He rejected the claims what is just on vague, unverified impression* as to financial conditions. Mr AtleeH u n t accepted that dictum as applicable to himself, and he proceeded to operate accordingly. But having forgotten his previous decision, he immediately swept out of the Court the large body of postal electricians, not on the have ground of equity, not on the substantial merits of the case, but on the ground that no funds were available. And he swept out of Court another body of men, numunder the bering thousands, because of impending Such conlegislation that may never become law, give and the for m of which, if it should become law, neither Mr AtleeH u n t nor It is not in accordance with the anybody else can foretell.

36,Mr Foley,He has nothing to do,24,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero
37,Mr Anstey,"Of course not; theHe usurped the functions of the Treasurer in that instance, but a few days later he had before him two cases, one relatiug to higher officials, and the other to lower officials. The lower oflicials, of course, he swept out of the Court. A f t e r telling them that they could not get judgment on the merits of their case because the funds were not available, three days later he awarded increases of £100 to £200 to the higher officials on the merits of their case. crease to the higher officials, he could not then argue to the lower-paid officers that there were no funds available, so he h it upon another excuse, and that was the proposed legislation that is before Parliament. I do not say his judgment in favour of the higher officials was wrong, bnt in the case of the rank and file he dismissed one application on> the ground of the proposed legislation, and another on the ground of the state of the public funds. If either of these grounds is valid against the lowerpaid public servants, it is equally valid against the higher-paid applicants. But what did Mr AtleeH u n t do ? A body of ; men who were already receiving large salaries went before him. He raised their salaries by from £120 to £150 per annum, and, in addition, he granted a cost of livin g allowance of £30 to single men ancl £50 to married men. receiving? salaries of from £600 to £700. I am not saying that his judgment was wrong,, but I am quoting his contradictory statements, and showing that he has no principle guiding him, and no policy, and that ho is not consistent or fair. A f t e r having swept out of Court thousands of men on the grounds of the state of the public funds, and in another case on the ground of anticipated legislation, he at the same time gave other higher-paid men increases of salary up to £150 per annum and a cost of living allowance, which made a total increase in some cases of £200 per annum. In another case he raised the salaries of many officials by £100 per annum. But in regard to the Fifth Class, to men who had been at the head of their Division' for a number of years, he said, "" Y o u should get the higher status for which you ask, because you are performing the duties of the next grade, but I cannot award it because of proposed legislation."" Almost within an hour or two he reversed his attitude, and raised another section of* omcers from their particular class to a higher grade, and gave them the emoluments that attached to the promotion. jSumming up his judgments, there is no increase which he has given to some men Having given that in on a particular ground that he has not refused to other men on the same ground; he has put forward no authority to buttress his acts which he has not afterwards repudiated. .When he was dealing with the case of the higher-paid officials he 'saidThe question I have to decide is whether the salaries paid and the promotion offered are sueh that good men are likely to be induced to remain in the Service. Evidence was given that the present rates of pay are too low. Thereupon, so f a r as the higher officials ' are concerned, he proceeded to raise their classification. When he came to deal with the lower paid officials, he said that the evidence given showed that their wages were too low, and that, on that evidence, he should raise the maximum of their class, but he could not do so, either because of lack of public funds, or because of some proposed legislation. In other case3 of the higher-paid officials he said that the men were doing work really more valuable than that repre-sented by their present classification, and that after they had remained for two years at the maximum of their class, they should be raised automatically to a higher class. Then he turns round and takes away from the lower ranks what has been awarded to them. Honourable members oan place their own construction on these' varying attitudes. Mr AtleeH u n t sinned either in error or in ignorance. The one is as bad as the other. If he erred deliberately, -then he is not fit to hold the position of Public ServiceA r b i trator. If he erred in ignorance he is equally unfit for his office. In my opinion the evidence goes to show that he erred deliberately. On 1st June, 1921, he saidThe Arbitration (Public Service) Act, under which I work, says that I shall act according to equity, good conscience, and the substantial merits of the case. That was the attitude he took up when dealing with the claims of the higher paid O",24,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero
38,Mr Higgs,-What salaries were they,25,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero
39,Mr Anistey,"They were receivingofficials, ancl he acted accordingly. On 12th August he referred to the "" Public ServiceB ill now before Parliament,"" and saidWhatever may be done in the future I deal only with the conditions now present. And on that basis he proceeded to operate. He knew of the existence of the Public ServiceB ill not only in August last when he made that statement, but in June, because the B ill was introduced in the Senatei n A p r i l last. D i d he say in August that the introducion of that B ill was fatal to any action on his part in granting relief ? No ; he said that he could uot regard these men as being underpaid. He rejected the claim of three-fourths of the applicants-the lower paid -o n the ground that they were receiving child endowment, but he increased the pay of the higher-salaried applicants, who were also receiving child endowment. Mr Atlee Huut's administration as Public Service Arbitrator from beginning to end has been entirely unsatisfactory. It has been unfair. It has not been governed by any definite principle. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House longer than is absolutely necessary, but this is a matter of vital importance, and I feel that it is imperative that the House and the country should know the facts. It is of the highest importance that a man who is vested with judicial powers shall deal with every case brought before him on its merits. If he gives a decision against applicants for increased pay, that decision must be on the merits of the case, and for that decision he should be prepared to take the f u l l responsibility. He should not shirk his responsibility because of projected legislation, or in anticipation of a shortage of public funds. He should give his decision in every case without fear or favour, and should not discriminate between those who earn much and those who earn but little in the service of their country. trator's decisions in the earlier cases quoted in the course of the argument in the later cases ? peatedly referred to, but the men had no standing. Most Judges base their decisions on some definite guiding principle. are generally quoted in support of an application. O 1 servants have been induced to submit cases to the Public Service Arbitrator by reason of certain decisions given by him, but as I have said he seems to have no guiding principles. Take bis decisions in May, June, and July. Men have gone before h i m and have said, ""These decisions were given by you in such and such cases-thes e are the precedents you have established,"" only to find that he shifts his ground. When his previous decisions are quoted he puts forward the condition of the public finances as a reason for not following them, or else advances as an excuse for not observing such precedents the introduction of a certain B ill . In view of all these facts it is the bounden duty of the Government to tell Mr. AtleeH u n t that if he wishes to continue to draw the salary and emoluments now paid h i m by the Commonwealth, he must as the Public Service Arbitrator f u l fil the functions for which he was appointed ; that he must give judgments which are consistent and based upon commonly understood principles; and that he shall deal fairly as between the highest and the lowest. It is the duty of the Government, not merely to refer these matters to Mr AtleeH u n t for consideration, but to tell him that he must f u l f i l the functions of his office dr resign. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr. Anstey) has brought before the Housei n the most forceful manner some of the causes of the (present unrest and dissatisfaction in the Commonwealth Public Service, and has emphasized the glaring injustices which Commonwealth employeeshave suffered. I hope that the House will recognise its responsibility to those who are so aggrieved and will endeavour to afford them the relief to which they are entitled. I desire to bring before honourable members a serious anomaly which has beeu created underi a new We r e hot the Arbiregulation under the Public Service Act.

44,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [11.45],"fits of any award so obtained. It is uhreasonable that they should secure the advantage of proceedings for which others have been responsible and financially obligated. There can be no more contemptible or more unworthy persons in any community than t,hose who remain outside an organization or union which is endeavouring to improve the standard of wages and conditions of employment in the industry or profession in which they are engaged, yet who are ready to avail themselves of every advantage which that organization or union secures. Such miserable individuals, unfortunately, do exist even in enlightened Australia, always anxious to secure selfadvancement at the expense of their fellow citizens, and without accepting corresponding obligations in such efforts. This regulation extends to non-unionists a consideration of which they are not deserving. We should recognise our obligation's and see that the conditions of those who carry out their duties and responsibilities in this connection are improved exclusively. This is the very basis of awards and decisions made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I have risen to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), and to intimate my distinct disapproval of the Government's intention in respect of this particular regulation. The honourable member made out a case which Ministers cannot fail to acknowledge the importanoe of, and should immediately recognise as urgent. Such proceedings by this alleged Arbitrator constitute an absolute scandal. They should deinand from the official in trusted with thei high and important duties of Public Service Arbitrator an explanation, and if unsatisfactory his recall, so that in future justice may be done to the Commonwealth employees who bring claims before such tribunals. U n t il they feel secure of that consideration for their claims which is justified, we shall not have' satisfaction in the Public Service, and dissatisfaction tends to inefficiency and is against the best interests of the community. that the Government will give immediate consideration to the statements of the honourable member for Bourke, and will also take note of my request that regulation 166 be disallowed, because it is not in accordance with the principles under which awards should be made. heartily approve of almost everything said by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) regarding the position of the public servants as affected by the awards of the Public Service Arbitrator. Tho conditions which apply to any grade of the Public Service, high or low, should be taken as the basis on which an award is given. In a case with which I was connected before the Arbitration Court of Western Australia, it was shewn that an Arbitrator ought not to take into consideration the ability of an employer t.o pay an award; that the sole question he has to decide is whether the services of the employees are worth what is asked for them, or whether the conditions which the employer wishes to impose on tihe employee are fair. The case to which I refer was that of the Northern Gold-fields against the employees of the various mining companies in that area. A f t e r we had put our views as forcibly as we could, Mr Justice Burnside said that the question he had to consider was whether a mine could pay what it was asked. Let me show honourable members how hardly that principle might apply. The Sons of Gwalia Mine was adjacent to the TowerH ill Mine, the division between them being an imaginary line drawn between two pegs, and while the firstnamed mine was paying good dividends, the second was in a hopeless state of in solvency. I contended, speaking for the unions, that the question to be considered was not whether the TowerH ill Mine was profitable, or whether the Sons cf Gwalia. Mine was profitable, but whether the men employed in those mines were rendering services worth the wages they asked for them.. Every one received a shock when the minutes of tbe award were made known. The Arbitrator declared that because the TowerH ill Mine was not paying, the men employed in it must work for low wages, but he gave no more than the minimum to those employed in the Sons of Gwalia Mine. .1 contend that in that award the Judge went beyond his province and did an inI hope justice to those connected with the Sons of Gwalia Mine. That mine was well managed and .was worked by men who took an interest in it , whereas the TowerH ill Mine was badly managed. The award put a tax on good management ^and industry.

All connected with a profitable concern, whatever their scale of pay, are in common employment. The Public ServiceA r b i trator has said to those appealing to him for higher wages, ""We-meanin g the Commonwealth-ar e unable to pay."" What had he to do with the finances of the Commonwealth? such a judgment he has usurped the position of a member of Parliament, and arrogated to himself a right that he does not possess, and that Parliament did not in tend him to have. It is apparent that wages men go down every time in connection with awards. The Arbitrator has not performed the functions w i th which Parliament intrusted him. If one buys goods from a certain firm which, on delivery, are not up to standard, a complaint is not made to another firm, but the firm that supplied the goods is asked why it did not deliver goods of the standard paid for. In this instance tihe goods that Australia has paid for are not being supplied by the Public Service Arbitrator. If an amendment of the Public ServiceA c t is needed, that is our picnic, not his.

79,Mr Hector Lamond (Illawarra ),"another Arbitrator declaring that, because it has come to his knowledge that there is certain legislation contemplated, he w ill refuse to adjudicate upon the cases brought before him. I am astonished that we should be able to find in Australia three men of legal training who should make so grave a mistake as to where the Judicial and Executive functions meet. Mr AtleeH u n t should be in no way concerned as to the proposed legislation in this Parliament. investigated the matter, or sought to in f o rm his mind upon it , he would find that of the Bills introduced into Parliament a very small proportion ever finds a place on the statute-book; and he would have found also that it is beyond the power of a Judge to say in what .' form any B ill that comes before this House may become an Act. To agree to the contention of Mr Justice Powers that because a Ministerial statement is made that the Government contemplate certain action, the Court is then to close it doors to all cases that may be affected by they become the law, is to my mind so absurd a proposition that I should entertain it . And while I think that MrH u n t has made a very grave mistake in refusing to give justice on the merits, as he is sworn to do, of the cases before h i m because of legislation pending before this Parliament, I consider that he is only fallin g into the error through following the precedent set by gentlemen of higher judicial attainments than himself, who ought to be exceedingly careful in following the examples they set in the Courts over which they preside. I am equally at variance with the contention of the Arbitrator that he is in any way the custodian of the finances of the Commonwealth. Let us look at the position the Minister put before us just now. He came almost to contend that the Arbitrator is bound to consider volved I have never, in this House or out of it . contended that the higher, officials should have their salaries cut down. I believe that one of the causes of inefficiency, when there is inefficiency in the Public Service, is that the higher officials are not paid sufficient for the skilled work they do. Buti t is repugnant to my sense of justice that a Court, set up for the purpose of dealing fairly with the different sections of the Public Service,.should declare that it will do justice to a small number of men when it means a cost of only a few pounds, and refuse to do justice to thousands, because to remedy their grievances w ill cost a large sum. I do not think any reasonably-minded man can approve of such a contention. TheI f he duty of the Arbitrator as set put in the Act is to do justice to all sections according to good conscience and equity-that is his job. that he has not done justice? his own assertion that w i th regard to a section of the Public Service, equity and good conscience demanded that they should receive more pay, and he refused it, because he presumed to judge of the ability of the Commonwealth to meet its just debts. I resent, as a libel, the statement that the Commonwealth is unable the suggested measures, should to pay its public servants properly for the work they do. We are continually resenting similar libellous statements pubmarvel that any judicial ""mind lished in the newspapers at the other end of the world ; but .here we have our own Commonwealth officer declaring that, while in his judgment certain sections of the Service 'are entitled to better pay and conditions, the Commonwealth is so poverty-stricken that it cannot afford to pay them. No more libellous statement has ever been published; and coming as it does fro m a quasi-judicial source, it is likely to have more weight with those who attach importance to statements affecting our finances. I should be the last to say that the Government should issue directions to any Judge, or any person exercising the functions of a Judge; but if a Judge publicly declares that he will not administer the law that this Parliament has made, there must be, somewhere in the Constitution, some power to direct him to do so. how much money is inmove a Judge. think that in either of the cases cited it is necessary to remove the Judge.

When the B ill for the creation of this Arbitration Court for the Public Service was before Parliament I gave it my most strenuous opposition. I maintained that there was already in existence a Conciliation and Arbitration Court to which an appeal could be made by the public servants in exactly the same way as by other employees in Australia. trator is a Crown servant, appointed by Public the circumstances, he cannot be other than a political Judge. justified my forecast when the measure was before us to create this Court. 1 Mr AtleeH u n t has done no more than intimate that the condition of the Treasury is such that it cannot pay the emoluments to which our public servants are entitled; and this is. an illustration of what I mean when I say that whoever occupies the position of Arbitrator must act in accordance with the ideas of the Government of the day. Otherwise, he would simply be a useless appanage. He cannot act in accordance with equity and good conscience, because he has to keep the Government position in mind, and this Mr AtleeH u n t has done. I do not know whether he asked the Treasurer for information as to the state of the publio finances, but if not, he evidently got the information somewhere, or he would not have acted in the way he did. There is before this Housef o r approval a regulation to the effect that public servants who are not members of organizations shall be regarded as in the same Position as are members of organizations. I cannot understand this proposed regulation, in view of the fact that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has in the past, on more than one occasion, declared that a man who does not belong to the organization of his calling, whether iu the Yet we are asked to pass a regula. organization as himself ? that? -cbeen. compelled to organize, but even the newspaper reporters have banded togetheri n order to liaise the status of their profession, and safeguard themselves for that period of life .when it is impossible to change one's vocation in order to improve one's position. It is remarkable to me TheA r b i that this Parliament, should be asked to give this pri%ilege to blacklegs and the Crown to adjudicate on scoundrels, persons who are too conService cases; and, under temptible to join with their fellow men for the'T welfare. Personally, I have been a nember of a union ever since I Events have was apprenticed at fourteen years of age, and when I became an employer I con-timied a member. Every industry and profession is now organized, and unionism is a -sound, solid principle making for the progress of the country. In the Public Service, under such a regulation aa that proposed, we may have one non-unionist working at the counter w i th five or six unionists, and that one man cannot expect to be treated with anything but contempt. A t any rate, I know that under such circumstances I should assist in putting him outside. I cannot conceive that there should be contentment in the Public Service under such a regulation, which is a contemptible proposal to submit to a National Parliament or any other body of men. As I ha.ve.&aid, Mr Atlee Hunt's appointment is based on the idea that he is a servant of the Crown. I can see no reason why the great expense involved in creating this Court should have been in curred ; there is not the slightest doubt that, as time goes on. this new institution will grow in both size and cost. There never will be peace and contentment in the Service until this new Court is abolished, and public servants l e f t free to appeal to the ordinary tribunals of the country.",31,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero

Public Arbitration Court to say what the country can afford. It is the duty of such Tribu nals to give judgment according to the evidence and regardless of the cost, unless, of course, the Arbitrator's position is political rather than judicial. If the evidence in the case of the F if t h Class clerks were submitted to the judgment of any ordinary citizen, he would admit that the Arbitrator's decision was not in accordance with the evidence.

The Government-and not the Arbitrator -shoul d decide what the country can afford to pay. There should be greater control of the Public Service by Parliament, but, little by little, that control is driftin g away from us. By many people the management of the Public 'Service isregarded as too big a matter to be dealt with by Parliament, but I do not consider that there is any question on earth too big for me to deal with. I suspect that the appointing of the Public ServiceA r b i trator was made from ulterior motives. able member is not in order in imputing motives. In any case his time has expired. do not know in what way the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) regards the Publio Service Arbitrator's Oourt as political. One of the principal ideas Parliament had in mind when it created that Tribunal was to make it free from political influence of any sort, and, therefore, we should be very careful of any action we take in regard to the issue that has been raised to-day. The reasons for the creation of the Court are perfectly well known to honourable members, and cannot have been forgotten by the honourable member for East Sydney. The, A r b i tration Court was very much congested, partly because of the number of applications from the Public Service, and in ordei to give th© public servants the justice tc which they are entitled, this special Tribunal was set up. The idea of Parliament was that if any of them were underpaid, their salaries or wages should be placed upon a proper basis, and if their, which classification was wrong, it should be It is not for the rectified. I regret that the Arbitrator haa Service Arbitrator or the adopted a certain attitude. A Judge who says in effect to any party who cornea before him, "" All the merits of the case are with yon, but I must proceed according to the logic of expediency,"" is acting as we do not desire or require the Public Service Arbitrator to act. No matter how dark the way may be, it is never so dark but that we can see the right thing to be done. We cannot in all cases see what is the expedient course to follow, but I do believe that in the long r u n the right course proves to be the expedient one, and if the public servants who applied to the Court had right on their side, the Arbitrator, by doing the right thing, would have done the expedient thing. It is notorious that many men in the F if t h Grade are underpaid for the work they are doing, and whilst that state of affair exists, we shall have dissatisfaction in the Service. When the Tribunal we appointed to settle the claims of the publio servants, while admitting that their claims are fair, declines on some other ground to grant them, dissatisfaction in the Service must increase. Whether or not the granting of the claims is justified by the financial position of .the country is a question of which the Arbitrator should not take cognisance. I admit that the Public Service Commissioner is perfectly justified in telling tihe Court what will be' the financial consequences of any increase in wages that may be granted; but if an increase is justified I do not think that, merely because it w ill involve an increased expenditure, this House desires that the Arbitrator should decide that it cannot be paid. As the honourable member for Hlawarra( Mr Hector Lamond) pointed out, the natural inference to be drawn from such a decision is very patent. An increase of emoluments in the lower grades of the Service, whicl include many thousands of employees will always involve a large amount ol money, wihereas in the higher grades, ir which fewer officers are employed, th<",32,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero

The Commonwealth, is always in . need of money, and, whilst we should be economical in our expenditure, true economy consists in the proper expenditure of money rather than the saving of it by improper means. Therefore, the economy cry, when directed against the payments to the Public Service, is very unfair. If the Arbitrator decides that a certain wage is fair this House has still the righ t any Judge, and the reasons as expressed to say that the country cannot afford it ; we can refuse to pass the Estimates, and until the money is voted it cannot ba paid. Thus, Parliament w ill always have a certain amount of review over the decisions of bhe Arbitrator. want from him an independent determination, free from political influence, of what is a fair rate of pay for the men in our employment. Parliament will be in a position to do its duty. The argument that the work of the Court cannot be done because of proposed legislation is dangerous. might be justified when the Arbitrator has been asked to reclassify the whole Service, at a time when he knows that a B ill before Parliament provides for the reclassification to be dealt w i th in another manner. those circumstances he might very well decide that it would be better for him to ©proceed with the more important work of assessing the rates of pay, and leave to the new authority to be created the duty of reclassification. But when the Arbitrator declares that he w ill not deal with questions of classification because of impending legislation, and that he cannot award increases of pay that are justified because the Commonwealth cannot afford the money, he throws aside the work that he is paid to do. I hope that the opinions of this House will be placed before the Arbitrator, so that he may know that we desire that the matters referred to h i m shall he finally settled, and justice done to the employees of the Commonwealth. desire to record briefly my views on this question, which was raised so admirably and eloquently by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey). The well-considered case which the honourable member made out, evidently as the result of very careful study of the declarations by the Arbitrator, merited a more complete reply than it received from the representative of the Government. I propose to direct my few observations to one or two matters of principle. The first of these is the right, which the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) seemed to challenge, that undoubtedly rests in every honourable member to bring before the House the decision given by any Arbitrator or, for that matter,by by him, for that decision. That is not only our undoubted right, but is clearly a duty. Judges-and the gentleman whose work is now under consideration is largely in the position of a E u t we do Judge-shoul d not be lightly or captiously criticised. Personal animadversions should not be passed upon them in a spirit of pique arising from the fact that their Having got that, decisions are against one's interests or anything of that kind. But wliere a Judge is considered to be acting upon wrong principles there rests upon honorIt able members the very serious duty of bringing that matter before the House for consideration and discussion in the confident hope that such a condition will be cured. I take this opportunity to point out that, as I mentioned once before, we In have in the dissatisfaction w it h the decisions of tlie Public Service Arbitrator the consequences which honourable members of the Labour party foresaw when the position was created. We were against the creation of this office. We were opposed to depriving members of the Public Service of. the right of access to the Tribunals which were created for the use of the public generally. Just as we were bitterly opposed to an old A ct of Parliament which segregated members of the Public Service, making them a class apart, with representation, of their own in Parliament, so we were against this attempt, on the part of the Government to segregate the Public Service and to deprive it of the right to approach judicial Tribunals on an equal footing* with others. I do not go the length of saying .that this Arbitrator, necessarily, has -any political leanings, or that he is biased against one class or one party in cases that are heard before him. I do not accuse him, at all events, of any intentional bias, but I say,",33,Lamond The Y Did Not Presides I T Will Not Impinge On His Prero

The present Arbitrator was at the head of a large Department of the Public Service member know that this House once refused to give h i m an increase of salary? been rightly on wrongly done"". I point out that he was for many years a member, of the Public Service, and that he has grown up as a Public Service disciplinarian and manager. Those of us who are acquainted with the ways of the Publio Service know that heads of Departments very often, if not always, w in their positions of prominence by strict economy and the exercise of discipline over their subordinates. Whilei t is feasible that an. officer of the Public Service may prove a satisfactory Judge Judge,-one Judge is one who enjoys the confidence of all sections of the community. If the honourable member will examine the personnel of the various Courts of this country he will find that by far the greater number, if not all our Judges, are in that sense satisfactory. be diverted from the point that I was seeking to make-that a gentleman who id taken from the Public Servioe-wh o has risen up in the Service-is peculiarly unsuited to act as a Judge over the Public Service. That is one of the weaknesses iri whose work is now under' consideration. it is no part of the Arbitrator's business to consider the means of the Commonwealth to pay. It is the right of contestants in arbitration proceedings, to consider the power of an industry to pay a wage; but the principle has always been laid down that an industiy which cannot pay a living wage has no right toexist, and that as between the right to live and the right to carry on an industry, the pre-eminent right is the right of decent conditions. It is quite evident that the Arbitrator here has' not adopted that principle. No one deniesand the Arbitrator himself would have no right to deny-the power of the Commonwealth to pay a fair wage. Having declared that these men were entitled to a certain wage on the merits of their claims, his statement that he had to apply the logic of expediency to their case and honourable that they should, therefore, be paid something less than they were entitled to receive, constitutes on the face of it a very T h a t may have grave departure from his public duty. The other point which the honourable member for Bourke made deserves a very serious answer, and, I hope, will have it from the Arbitrator himself. I refer to the statement made by the honourable member that, in dealing with men in very large numbers, the Arbitrator said, in effect, "" Y o u r claim is sound on the merits, but we cannot grant it because of the numbers affected and the hundreds of thousands of pounds that would consequently be involved in giving effect to your claim. We can, however, grant the claim of those who are few in number, is a satisfactory because, in the aggregate, the amount to who) pleases both sides 1 be paid is so much less."" It is only to matters of principle that I wish,to address myself,.and not to any personal attack upon the Arbitrator, especially as I have not carefully read the judgments which have been brought under our notice to-day. I make that admission quite frankly. I have addressed myself to this question in the light of the I do not wish, however, to deliberate expressions of principle to which the Judge has undoubtedly given utterance, and I say that the honoraSble member for Bourke has been well justified in bringing this matter before the House. His case, primd facie, at all events, is a strong one, and is deserving connection with the Arbitrator of a f a r more serious reply than has been made by the Minister this morning. It has been suggested that think the ""honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), who brought this matter a Judge, as between private before the House, is entitled to have his case considered both by honourable members and by the Public Service Arbitrator.. On the whole, I do not think any exception' can be taken to the manner in which he set it out. He is of the opinion that the Arbitrator ( Mr AtleeH u n t ) has not been consistent-that he has failed to deal with the claims of the lower paid servants, while he has undertaken the individual to live under to grant increases to a numerically small ( number of officers in the Service who are receiving from £600 to £800 per annum.

As the result of advantages of exchange, Mr Mackinnon, his wife, and daughter, were able to live at first class hotels, equal to the best in Australia, for 7s. a day. They travelled 300 miles, first -class, on the railways for 9s. each. That shows that the value of the mark in Germany itself has not depreciated in anything like the same ratio that it has depreciated for the purposes of international exchange. hotel keepers of Germany are contented with reasonable prices. strates, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the value of the mark in Germany has not depreciated to anything, like the extent, or in the same ratio, that its value in international exchange has depreciated. I do not think that any one w ill worry about that. exchange dumping duty is based on the theory that the depreciation within the country is not the same as the depreciation affecting international exchange, and, consequently, that the people manufacturing in countries with a depreciated currency have an undue advantage. The following letter was'received from a gentleman well known throughout Australia, and eminently fitted to express an opinion on this subject, D r . Wunderlich, who writes:A startling instance of thc way in which a debased circulation will retain its nominal value in its own country is seen in the case of* newspapers. In Switzerland the local paper costs 10 or 15 ceiitimes, and the French edition of the Daily Mail is 33 centimes. The Berlin nioriiing paper is 30'pfennig, whilst the Hail is 5 marks. Allowing for freight and distribution, the foreign paper in Switzerland is about the same value as thc local paper; but in Germany its value is ten to fifteen times higher. A similar thing is seen in the case of foodstuffs. Wines which formerly would have had approximately the same value in Germany and in Switzerland are still sold in the latter country at about 5s. a bottle, while in Germany, at the present rate of exchange, they would, even in the best hotels, cost only Is. 0d.; and if such discrepancies exist on the big lines of traffic, Iiow must it be in the more remote parts of the country? Austrian beer costs 11 kronen: and when I state that I casually changed a Swiss5 franc note ancl received 1,720 kronen for it, it follows that I could have obtained 120 pots of beer for less than 5s. The swaggic's ideal universe would thus have been reached, and he would no longer have occasion for a tapthe .beer would flow all the time. to show that Germauy very nearly won the war. in that contention, from the commercial point of view. The facts of the case are beyond question. .We know that in Germany there are, for all practical purposes, no unemployed. Her factories are working night and. day, and she is in a position to put her goods on the markets of the world at .prices which other countries are unable to look at. There seems to be no doubt whatever that this arises very largely, indeed, from her peculiar position in regard to international exchange. There is. hardly a country in the world now that is not trying by some means or other to grapple with this situation, and to prevent countries w it h a depreciated exchange from practically, swamping their industries. B ill will enable us to do so? go a long way in that direction. Every country is trying by some means or other to grapple with this question. Canada has adopted a method which, .when we weire discussing this matter previously on the occasion on which I introduced these resolutions, I ventured to suggest, would lead to the complete cessation of trade between Germany and the Dominion. Canada's law permits the recognition of the depreciation of currency to the extent of 50 per cent. only. That means that for the purpose of ascertaining the duty on goods coming from Germany, the invoice value is converted into marks, and the value of the mark is assessed at 6d. for duty purposes instead of something less than ^ d . , which is the actual value of .the mark to-day. £ have not had official information on the subject, but I have been informed by people who know what the true position is that the result of the operation of the Canadian law has led to a complete cessation of trade between Germany and Canada; that is to 6ay, German goods are not going into Canada under the operation of the A pint of excellent law. America is adopting a different method, which, I think, it will find extremely difficult to operate.

One difficulty in this connection is that the extent to which Germany can take advantage of the depreciation in the exchange to place her goods on the foreign market at a low figure is not known. It may be a profitable thing for Germany to use a great deal more than she actually does, the advantage she derives from the depreciated condition of the exchanges in selling her goods on the markets of the world, and one hesitates, therefore, to declare whether or not the schedule to this B ill will prove sufficient; but generally speaking, I think, it w ill .

There are two other paragraphs to which I wish to refer. Chanter) -The paragraphs may be interrelated, but the Committee has already declined to allow other than one paragraph at a -)time to be taken into consiv deration. is as difficult and thorny a subject as one can get in touch with . I was 1 concerned with a eimilar question ou a former occasion, and in view of the action I uhen took, I am very interested in the present proposal, and, if I am to be conIt sistent, must support the Minister's proposal and should be perfectly agreeable to something being done in the direction he has suggested. On the previous occasion the question was in regard to exchanges. The Customs authorities in Australia' took up the attitude that the depreciation of exchange did not affect the cost of production in the country of origin, and that, consequently, it was perfectly fair to continue charging duties on the mint par rate of exchange. I suggested at the time that when the exchange of a country depreciated inevitably some part of the depreciation was reflected in an increased cost of producing I the goods in that country. Mr .GBEENE -To some part of that contention I have already agreed. agreed toi make an alteration from the mint par rate of exchange to the commercial rate of exchange, but there is the further difficulty that the depreciation may go on at such a*paci n one country that there is no possible relation between the depreciation of exchange, and the increase in' the cost of production in that country. We have had an example in the case of Germany, where, since August last, the rate of exchange has fallen from about 300 marks to 1,Q0G marks to the sovereign. It 'is impossible for a depreciation of that character within two months to find its 1 reflection in the cost of production in the country. It ia perfectly obvious that a hopelessly artificial position has arisen, I and the facts whioh we have heard in regard to Mr Donald McKinnon's trip , and as to how f a r a .sovereign. will go in Germany, are what inevitably happens in such circumstances. There are certain points which are perfectly obvious, but I will only stress one, that is, that where the exchange has depreciated steadily and quietly over a certain period, and is (Hon. J. M . probably the result of the actual position of the country, being in no sense due to panic in regard to the stability, or otherwise, of the nation, it is found, sooner or later, that the depreciation' of the exchange is reflected in the cost of the",37,Preservation Bill

It a ly and France? and France later on. The point I took on a previous occasion was that the depreciation in those countries, w i th which I was particularly concerned, and which, to my mind, were not getting reasonably fair treatment from Australia, had been fairly steady, and was, so f a r as I could judge, to a great extent reflected in the cost of production. Having taken that view, I said that I was quite clear that these countries were having to pay more to produce, and were not getting a fictitious benefit of any material moment from the exchanges. There is nothing in this B ill to injure the attitude I took up on that occasion, because no penalty is to be imposed on any country unless it can be shown that the exchange position is not production in the country itself, and that it is thereby"" deriving an advantage over other countries. No one could have any complaint against that. view-point on the previous occasion, was that we were taking no notice whatever of this depreciation, and not admitting that any part of it went into increasing the cost of the production of goods in the country under review. Take the case of Germany. The position cannot actually be stated as a fact. It can only be set out on calculations based on what are called statistics. There are three ways of lying, one by affirmation, one by negation, and the other by statistics. . Personally, I tbink statistics win easily. However, these facts are worth putting before the Committee as constituting the best basis that could be arrived at. In August of the present year, it was calculated that the wholesale price in seventy trades in Germany had increased to sixteen times the pre-war cost of production. Taking 100 as the pre-war figure, it was, in August of this year, calculated for seventy industries to be 1,628. you consider it , it was sixteen times the [554] Whilei t pre-war cost. As against that, rather curiously, the exchange position was exactly the same. The rate of exchange in August was about 320, so that it had also increased sixteen times. Taking these facts, it means that Germany has an advantage, for while in Great Britain the cost of production had increased from 100 to 180 it was exactly the same in GermanyI shall deal w it h Italy as it was before the war. That is to say, the increase in the cost of production had gone up sixteen times, and so had the rate of exchange to the same extent. These two factors, therefore, bring one back to the starting point, that in Germany they can produce at the exact pre-war figure, while Great Britain's cost of production is 80 per cent, above it . That is an obvious advantage to Germany. Now the German exchange is in the region of 1,000, indeed, I think it has been over 1,100. That simply means that the whole position is artificial, and certainly no duty on the basis that GreatB r it a in has dealt with the matter w ill have the slightest effect while that position prevails."" But the position cannot prevail indefinitely, because, to-day, while the being reflected in the cost of wholesale price is calculated at sixteen times, wages are only eight times the pre-war rate. That means, broadly speaking, that the German workman, My with all the talk of his prosperity, is just a'bout half as well off as he was when the war started. All these figures are very mysterious and difficult to follow. The cost of living is about eleven time3 the pre-war rate, taking the standard goods into consideration-that is 1,100 as against 100. But then the wholesale price is sixteen; and how eomes that mysterious difference? We can only suggest that the difference creeps in throtigh the adverse rate of exchange, affecting purchases of raw material. Though the figures are hopelessly confused, they establish two facts. One fact is that the cost of production does increase in the country if there is a depreciated .exchange, and the second, that this depreciation has no relation to the actual cost of production when there is a very rapid and very steep decline in the basis of exchange. So far as Germany is concerned, it seems beyond question that she is in a position to put goods into any country where the exchange is against her, on a better basis It dees not matter how than can the local manufacturs?.",38,Preservation Bill

That protection may be nitude, for the reason that the cost of production has risen with the depreciation of the exchange. If , by any chance, German exchange is going to stay down in the region of 1,000, it is inevitable that in the country itself the cost of prosame ratio as its exchange has depreciated. duction will have to increase. It cannot be held where it is unless there is an appreciation of the value of the mark. This is going to hit Germany sooner or later.. There is also the fact that the position cannot go on indefinitely. There may be an advantage for a certain time, but it is inevitable that, in the end, the diffithods of production another method of culty of meeting the position, and the internal obligations must be faced. The Germans have to run their country and pay the war indemnity in some shape or form. Taxation must be increased, and the whole position must eventually work back against Germany. Wheni n England, I took great trouble to discuss the question of exchange, particularly in relation to Germany, in an effort to get a clear vision of what it means. I talked to bankers, economists, and business men, and the impression left on my mind wheu I had finished was that the whole of them were absolutely fogged, and could not say what was going to happen. are all agreed that there is a dual value of the mark. have maintained that all along; there must be where there is rapid depreciation. But to come back to the actual proposal before us. As I see the position, there is no objection to trying the proposal, and seeing if it will have any effect. So far as countries are concerned where the depreciation is a reasonable one, I think that the more legislation of this character that goes on the statute-books of the world, the more difficult it will be to readjust exchanges, and get the peoples of the world to trade with one another on a basis satisfactory to all. But the exchanges of Germany present an impossible position, and a proposal of the kind presents a possibility of doing something. Personally, I think that these penalties, certainly in the case of France until the necessary. That is, however, for the Committee to decide. We have recently The passed a Tariff to give certain protection undermined by the exchanges. We have to bear in mind that this proposal will not come into operation unless we can establish that the country is going to get an advantage from the fact that its cost of production has not increased in the I think the Minister( Mr Greene) will agree with me. the matter to the Committee in this way. undermining the Tariff? do with exchanges. tack. ther resolution to deal with that matter; at present we are dealing with exchanges. For myself, I do not like much this proposal, and I admit the fact frankly; but I do say that, having passed the Tariff, we have to take some action. I think that the Minister's method of dealing with the matter is better thought out than that of anybody else who has tried his hand. The Minister's method has a more logical basis for its operation. If we feel that there is a danger notwithstanding the Tariff that our industries may be undermined through the exchanges, the Minister's is the best way in which we can attain what is now attempted. For my part, I do not propose to vote against the proposal. I do not like it, I admit; but I do not think that anything we may do will stop the re<«ta.blishment of a proper basis of exchange between all countries. I do not believe that the volume of trade we are going to deal with is of such a character that it is really going to imperil -the stabilizing of the world's exchanges.

The resolution saysIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods has depreciated and that by reason of such depreciation goods have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry. The following are the words I should like to amend : at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry. We may have all the confidence in the world in the Tariff Board and the Minister, but this resolution leaves them with no indication of what we mean; it merely says that if they take the view tliat goods are being sold at a price detrimental to Australian industries they may impose the heavy penalty duty. We might have a Board, the members of which have slightly run mad on the idea of Protection, and there might be an industry in Australia in which the cost of production was five times what it ought to be. But if somebody was producing goods at three times the cost in another country, the Board could say that the importation of those goods was detrimental to an Australian industry. On the other hand, we might have a Board of members with Free Trade tendencies, and it would be left to them to decide, no matter what the case was, that no trading was detrimental to an Australian industry. It seems to me that we must get much closer to facts, and give the Board some basis, such as the cost of production of similar goods in Great Britain. price of production here: and the suggestion I have made, if carried out, would, I think, cover the whole position, because there are very few goods which come into competition with goods produced in Australia, that are not also produced in Great Britain. of a reasonably fair price, enabling the Board to see whether Australian goods were being under-sold through depreciation. understand it , we have given Protection of certain percentages to Australian industry; but if that is not enough, and people by legitimate methods can produce cheaper elsewhere, they are entitled to [554]2 come in here. The suggestion I have made would not, I think, do the slightest harm, and would make the resolution more explicit and easier of administration. I have tried to make clear what my view is. The whole subject is a very dangerous one. I do not quite see what is going to happen under this legislation with regard to German exchanges now, because they w ill have to come back to 240, or we get no more than 75 per cent. However, that is a point w i th which the Minister w ill perhaps deal. But having regard to the fact that we have a T a r if f under which we have undertaken to protect our own manfacturers in a certain way, and that there is certainly a possib i l it y of our goods being under-sold by unfair means, through the exchange position where it is unduly depreciated, I am quite prepared to support the resolution provided that there is a definition of the basis on which the cost of these goods is to be calculated, in order to discover whether they are coming in at an unduly low figure. Honourable memhers are exceedingly desirous that goods manufactured in Australia shall not be exposed to any form of undue competition, whether that for m referred to in an earlier paragraph, or in the portion that is now immediately composed under consideration. The only object we have is to ascertain what is necessary to give adequate protection to Australian industries, and what is fair as between manufacturers and consumers in this country. We have had several debates on the depreciated exchanges of the various European countries, and the legislation necessary to meet the difficulties that The Board could not take .the have resulted. It has become apparent to all who have followed the debates that there is very littl e danger of goods being dumped* in this country at low prices 1 owing to the depreciation 'of the exchanges of France and Belgium. As has been frequently pointed out, and conThis would give the basis firmed to-day by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), immediately the currency of a country commences to depreciate there is set in operation a comUnder the Tariff, as I pensating factor by means of whioh the cost of manufacturing in that country rapidly adjusts itself to such depreciation of currency.

129,"Mr Jowett (Grampians) [3.14],","greater amounts of their own currency tends to bring about a perfectly natural and fairly rapid increase in the cost of production, as measured in the currency of that country, raw material is in the country and has not to be imported ? raw material becomes more costly to produce, and the cost of manufacturing also increases. Therefore, it must be quite apparent-to the Committee that so far as France and Belgium are concerned there is little to fear regarding the effect of the depreciated currencies of those countries, and for all practical purposes this clause is an unnecessary precaution against them. There is no doubt, however, that the position as regards Germany is very serious indeed. The mark fluctuated from 262 to the .£1 sterling on 8th July last to 1,100 to the £ 1 a little time ago, and it haa now recovered to 920. It must be obvious from this that for a considerable time the manufacturers in that country have enjoyed a great advantage in being able to produce and export at low prices as measured in the currency of this country. made out in favour of this proposed legislation as regards imports from Germany, and possibly some other countries in which the currency has depreciated very considerably, even during the last six months. We desire to arrive at a fair means of protecting our industries from the effects of these depreciated exchanges, and I think the Minister( Mr Greene), in his opening remarks this afternoon, provided the solution. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that the words in paragraph E "" are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry "" are open to a very wide and variable construction. But the Minister stated that "" the exchange anti-dumping duty will only apply to those goods which enter into unfair competition with Australian products."" If the words "" at prices which will be detrimental to an Australian industry "" were deleted and something to the same effect as the Minister's statement were inserted, I think everybody would be perfectly satisfied, a-d I , at any rate, would offer not the slightest opposition to this proposal. Failing that, I would be satisfied if it were clearly understood by the Oommittee, and; therefore, by the Board, that this duty should apply only to those goods that-enter into unfair competition with Australian industries. for Trade and Customs) [3.22] I have followed with a good deal of interest the remarks of the honourable members for Flinders( Mr Bruce) and Grampians ( Mr Jowett). One would be a fool to contend, and I have never done so, that the depreciation of exchange against a country was caused solely by the depreciation of that country's currency. WhatI have always contended is that the depreciation of the currency, which necessarily is reflected in the cost of production, is 'one of the causes which lead to the depreciation of the exchange. The extent to which the currency is depreciated must necessarily be reflected in the added cost of production in that country. But the difficulty is to determine the exact amount of that depreciation and the effect it has on the international exchange position. There are other factors which produce depreciation of exchange, and one has only to point to the rapid fluctuations Therefore, a strong case can be that take place in international exchanges to see that the depreciation of the currency is not keeping pace with the movements of exchange. If one were the exact measure of the other, as some economists contend, it would be necessary to get an internal improvement of the currency before there could be any improvement of the international, exchange, and a corresponding depreciation of the currency would follow every time the exchange turned against a country. To my mind, there is a very marked difference between the depreciation of currency and the depreciation of exchange. The one is not the measure of the other, although one is a very big factor in producing the other. fluencing one another. movements of international exchange have any effect upon the currency, but a depreciation of currency must have an effect upon the international exchange. The honourable member for Flinders asked a question as to the stage at which this duty would be applied in the interpretation of the words ""which will be detrimental to an Australian industry.""",41,Preservation Bill

We do not concern ourselves with goods that are dumped into Australia and do not result in detriment to an Australian industry. tage to get them. goods with which we are concerned are those which are imported at prices which, from their very nature, create unfair competition, and thereby result in detriment to an Australian industry. I refer honourable members to the anti-dumping legislation of other countries. The New Zealand Act reads:If such concession will, in the opinion of the Minister, have an effect prejudicial or injurious to any industry or business established or carried on in Kew Zealand The American law includes these termsWlhenever the Secretary to the Treasurer, hereinafter called the Secretary, after such investigations as he deems necessary, finds that an industry in' the United States is being or is position in regard to quite a number of likely to be injured or is prevented from being established All through this class of legislation similar language is employed. The honourable member for Dampier has suggested that we might incorporate in this proposal the words "" below a reasonable price as ascertained under paragraph B "" ; but the honourable member will see that that paragraph refers to the cost of production in the country of origin. That is the very thing which we are trying to avoid in this paragraph. It relates to a country which, by virtue of its depreciated' international exchange, can, and does, produce goods at a very low cost; but if we take the cost of production as the standard by which we are to judge whether or not this dumping duty is to be imposed, it will not be imposed at all. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) has suggested as a basis the cost at which similar goods are produced in Britain. We know that the manufacturers of Great Britain are importing very many goods from Germany and Belgium. For instance, iron and steel is being imported very largely because, owing to the international exchange position, British manufacturers can buy those goods very much more cheaply than they can produce them. those goods on the list? British manufacturers closed down most of their blast furnaces-ther e are hardly any blast furnaces working in Englandbut they are importing blooms, rods, bars, &o, and using them in their manufactures, so that they are able to produce these goods at a very much cheaper rate than, would be possible if they used their own material. member think that it would be a good thing for us to do what the Mother Country does? because the Mother Country is doing that sort of thing, it necessarily follows that we should. member's argument apply to the use of the words "" cost of production "" in paragraph B. see my way out of that difficulty. The things is that which I have just stated, and I am afraid that if we decided to judge by such a standard the prices at which the goods were sold in Australia, we should not achieve our object. For these reasons, looking at the whole matter by and large, I do not think it is possible to set up a standard, below which we oould say the cost must fall, before the duty should operate. It seems to me that, in matters of this kind, we must assume that those charged with the administration of the Act will administer it equitably, and endeavour to give",42,Preservation Bill

It is very difficult. aside from everything that is difficult in this world, we should accomplish nothing. WhilstI do not for one moment contend that this in itself is a perfect way of dealing w it h the matterI do not feel altogethersatisfied that it is a perfect way of dealing w it h a difficulty that we can see and sense better than we can understand man has been steering to every point of the compass in this proposal. to throw around Australia a mantle that will protect her from rough and stormy industrial weather. the peculiar set of circumstances with which we are trying to' deal, I think that we cannot get any better test than that whioh we have laid down in the B ill itself. It has been suggested that it may be that an Australian industry is struggling along, and charging for its goods three or four times more than they ought to cost. In reply to that, I would say that we have the best possible guarantee that no such Australian industry exists since, in the schedule of duties, there is no item which provides for a duty that would allow anything approaching that sort of thing to be done. If an Australian industry, owing to its inefficiency and in eptitude, was charging three or four times more for its goods than the price at which it should be able to tur n them out, if it were efficient, is it not reasonable to suppose that its output would i m mediately come into competition w i th goods from all parts of the world, and that it would not be able to carry on? Isi t not a fact that every Australian industry to-day has to compete with the products of other parts of the world; subject only to such protection as we have given them uncier our Tariff? that the Tariff does not protect. we do not protect and some to which we have given a very high measure of protection. I would remind the honourable member, who has always the wheat farmer in mind, that under the Tariff we have just passed many Australian primary in terests are given the highest protection. honourable member refer ? prunes, apples, onions, maize, tobacco, and quite a number of other lines. I do not wish, however, to open up a general debate on the Tariff. All that I want to suggest to honourable members is that the supposititious case which the honourable member for f l in d e r s ( Mr. Bruce) has referred to-the case of an Australian manufacturer who, owing to inefficiency, may be charging three or four times too much for his goods-can not as a matter of fact exist. Australian industries have to compete with those of the world at large, subject only to such protection as we give them under the Tariff. Consequently if this question Having regard to arose in respect of any particular class of goods those charged with the administration of the Act would need to have regard to the conditions under which the local industry had been carried on in competition with the world. They would have then to determine whether the goods coming in from countries with a depreciated exchange created, of themselves, a competition which was unfair and something greater than the competition which the rest of the world brought to bear. These are matters which they would have to determine for themselves. Then, with all these facts before them, they would have to say whether, in the circumstances, the prices being charged for the goods were detrimental to an Australian industry. If a i l to see that it would be possible to get away from that position. I do not think that we could set up any satisfactory standard by which to determine whether the particular duties as set out in the schedule should or should not be applied. not altogether agree with the views which have been expressed by the Minister( Mr. Greene). As I said when speaking earlier in the debate, I cannot accept, without any limitation, the words "" which will be detrimental to an Australian industry,"" as set out in this paragraph. They are far too wide. My suggestion is that we should insert the words "" are below the cost of production of similar goods i u",43,Preservation Bill

I come now to the other point which has been raised, as to the standard of measurement. suggested standard of measurement would be of no avail, because material is being imported into Great Britain from countries with depreciated exchanges, and being worked up into the goods, so that the cost of production of these goods in Great Britain would not be the proper measure.

Several attempts have been made to secure greater powers for this Parliament by an amendment of the Constitution, but so far they have been unsuccessful. It is a very difficult matter to secure an amendment of the Constitution, because it is necessary not only to get a majority of the people of the Commonwealth in favour of any alteration to the Constitution, but also to get the approval of a majority of the States. However, the fact that we have not hitherto succeeded in getting the people to approve of any alteration to the Constitution in order to give the Federal Parliament greater powers is no reason why, at the present stage, we should depart from the constitutional method of submitting such questions to the people at a general election: I believe the people have become educated to the necessity for amending the Constitution. it. next appeal to the people will be successful. ful if it is made in the right way.

Ib provides for a Convention of 111 representatives. liament is to have the privilege of appointing eighteen delegates, twelve from this House and six from the Senate. The State Parliaments will also appoint eighteen .delegates, three from each State. There will also be seventy-five delegates elected in the Federal electoral divisions, which means that there can be no escape from a fight on the part of each honourable member in this House. Every honourable member, whether he desires to attend the Convention or not, w i ll be compelled to fight an election; otherwise he will be placed at a considerable disadvantage when the next general election takes place.

In the event of the Federal member winning-and I do not think certainly have that there can be any doubt as to what will happen in the great majority of cases -the seventy-five elected delegates to the Federal Convention will largely consist of honourable members who are now sitting in this House.

That isConvention's recommendation as submitted to this Parliament will assuredly reflect fhe opinions of honourable members sitting here at the present moment. This Parliament will then, in turn, consider what has been recommended by the Convention body of men? same body of men will reconsider the decision solemnly arrived at by them sitting as a Convention, at Canberra, or somewhere else. . If we can justify spending £200,000 for a purpose like that, we can justify anything. The position would be different if it could be shown that something would be gained by holding a Convention, if it could be shown that such a gathering would lead us anywhere, or give satisfaction to the States. I venture to say, however, that no State Parliament which is opposed to the giving of greater powers to the Commonwealth Parliament will be satisfied with the proposed Convention. It will contend that it is a Federal body which has been forced on the States, and when the final appeal is made to the electors it will fight fight for its recommendations in the constrenuously against any recommendation that may be submitted. could put no better weapon in the hands of the States to defeat our proposals than by agreeing to the Prime Minister's proposals. It is idle to say that, because the States have eighteen representatives in the proposed Convention, they will be satisfied. They will not be satisfied in any case. Therefore, the Convention will be a most unsatisfactory method of dealing with the-question if it is, as the Prime Minister says it ought to be, elected. He says that he is prepared to drop everything in the Bill, lock, stock and barrel, with the exception, of the provision that the Convention must be elected by adult suffrage.

Those who are concerned with the interests of the States would complain bitterly if this Parliament decided to elect the Convention, but I would have no objection to taking that course if it were necessary, although I agree with the Prime Minister that the more democratic way of dealing with a matter of this kind is to have the representatives to the Convention elected by the people. However, in view of tihe fact that if this were done it would really mean an election for the Federal Parliament, and that the body elected, which would be for all practical purposes the Federal Parliament, would have to make recommendations to itself, and, later on, stituencies, I do not see why we should In fact, we not decide straight away to deal with the amendments to the Constitution in the way we have hitherto done, that is, to send the proposals to the people at a general election, and fight them out in the constituencies. It would certainly save the country £200,000, plus any amount that would need to be paid to the delegates to the Convention. The Prime Minister has already stated that he does not expect the delegates to act without some emolument, and that it is a fair thing that they should at least have their expenses paid. In these circumstances, the expenses of the delegates would be saved in addition to the £200,000 which it would cost to hold an election, without taking into account the cost of the necessary machinery for the conduct of, and reporting of the Convention debates, and so forth. ister has calculated all that in his estimate?

Even Federation was delayed for a score of years by reason of certain vested interests that existed in the various State Parliaments; and, even when the union was accomplished, It the anti-national interests were able to secure .compromises which, at the present time, are interfering with the national development, and which would have completely spragged Australia's effort during the war, but .for the practical abrogation of the Constitution by means of the War Precautions Act. But now, when an opportunity of reforming the Constitution is presented, we find the Opposition in this House opposed to it. Even the Prime Minister, who on many occasions has ranged himself with the people who desire reform, has allowed himself to he led away from his intention, and has brought down a Bill which, in its present form, is condemned to death.

Financial statistics show that all the Australian Governments are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet, and at the same time many activities are duplicated by the State and Federal authorities. The ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) said in his Budget speechThe economy that counts can host be obtained by a revie.w and re-adjustment of Federal and State functions. Overlapping, misunderstanding, and want of co-ordination lead to much waste and lack of efficiency. Two sets of taxing authorities with two staffs and establishments is a Gilbertian proceeding. Similarly, two sets of electoral officials for the same people is absurd. Two kinds of debt management in one market for one people and seven competing borrowers is disastrous.

Apparently the most vital policy at the present time, that of increasing our population by means of immigration, is to be conducted on a gentleman's agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, but about it there is no certainty, because one Government cannot bind any other by the arrangement it makes, and no effort is being made to overcome the duplication and friction which exist in various Federal and State activities. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. An even Greene) said in the course of an article about a fortnigh t agoI have every desire to see the new State movement successful, provided it is accompanied by that measure of constitutional reform which I think is necessary in the interests of the nation. In view of these statements I cannot understand why, if the Ministry are honest in their desire to have constitutional reform, they should have introduced such a B ill as that which is before the Chamber at the present time.

I should like, first of all, to examine the defects in this B ill with"" a view to suggesting amendments which may help to insure its passage, at any rate, through this House, although I fear that its passage through another place would be a stormy one. I expressed that view recently elsewhere, and my statement was called into question. The first thing that strikes one on examining this B ill is that it ignores the Pederal principle of equality of State representation. I agree absolutely .with those State Premiers who, in addressing themselves to the question of the necessity for a Federal Convention, have urged that since it may have to discuss changes affecting the Constitution, it should be similar in composition, and in the proportion of its membership, to the original Convention that drew up the Constitution B ill . We shall not be able to secure the support of the people to suoh changes as not only the Prime Minister, but other honourable members, and, indeed, the great mass of I the community desire, unless we have a Convention which in its composition has regard to the Federal principle of equality of State representation. The Convention is to be, not a governing, but simply a deliberative, body. If its decisions were to become immediately the law of the land there might be some excuse for ignoring the Federal spirit in regard to the had no equality of 'State representation. The he Prime Minister, however, prpposes, in this B ill , that the recommendations of the Convention shall be submitted to this Parliament, which is elected on the basis of adult suffrage, and that very fact, from m y point of view, renders it unnecessary to insist on the Convention being elected on the basis of adult suffrage throughout the Commonwealth. ber in favour of the equal representation of the States? be our endeavour to secure such proposed amendments of the Constitution as w ill have a reasonable ohance of being carried by a majority of the people in a majority I shall put beof the States.

That is a matter which gives me more concern than does any question as to the reduction or extension of the Federal authority. Dealing with this question of equality of representation of the States at the proposed Convention, I would remind honourable members that proposed amendments of the Constitution that have hitherto been submitted to the people have met w it h serious opposition in some of the very basis of the smaller States, which havo voted against tliem.

We have in the Bill a very remarkable provision as to the way in which nominees shall be chosen.

Before doing so, however, I should like to stress the point made by the Prime Minister as to the necessity That, necessarily, for holding a Convention at the present time. I propose to show later on what should be done to insure an equitable means of representation. I agree with the Prime Minister that a time limit should be imposed, and that the Convention should be required to report within a certain period. Every honourable member, I think, will* agree that some alteration of the Constitution is necessary. We all admit that invaluable work was .done by the framers of the Constitution. We recognise that they devoted to their work much care and study; but the fact remains that, within two or three years of the consummation of Federation, even many of those who,had taken part in the framing of the Constitution admitted that, in actual practice, it was creaking in many places and needed amendment. Quite early in the history of Federation the the honourable fact that it was necessary to hold every year a Premiers' Conference suggested that we had not attained that which we had hoped to secure-on e nation, one flag, one destiny-and that there were many features of the Federal instrument that needed revision before this could be regarded as a really National Parliament. In 1908, Mr Deakin, who at the'time was Prime Minister' of the Commonwealth, was asked by South African, statesmen, who at the time were engaged in working out a Constitution for the South African Union, in what respect he thought they could improve on the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

Change is a proof of life. An organization that is not changing is practically dead. All Federations have found changes to be inevitable. No original instrument of Federal government has remained unaltered. Every Federation has applied its experience to the amendment of its Constitution for the more satisfactory performance of its functions. Canada, when it federated, had the Durham report to work on and its experience of its working, and the United States of America, in drawing up its Constitution, had the experience during the War of Independence, gained during the loose federation of the States between 1776 and 1789. Y e t fifteen amendments have been made in the American Constitution, many of them f a r reaching. The dispute about State as opposed to Federal rights had to be fought out in a civil war. Switzerland, As matters which has had centuries of experience in the working of a federation, radically altered her Constitution four times in the nineteenth century. The first alteration was made in 1815, shortly after the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars. Changes were made again in The experience of the 1832. In 1848 the war of the Sunderbund was caused by constitutional questions, and in 1866 amendments vitally changing the Constitution were An y postponement agreed to. We should take the opportunity that now lies to our hand and remould our Constitution while the people 'are looking anxiously for changes as a result of the promises by the Prime Minister at the last election. There are practically only three methods by which our Constitution can be amended. There is, first, the method provided in the Constitution, the adoption of which has been suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). We have had experience of that method, which has failed to secure alterations, except in regard to State debts. unanimity in regard to what was proposed. Dr. EARLE PAGE -There is not likely to be unanimity on any question; but if we submitted the subject of constitutional amendment to a body specially An agreement elected to deal with it , we should get better results^ In America, a body of practice has grown up in connection w it h the alteration' of the Constitution which is used on all occasions when constitutional questions are to be decided. Here, however, a proposal for a constitutional change at once becomes a party matter, and is fought in the constituencies as such. But if a Convention were elected to consider the Constitution, it would be much freer than any ""present legislative body, because there would be no cracking of the party whip. The l if e of a Government would not be at stake, and the members of the Convention would be free to vote wholly in accordance with their opinions.

239,Mr Bowden,"There has not beenand usually attend to only one thing at a ' time. Generally, a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution is submitted by way of referendum at the time of a general election, and it is the election that focusses the attention of the electors. part, and not f u l ly informed of the effect of the constitutional amendment that is proposed for their acceptance, they generally err on the safe side by rejecting it. It was only at the last referendum that a number of proposed constitutional changes were submitted separately to the electors. deal with such proposals as a whole. Certain amendments of"" the Constitution would, of course, be dealt w i th together, such as those providing for the creation of new States and contingent constitutional reform. electors who would favour the creation of new Statesi f they were sure that the system of government would not thereby become more extravagant, who would oppose the proposition if placed by itself. The second method for securing alterations of the Constitution is that of agreements between the Commonwealth and State Parliaments; but the success of that method has not been remarkable. first attempt at an agreement was made in 1915, and I think that only one House of one of the State Parliaments passed the measure necessary to give effect to the resolution arrived at in the Conference between the Commonwealth and State Ministers. The third method of providing for constitutional changes is that which, to my mind, is the proper one, the election of a Convention. Viecount Bryce, in his book, The American Commonwealth, points out thatIn Americai t is always by a Convention (i.e., a representative body called together for some occasional or temporary purpose) that a Constitution is framed.. Recognised in the Federal Constitution (Art. V.) and in the successive Constitutions of the several States as the proper method to be employed when a new Constitution is to be' prepared, or an existing Constitution revised throughout, it has now become a regular and familiar part of the machinery of American Governmentalmost a necessary part, because all American Legislatures are limited by a fundamental law, and therefore when a fundamental law is to be repealed or largely recast, it is desirable The fact that the Constitution when drafted to provide for the purpose a body distinct from the ordinary Legislature. Wherei t is sought only to change the existing fundamental law in a few specified points, the function of proposing these changes to the people for their acceptance may safely be left, and generally is left, to the Legislature. Originally a Convention was conceived of as a sovereign body, wherein the full powers of the Being uncertain, for the most people were vested by popular election. It is now, however, usually an advisory body, which prepares a draft of a new Constitution and submits it to tEe people for their acceptance or rejection. And it is not deemed to be sovereign in the sense of possessing the plenary authority of the people, for its powers may be, and now almost invariably are, limited by the statute under which the people elect it. It is worthwhile to indicate certain advanPreviously, they have had to tages which have been found to attach to the method of entrusting the preparation of a fundamental instrument of government to a body of men specially chosen for the purpose instead of to the ordinary Legislature. An American Constitutional Convention, being chosen for the sole purpose of drafting a Constitution, and having nothing to do with the There are thousands of ordinary administration of Government, no influence or patronage, no power to appropriate revenue, no opportunity of doing jobs for individuals or corporations, is not necessarily elected on party lines or in obedience to party considerations. Hence men comparatively indifferent to party are sometimes elected; while those who seek to enter a Legislature for the sake of party advancement or the promotion of some private gainful object, do not generally care to serve in a Convention. When the Convention meets, it is not, like a Legislature, a body strictly organized by party. A sense of The individual independence and freedom may pre-' vail unknown to Legislatures. Proposals have, therefore, a chance of being considered on their merits. A ' scheme does not necessarily command the support of one set of men nor encounter tbe hostility of another set because it proceeds from a particular leader or group. And as the ordinary party questions do not come up for decision while its deliberations are going on, men are not thrown back on their usual party affiliations, nor are their passions roused by exciting political issues. Having no work but Constitution making to consider, a Convention is free to bend its whole mind to that work. Debate has less tendency to stray off to irrelevant matters. Business advances because there are no such interruptions as a Legislature charged with the ordinary business of government must expect. Since a Convention assembles for one purpose only, and that purpose specially interesting to thoughtful and publicspirited citizens, and since its duration is short, men who would not care to enter a Legislature, men pressed by professional labours, or averse to the ""rough and tumble"" of politics, a class large in America and increasing in Europe, are glad to serve on it, while mere jobbers or office-seekers find little to attract them inits functions. Thus the level of honesty, even more than of ability, is higher in Conventions than in Legislature. has to be submitted to the people, by whose authority it will (if accepted) be enacted, gives to the Convention a somewhat larger freedom for proposing what they think best than a Legislature, courting or fearing its constituents, commonly allows itself. Convention vanishes altogether when its work is accomplished, the ordinary motives for popularity-hunting are less potent. Asi t does not legislate, but merely proposes, it need not fear to ask the people to enact what may offend certain persons or classes, for the odium, if any, of harassing these classes, will rest with the people. And as the people must accept or reject the draft en bloc (unless in the rare case where provision is made for voting on particular points separately) more care is taken in preparing the draft, in clearing it of errors and repugnances, than a Legislature capable of repealing or altering in its next session what it now provides, bestows on the details of its measures. I have read that quotation in full, first of all, in order to have it ou record in Hansard, and in the second place, as an answer to the argument that has been raised here, that a Legislature is better fitted to deal with these matters than a Convention would be. This is not one man's opinion; it is founded on the universal experience of America for many years past, and is the method they have found to be the most expedient for dealing with questions of constitutional alteration. Having shown the necessity for a Convention, I would like to deal now with the method of electing delegates. have already set out my reasons for objecting to the nominee system. wholly elected, and I have advocated a big Convention which would permit '>f wide representation of many interests and enable representative men from all over Australia, and especially from the sparsely-populated States which are poorly represented in this Parliament, and many of which have a definite grievance against Federation-ther e is a distinct anti-Federal feeling in ""Western Australia-to meet men from other parts of Australia and appreciate their points of view.

I tliink it will be found, however, that men who have had an opportunity of meeting one another and discussing one another's points of view, will be more likely to become advocates of the changes agreed upon, probably as the result of a. compromise, than they would be likely to be if that opportunity for interchange of thought and views is not freely extended to the sparsely-populated States.

However, as there seems to be hostility to the proposal for a big Convention, I suggest that the number should be seventy-two; and, in order to obliterate the disadvantages of the Government's proposition, I suggest also that each State should be divided into four electorates, each returning three delegates on a proportional system of voting. would insure that a senator would be able to stand for one of these divisions without having to contest the whole State, and without having to pit himself against a man who might possibly beat him in his own' electorate, which, of course, is the State itself. At the same time, it would permit a member of the House of Representatives representing any of the electorates included in the division to submit himself for election, and as the division would not be coterminous with the boundaries of his electorate, if he were defeated he would not feel that he had been rejected on his own ""heath,"" and would not have reason to fear that he might not be able to hold his own at the ensuing general election. If my suggestion were adopted we could secure in each State divisions permitting of the representation of community of interests. For instance, in the State of Victoria, the metropolitan area, which practically contains half the population, would comprise two electoral units, leaving two for the extra-metropolitan areas of the State. done in New South ""Wales, ""Western Australia and South Australia; and it would not be a very difficult mat-' ter to divide Tasmania into four constituencies. My desire for a numerous Convention is to have as many different interests as possible represented, and putParliaments. I understand that a proting forward their points of view. Convention of seventy-two men would not be unwieldly. what took place at eaoh of the previous Conventions we find that most of the work was not done by the main body of delegates, but was carried out by Committees into which the Convention divided itself. The Convention of 1897. met on the 22nd March. There was a general debate for seven days, and then tbe Convention was divided into three Committees, constitutional, financial, and judicial, just as I think it will be found necessary to appoint three Committees at the forthcoming Convention to discuss the matters submitted. On the Sth April the -Committees reported, and on the 12th April the whole Convention went into Committee, and reported on the 22nd April to the f u l l Convention. The report was adopted on the following day, and the draft Bill was then ready for submission to the State Parliaments This for their approval. It was found necessary to do this in a Convention which numbered sixty delegates, and of the reports brought up by the various Committees only one finding was rejected by the Convention sitting as a whole. to the findings of the_Committees. For instance, it added the old-age pensions power and the industrial power. of the Committees were not altered except in one instance. The point is that the back of the discussion was really broken in the Committees. mine what matters are to be dealt with at the Convention? with that aspect of the question if I am permitted to proceed. When one realizes that the mere carrying of. a resolution by a majority in -the Convention is not sufficient to carry it through this House or the succeeding referendum, The same could be unless it has behind it strong support in the Convention, it seems superfluous to introduce one, seeing that the Convention is more likely to reject it than allow it to be carried by a vote or two. I object very strongly to the provision for nominee members from the StateA mise has been made by the Prime Minister with regard to this matter, but, though that may be binding on the right When we: examine honourable gentleman himself, it is not necessarily binding on this House. I object to State parliamentarians taking part in tha Convention unless they are directly elected by the people after an exposition of their views. A State Government and Parliament will always be found more anti-Federal than the constituencies by which the Legislature is elected.

[Extension of time granted.'] orable members for their consideration, and promise not to detain them much longer. There is one matter connected with elections to this House that I should like to see discussed, both in this House and in the Convention, and placed before the people for decision. There ought to be some alteration of the system which obtains at present by which the number of the members of the House of Representatives must be "" as nearly as practicable"" in a certain proportion to the Senators. It seems to me, from what happened at the first redistribution of seats, and what is going to happen at the next, that the States which are small in area, and without the capacity for expansion enjoyed by the larger States, will gradually have their members filched away. A t present the position in Victoria is grossly unfair. The fact that Victoria loses one member now makes the quota that is applied to that State something like 3,000 or 4,000 greater than the highest for any other State. I have carefully investigated the Constitutions of every Federation of which I could gain any knowledge, and they are all alike with regard to the method of election. Every one of the Federations takes a certain definite quota for one member, and as the people of the nation increase the number of members automatically increases periodically, while at stated intervals the Parliament decides whether the qnota shall be altered to prevent numbers It is no good providing becoming (Unwieldly. We know the drift to the cities that is going on every day in Australia, which has resulted in Melbourne gaining 124,000 electors in ten years, as against a gain of 5,700 over the electorates created in Melbourne, while two have been destroyed in the country.

CONVERSION BILL . ter for Works and Railways) [5.55 p.m.]. I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill for an Act to 'authorize the paying off, repurchasing, redeeming, and converting of loans and for other purposes. Honourable members are aware that a large number of Commonwealth loans will mature 'at definite dates. The firs:' of these to fall due is one for £4,000,000, which was raised to provide money for the States in accordance with an agreement made between them and the Commonwealth during the period of the war. That loan will full due in August next. It is most desirable that the Treasurer should be given a standing authority to redeem loans. It is often advisable that redemption operations should be undertaken some time prior to a loan reaching maturity. Therefore we desire to pass this Bill, which will give the Treasurer general authority to raise money for the purpose of redeeming loans. Honourable members will realize that it is not always advisable to indicate the exact date on which it is proposed to raise money for redemption purposes, because by doing so the Treasurer might be hindered in getting the best terms. If the Treasurer is given a general authority he can go upon the market at any time to raise money for the purpose only of redeeming loans. This Bill gives him authority to raise money to pay off bondholders, or to arrange with them for the conversion of their holdings. It does not authorize the Treasurer to increase the capital debt in any way. He will be able to borrow in order to substitute new loans for old, as and when he thinks convenient. raised at a higher rate of interest. on the other hand the Treasurer may be able to raise the money at a lower interest than is borne by the loan he is rePage, Dr. Earle deeming, and thus he will reduce Watt, W. A. expense. Stewart, P. Gt. tain any limitation? amount of loans that are outstanding. This authority will apply to all loans as they fall due, and will obviate the necessity for 'asking for specific authority in connection with the redemption of any particular loan. We need this authority in order to be able to make arrangements for the redemption of the loan that will fall due in August next. tions. to enable the Treasurer to take advantage of a suitable market. At page 28 of the Budget-papers, honourable members will find a list of the loans, and the dates on which they mature. that statutory provision of this kind is requisite* in view of the early necessity for considering the redemption of some substantial part of our loan indebtedness. A point which the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has not made quite clear is as to whether this Bill will give the Treasurer authority to increase the public debt, should it be necessary to do so in the conduct of these conversion operations. For example, if , in respect of our earlier loan redemptions, we cannot issue at par, but have, perhaps, to issue at 96 in London or Australia, the principal sum will be added to if the difference has to be paid out of loan money. If , therefore, this Bill does not give sufficient authority to increase the public debt for all conversion purposes, the Treasurer will be obliged to find out of revenue the difference in the principal sums. the Treasurer more careful? for him to pay that difference out of revenue without disorganizing the finances of the year. be any harm if he had to make good the difference out of revenue? funds were available; but if they were not it might lead to extreme difficulty.

I understand, moreover, that there is no fund which may be drawn upon for distributing compassionate allowances. desire to mention the hard case of a former British soldier who came out to Australia, under the Imperial immigration scheme, I understand, in company with his wife and four of his children. Shortly after reaching Australia he broke down in health. I am informed, and the man has been unable to earn a living. As he has not been in Australia sufficiently long to become entitled to a pension, the circumstances of his family are very hard. There are four older children still in England, and the parents are anxious to return with the younger members of their family, so that they may be assisted by the children who are at work. Is there a fund available from which money can be drawn to provide these people with immediate help? done in the direction of affording them passages back to England? vessels of the Commonwealth Fleet are returning practically empty. the Government can assist the family in that direction. Another matter upon which I desire to touqh has to do with a promise of the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), that he would investigate the matter of asylum pensions. Inmates should all be treated alike in respect of the receipt of pension money. To-day, some are allowed 23., while others are paid nothing whatever. That is because certain persons were entitled to receive pensions prior to their entrance into the institutions. In respect of those latter, the State Government concerned receives 13s., and the asylum pensioner 2s. weekly. There are pensioners who have friends or relatives who look after these unfortunate people for certain periods when they are permitted to leave the institutions. While they remain outside they are given the ful l amount of the pension; but, upon their return, they receive 2s., and the balance of the weekly pension allowance. There are patients who have been in asylums for many years, and who can never hope to get out. Numbers are bedridden. Unhappily, these poor folk cannot be made to understand why certain of their fellow inmates receive 2s. each week from the Government, while they themselves get nothing. Even the small sum of 2s. goes a long way in the asylums. Bedridden folk, if they are in receipt of their weekly portion, are able to purchase the assistance of others. They receive certain little attentions from their fellows by paying a very small sum, or by giving goods-tea , tobacco, and the like. Women Tubercular trouble developed, inmates of asylums in New South Wales who receive no pension money or financial assistance from friends feel their deprivation very keenly. ' Those who are paid the 2s. a week are regarded as the aristocrats of the institution. These relatively fortunate women are able to afford their afternoon tea, and are able to provide themselves with other humble comforts. I repeat that it is impossible to make the inmates understand the reason for discrimination. Some arrangement should be made, in the name of humanity, by Cannot something practical be which a weekly pittance may be given to all inmates. This could be brought Certain about by arrangement with the State Governments, by an adjustment in respect Possibly of the weekly payments of the portions of pensions. If there could be established a fund-cal l it an Asylum Income Fund-it would help to ameliorate the pathetic circumstances of people, many of whom are old and feeble. And that is the very least that should be asked from the Government. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. Progress reported.

It is a telegram from the Prime Minister of Great Britain sent directly to meArticles of Agreement for the settlement of the Irish question were signed this morning. Article No. 1 reads as follows:-Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the community of nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland, and an Executive responsible to thc Parliament; and shall be styled and known as The Irish Free State. Under subsequent Articles the relations of Ireland to Great Britain are to be those of Canada in practice as well as in law, subject to certain special exceptions, such as facilities to offer sincere and hearty congratulafor Navy. Thc oatli is amplified to include allegiance to King, fidelity to the Irish Constitution a3 by law established. ship with Britain and membership in ths Britisli Commonwealth of nations. The Irish share of national debt and war pensions is referred to arbitration; arbitrators must be British subjects. 'Subject to further consideration five years hence of Irish claims to coastal defence, and protection of Customs and Fisheries, defence of British coast is permanently referred to the British Navy, together with all powers in peace and war essential thereto. of military forces controlled by the Irish Government is limited by the ratio of Irish to British population. Ulster may maintain a militia subject to the same limitation. Ireland secures absolute control of Customs and Excise. Ships of Great Britain and Ireland will enjoy equal rights in each other's ports.

Ulster is given complete freedom of choice between two alternatives-eithe r she can retain her existing position under the Government of Ireland Act or she can enter the All-Ireland Parliament on terms which are left to herself to negotiate. If she elects to remain apart, anomalies in existing conditions are to be rectified by a Commission, having regard to the wishes of the local population and geographic and economic conditions. Minority rights in North as well as South aTe protected by an Article invalidating laws which interfere with free religion or education, or with endowment of schools. The rights of Southern Unionists are further secured by an understanding made between their representatives and the Irish signatories to the Treaty as to representation of minorities in constituencies, and in the Upper House, which will be embodied in the Constitution when drafted. Mr Hughes. Effect will be given to the Agreement when ratified by Parliament and the Dail by legislation, pending which a provisional Government will be established for Southern Ireland by Orders in Council. In effect, the Irish leaders will become Ministers of the Crown as soon as Treaty is ratified. This news is perhaps the most welcome that we could have. By the agreement which is outlined, there has been ended, let us hope permanently, a quarrel now some 700 years old. A problem, seemingly insoluble, which has baffled the wisest statesmen of England for centuries, has, through the genius, tact, and tenacity of purpose of Mr Lloyd George, been happily solved, and a country which under other circumstances would have been our enemy has became our friend. I desire, on behalf of this Government, tions to the British Prime Minister and his Government on the success of the protracted negotiations which have ended so Commonwealth citizenhappily. Australia extends to Ireland, her new sister Dominion, the heartiest welcome. She bids her God-speed, and asks her to accept the best wishes for her future .

The matter has been brought under the notice of Ministers on previous occasions, but little or no direct attention has been given to repeated requests put forward on behalf erf invalids who, by reason of the fact that they live with their parents, or in uhe same homes as their parents,although they have reached their majority in years, are unable to secure the benefits of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I could cite cases that have previously been mentioned by other honourable members, but there is no need for me to go into details, the ciroumstances are well known to the Government, and I recognise the urgency of other matters honourable members will be called upon to consider.

A week or so ago the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Maithews) cited special instances of hardship among the class of people who are subject to conditions I have mentioned, and I hope that the Government will recognise the country's obligation to them.

I pay a special compliment to the officers in that branch of the Treasury which is intrusted with tihe administration of invalid and old-age pensions, not only for the sympathetic manner in which they before them, but also for the despatch with which they consider the various requests submitted to them. If there are people who are unfortunate enough not to 'be drawing pensions, I am confident it is not because of any desire on the part of officials to deprive them of this allowance, but is owing to the fact that the Act does not provide for their cases. However, I hope that before long these difficulties and anomalies will be removed, and that those who are approaching the eventide of their life, the pioneers of this country, and those who are, unfortunately, regarded as the invalids of our community, will receive the fullest measure of assistance at the hands of a sympathetic Parliament.

The object of this B ill is to r a t if y an Mr Collins, the Secretary to the Comagreement made between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government with respect of the funding of our indebtedness to the British Government. During the progress of the war the Imperial authorities not only advanced cash to the Commonwealth to the extent of about £50,000,000, which, of course, was all devoted to war expenditure, but also made numerous payments on our behalf for the maintenance of our Forcesi n the field, for supplies to the Australian 'Navy, for the transport of troops, and for other services. Repayments have been made from time to time by the Commonwealth, but there has always been a large amount outstanding and owing by us to the Imperial Government. No arrangement was made in regard, to the cash advanced, or in regard to the payments made on our behalf, as to the time at which' the balance should be repaid. As the war went on the balance was simply carried forward, various payments being credited to us, deal with all cases brought and various other advances being made. Of course, in the absence of any such agreement as to the period of repayment the British Government would be entitled to payment on demand, but one of the objects of Senator Millen's visit to Great Britain last year, apart from his attendance at the meeting of the League of Nations, was to negotiate with the British authorities, and endeavour to come to some final arrangements in regard to these large sums of money which were owing. .He succeeded in making a very satisfactory agreement, by which Australia was to pay the British Government 6 per cent, for thirty-six years.

There were certain amounts about which no complete settlement had been come to by the time SenatorE . D .

I remind the honourable member that this arrangement w i th the British Government was made by the Labour Administration which tihe honourable member supported, and, apDuring the war I enparently, he is now complaining because he is asked to pay his debts.

336,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nHonorable members have a copy of the draft agreement, which, in substance, is thab which was laid on the table of tihe House some time ago. OctoberI dealt fully with the question of wireless communication, draft agreement specially refers. orable members will recall the fact that I pointed schemes before the Imperial one known as the Norman system of relays, and the other the scheme that is covered by the document that is in honourable member's hands. The two schemes that I dealt with when makingmy report to the House on the Imperial differ fundamentally. one is a system of relays and the other a system of direct communication Australia and Britain and every part of the civilized world. The Norman scheme provides for stations to be provided at Oxford, Cairo, Poonah, Singapore, Kong, and Australia, and to cover South Africa from Nairoli and Wyndhoek. estimated capital cost of the scheme is £1,243,000; of the initial cost, £185,000; the annual charge for Australia, £60,000; the estimated revenue, £40,000; and the annual loss, £20,000. tions to this scheme other than the financial ones, which are fairly obvious, and to which I shall again refer. Pirst of all, we get direct communication Kong only under special afcmospneric conditions, and for a limited number of hours per day. The messages are sent in relays, and necessarily the outlying stations, of which Australia is the most remote, will be delayed by any congestion at any one of the intermediate messages from here to England may be held up at Singapore messages, which Poonah, by Hong Kong and Singapore; at Cairo, by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Poonah, and so on; there is this objection of delay and lack of direct tion. to expect from wireless other than what we get from cable communication, answer is obvious. tion furnishes us with the most effective mode of propaganda Honourable members may ask what we' have to do with propaganda. days, I submit, Australia nation has everything to do with propaganda; without it nations cannot hope to Mr Hughes. meet the intense competition for trade, and all up-to-date nations resort to this method. It is, perhaps, not necessary to On the 5th remind honourable members of the extent to which Germany influenced public to which this opinion during the war by wireless proHonpaganda. It is safe to say that to Germanyi t . was worth more than many out that there were two legions. By skilful manipulation she Conference, sent distorted stories abroad that have not yet ibeen overtaken; and to-day she is still relying on wireless for her overseas communication. The United States of America, perhaps the most up-to-date nation in the Conference, world, has, since the Imperial Conference As I have said, met, established long-distance wireless. And yesterday a press message was rebetween ceived, the first direct wireless that has been sent from Europe to Australia, and that which at the Imperial Conference we were told could not be relied upon has Hong been done. The Norman scheme, then, is The useless for the purposes for which we reNorman quire it . We wish to advertise Australia Australia's share in the East and in America. We wish, above all things, to have direct communication w it h GreatB r it a in. Australia is' A country geographicallv remote, but hapI pointed out the objecpily, owing to B r it a in ' ! command of the sea, the cables were not cut during the war. But little imagination is necessary to understand what the severing of the with Hong cables would have meant to Australia, cut off, as it was, from Europe, and without an effective system of wireless. Australia is an integral part of the British Empire; but what do we know of what is going on in England? Very little. What do the people in B r it a in know of what is stations. Thus, all going on in Australia? Still less. It is not for me to speak of the cable chargesby Hong Kongthe press is able to speak of them w it h take precedence; at authority-and I am able to say that the whole of the press of Great Britain, and I think I am accurate in saying the whole of the press in Australia also-a t any communicarate, the daily press-is behind the If we ask ourselves what we are scheme I have the honour to put forward to-night. fhe member mean that they are in favour of that now exists. the details of this scheme, or that they are in favour of the idea of direct wireIn these less communication? of this scheme for direct communication with Europe.",71,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
337,Wireless Communica,Mr GREGORY -Does the honourable,72,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
338,And Every Mr Hughes,"They are in favourcontribute towards the cost? ber might as well ask me what the press contributes towards the cost and maintenance of the Pacific cable. The press will contribute towards the cost of this wireless system by using it for pres3 purposes, and will be amongst our chief customers; but it is not suggested that the newspapers should establish the scheme. think the honourable member for Robertson would be one of the first to register his vote against allowing the press to establish its own wireless system in Australia. I sliould, at any rate. wireless will be to enable us to communicate directly with other countries, and, for propaganda purposes, it is essential that we should communicate direct. The Norman scheme would not enable us to communicate direct with Canada or South Africa, or England. It would enable us to communicate direct with the East, but there would be possibilities and probabilities of great delay in the transmission of messages. The financial side of the Norman scheme must not be overlooked. The present position of wireless in this country is well known to honourable members, for I stated it a few days ago. There is a net loss now on the system of £57,068 per annum, without including interest on capital or allowance for depreciation of assets. That is to say, the Commonwealth now loses nearly £60,000 per annum on its present system of wireless, and from the point of view of business men that is not very satisfactory; nor would a statement of accounts which did not take into consideration interest on capital or depreciation be considered satisfactory by any business firm. It is fair to say that if we do take into consideration, interest on capital and depreciation, the present loss to this country is easily from £70,000 to £75.000 per annum. It is proposed, under the Norman scheme, to add £20,000 to that, which would mean a net loss of £80,000 per annum on a system that would enable us to communicate directly with Hong Kong, but would not enable us to utilize the main wireless for the main objects for which wireless exists-propaganda-whic h would cut us off from Great Britain, and would not enable us to send messages direct to America, the East, Canada, or South f555]2 Africa. The benefits of the Norman scheme were stated by me. It was alleged by the Norman Committee that because the relays extended only over 2,000 miles that scheme could be relied upon, whilst the long distance communication could not. Buti t is only fair to repeat what I said when speaking .on this matter before, namoly, that honourable members may go to any of our receiving stations In fact, I and hear Bordeaux or Lyons or the long distance wireless in America speaking. Those messages are being received, and, therefore, so far as covering the distance is concerned, there is proof positive of The benefit of which every honourable member may satisfy himself, that it is possible to send messages from England, or America, or France direct to Australia. And, of course, they are received with the rapidity of light, which is exactly the rate at which wireless travels; for all practical purposes it Hs instantaneous. The advantages of direct communication are so obvious that it is sufficient to set them out. They do not require any argument. The Norman scheme would be controlled wholly by the Governments of Great Britain and the various Dominions, and it would he run by the Postal Department. It can hardly be expected of me that I should say anything against the Post Office, because it is perhaps one of the most cherished of the Departments over which I have the honour to preside, and it is a veritable jewel in the diadem of Great Britain. But, nevertheless, it is a fact that Mr Donoghue, of the Daily Chronicle, and the representative of the British press, said that the press of Great Britain had grave doubts as to whether wireless under thecontrol of the Postal Department would be quite satisfactory. Those honourable members who from time to time express grave doubts as to the wisdom of governmental enterprise may now be able to couch a lance in favour of it, but on this occasion I am to be counted on the other side. In. my opinion, if we want an efficient system of wireless, we must look for it in quarters where we shall have at our disposal men with scientific training and business capacity, and above all those in quarters that have control of those patents and apparati without which it is impossible for wireless to be",72,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great

The company w it h which we propose to make this agreement guarantees not only to erect a wireless transmitting system in Australia, but also to make arrangements for the receipt of the messages in England and elsewhere. of the present Australian wireless system? take it over, and it shows that it expects not only to prevent the continuation of the present loss, but ta give the Commonwealth a return of 10 per oent. The present business of Amalgamated Wireless relates to all merchant ships voyaging about the Australian coast; it is well established and profitable, and the company is offering its services and its business to the Commonwealth, and is seeking our co-operation in order to establish long-distance* wireless, which shall include its and our present wireless operation, grouped under one control in which the company and we shall be partners, we providing half the capital and the company the other half. I shall deal now with the proposal in detail. mated Wireless are mainly Australian, and the company is now operating at a profit. It owns its own workshops, and has its own staff of mechanics and operators. It has the Australian rights over all Marconi patents. I must say, in order to be fair, that I had to complain at the Imperial Conference that those who were responsible for the Norman scheme seemed more anxious toi pursue their feud against Mr Godfrey Isaacs than to further the interests of wireless telegraphy. We have nothing to do with Marconi or with Mr Godfrey Isaacs. But there is no doubt whatever that in the world to-day wireless is what it is mainly because of Marconi. Australian Wireless owns rights over all the Marconi patents. It is in line with all the latest advances in wireless, and, as I have said, the proposals of the company are f u l l y set out in the d r a f t agreement, copies of which honourable members have in their hands. The agreement follows in all essentials the lines of the agreement with the Anglo-PersianO i l Company-that is to say, the Commonwealth w ill take £501,000 worth of the shares, and will have a proportionate amount of control There must be reciprocity. over the scheme. not give the Government the measure of control that it would secure by means of the same number of shares in an ordinary company. the same control that we have under the agreement with ""the Anglo-PersianO i l Company. In order to control a specialized business of this character we must have trained men. Governments come and g o I admit that some of us do notbut that is the idea, and we could not run a commercial concern on those lines. That being so, a majority of the directors are to be nominated by shareholders other than the Commonwealth Government, but a majority of those shareholders-nearl y all of them-ar e Australians. That is to say, they are our own fellow-citizens. The company is to increase its capital to £1,000,000, divided into 1,000,000 shares of £ 1 each. Of these the Commonwealth Government is to take up 500,001. It w ill pay on allotment 2s. per share, or £50,000. The further calls are limited to 6s. per share not earlier than the 1st July, 1922; 6s. per share not earlier than The shareholders of Amalga1st January, 1923, and 6s. per share not earlier than 1st July, 1923. Thus during the present financial year our expenditure w ill be £50,000. In the next financial year there w ill be an expenditure of 12s. per share, and in the following financial year a payment by us of 6s. per share. The Commonwealth is to have at all times a majority in number and value of the shares. As to the safeguards, paragraph i . of clause 3 provides thatOn any increase of caipital the Commonwealth shall he entitled to subscribe so much capital, and be allotted so many shares that at all times the Commonwealth will hold a majority in number and value of thc shares in the company. It is further provided that every shareholder shall have one vote for every share held by him. Paragraph i i i of clause 3 provides thatSo long as the Commonwealth or its nominees continue to hold a majority in number and value of the shares, of the total number of directors of the company (including the managing director, if he has a vote, threesevenths in number shall be nominated by and",73,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great

Any proposed sale or disposition of the company's business or any part thereafford facilities for distributing traffic throughof; or 3. Any proposed change in the status, powers, objects, or constitution of the company; shall be taken, determined, or made without the consent of the Commonwealth, as expressed through its representatives on the Board of Directors; (vii) That the company shall not enter into or be a party to any commercial Trust or Combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business; (viii) That other things being equal, the company shall give preference to goods manufactured in the Commonwealth when purchasing machinery, plant, and supplies; and (ix) Any other matters and things necessary! or expedient to protect the interests of the Commonwealth under this agreement. Under clause 4 it is agreed thatThe company shall forthwith proceed with the development, manufacture, sale, and use of apparatus for wireless communication and for the wireless transmission of energy within the Commonwealth and its Territories, and in ships and aircraft owned, registered, or trading within the Commonwealth or its Territories, and for communication with the countries overseas, and the erection of wireless stations and the conduct of wireless services for the purpose of such communications. The company'further agrees that it will forthwith undertake the following programme :(a) To construct, maintain,, and operate in Australia the necessary stations and equipment for a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the United Kingdom; (6) To provide and operate a system of feeder stations for wireless connection between the main high-power stations and the capital , cities of all the States; (c) To equip and organize the feeder stations so as to provide communication with merchant ships round the coast of Australia: (d) To arrange that the rates to be charged for messages between Australia and the United Kingdom, transmitted or received by the company, shall not exceed the following:Proposed Wireless HatesFull-rate messages, 2s. per word. Deferred messages, Is. per word. Week-end messages, Gd. (minimum, 10s. per message). Government messages, Is. per word. Press messages, 5d. per word. Deferred press messages, 3d. per word. (e) To arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom; (/) To provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within two years from the date of receiving the necessary permission at each end, subject to any unforeseen circumstances or conditions beyond thc company's control; (g) To arrange for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with the high-power station in Australia and so equipped as to out North America. It will thus be seen that this is a contract providing not only for the erection of high power and feeder stations in Australia, .but to arrange for corresponding stations in the United Kingdom. Provision is also made for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with, the high-power station in Australia. The agreement further 1 provides thatIn time of war or public danger the company shall, if required by the Commonwealth, hand over to the Commonwealth the control of. its stations, its apparatus, its services, and its manufacturing plant. Then there is a provision that the Commonwealth may take over the business of the company as provided for under the constitution, namely, on just terms. I have here a list of the principal shareholders of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) L t d . I cannot say what is the total number, but they are all Australian citizens, and domiciled for the most part in the various State capitals of the Commonwealth. It is an Australian concern with which we are dealing. It is under the control of the Australian law. It is a business concern which is run at a profit, and contrasts very favourably with our own wireless scheme, which is not a business concern run at a profit, but, on the contrary, shows a loss, as I have said, of nearly £60,000 per annum. D r . EAELE PAGE -'What is the present subscribed capital of the Amalgamated Wireless? £200,000. The company w ill , of course, have to bring up its capital.

The other day we received from President H a r d in g a message at the very moment that it was sent from the United States of America. A t present we can receive any such message, but can send none. As soon as we-get our high-power station we shall be able to send messages to every part of the world. (Let me tell the House what other nations are doing. The people of other countries are not fools. great financial straits, yet she has spent over £1,000,000 on the Bordeaux Station, and is erecting a still more powerful one. In the United States of America there has been erected one of the most, if not the most, powerful stations in the world. Still further sums are to be expended there. The people of the United States of America are flooding the world with news. They are sending out radio messages -which are picked up gratuitously, and which set out the news of the world as seen through American spectacles. B r it a in alone is doing nothing in this rehave possession of our stations and plant. gard, and it is a reflection on us and upon B r it a in, too, that in this respect other countries are showing us the way. On the 8th ultimo the following appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald:The New York Radio Central is equipped to work with five different countries simultaneously, for instance, England, Prance,. Norway, Benmark, and Poland, with the possibility of extending its commercial services to ten countries. The inauguration ot this huge new station in America has its lessons for us. It emphasizes once more the fact, as is demonstrated i by President Harding's historic message, that Australia can be linked direct with any country in the world without any difficulty. It is just a matter of putting up a suitable station. There will be nothing, then, in an ordinary commercial way, to prevent a man from getting into touch with London in one-fifteenth of a second, the while his typist, probably, is spendarrangement with them in order to set ing half-an-hour trying to got a business house a few yards off by telephone.

Under this agreement the Commonwealth is to its assets in the shape of its wireless telegraphy plant here: What amount does the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited bring in? fitable business, whereas we bring in a business that is losing £60,000 a year. That can hardly be described as an asset. £500,000 in cash as well as our wireless plant. has a subscribed paid-up capital of France is in £200,000.

357,Mr Hughes,"I w ill tell honorablethat there is no mention of a sale to them. The property w ill remain vested in the Commonwealth. in this agreement covering that matter. orable member will know that property cannot pass, under the terms of a document, unless specifically covered therein. There is no mention in the proposed contract of any transfer of any property rights by the Commonwealth in its wireless plant. If the plant were to pass the Commonwealth would have to be paid for it ; and, since its transference is not covered in the agreement, the property will remain in the Commonwealth. I desire to refer briefly now to a third offer-that by the Radio Communication Company Limited, which has its head Australian office at 38 Pitt-street, Sydney. The company offers to form a company with a capital of £700,000, to be contributed over three years, one-half plus one share by the Oommonwealth, and one-half minus one share by the Radio Communication Company. The company so formed would undertake to erect, equip, and operate a high-power station capable of direct communication with Great Britain, and such other oversea countries as might be made the subject of agreements. Further, the company would undertake an arrangement with the Imperial Government for the erection of a high-power reciprocating station in Great Britain, and so on. I point out, however, that this company is not able to guarantee to Australia a high-power station in Great Britain. It says it can, and will, erect a high-power station here. No company -can carry out contracts for erecting wireless stations unless it has control of the patents covered by the Marconi rights, and others of a like nature. For all practical purposes, therefore, this proposal must he ignored. There remain the two before the House. One is the Norman scheme, and the other is that of Amalgamated ""Wireless. The Radio Communication Company's proposition fails for many reasons. One is that, to my mind, the company cannot make good. It certainly cannot guarantee a reciprocal arrangement with Great Britain. I hope honourable members will not The factor is one whioh has not escaped -overlook the fact that the Imperial Conthe attention of any of the other nations. ference discussed this matter at great France knows it ; America knows it : length. The Amalgamated Wirelessi n terests had their representatives present; and Mr Lloyd George, after a very long discussion, agreed thati Australia should But there is nothing have the right to choose either of the two first indicated schemes. There is no doubt b u t that either one of them w ill be given the support of the British Government, in so f a r as it is necessary to insure to Australia reciprocal arrangements. The Marconi system has already, at Carnarvon-apar t from whatever else it may have a high-power station. Two years ago Sir Joseph Cook and I sent the first message from England to Australia from that station. The questions for the House to consider are these: Are we to accept the Norman scheme, with its system of relay, and Its annual loss of £20,000, on top of which would be the annual loss of £60,000 which the Commonwealth is now incurring, and which is inevitable, must continue, and is bound to grow worse? A r e we going to link up with the Normani n terests, and, in return, get a scheme which will not p u t us in direct communication with Great Britain, Canada, the United States of America, SouthA f r i c a , tind the East? On the other hand, we may secure a scheme in which the Commonwealth w ill be the principal shareholder, and in which practically all the rest of the shareholders w ill be Australians domiciled in this country; a scheme which has rights over the Marconi patents, has at its command trained experts, and which is managing a profitable business here, in glaring contrast to that which the Commonwealth is managing. Australia, more than any other country in the world, because of its remoteness, needs advertising. What is the great handicap under which we suffer? It is represented by our remotenessWe are ipart of an Empire. We depend for our livelihood upon the sale of our goods in overseas markets. It is, therefere, vital that Australia should be able to communicate with the whole world by the most direct methods. It is true, as was. suggested, I think, by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), when referring to the matter at an earlier stage, that wireless is not secret. That applies, of course, to both the schemes under consideration.",76,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
358,Sir Robert Best,,77,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
359,Mr Hughes,"As a lawyer, the honGermany also knew-that wireless is not secret. But, at the same time, I do not know that it is secrecy which Australia wants. We need publicity. We want to let the whole world know where we are. We want to send our news to Great Britain, to advertise ourselves there; and we want to know more of what is going on in the world. Honourable members complain sometimes because the press of this country does not set but in amplitude such of the news of the world as they may desire to read. Do honourable members know what the press of Australia spends annually upon its news services; and, vice versa, what the British press spends upon the gathering of Australian news? Lord Burnham, proprietor of the London Daily Telegraph, told me that his people spent thousands of pounds a year upon the Australian news services alone. Anybody reading the Daily Telegraph, however, would see only occasional and meagre reports concerning Australia. Those are all that Lord Burnham gets in return for the money he spends in this direction. Lord Northcliffe's services are very complete. The amount of money paid by his interests for Australian news is out of all proportion to the return which they get. The whole of the press of this country, I feel sure, would join with me in demanding that this Parliament assent to some scheme which will provide opportunities for securing cheap news. That is one consideration. Another is that we shall have means of advertising ourselves; and, above all, that we shall have some sure and effective medium, which no one can touch or break, of contact with the Mother Country. .What with the possibilities arising from the outcome of the Washington Conference, and with one consideration and another, we may be left very much to ourselves, and thrown more and more upon our own resources. It will be well that we should have the means of calling across the great distances upon the only power in the world that could help us should trouble ever again arise. I ask honourable members to take their courage in both hands, and to have a little faith in the future of this country. It was not in any timid, shirking spirit that our pioneers went out and made AusMr Hughes. tralia what it is. They had faith, though they had far less reason for its exercise than we -have. I hope honourable members will agree to the motion, and will let the whole world see that Australia has confidence in her future; that now, since she has been admitted into the community of nations, she intends to assert herself and act as a young, virile, and progressive nation should act. Most honourable members will agree with the Prime Minister concerning the need for wireless communication between all parts of the Empire and the civilized world. Honourable members will be quite prepared to take their courage in both hands as they have been exhorted to do; but, in doing so, they must be permitted to give the fullest consideration to an important proposition of this character. Honourable members cannot be expected to decide such a big matter in so brief a period as is available. The subject is one which should have been brought before Parliament some.time ago, in order that ample opportunity might be afforded honourable members to test and consider in detail the various offers. tban two months, you know. similar statement made in regard to other matters, but it was the duty of the Prime Minister to bring a definite proposal before the House. Had he done that two months ago we would have had an opportunity to analyze it , and would probably by now ha.ve reached finality regarding it . The control of the business paper is with the Government, not with private members, and mere statements by the Prime Minister, or other Ministers, are not to be regarded as opportunities for the consideration of the subjects on which they speak. That is not the parliamentary method of dealing with matters of this kind. Definite proposalsmust be placed before us, so that we may have an opportunity to consider them. I am not against doing whatever may be necessary to bring Australia into closer touch with the outer world. We cannot progress with the times unless we take advantage of all the improvements. in methods of communication. But thatdoes not warrant me in accepting a proposal which I am not certain is the best offering. I should have my doubts-",77,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great

362,Mr Charlton,"We have had acleared up before definitely committing myself. I agree with the Prime Minister in regard to the discarding of what is known as the Norman scheme. scheme was not at all satisfactory, and cannot be compared w i th that embodied in the agreement before us. It provided for a service at a capital cost of £1,243,000, and our share of the initial cost would have been £185,000, and our annual charges £60,000, with a loss of £20,000 each year. scheme is not comparable with the scheme recommended Minister. weight with many honourable members for the adoption of the proposal of the Government is the fact that the company with which he wishes to make an agreement is an Australian company. I have before me the list of its shareholders, which is a long one. The company is already established, but its operations are on a limited scale in comparison with' what is projected. pany has a capital of £200,000, and the Prime Minister tells us that it has been a financial success. It offers to ua fairl y liberal terms.

As the Commonwealth will provide more capital than the company, it should have a controlling interest in the concern, but paragraph in of clause 3 of the agreement saysThat so long as the Commonwealtli or its nominees continue to hold a majority in number and value of the shares of the total number of directors of the company (including the managing director if he has a vote), threesevenths in number shall be nominated by, and represent, the Commonwealth, and foursevenths shall be elected by and represent tlie holders of shares other than those allotted to the Commonwealth under this agreement. and they call the tune. be the position. We are to have a smaller voice in the management of the affairs of the company than the present shareholders, whose directors will decide the policy of the concern. clause 3 saysThat every shareholder shall have one vote for every share held by him, provided that a holder of shares allotted to the Commonwealth under this agreement shall not be entitled to vote in respect of the election or removal of directors representing the holders of shares other than those allotted to the Commonwealth That under this agreement. Thus, while we provide the larger part of the capital, only three-sevenths of the directors are to be nominated by and to represent the Commonwealth, and a holder of shares allotted to the Commonwealth w ill not be entitled to vote in respect of the election or removal of direcThatt tors. Thus, the directors nominated by the present company w ill r u n the whole by the Prime show.

If this project is carried out, we cannot, I suppose^ continue to work our wireless stations, on which we now lose about £57,000 a year. They represent, I suppose, plant worth £100,000.

What is thef o l l o w in g ccmmunicaticja to th© P r i m e Ministerf r o m the Radio Communication Company, dated 3 r d DecemberFollowing my letter of 2Sth inst., in which proposals were made to your Government in respect of direct wireless communication with Great Britain, my company now instructs ine by cable to submit further proposals which may, at your option, be regarded as. alternative. Tliese proposals are:1\ The formation of a company with a capital of £700,000, to be contributed over three years, one-half plus one share by the Commonwealth, and one-half minus one shaTe by the Badio Communication Company; the Board of Control to consist of three members appointed by the Commonwealth, a like number appointed by the Radio Communication Company, these six members to agree upon a seventh member as chairman. It will be seen that under this proposition the Commonwealth would not' be called upon to provide more than £350,000, so that if the offer should prove satisfactory it would lead to a saving of £150,000 to the Commonwealth. However, I do not say that the proposition would prove satisfactory. stations in England. formed that they have the right from the British Government to use the stations in England. The letter continues:2. The company so formed to undertake(o) Tlie erection, equipment, and operation of a high power station capable of direct communication with Great Britain and such other oversea countries as may be the subject of agreements; (5) Arrangement Government for the erection of a ft high power reciprocating station in GreatB r it a in ; (c) Operation and maintenance of five or more feeder stations in Australia, at such points as the Government may determine after a survey by the company's experts, in association with Commonwealth officers; likewise the maintenance and operation of such. island stations as may be indicated; (<J) The maintenance, operation, and control of existing coastal stations to enable effective communication between these stations and ships at sea and also between these stations and the feeder stations on the mainland and in the Pacific Islands; (e) Installation of high-speed apparatus at stations as warranted by traffic necessities; (/) Establishment in Australia of works for the manufacture of all types of wireless apparatus both for shore stations and ships; [g) Establishment of offices in cities adjacent to feeder stations, to handle inward and outward traffic with a maximum of expedition; (h) Supply and installation of Radio Communication Company's automatic watch-keeping apparatus in every centre desired by the Commonwealth authority; (/) Transaction of any other business appertaining to wireless and wireless communications; (It) Manufacture and supply of ordinary telephones and auxiliary parts if officially desired; (/) The equipment of colleges in suitable centres for the training of operator personnel for the company's service. In regard to (/) aiid (7c) above, I might say that the works proposed for establishment would be on similar lines to the company's works at Barnes, near London. These workB with scientific laboratory attached are equipped with the most modern plant for the manufacture of every type of wireless apparatus, and the duplication in Australia of this plant would, I submit, represent a very notable addition to the technical instrumentalities of Australia. Such a plant would be available not merely for the manufacture of wireless requisites, but could also be utilized for the production of telephone and telegraph parts and other auxiliaries required from time to time by the Post and Telegraph Departments, should such activities officially commend themselves. In regard to (h) I would point out that the automatic watch-keeping apparatus (the world patents of which are owned by my company), is suitable for installation in even the smallest of towns, and is capable of responding to any pre-arranged signal from distant land or ship stations. In its working the apparatus is entirely automatic, practically with the Imperial eliminating the human factor altogether. It can be so arranged that when an alarm is given, both the station and the class of signal are at once determinable. It is also capable of operating a tape machine, so that any one with a knowledge of the Morse code could read the message in course of transmission. By this means every town supplied with this instrument could . be notified if necessary in a few moments. The outstanding merit of this instrument lies in t h e fact that it makes possible wireless communication with small centres throughout the Commonwealth, a condition otherwise out of the question because of the cost of apparatus and personnel. Applied to sea work, the instrument enables a continuous wireless watch to be maintained although one operator only be carried. This fact alone' would place the proposed company in a dominant position in relation to all ship installations, which form so large a proportion of Wireless business.",79,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
367,Mr Marr,Those people have no,80,Wirelesscommunicatio N Direct Communication With Great
368,Mr Charlton,"Yes; I am inIn requesting your consideration of these outline proposals, I venture to emphasize the following points:1. The capital sum invited from the Commonwealth is £350,000, instead of £500,000, as indicated in a competitive proposal. 2. The works contemplated would be of high efliciency and capable of wide utilization for both wireless and land telephone and telegraph purposes. 3. The present standing of the Radio Communication Company is a guarantee of technical efliciency, administrative adaptability, and financial competency, and the company's existing business ramifications (in the benefits of which the British-Australian Company now proposed would share), are of such scope and character as to insure both the commercial and public success of the company's activities. We cannot turn down such a proposition without giving it consideration. not know that it is worth anything, and I do not stand for it-at the present time, but I stand for the fullest investigation in regard to any proposition before we take any action in regard to it . We are uot justified at this late hour of the session in agreeing to commit the Commonwealth to an expenditure of £500,000 in connection w i th any offer under an agreement which on the face of it is f a r from satisfactory. If we agree to the motion submitted to-night the Government w ill regard it as an instruction to them to sign the agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) L t d . , and go on with the work. any action in the matter it must be done now, and as I think that further inquiry into the matter is necessary, in order that the Commonwealth may be safeguarded, I move That all the words after "" That"" be left out with a view to iusertdng in lieu thereof the words ""the whole question of wireless be referred to a Committee of this House for investigation and report."" I agree w i th the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) as to the importance of wireless communication to Australia, not merely for the purpose of communication with other countries, and particularly with the heart of the Empire, bub also for utilization in the wide spaces of the Gommonwealth in order to eliminate to some extent the isolation of the bush as it exists to-day. If this proposition w ill improve facilities for communication in our far-back settlements, I shall be willin g to support it to the utmost of my .ability, but I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there is some need for inquiry, although I do not think that the report of the proposed Committee should be delayed for any length of time. agree with that. -tee's report should be made available at the earliest possible moment, and if it be favorable, the Government should be empowered to complete the negotiations involved. The solution of the problem of G wireless should not be regarded as a party question. that "" big business "" is in it . business in this matter, as I hope to in dicate in a second or two. A proposition that really would have more support from me than the honourable member's amendment is one that would not bring the Government into the business at all, but would permit all wireless communication, under proper guarantees and safeguards, to be in the hands of private enterprise, which I am sure would handle it much more satisfactorily from every point of view than any half-bred companies we can form , one of which, according to our experience, has not proved an unchalI f the House is to take lengeable success. I agree with the Prime Minister that the Post Office should not be called upon to handle this matter of dealing with wireless, because we are already showing a loss of about £57,000 per annum on our radio activities; and wireless development is controlled, to a large extent, by patent rights, without which no company could carry on. In the circumstances, I think we are wise in getting into touch w i th a company that is in a position to acquire and use these rights in the freest possible way. Already installations that have been established by certain companies have proved unsatisfactory because of the absence from some of them of a small i m provement patented by Marconi. It is quite an inexpensive matter to install that improvement; but the fact that it is not available to these companies prevents their installations from being as satisfactory as they otherwise would be.

373,Dr. Earlepage,"There is bigconsidering alongside, that which has been submitted by the Amalgamated ""Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The first cost of relay stations would be very considerable, and would involve a definite loss of at least £20,000 per annum, which, on top of our present annual loss of £57,000, would practically mean that, at the end of ten years, we would need to capitalize close up to £1,000,000, and our interest^ bill by that time would overburden the whole proposition. The difficulty in regard to the Radio Communication Company'saoffer is that it is a new company, and for the last twenty-five years the various Marconi companies with which the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is associated have been building up their business, getting together a staff of exshould be. thoroughly threshed out. perts, and setting up a series of workshops and installations throughout the rest of the world; whereas the Radio Communication Company have been established for only a couple of years. In these circumstances, it seems to me that if they are not in a position to offer us more satisfactory installation than the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited can supply, the Commonwealth Government could do the work themselves from the very inception. However, I do not think that that is possible. The proposition of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is one that deserves favorable consideration from this House. deal of time to investigate the bona fides of the company and see exactly where we stand. It is a concern which has been established in Australia for several years. the majority being conserved by the conIts balance-sheets have been open for investigation. £180,000. Its nominal capital is £200,000, against which there are patent rights; wireless installations on various ships, worth from. £450 to £500 eachpractically, £100,000 in all; and workshops, plant, and machinery, roughly valued at about £50,000. The Bulletin, in September last, pointed out that the company was handling its reserves, which amount to £40,000, in a most conservative way. In any amalgamation which is formed, the company will, undoubtedly, be in a position to provide practically £1 for £1 for every share the Commonwealth is asked to subscribe. I would much prefer an arrangement under which Dr. Earle Page. the Commonwealth was left out as a partner. I understand that before the agreement before us was submitted a suggestion was made that the company was prepared to undertake the whole of the work if it were given some guarantee that it would not be interfered with over an extended period. There was no desire on the part of the company for a monopoly; all that was required was a guarantee and licence to operate. It is really for the purpose of examining the relative merits of the two propositions that I suggest there should be some delay. The question is whether there should be an arrangement by which the Commonwealth becomes a partner, or whether the company should be permitted to undertake the work itself; and it is one that to settle the matter when we return after the recess. long delay. Australia is remote from other parts of the world, and it is essential that we should take action before all the big wave lengths are commandeered by other countries. Already, many installations have been arranged for by other countries nearer Europe, and if we fail to secure those wave lengths our service will lose in efficiency. I think the arrangement made with reference to the directorate is one that can be endorsed.

But this Parliament may get back to tbe normal condition under which Parliaments generally work, viz., a six months' session in every year.

Parliament has remained almost continuously in session. the same thing. expectation..

The Estimates are usually submitted to the House about September or October, and they include amounts for various works and buildings. It often happens in respect of some work, the cost of which is expected to exceed £25,000, that after the money has been appropriated the investigation by the Public Works Committee takes place. The result is that, although the money has been made available by Parliament, a long delay takes place before we can get a resolution of the House that it is expedient to proceed w it h the work after it has been recommended by. the Public Works Committee. I am anxious that there shall be, as far as possible, an in vestigation of, and report upon, these works by the Committee before they appear on the Estimates, so that honourable members, when asked to vote money for them, w ill have, in addition to the recommendation by the Minister, the report of the Public Works Committee. Such a procedure would tend to keep our Estimates for works and buildings down to the actual proposals that we can immediately proceed with . Often the difficulty is that the Department supplies us w it h requests for works and buildings before they have been properly investigated, plans' and specifications for them prepared, and the actual estimates made. We are suggesting that when Parliament is net in session the Governor-Generalactually the Executive Council-ma y refer proposed works to the Publio Works Committee for investigation and report. sent of Parliament?

In my opinion, it is not necessary to have so large a Committee as we have at present. The work of the Public Works Committee and the Public.Accounts\Committee ought to be exceedingly valuable, and the Parliament should be particularly careful in determining their membership. I think that it would be sufficient to have six members on each Committee. If that reduction were made, each Committee, when required, could be divided. We could have sectional Committees of three each I strongly objected inquiring into different works at the same time, and thus a great deal of time could be saved.

I hope that the Government, when considering next year the exercise I subsequently adof economy in the administration of the -public Departments, will give attention to this suggestion. In advocating economy of administration we should see to it that that principle is applied to the Committees that are appointed to carry out the requirements of Parliament.

As a matter of fact, the Public Works Committee has an annual appropriation of some £2,000, and the year before last I do not think we expended more than £900. Last year, but for the Kidman-Mayoh Inquiry, there would have been a big saving also. I think that this amendment of the Act will prove advantageous to Parliament. MrM c WILLIAMS (Eranklin) [10.41].

408,Mr Gregory,"That is so. I rose 'suggestion just made by the Chairman of the Committee ( Mr Gregory), that its membership should be reduced, is an exceedingly good one. The probabilities are that if such a reduction were made the work would be carried out more expeditiously, and even better, than it is now. The principal Act provides that the Committee shall inquire into and report upon only sueh works as are referred to it by the Parliament; so that this Bill involves an entirely new departure from that principle. It gives the Minister power to refer to the Committee for inquiry any work that he thinks fit. cost more than £20,000 can be referred to it. is a dangerous procedure. It will allow the Minister to spend money without the approval of Parliament proposed work, but every reference by proposed work required to be sanctioned as him to the Committee will entail some provided in this section, and, upon receipt of expenditure. When the original Bill the was before Parliament it was considered preceding subjection."" that the provision that no work should be referred to the Committee except by direction of the House constituted an important safeguard. That safeguard is now to be removed. The system for which the Bill provides has not proved satisfactory in some of the States. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, and I hope that it will be rejected. [10.45] The order of leave is too limited to permit me to move an amendment which I had in mind, but I desire an assurance by the Minister( Mr Many other inquiries, however, will not Groom) that if the Bill passes, the Public Works Committee will not have the power to set out upon excursions beyond the boundaries of Australia in connection with any of its investigations unless the sanction of Parliament has been first obtained. power now. less, it has done so. The latest investigiven sum in any one financial year. gation of the Committee must have run into many.hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. work submitted to that body may involve mittee held up for the remainder of the equally great expense. [556] practice should be adhered to of Parliament first being required to approve of all works submitted before the Committee is .authorized to incur the heavy expenditure which the investigation of some matters must necessitate. Further, there should be a definite assurance that investigations shall not be permitted to extend beyond the Commonwealth without the sanction of Parliament. Question resolved in. the affirmative. !

Clause 2Section fifteen of the Commonwealth Publio Works Committee Act 1913-1914 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following subsection:"" (7.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section the Governor General may, at any time when tlie House of Eepresentatives is not in session, or is adjourned for a period of one month or upwards or for an indefinite period, refer to the Committee, for inquiry and report, the House of Eepresentatives shall deal with the matter as provided in the last proposedThat the following words be added:""Provided that the amount to be spent in any one investigation so submitted shall not exceed the sum of Two hundred pounds."" No matter what may be the merits of the proposal of the honourable member, I suggest that he will not be wise in insisting upon his amendment. There are bound to be teome investigations which will entail an expenditure of £300, and possibly more, but without the waste of one penny. cost more than about £50. vestigations which have just been referred to the Committee will certainly not cost more than a few pounds each, as some work has already been done upon them. there is the further safeguard, that the permitted to be spent is exhausted, say, It is possible that any future in six months, is the work of the ComThe present year?",86,Public Works Committeebill Second Readin G
