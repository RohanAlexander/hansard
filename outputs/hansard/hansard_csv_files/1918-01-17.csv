0,"Boust Of Eepresematibcs. Thursday, 17 January, 1918. Took The Chair At 11 A.m., And Read Prayers. Not Confined To Ministers And Party","are a number of notices of motion on the business-paper in the names of private members. Commonwealth Bank. Will the Government afford honourable members an opportunity, which was promised, to deal with these motions before we adjourn over Easter? that there will not be time for the consideration of these motions before the adjournment. S.S. the Ministeri n charge of shipping been drawn to a newspaper paragraph in which it is stated that an Inter-State steamer, the Victoria, is about to be sold to the Chinese Government? honorablo member to postpone the question until the motion of no confidence has been disposed of. has intimated that no question will be answered while the motion of no confidence remains on the business-paper. Debate resumed from 16th January(vide page 3096), on motion by Mr. That the House protests against(a) the repudiation of the pledges of the Prime Minister and other Ministers; (b) the political persecution of public men and otlier citizens and the pressunder the War Precautions Kegulations during the recent Referendumcampaign ; (c) the deprivation of statutory electoral-' rights of Australian-born citizens byregulation behind the back of Parliament; (d) the general administration of public affairs, and wishes to inform His Excellency theGovernor-General that the Government does not possess the confidence of the people of Australia. [ l l . o ] I think that every honourable member realizes the seriousness of the present position and the responsibility that rests upon us all. This responsibility isleaders; every honourable memher must shoulder his share of it. The recent voteon conscription has created a most serious -political situation. The few remarks that I have to offer now will be arranged underthree heads. These are-(1 ) the failure toI have one concerning the secureby conscription the necessary reinforcements for our men at the Front; (2) the 'extent to which Australia's relations'with other portions of the Empire and the Allies are affected by the vote; (3) theeffect of recent events on the public life of Australia. I am one of those whothought the holding of the first referendum on conscription a mistake. Theholding of the second referendum was ablunder. Although. I advocated connever addressed a meeting asking the electors to.vote "" Yes "" without feeling the impropriety of calling on women to vote to>send men to the/war. The proposition was not a fair one. Parliament should ' have taken the responsibility. I have never been able to follow the somewhat conflicting figures that have been published; but we know that the voluntary system in Australia has given magnificent results-results , it can be safely said, as good as, if not better than, those obtained by that system in any other country. Had any one, when, at the commencement of the war Mr Pisher offered 50,000 men for",20,Setup

7,Mr Mcwilliam S (Franklin),"' service abroad, declared that within three years there would be over 300,000 Austra' lian volunteers under arms, he would have been regarded aB an. exceedingly rash prophet. But the voluntary system failed in Canada, in New Zealand, and in England to give the necessary reinforcements, .and it has failed also in Australia in that respect. When Great Britain found that she could not get voluntarily the men whioh her authorities deemed necessary, she adopted the compulsory system. got by compulsion? men have been raised in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, of whom over 1,000,000 men have been obtained under the compulsory system. When the voluntary system failed in New Zealand, compulsion was adopted there also,and so, too, in Canada. The United States of America, I am reminded, took no chance. Australia alone of the belligerents has not adopted compulsion. To my mind, conscription is eminently a fairer way than the voluntary system of obtaining the men needed for a country's defence? and it is infinitely the more democratic way posed to Democracy. stone of Democracy is equality of sacrifice. During two electoral campaigns, at least, preference to unionists was a prominent issue, and in visiting the timber districts of my electorate, where most of the mill hands are unionists, I found it difficult to answer a question which they put to me, embodying an argument which members of the labour party have used with effect on every platform in Australia. They said, "" Isi t fair that when we have taken the risks of. dismissal and victimisation in striking to better our conditions, men who have stood outside and made no sacrifice should obtain the full benefits of unionism?"" That is the argument on which thc claims to preference to unionist's have been based. It is contended that it is not fair for men to remain outside of unions, and then to enjoy the benefits that unionism has won for unionists at their own risk. I now ask, Isi t fair for families to remain outside the military movement, and to accept the benefits conferred by the sacrifice of others? The best argument I have heard for conscription came from an old lady, the wife of a worker, during my first referendum campaign. Some one had asked, "" D o you think conscription fair? Do you think that a man should be sent to the war without his consent? "" This old lady said, "" I have three boys, one of whom is in the trenches, another in the hospital and a third just gone into camp, while' my neighbour here has five big boys, none of whom has enlisted. Do you call that fair? Can any one say that it is fair, democratic, or honest, that whole families should take no part in the war while others are sacrificing all their available men? There are families of three, four and five eligible boys not one of whom has enlisted. eight eligibles not one of whom has enlisted. main here are reaping the benefits of the sacrifices made by those who have gone to fight for freedom and liberty. My friends opposite oall those "" scabs "" who, refusing to join unions, enjoy the benefits which the unions have won. do about it ? who have prevented the Government from getting necessary reinforcements to say what they are going to do. What remedy will they apply? ber vote to keep; this party out of office, and thus prevent it from having an opportunity, to do something? with that matter when I come to the third part of my_speech. Those, who prevented an affirmative vote on the referendum by exerting all their influence in every electorate of Australia have wop. They have beaten us badly. MrM c WILLIAMS I never argue against facts. They won by a very large majority. Australia is therefore entitled to know what system they propose to substitute for the compulsory system. The offer made by the Prime Minister, and supported by the Minister for the Navy demands an answer. Tho Prime Minister has deliberately said, "" We want the help of honourable members on the other side, and if I am the man who stands in their",20,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

The Minister for the Navy, the Leader of the Liberal wing of tbe Nationalist Government said yesterday, "" Come in and help us; if I am standing in the way I will get out."" My honourable friends opposite cannot escape their full share of responsibility. Does any one say that men are not required to reinforce the Australians at the Front? An event happened at Hobart two days after the last referendum, which, if it had happened two days before the vote was taken, would have turned thousands of votes. A large transport put into HobaTt with New Zealand troops. They were not wounded or disabled men, but men being sent back to New Zealand on six months' furlough, to enjoy a well-earned rest. Why? Because there were other 'New Zealanders to take their places. Not one man can leave the Australian trenches or Australian hospitals in England to come to Australia for a rest, because there is no one to take his place. I know men who have been at the Front for three years. They have been wounded, sent back to England, patched up, and then sent back to the trenches. been patched up three times, and are again back in the trenches. Do not honourable members think that those men require a rest, and have well earned it? Honora'ble members opposite cannot on any political ground relieve themselves of their responsibility in this matter. Having defeated the reinforcements referendum it is up to them to do something to assist in order that our men at the Front, who are war weary, may be given a rest. Mr J. H . CATTS -Why do not honourable members on the other side give them a rest instead of trying to form a sixth division ? MrM o WILLIAMS that a sixth division was created. I have it on authority that I accept that the sixth division was formed only for training. It was never an actual fighting force, and was never in France. There was not one man of the sixth division who ought to be in the fighting line.. I repeat that my honourable friends opposite cannot relieve themselves of their responsibility in this matter. member aware that the Prime Minister. definitely stated that if the proposal were carried he would not call up more men under it than would be necessary to fill up the gaps caused by casualties? How. could men he brought -back if that course were followed ?. whether the Prime Minister said so or not, nor do I think that it matters very much. I am not taking the view of anj politician or anj member on either side of r the House, as the authority for what I state. I take the views of the officers in charge of our men, whose word no one -will challenge. no one will challenge tell us that moTe men are required. I have said that there are New Zealanders back in their own country enjoying a well-earned rest in their own homes and among their friends. They have been able to obtain six months' furlough, because New Zealand, having adopted conscription, there are other men to take their place. ' any of them are home on furlough. member will believe me when I tell him that two or three days before Christmas I saw many hundreds of New Zealanders in Hobart on the way to their own country on furlough. I do not believe they were men on furlough. at Hobart. The honourable member has only to take up any of the New Zealand newspapers to find out that what I am saying is correct. Those men have returned to enjoy what every one admits is a well-earned rest from the trenches, and they will be given a chance for their lives -I do not admit when they go back there. Not one Australian soldier can come home for a rest, because there is no one to take his place. That is an aspect of the matter whioh cannot be overlooked. What will be the effect of the referendum vote? With one exception, other portions' of the British Dominions have accepted conscription. We know that South Africa has put up as good a fight as any other portion of the Empirei n the honourable Africa itself. No men fighting under the British flag in this war have endured",21,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

WhatI understood was that the honourable member said he would not ask any one to leave Australia to fight, and that, when some honourable member interjected, "" Would you fight if the enemy came here?"" he replied, "" I would, if we first had the land divided between us, and we had something to fight for."" regard the honourable member, when he says he represents the workers of Australia, to be slandering those workers to an extent that no other public man in Australia has ever ventured upon. Where is' Australia being defended today? I remind honourable members opposite that in 1903 the first Commonwealth Parliament passed a Conscription Act for Australia. member has the record there, and he may refer to it . Mr J. H . CATTS -That was for home service. the Navy, for service overseas. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Navy men volunteer. say, a Defence Aet was passed which secured the f u l l and complete approval of the then Labour party. That Act provides that the Citizen Forces shall be liable to be employed on active service whenever called out by proclamation, and, with certain exemptions, it conscripts every man from eighteen to sixty years of age for the Citizen Forces. A proviso was inserted afterwards to the effect that the Military Forces, unless they volunteer, shall not be required to serve abroad beyond the limits of the Commonwealth or Territories under the Commonwealth. that? Mi-. McWILLIAMS -^Speaking from memory, I say that that Act had the full and complete approval of every member of the Labour party in this House. In , that same Act provision is made for f u l l and complete conscription for the Navy. And what does that Act mean? It means that if one shot were fired at Norfolk Island, 1,000 miles away, or in New Guinea, every man between the age of eighteen and sixty would be liable to 'be called into camp. Mr J. H . CATTS -Thes e are our own Territories. miles away; and yet, in the face of that Act, we are told that, if we adopt conscription, we are enslaving the people, ringing the death-knell of Democracy, -If that he correct, I can only and smashing trade unionism. shackles the people, they have been wearing shackles since the life of the first Parliament. Is there one honourable member opposite, excepting, perhaps, the sidine), who, if an enemy landed in Australia, would not be prepared to call out the whole fighting force of the country? If it is right to have conscription for the defence of Australia, what argument can there be against conscription when Australia is being defended far more effectively in Flanders, the North Sea, and Italy than it could be here? So long as Australia has to fight for her freedom and independence, I pray God, night and day, that the fight may always be 12,000 miles away from our shores. Does any bonorable member think that we could serve Australia better by waiting until the enemy came to Sydney Harbor, Port Phillip, or any other part of the coastline ? Do honorable members think that the real liberty and the real freedom of Australia could be better fought for here than it is being fought for to-day in Flanders? in Australia, though it is rapidly vanishing under your Government. orable member to read the newspapers of to-day, and Bee what his latest heroes, the Bolsheviks, are doing in Russia to-daythose men who, he hopes, are going to spread all over the world. made by German Jews.",24,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

82,Mr Considine,"Thes e are chargesBolsheviks doing in Russia to-day? The honourable member, of all the public men of Australia, is safer in Australia to-day than he would be in Russia. I wish to impress on the people of Australia, and through you, Mr Speaker, on this House, that the bogy about conscription, the prophecies of what it is going to do to the Democracy, ancl trade unionism of the country are fifteen years too l'ate. The law was passed in 1903, and we are living under it to-day. Are there any honourable members opposite, with, perhaps, the exception' of two, who would care to repeal that Defence Act? I do not think there are. myself for a few moments to the third section of my speech, and to say . that I cannot regard the situation as it exists to-day as in any way satisfactory. The Government, in my opinion, made a mistake in entering into the pledge they gave a.t Bendigo. The real object of a referendum is that people may give an unbiased vote, free from party influences, and without having to select any particular candidates or Government. That is tbe theory which caused many of us to favour the referendum, but our experience has proved quite the reverse. I say deliberately that there has been more ill feeling and bad blood engendered by the last referendum than by all the previous elections since we became a Oommonwealth. It is impossible to deny that, because the fact can be realized everywhere. The Government, in pledging themselves to stand or fall on the result of the re' ferendum, were defeating the very object of the referendum. ciple of it. the pledge was given, and I am one of many who think that the pledge should be honoured. The Commonwealth Parliament has, I think, stood as high in the estimation of the public as, perhaps, any Parliament in the world; it has set up a high standard, and has fairly well lived up to it ; and I am old-fashioned enough to think that, when a Government pledges itself to a particular line of policy, and declares that without that policy it will not continue to govern, it ought, when defeated, t.o honour its word. the 5th May? be led astray in considering these serious and important matters, and I ask to be permitted to state my case in my own way. The pledge at Bendigo was given as distinctly and as clearly as any public pledge could be. The Prime Minister, speaking for his Cabinet, declared that if the referendum were not carried the Government would not, and could not, govern Australia, and some of the members of the Cabinet went even further. The referendum was not carried; and I say, straight out, that I think the GovernI wish to address ment ought to have honoured the pledge. It is a serious thing in the public life of a country, if public men give a distinct pledge as to the adoption of certain principles, and, when defeated, abandon those principles. No Government can offend the susceptibilities of public opinion and escape unscathed. I agree.with the honourable member for Indi( Mr Leckie) that the great majority of Ihe people of Australia do not think that tendering a resignation for a few mintues or a few hours, taking it back and coming in again, is carrying out the pledge in the faintest degree. I shall vote just as I think I ought to vote, and mean to state my position clearly and distinctly. I think-and I shall not dilate on this matter, because it is a subject that should never have come before the House at all-that the Governor General made a great and serious mistake in sending that memorandum to the House. to discuss it, but a word of warning should be given to this extent-that it will not be possible for any Governor General to send a memorandum to this House without that memorandum being open to full and ' complete criticism. It was a proper memorandum to send to the Colonial Oflice, but it should never have been sent to this Parliament, and it must be clearly and distinctly understood that in not discussing it the members of this House are placing on themselves a very deliberate restriction. It must be understood, also, that if political memoranda are sent to the House by any one, and incorporated in the records",25,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

MrM c WILLIAMS I had no intenfair fight-and no fight was ever carried tion to reflect on the Governor General, and tried to avoid doing so, but I thought it necessary that that word of warning should be given. I do not' think the result of the referenda showed that the people had confidence in the party that was so badly beaten on the 5th May last. My honourable friends opposite carried two important referenda to the people, and told them that it was impossible to carry on without the powers asked for. good memory. My recollection is that the then Labour party took the referenda to the country asking for additional powers, and stating distinctly that they could not give effect to the Constitution without them. effect to the platform. could not give effect to their platform without those powers, what did they do? They are sent here to give effect to their platform. If they appealed to. the people saying, ""We cannot carry out our platform unless you give us these additional powers""-anc l on those occasions they went a good deal further-and if the people deliberately, on two occasions, refused to give them those powers, then, if it is right that honourable members on this side should now resign and allow the Opposition to come into power, they themselves should have .walked out of office and allowed the other side to come in on the defeat of their referenda. But they did not. gether. ence between orthodoxy and heterodoxy. One is ours and the other is the other fellow 3. J tween one man's'meat and another man'spoison. what is right for us is quite wroug for the other fellow. Yet, on this occasion, the party of twenty-two members opposite are making the claim to be allowed to violate every principle of responsible government and to 'go behind the distinct direction given by the people in May last after a on more vigorously from one end of Australia to the other. The people were asked to make a choice between the Liberal or National party on the one side, and the Labour party on the other, and by the greatest majority that has ever been given in the Commonwealth, with a clean sweepof eighteen seats in the Senate and two-thirds of tlie members of this Chamber,, the National party was sent in by theelectors, who decided that they should 1 govern Australia for three years, and that those holding the views of the Labour party should not govern Australia forthree years. There is no getting away from that position. the promise that you would not re-intro duce the referendum. mise was given, but a distinct promise wa» given that conscription would not be enforced .either by regulation or legislation until the people had had another opportunity of dealing with the matter. The one thing that overshadows everything else, to my mind, is the obtaining of reinforcements for the men at the Eront. In view of the fact that the greatest bitterness that has ever existed in this country was created by the late referendum, and that there is a personal hostility to an extent that has never previously existed against any Government in Australia against the present occupantsof the Ministerial bench, I have been thinking for a considerable time that it would be in the best interests of obtaining reinforcements if another Government occupied the Treasury bench. side of the House, and we are prepared to assist them. close our eyes to the fact, for it is impossible for any man to go into any por-",26,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

We pledged ourselves to help them when we sent them away, cheering them, singing ""Australia will be there,"" and .showering honours on them. We must not let them rot unaided in the trenches.

The only thing Australia has to do is to see that reinforcements-are obtained to back up her men. We are responsible. Some one said that we did not send them there. But we did send them there, and we must take the f u ll responsibility for having done so. The great responsibility, therefore, rests upon us to see that reinforcements are sent to help them.

Seeing that the honourable member for Eranklin( Mr Mcwilliams) has disclaimed, any intention to misrepresent either myself or the Governor General, I simply desire to say that. I have never at any time stated' that I would endeavour to prevent men from leaving this country who wished to go to fight across the seas. My attitude since the inception of the war with regard to the volunteers has been: "" Good luck to every man who goes; the only harm I wish him is that he comes back the same as he went,"" but my quarrel' is with the man who says that because he volunteered I Not one Australian can. bo shall be forced to go. do not propose to attempt to reply to the greater portion of the impressive speech of the honourable member for Fra.nklin, because, if he will pardon me for saying so, I do not think a great deal of what he has said has very much to do with the question before the Chair, which is the political character and capacity of the honourable members who occupy the Treasury bench. The Prime Minister has no regard whatever for public opinion, if we may judge by his action when the Leader of the Opposition moved his motion of censure. The Prime Minister then endeavoured to stifle all criticism of himself and his colleagues, except such as might take place during the discussion of a Supply Bill, when, in the midst of a debate about the Ministry, a member on the Ministerial side .might easily intervene to put the House off the track by discussing the administration of the Northern Territory, or Papua, or some other question.",27,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
103,Mr Considine,I wish to 'make a,28,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
104,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [12.0],"IThe plain duty of the Prime Minister -was not to allow any questions to be answered; not to permit a Supply Bill to go through, but to follow the invariable practice adopted by Prime Ministers since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. The practice was laid down by Sir Edmund Barton. ""When Sir George (then Mr) Reid gave notice of the first motion of censure in the Federal Parliament, Sir Edmund Barton immediately rose and moved, "" That the House do now adjourn."" The House accordingly adjourned, and on the next day of sitting, when the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) desired to ask a question without notice, Sir Edmund Barton at once replied, "" May I explain to my honourable friend that with a motion of censure pending it is the constitutional practice to suspend the answering of questions."" No business whatever was done until that motion of censure, the debate on which extended over a fortnight, had been disposed of. We can gather from the action of the present Prime Minister that he and his colleagues wish to curtail this debate as much as possible. There is no reason why we should go into recess other than that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Waft), both old political hands, no doubt recognise that if they can crowd the debate into a few days the press will have but little opportunity to report the speeches of honourable members. We had last night a splendid speech by the honsidine), and I think the press this morning devote just about twenty lines to it. The Prime Minister, in replying to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), after certain members sitting on the Ministerial cross-benches had informed the Government that if they persisted in the course they were taking they would wreck the purple adjective party, endeavoured to draw us off the track by sayingThere has been no reference to the great war. We stand on the brink of a precipice, over which we may topple to-morrow. Nothing was said of thc great and tragic situation as it presents itself to the world to-day we stand on the edge of a precipice Millions of Germans are said to have gone from the Eastern frontier, and strong forces are concentrating at Cambrai. Mr Higgs. In his endeavour to answer the Leader of the Opposition he was only repeating his referendum speeches. We had heard these statements from a dozen different platforms, but we had heard also, at the end of such remarks, a further statement to the effect that, in orderTo meet this situation, filled with the portents of evil, we require compulsory powers to send men abroad to light, and if you do not give us those powers we decline to govern this country; we will not attempt to govern it. If Ministers wish us to discuss the war, let them set apart a day, or several days, for its consideration. I should have liked to follow the example of the honourable member for Barrier, but I submit that we ought to discuss the war apart from any motion of this kind I propose to discuss the sins of the Government and the political crimes of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman. offers to retire from his present position if he stands in the way of the formation of a National Government. That offer is palpably insincere. Did he not tell the country that he would not attempt to govern unless conscription were agreed to? The time for him to have effaced himself, as he now says he is prepared to do, was when the Governor General asked him to form a second Administration. He should 'then have refused. I notice, too, that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook) states that he also is prepared to retire if he stands in the way. Do these two right honourable gentlemen speak for the.whole of the Ministry? I am anxious to hear other members of the Government in that regard. No one will believe the Prime Minister when he says that he is willing to efface himself. I well remember the time when, in 1904, there were three parties in this House, and I proposed a Coalition between the Labour party and the members of the Deakin party. The matter was brought up at our Caucus meeting, and the present Prime Minister, at that time a private member, bitterly and tearfully resented the suggestion. "" Supposing,"" said he, "" we do have to remain, as Mr By a hair's breadth Higgs suggests, on the Opposition side of the.House! What better could we wish for?

Other Mintoms, speaking at Moonee Ponds on 28th November, saidThe Ministry felt that, in view of the situadefeated on the question. They have been twice defeated, and on the second time more heavily than on the first. Mr Watt, the Minister for Works and Railways, also, in a speech at Kyneton, saidThe Government would stand or fall by the result. ' And the Prime Minister, speaking at Brisbane, saidThe pledge he gave to the people was that he I think he was referring to a would bring conscription forward again if the national safety demanded it.

I want now to put on record in Hansard the opiniori of the Melbourne Argus before the National party came to the conclusion that for their own safety they ought to stick together and put up with the Prime Minister and his colleagues for a little while longer.

The Argus continues-^Resignation and subsequent resumption of office, supposing the Governor General concurs, are not even a keeping of the letter of the pledge, and they are an unmistakeable violation of its spirit. The Melbourne Age, on the same date, referring to the pledge, statedThis declaration binds honest men as firmly as an oath. It has only one meaning He cannot be held responsible for the suggestions that have been made for evading his word of honour, but they suggest so great a depth of moral infamy in our political life that it is impossible to pass them by in silence. It would be a fraudulent design to deceive and betray. Honest men do not forswear themselves by subterfuges like this. When a Government stakes its honour on the statement that it will not "" govern the country"" in a certain event, every common sense person of decent instincts understands that the members of that Government will surrender their portfolios absolutely Were the dishonourable "" re-election "" or "" reconstruction "" subterfuge to find favour with a majority of the Hughes party, parliamentary government in this country would be befouled by a stain from which it could not be cleansed for many years. Political life would not longer be possible to the man of honour A Prime Minister who would seriously consider the hints thrown out to Mr Hughes to enable him to continue in power could not escape being ultimately hounded, out of political life as a dishonored and degraded man. His most sententious and solemn assertions would be mocked and given no credence. The charges of bad faith would be true, and there could be no answer. Tho party dishonourable enough to aid and abet him in his falsity could not hope to retain its repute amongst decent men of the Liberal party means too much to Australia at this time to allow of its being compromised, even by representations that it is capable of the dishonor contemplated by the vicious advice to construct under the same leadership. Honourable members may think, while they are in the Caucus room or in this House, tliat they can escape the influence of public opinion, but eventually they will realize that this is impossible.

[113]-2 modification of that view expressed; and, if so, did it also represent public opinion? Argus and the Age were trying, by way of protest, no doubt, to awaken members of tlie Win-the-war Goveirnment to a sense of their public duty, but, having failed, it appears that they were so afraid of the Labour party that they have decided, for the time being at least, to stand behind the Government and the honourable members who are supporting the Ministry. When the Win-the-war party came into office they did a most unusual thing. In structions were issued to Hansard to describe the Government not, as was customary up to that time, by the name, of the leader, such as "" The Deakin Ministry,"" "" The Barton Ministry,"" or ' the "" Reid-McLean Ministry, "" but as the "" Australian National War Government,"" which, in their opinion, was evidently the name to which they were entitled. I am wondering now what title they propose to claim and insert in Hansard to indicate this reformed and new Government. What are they going to call the Ministry? tions. and Railways says they are open to accept suggestions. That being so, I would, advise them to adopt the title given to the Ministry by the Sydney Daily Telegraph, which describes them as the "" LimpetM in is t r y , "" the limpet, as honourable members are aware, being a mollusc, without backbone, but w it h a tremendous capacity for The honour adhering firmly to the rock upon which it makes its resting place.

142,Mr Hlggs,"The honourable memberblue metal at tbe Minister's motor cara very wrong thing to do. Senator Millen, According to a press paragraphat the conclusion of his speech at Eockhampton, saidWith regard to a statement made by Mr ing a most careful inquiry into the matter. So Higgs at his meeting last night-that Mr Hughes had given permission to a German, Julius Blau, to go to America, although the Defence Department was against his goingI wish to say that at the time Mr Hughes did that, whatever he did, Mr Higgs was a member of his Cabinet. Mr Higgs knew all about it, and, if he thought it wrong, his dnty was to have denounced it and left the Cabinet. That was an audacious misstatement, not to call it by a harsher term. The case of Julius Blau was brought under my notice when I was a private member, in April, 1915, by a member of the New South Wales Grovernment, who objected to the then Attorney-General allowing this man to leave Australia, and I wrote to the Defence Department asking for anexplauation. I received this letter on the 29th April, 1915With reference to your letter of 23rd inst., enclosing certain questions relative to Julius Blau, & c , I desire to append for your information the following replies to same :(1) Yes; but he has not yet returned. (2) and (3) Permission was given at the request of the Attorney-General, who satisfied himself as to the case. T h a t is the actio n of the m a n w h o h a d the impudence to c a l l honourable members on t h is side pro-Germans. terested to notice t h a t the P r i m e M in is t e r , a discussion on the Estimates. The point in a speech in Sydney, issued a w a r n in g to l i a r s . He s a i d I want to warn every man in Australia that if, in this campaign, he utters lies he will utter lies at his peril. If anything be said by a speaker which is calculated to mislead the electors, unless he proves his words, his punishment will be swift and certain. Nobody in Australia was more unsuccessf ul than the Prime Minister in his endeavours to make accurate statements. In the 1916 referendum campaign the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) raised in this House the matter of the introduction of Maltese into Australia. The Prime Minister, in effect, denied that there was any truth in the honourable member's statement, ancl paragraphs were circulated throughout Australia headed, "" A lie nailed."" The Prime Minister held one of his investigations into the matter. When a question is raised in this House Ministers, of course, invariably promise to investigate it, but we never see the report. The Prime Ministei, on being questioned today in reference to the alleged importation ot Maltese under contract, said that he was havfar the Minister for External Affairs had not been able to obtain any evidence whatever tu support a prosecution under the. Act ; but Mr. Hughes continued, "" Whether there had been a violation of any of the provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act or not, the Government, during the war, does not intend to permit any importation of labour which amounts to a violation of the spirit of the Act, and it has decided to take such steps as are necessary to prevent any further introduction of any kind of cheap labour during the. war. The people of Australia may rest assured that cheap labour, no matter from what country it comes, will not be permitted."" What did he do? The Maltese referred to by the honourable member for Bourke were on a boat, and the Prime Minister sent them to New Caledonia, where they were kept at the public expense until the referendum campaign was over, and then they were allowed to return to the Commonwealth. I asked the Prime Minister whether, at any time, he had given instructions that the Maltese should be kept at New Caledonia, and he replied, "" No."" I then asked how it was that there appeared in the Estimates an item "" Cost of Maltese kept at New Caledonia, £3,008,"" and the Speaker called me to order, and said that I could not ask that I was v e r y in question, because I should be anticipating I am making is the utter unreliability of the Prime Minister's statements on all occasions when it suits him. honorahle member has read, the Prime Minister's promise was not to allow the introduction of cheap labour. ' I understand that the Maltese are not cheap labour. culty the Prime Minister experiences in observing his own regulations, which require that people shall not tell lies. I propose to deal with some of the methods adopted by the Ministry during the last referendum campaign to which I take exception. Many letters were written by me and other honourable members, and by parents, to the Minister for Defence asking that the soldier sons of those parents should be allowed to return to Australia. I sent one letter on the 2nd",33,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

Apparently the idea was that the letters should reach 'the voters just before polling day, but not in time to be used by public speakers who were advocating the "" No "" cause. This is the reply I receivedWith further reference to your letter of 2nd ultimo, on behalf of Mr W. Gerard, of Ambrose, who desired that his son be returned to Australia, I am directed to inform you that it is regretted Mr Gerard's request cannot be complied with at present. 2. In view, however, of the statement of Senator Pearce, to the effect that if the referendum proposals aro carried, one of the difficulties in the way of granting leave to members of Australian Imperial Force would be removed, and if the other difficulties could also be surmounted, the Commonwealth Government would do its best in an endeavour to obtain leave to Australia for them, the matter may be submitted for reconsideration should the vote on the referendum be "" Yes."" A similar letter was sent to me in reply to an application by Mr T. A. McCosker. of them. One reached me only yesterday. thc-se terms? liberate attempt by the Government to drive the parents of the soldiers into voting ""Yes,"" and was an unfair use of a Government Department. the Minister for Defence had stated that they could not bring the men hack because of the lack of ships. lack of ships. the members of the Government are sufficiently old parliamentary hands and political campaigners to leave a loop-hole of escape. Their promise was qualified to some extent. The anxious parent might read the letter, and he concerned only with the statement that if the referendum were carried there would be a possibility of his son returning. He would not notice the qualifying words, "" One of the difficulties would be removed,"" and "" if the other difficulties could be surmounted."" member deny that if the referendum proposal had been carried there would have been a better chance of bringing thosemen back ? that they had not the ships with which to bring back 5,000 men. and Railways has interjected that thisletter was signed by the Secretary of the Defence Department, and not by the Minister. It is quite in keeping with the habits and customs of the Prime Min. ister to get somebody else to do the dirty work. The letter was not even signed by Mr Trumble, but was signed by somebody else in his behalf. actually being blamed? attempt to deceive the parents of this country. We all know that it is impossible to give effect to Senator Pearce's scheme to return to Australia 5,000 of theoriginal ANZACs. How much would it cost to bring back a single soldier? Why, to return 5,000 men to our shores, to givethem four months' leave, and to pay them,, would cost, at least, half-a-million poundsit would cost; it ought to be done. ships to enable it to be done. I wish now to call attention to some of the unfair tactics that were adopted by the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign. In passing, I would like to mention a curious practice which has grown up in our public life owing to the methodspursued by the .right honourable gentleman. Prior to his advent to office, a daily newspaper, like the Argus, would neverdream of accepting gifts either at thehands of the Government or of any individual. But when the recent campaign ) started, what did the Prime Minister do ? Apparently,he visited the Argus officeand requested that the services of Mr Dumas, one of its first-class reporters, should be placed at his disposal. Thisgentleman, it is said, was paid £12 per week, in addition to an allowance of £T> > per week for expenses, to accompany the Prime Minister.

180,Mr Higgs,"Every man I know inbility of Democracy. Minister say that he never accepted any .outside position in connection with the Labour movement, but he was a travel ling organizer for the shearers of New South Wales. He secured his election soon after by denouncing Labour members for leaving the party. In those days such members were called bogus Labour members, and Mr Hughes secured his retur n for West Sydney by denouncing Mr. J. D . Fitzgerald and others. It may be said that the Prime Minister, deserves great credit for having succeeded in reaching his present position from so lowly a start. Australia is a place of great opportunities. said by many persons, that anything is possible in a Democracy. It is admitted, that the Prime Minister is clever, but his methods are inexcusable. A t the time. I speak of he was helped by the man who is now Premier of New South Wales. Many a pound of Mr Holman's money Mr Holman was then single-wen t to man's opinion of Mr Hughes to-day. Commenting on the acceptance by Mr Hughes of the commission to form a new Government, the Premier of New South Wales saidI have long known that Mr Hughes is a man whose pledged word is absolutely worthless, but I confess I am amazed and depressed to find that the whole of his colleagues have joined him in this exploit. I can only attribute it in certain cases to a sense of mistaken loyalty to a man who has never been loyal to anybody or anything. If vou want another opinion upon the Prime Minister, whose word cannot be relied on, and whose one characteristic is ingratitude and disloyalty to his friends, I refer you to Mr Beeby. Beeby, Holman, and Hughes used to go about together making speeches. name a dozen other men in New South Wales who have expressed a similar opinion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in m y opinion, is unfit to occupy his position, and has no right to be allowed to sit on supporting h i m . I sincerely hope that honourable members on the Government sidej who in private have expressed their opinion, will have the courage, when the vote is taken, to record it as they I haye heard the Prime ought to do-as the vote of men who believe that the Prime Minister's word ought not to be taken in the Parliament of this cpuntry. with a great amount of reluctance to speak on the present occasion. I do so, principally to remove certain misconceptions T regarding myself, and also certain misconceptions regarding the position, as I look at it , which has arisen in the course of the debate. A t the outset I have to inform my honourable friends opposite-thoug h I am afraid that when I make the statement* they will regard me 'as something of a backslider-that I am unable to support the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition,. support the motion is not' that it is an attack on the Government of a sufficiently definite character, but that it does not go far enough. It only touches the fringe of the great matter that ought to concern this Parliament-the only matter, indeed, that ought to concern this Parliament and the people of Australia at the present 'juncture-and that is the prosecution of the war. It is a misfortune, only a little short of the result of the last referendum, that we should be discussing a motion of this kind at the present time. I say, therefore, that 1 cannot support the motion; but I shall give, under this motion, a few reasons why, and by reason of the latitude allowed in debate on occasions of this kind, the House should i m prove the present position. There is one characteristic of this debate, common, I think, to all the honourable members that have spoken and that T is the distance they have kept away from the particular motion. It is, indeed,significant of-shal l I call it?-the lack of concentration of honourable members oppoI could site that they have gone all round the compass, and discussed such matters as the Taylor card system, the prices of rabbits, and so for t h , at a time when Australia is waiting, and waiting impatiently, for a lead on a question that materially concerns our honour and our very existence. the benches opposite by those One of the most interesting speeches that we have heard, and one that was successful in regard to the distance that was kept from the subject-matter of the motion,.",40,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

188,Mr Fowler,"The reason I do notwas that by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) last night. Because that honourable member, in keeping away from the motion, got somewhat near to the particular matter that I have at heart-the prosecution of the war I propose to follow h i m for a few minutes. He spoke about the position in Russia, and argued that revolutions, such as have taken place there, would probably do more to win the war than the armed efforts of the Allies. L e t me suggest to the honourable member that if the revolution is going to be carried on by the impractical and absurd methods of those responsible for it , instead of there being a successful winning of war rivet the fetters of Prussian absolutism on Democracy. revolutionary gentlemen talk w i th their heads in the clouds, the Prussians are getthing through their legs, and establishing a condition of affairs in Russia that may yet act disastrously,not only on that counthat, in his dreams of youthful ambition, try, but on the whole of the world. That is, indeed, a possible development. When one remembers that all revolutions of a similar character that have taken place have simply set of the clock of progress-in some instances for a hundred years-as in the case of the Prench Revolutionthen I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald), in his insistence on the principle that evolution and order point the only safe way in which humanity can progress. But the honourable member for Barrier, in the course of his interesting address, showed the sources from which he had obtained the political knowledge that he was expounding to lis. He talked, in fact, that kind of political pabulum which has emanated from Germany, and which, as we have every reason to believe now, was concocted for foreign consumptiona political pabulum which, being disseminated throughout the world, to the detriment of the cause of the Allies, has been abandoned at the first opportunity by the very people who were responsible for it in Germany-thos e people who are to-day seeking, in spite of their teachings in regard to Socialism, to aid the Prussian rulers in their onslaught upon freedom. repudiated Tiis principles ? the one solitary honest man in the whole crowd, who has remained consistently true to the teachings of his school, and has not abandoned them like the great mass of the German Socialists. The honorable member for Barrier, as I say, showed the source from which he has obtained his inspiration, by his use of terms that are utterly foreign to Australia -term s which practically have no"" meaning in a country such as this. He talked about the Australian "" proletariat."". It is a mere travesty to apply a word of tliat kind to the masses of Australia. There are no people in the the world belonging to the class to which the thereby it may yet assist to honourable member refers, who have a better standing, or more control of the While those political situation, than those referred to by h i m as the Australian "" proletariat."" But I know that when he talks in 1hat way he has in his mind heroic pictures of the French revolution. I have no doubt he sees himself, some day or other, standing in a dramatic attitude on a barricade in Collins-street, with a red flag in one hand and a bloody sword in the other, back the hands waiting for the Australian "" proletariat"" to bring him the heads of the capitalist magnates of the country. The honourable member for Barrier is, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of considerable intellect and imagination; and if the picture I have drawn of his mental attitude be a correct one to-olay, I venture also to suggest that in another ten years he wil l be laughing at the speech he made in the House last night. . The honourable member spoke about landless Australians, and he gave us to understand that there is only one way in which, land can be obtained for the Australian ""proletariat,"" namely, by bloody revolution. Does the honourable member realize that the Australian "" p r o l e t a r i a t "" have only to exercise their votes to get all that even he desires for them? To talk about revolution in a country like Australia is to indicate an intellect obsessed by teachings which are utterly foreign to Australia, and have no real practical relation to the actual conditions of this Commonwealth. The honourable member gave us his assurance that the war in which we are engaged is a trade war. For the purposes of",41,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
189,Mr Considine,Has Dr. LiebEnecht,42,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
190,Mr Fowler,"No ; Leibknecht isargument we will admit that such is the case, in the sense, at any rate, in which he puts it, and say that the war has really been caused by a desire for trade by the dominant nations of the world. A burglar has no doubt the same commercial instinct, though somewhat misguidedly he desires to trade in his own way. However, if the honourable member found a burglar in his own house some night, brutally maltreating a child or a mother, in order to stifle their cries, while he went on with his business, I ask how the honourable member would treat him? How is the honourable member prepared to treat the German burglar? Would he leave him severely alone to bayonet old men, outrage women, and starve little children to death ? I am sure the honourable member would do nothing of the kind; but that if he. were brought face to face with these horrors he would probably be one of the first to "" wade in "" with rifle and bayonet. I wish to follow up that question with yet another. After the German burglar has in turn devastated Belgium, France, and Great Britain, is the honourable member for Barrier prepared to stand helplessly by while he arrives in Australia and proceeds to carry into execution here his own particular methods? member admits the basis of my argument he reduces the quarrel to a squabble between burglars, and not between an honest man and a burglar. ber perceives the point of my argument. I am glad that he does. If he does not see also that the relationship of Germany to the countries she has attacked is actually that of a burglar in more or less defenceless households, then he has failed altogether to gather any elementary lesson whatever as to the meaning of this war. honourable member for Perth has himself a good imagination. orable member for Barrier possesses the quality of imagination, and if he looks at the position as I have put it to him, I feel sure he will realize that, remote though we are from the theatre of war, it is yet the right of Australians to do for others the duty that would be overwhelmingly a duty and a necessity in our own case here. I was surprised to hear during this debate an effort made in defence of voluntarism. It is, to me, one of the mysteries of the Australian position that nearly every honourable member opposite, while professing the principle of State Socialism, denounces conscription. A fundamental principle of State Socialism is that the interests of the community are greater than those of the individual. And upon that principle State Socialists proceed by compulsion to impose on the individual those necessary duties without which society cannot be maintained and cannot progress. One of the most elementary duties of any society is that of self defence. If compulsion is necessary in lesser matters why in the name of logic and common sense should it be withheld in regard to the all-important duty of defending ourselves? I have not yet heard any attempted explanation of that anomaly, and am sure I shall wait in vain for it . There is not one honourable member opposite who does not in his heart and soul realize that he occupies a false position in this regard, and that Democracy throughout the world, and in all ages, has imposed upon all its citizens, and must of necessity impose upon them, the one overwhelming obligation of fighting in their own defence. I come now to the more practical phases of this subject, and have a few observations to make concerning the speech to which we listened from the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley). That honourable member' is a very cheerful optimist. I would remind him that in nature the most cheerful optimist in the face, of danger is the. ostrich. It can put its head in the sand while its tail sticks up high in |he horizon, and convince itself that all is well. The honourable member, evidently a student of strategy, has given us assurances that all is well with the Allies. I do not think he went further, however, than to show that we could hold our own against the enemy. If we do no more than that-if the war comes to an end with us holding our own and no more-the n we shall have absolutely failed in regard to every object we had in view when we entered upon the conflict. If peace comes to the world with anything like the present military situation Germany will have absolutely won.' It will",42,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

The honourable member for South Sydney gave us the assurance that men were not particularly needed; that we had more than enough at the Front. For an answer to that statement we have only to look at the cables in yesterday's newspapers setting out that the Minister for National Service( Sir Auckland Geddes), who is not a military man, impressed upon the House of Commons the absolute necessity for increasing the man-power of the Allies. Minister, speaking in the House of Commons on the previous day, said that the question of man-power was "" the central problem of the war. at the present time is men for the A r m y . "" A little further on he is reported to have said, "" Our enemies are staking everything on our failure to solve fhe manpower problem.""

It is our worse, if not for U3, then for our posterity. I want now to go back to the causes mitted.

The people of Australia, in the Mr Fowler. What help would he get from conduct of the affairs, of this country. Speaking for myself, I have no hesitation whatever in taking any action in regard to this Government, which, in my judgment, may be necessary, on the present occasion. It will not. be of very much advantage to discuss in detail the events Beyond question we shall be leading up to the present situation. There is/ a well-known saying, worthy of general acceptance, that we should let bygones be bygones; but, on the other hand, it is our duty, as members of this Parliament, to learn from experience and, if neecssary, to criticise the duty also, on special occasions to take whatever steps may be necessary to put right any errors they may have comfirst place, the Prime Minister is t present, and in the second place, it is on account of illness that he is not I shall, therefore, confine myI dissent altogether self as nearly as possible to those matters Now, I maintain that the whole series first place, did not want tliese referenda, and did not ask for them. They were imposed upon the electors by the Prime Minister, and they were the outcome of cowardice on the part of the Government, led by the Prime Minister, whose failure to face the situation, and whose thrusting of the responsibility upon the people brought, about the only result that could have been anticipated. sentatives of the solitary State that has not failed, and in view of the succession of blunders perpetrated by the Leader of the Government, from the time that he rounded the men of Australia into those home defence camps down to the day when he imposed the national police force upon Australia for some trumpery reason or other, it is a matter of surprise to me that there should have been a million electors who could still vote in favour of conscription. No other country in the world could have done better than Australia in regard to this matter. The people of this country rose to the occasion as well as could have been expected by any man with a proper conception of human nature and an understanding of the political situation. In every community there is only a certain proportion of people capable of putting patriotism before selfinterests. In every Community there are slackers and those who are constitutionally averse to any new proposal, particularly of this kind. I want also to emphasize the point that the vote given at the last referendum was, to a large extent, not a vote against conscription at all. This may seem a strange statement to make, but I contend that tens of thousands of people voted "" No,"" not because they were against conscription, but because they were against the Prime Minister; and, in addition, tens of thousands of people voted "" No"" because they objected to having this responsibility thrust upon their shoulders by the Prime Minister. I majority would readily enough from a Government ancl Parliament that imposed it upon them, but would vote "" No "" every time as a protest against the action of a Government in placing upon the electors the responsibility of deciding the issue. When we remember that the difference between the "" Yes"" and the "" No"" votes is represented by only about 4 per cent, of the population, honourable members will see the strength of my contention. We have had an offer from the Prime Minister to stand down if that course of action would lead to effective co-operation of members in the prosecution of this war, and I ask the members of the Opposition to accept it. I quite agree that tlie presence of the As one of the reprePrime Minister at the head of this Government is detrimental to the effective prosecution of the war by a united Australia. More than that, I say that the internal affairs of the Commonwealth will suffer so long as the Prime Minister remains at the head of any Government. By the violence of his propaganda work in connection with the, referenda, particularly the latter one, he has brought Australia within measurable distance of civil war. He has created a spirit of bitter antagonism that was foreign to Australia until now, and I believe that it would be a good thing for Australia, not only in regard to the prosecution of the war, but also in regard to the management of our internal affairs, if the Prime Minister were to stand down. He has made an offer to do so, and I ask the Opposition whether it is not their duty under the cirIcumstances, and in the interests of the people they represent, to accept the proposal. undertaking more than we could on his word outside this House! has been made before Parliament and the country, and if honourable members oppo( site doubt its sincerity they have a very easy method of testing it. The Minister for the Navy made the same proposal, and I say frankly that the offer would have come with better grace before Ministers had entrenched themselves in the position in which they are now. But the offer has believe a substantial been made, and I ask honourable members accept conscription opposite to take it on its face value, and, at any rate, accept it.

A verywhere we are trending may be gathered from a casual observation dropped today by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr MoWilliams), one of the mildestand invalid, who are bearing the brunt of mannered men who ever scuttled a ship or cut a throat. This Christian gentleman, for whom I entertain a great respect, said something about whether or not we shall surrender the German colonies as part of the peace terms into which we shall ultimately enter.

I ask him and honourable members opposite to try and understand the differences which separate them from those upon this side of the chamber. whether this is a war for annexation, or whether it is not.

These are the Micawbers of compulsion. This war is being carried on, not merely by the brave boys who are fighting at the Front, but by the women and children, the aged and infir m of this country. When we speak of our inflexible resolution to carry on this war, sitting in soft places in this Parliament, receiving our emoluments and increasing our emoluments for doing the same work as we did previously, we forget that it is the women and children, the aged the struggle everywhere. In Britain, surrounded as she is by those cursed engines of militarism, the submarines-the productions of companies from which our own people have been drawing dividends in the past-peopl e are being starved. But who are being starved? Think you, it is our political leaders? Think you, it is the neurotic patriotic British aristocracy? Think you, it is the persons who have shouted loudest that we are boys' of the bull-dog breed? Not for a moment. The persons who are being starved in I ask them to say Britain are again the women and children, the invalid and the aged.

""We have, it is said, enjoyed the protection of the British Navy. Hypothetically, that is quite true. Probablyi t is quite true. But the fact remains that 12,000 miles from the seat of war, unattached, unviolated, and unthreatened, there have either gone from this country or there have volunteered to go, little less than 500,000 souls out of a small population of 5,000,000. Instead of congratulating Australia upon its unexampled record, instead possible, the courage that its people have exhibited, and which orable members, who are supposed to lead it , come here to decry Australia's effort, and to say, with deliberation and without shame, that she has debased and disgraced herself in the eyes of the world, as the honourable member for Plinders( SirW ill i a m I r v in e ) grossly libelled her by saying only a day or two ago. We may not be represented at the Peace Conference. I hope, at least, that we shall be represented at the next War Conference, and if we"" are I care not whether we are represented at the Peace Conference at all. I hope that never again in the history of democracy w ill the sons of Australia be dragged across the seas either compulsorily or voluntarily to fight in a war which they had no voice in making. Let us hope to see the end of. secret diplomacy, the end of those conditions which have led to this world calamity. I freely admit that having, with others-as I have done -accepte d the conditions under which we live, knowing that the obligation in war rested not with the people but with the various Foreign Offices and secret juntas of the gilded aristocracy which have engineered these things in the past, I have my f u l l weight of responsibility in connection with this war, as other men have. Having accepted the conditions under which it was rendered not only possible, but also inevitable, it behoves us to stand by our Allies and our fellow Australians who have gone to fight this war beyond the seas. We have been asked for suggestions. ' I cannot speak for my party. The Leader of the party speaks for the party. orable member is not speaking for the party. member is glad that I am not speaking for the party before he knows what I am going to say.

Now for the future. Let us see that recruiting is made a success; let us do our duty to our soldiers at the Front; let us t r y some new methods of doing it ; let us t r y some new Government for doing it . Although many Governments have failed in the judgment of the people of Australia-and that judgment h a been doubtless right-the s present Government enjoys the unique distinction of being the only one in history, to my knowledge, which is at once a self-confessed and self-demonstrated failure. Ministers came into oflice declaring that nothing mattered but the war and the winning of the war. They went on to the .Treasury bench declaring that their sole object was to give effect to a policy .of winning the war. They declared that voluntarism had failed, and they passed a measure of taxation designed to' buttress up the wealthy in this country, and secure them their dividends, and another measure which was a penal tax for the purpose of doing by an in of this country to fight direct method of legislation what they were fearful of doing, and dared not do, by the direct method of legislation, namely, penalizing men who had not gone to the war. That was their record in regard to winning the war.

214,Mr Brennan,"I did not knowby what they were pleased to call the voluntary method. If a chorus of voices, all affirming the same thing from their own experience, could be taken as a proof that voluntarism had failed, then, according to Ministers and every member of their party, the policy of securing recruits by voluntarism had failed.' Iti was that fact which drove them to the referendum, and, having gone to the referendum, they said, "" We are depending, as a last and only resource, upon this method of obtaining recruits. This is our win-the-war policy. Nothing else matters. This, and this alone, is the policy by which we can"" win the w a r . "" This was, as the Prime Minister called it , their "" Rock of Ages.""

Nothing has been defeated except their policy, and they took good care not to attach their fortunes as sitting members to their policy. was your party defeated on its Constitution Alteration referenda? serted that a Government is bound to go out of office when, having submitted a question to a referendum of the people, that question has been answered in the negative. The taking of a referendum is an executive act which should not affect the l if e of a Government, and it was a most improper course of procedure on the part of the present Ministers, on the recent appeal to the people, to deliberately weight the promises. great majority of this country are irrevocably committed against the policy of conscription, I realize also that there were some thousands, nevertheless, who were led on by that aureole hue of hope that by voting in the negative they would forever get rid of Hughesism in all its forms. Notwithstanding that fact, it was an improper thing to load the scales on an appeal to the people of this kind. Nothing could make the question vital to the Ministry but their own deliberate act. The terms of the motion moved by my leader include, three specific charges brought against the Government, and the first charge relates to the repudiation of pledges by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government. One would think that such an allegation was sufficiently definite and sufficiently serious to merit a definite and serious reply. My leader stood in the position of Crown Prosecutor. If I may be permitted to use a somewhat sinister metaphor, the Government stood in the position of a They not only voted Ministers man in the dock. Serious charges were -levelled against them; the honourable memY e t Ministers ber for Yarra( Mr Tudor) collated the evidence in support of those charges, Wavand he did not go beyond nor stop short of the material facts necessary to sustain the them. What did the Prime Minister say in reply? "" The honourable member In one sense, as for Yarra comes up and makes charges against me, but he says nothing about Ministers the battle on the IsonzoF r o n t ; nothing CanI be about the Russian revolution, or the attitude of the Bolsheviks, the ""Ukranians, or the Cossacks; and nothing about the. position on the WesternF r o n t . "" The right honourable gentleman might also have said with equal truth and potency that the Leader of the Opposition had said nothing about the procession of the equinoxes, or about an eclipse, though heaven knows a reference to an eclipse would have been relevant enough.i All that I have never as the honourable member for Yarra did was to confine himself to the cold and formal language of a serious personal and political indictment. Certainly it was very unkind of him, and it drew from the Prime Minister the rejoinder that the honourable member had dealt with things infinitely petty and in finitely mean. Maybe the honourable member was right. He was dealing with the personal reputation of the PrimeM in scales with threats or ister. Perhaps the right honourable gentleAlthoughI know that the man adequately assessed it as something",50,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
215,Mr Gregory,On how many occasions,51,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T
216,Mr Brennan,"infinitely petty and infinitely meanand, no doubt, painful task on the part of one who has a larger measure of Christian charity towards delinquents than could ever lay claim to. Nevertheless, although it was a matter of that kind, he dealt with it in the way I have described-in the cold and formal language of a person making out a cruel, hard case, but one which, in the interests of political decency in this country, had to be made. The Prime Minister's answer was, "" I am here. We are here. That is your trouble."" It is our trouble; it is not a trouble that we have brought upon ourselves, or to which we have been a party, or at which we have connived; but everything which debases the public life of this country debases, to some extent, the reputation of every citizen of this country. To that extent it is our trouble. That is why we have launched this motion, and w ill support it to a man. Por just one moment let me re-examine the facts which have been examined from other aspects by other honourable members on both sides of the House. I do not in tend to repeat the collated evidence to which I have already referred, amassed w i th crushing conclusiveness by the various members on this side of the House. Sufficient for my indictment are the words spoken at BendigoI tell you plainly that the Government must have this power. It cannot govern the country without it. It will not attempt to do so. Those words were uttered in circumstances of extraordinary solemnity, and in an extraordinary solemn manner, and they were uttered more than once in effect. They were uttered, it is true, in the presence of the numerous band of claqueurs, and hangers on, and boosters up, who followed the Prime Minister around this country, and who, in one way or another, contributed to those -nauseating columns that rendered the morning papers of the time even more painfu l than usual. it is true, to persons of that kind, but they were uttered also to seriousminded men and women. uttered to men whose sons were fighting at the f r o n t ; they were uttered to tearstained women hanging on his lightest word and believing that his lightest word might be accepted at its face value. They were uttered in the presence also an infinitely of hundreds of .people who realize that this country and the world to-day is bathed in blood by reason of the fact I that in the centre of Europe a man repudiated his pledge. That is the fount and origin of this war, and if I am expected to cynically disregard the seriousness of the position that has been created in this House, I tell you that I have no intention to make myself a party to this debasement. Although my name in politics may sing very small indeed to future generations, my reputation is still worth something .to me, and if in a hundred' years there be any readers of the forgotten tomes associated w i th this House they w ill find that I at least stood up in protest w it h other men against a deliberate act of falsehood, in the presence of tragic circumstances of unexampled importance, on the part of the chief political representative of Australia. Then followed that petty jugglery which we saw, that procession backwards and forwards to a certain place-tk e pro-. cess of "" in again, out again,"" as my humorous friend from Henty rightly terms it . There was nothing then about the position on the Isonzof r o n t ; there was no concern then for some days about the relative importance of the Bolsheviki and other persons in Russia. There was a continuous movement backwards and forwards, to see how the Government could get r i d of the pledge, or shunt it from one to another, in order that the odium of it might be transferred or at least distributed. It does not need a very vivid imagination to picture what happened. The Government met. The first thing they said was; "" What are we to do about it ? The position is difficult; we ought to resign; we are in honour bound to resign, and everybody here knows that we are not going to resign."" "" Hear, hear,"" from the Postmaster-General. honourable member, because it is untrue. "" W h a t were they to do about it ?

The party said to them, paraphrasing a well-known coupletWe could not love the half so much, Loved we not honour more. and the Government repliedWe could not love the half so much, Loved we not office more. The party said to the Government, "" You must go away and settle this matter consistently with honour, and the only limitation we put upon you is that you must not settle it. in the only honourable way in which it could be settled, that is, by advising the Governor General to send for the Leader of the constitutional Opposition."" see what a happy position that placed the Government in . The Government went away and said to one another, ""The party tells us we must do it in the only honourable way open to us, subject to the fact that we must not do it in the only honourable way possible."" "" Therefore,"" they said, "" having been to the party, we will go to the Governor General."" Honourable members know what happened. The Government came down to -the House, and the Prime Minister placed on the table a memorandum. I am very glad to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Speaker has not taken the view which I thought, from casual observations on his part, he intended to take, that the memorandum was not a subject for discussion i h this House. was quite prepared to move that his ruling be disagreed with if he had contended that a memorandum submitted for the consideration of the House, and to influence the deliberations of the House, could not be discussed. It appears now that we may discuss it, subject only to the fact that we must make no reflection on the Governor General. readily accept, and beyond which I have not the slightest intention of going.

Nobody will be in the least deceived.

I can scarcely conceive of a more serious charge against a Government than that of manipulating the statute law of the country by weighting the scales against one party to legal proceedings for the sake of obtaining political advantage. That charge I make against this Government. It is almost inconceivable that some members of the legal profession should have sat quietly by while this outrage was being perpetrated, and should now sit quietly by while it is being condoned. The time for an appearance to a summons for an offence against the regulation is limited to forty-eight hours. It must be remembered that the penalty on conviction is not a small fine, or a short term of imprisonment. The charge for which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who takes even tragedies in good humour, was arraigned ' at Maryborough, and on which he was honorably acquitted, carried with it the penalty of six months' imprisonment or a fine not exceeding, I think, £100=Twenty-four hours' less notice is given t'o a defendant under this regulation than he would be entitled to if charged with ample. the honourable member's pardon-wit h some other trifling offentee.

CATTS -My case came on on the Friday, so that an adjournment for forty-eight hours was impossible. bourne, of which I know something, a lady was charged in a summons served at her house when she was away at Oolao doing work for the country, and could not have reached Melbourne, after she had heard of the summons, in time to make an answer to it . We pointed this out to the magistrate^ and the barrister who appeared to prosecute graciouslyI use the word advisedlyconsented to apply for an adjournment, because, as he said, "" You teannot do so."" Only the prosecutor could obtain an adjournment in these cases. This case Was therefore put off until the Tuesday. The defendant was charged w it h having made false statements regarding the vote of the soldiers at the Front. The authorities probably thought that we would make no defence, and pay a fine, but we were determined to prove the truth of what had been said by calling for the records of this House, and bringing as witnesses returned soldiers whom we knew had i m portant information on the subject. But we knew that we could not fight the case to a finish adequately unless we got an adjournment, and our application for the adjournment needed was strenu. ously opposed. But the police magistrate on the bench, after reading the regulation, said that "" as it was contrary to natural justice he must disY e s , or-beggin g regard it , "" and a leader of the Bar, in putting the same view, said that it amounted to a direction to the Court as I had only twentyto how it should t r y the case. Consequently we obtained an adjournment in spite of and in breach of this iniquitious regulation, and ultimately gained the acquittal of the lady. In probably a dozen instances the Crown charged perT h e interjection sons with making false statements; but to my knowledge in only one tease was a conviction secured, and even that is the subject of an appeal. Nothing of the kind has ever happened in this country before.

230,Mr Brennan,"In a case at Melthat is not the worse of the matter. There is this aspect of it which I mnst not overlook. I ask honourable members to mark this, and let lawyers on the other side say what they think of it. I should like to know what the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), who, judging by interjections and observations he has made in this House, is disposed to be a fair-minded man, and as I know him personally I have always believed that'he is, thinks about it. ' The averment of the prosecutor that the defendant is the person who made or authorized to be made thc statement in respect of which the proceedings have been instituted, or was the printer, publisher, or distributor of the advertisement, notice, hand-bill, pamphlet, or , card containing the statement, shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the conthe people, and promoting recrimination trary. will find the same provision in the Customs Act. member for Grey( Mr Poynton) may think that it is possible by searching the records of the jurisprudence of this country to find a single parallel to,that provision deeming such an averment proved in the absence of proof to the contrary, but it is not. There are many cases in which, the prosecutor having proved certain formal facts, the onus of proof is passed on to the defendant, but there is no case of this kind. vision in the liquor laws, and in the Customs Act of the Commonwealth. ber for Grey does not know what he is talking about. The honourable member will have no difficulty in finding that the burden of proof in certain circumstances is placed on the defendant, but I say that he will not find a case parallel to this regulation providing that the mere averment, of the prosecutor that the defendant is the person who made, or authorized to be made, the statement in respect of which proceedings have been instituted shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. Not only is that law improper and inequitable; not only is it in essence weighted against the defendant, but, .if anything could be worse than that, this is made worse by the fact that the Government would not prosecute except in the case of charges made against their political opponents. That is a very grave charge. It is worthy of a serious answer from the Government, and it should be answered also by the party opposite, because it goes to the very base of British justice. If what I have said is true, and I shall prove it, it amounts to a prostitution of British justice. One could hardly make a stronger statement than that. Let me give honourable members one illustration in proof of what I say. The Prime Minister in proceeding up, and down this country, spitting venom and vituperation wherever he went, dividing and ill-feeling, calling out the police here and creating new police there, and making violent Imperialistic and jingoistic speeches dividing families and unmaking friendships, referred to three things more frequently than to anything else, namely, Sinn Fein, Industrial Workers of the World, and a certain ecclesiastic, who got on his nex-ves, and apparently afterwards got on his chest. His greatest trouble was the question of Sinn Fein. I am bound to say in passing that the right honourable gentleman knows as much about Sinn Fein as does the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald), and that is making a pretty strong statement to indicate his want of knowledge of the subject. There was a meeting held in the' Guild Hall, in Melbourne. This hall is leased to the Women's Political Association. There they hold meetings, and other Christian democrats also hold meetings there from time to time. There Avas a meeting, held there shortly before the referendum was taken, which was referred to in the Argus newspaper of the morning following in terms which I shall quote from ai declaration made by Miss Cecilia John, whose name I have permission to use. and who was one of the lessees of the Guild Hall. The Women's Peace Army have a flag, which was flying, and had been flying at all material times, over the Guild Hall. I shall read Miss John's declaration to show how the Argus treated the meeting to which I have referred on the morning after it was held. The declaration includes the name of Miss Vida Goldstein,",55,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

You must be thoroughly seized of its i m portance and urgency. Your recent addresses have been devoted mainly to exposing and condemning Sinn Fein. We owe almost entirely to your distinguished eloquence our information that it is rampant, and that it stands for disloyalty and rebellion. It is stated that the Sinn Fein flag was flown over a city building in a conspicuous place, and that it was hauled down. It is, as you must admit, a grave statement. It is either true or not true. There has been either open disloyalty or misstatement of fact likely to affect the voting at the referendum. We submit that either the publisher or the disloyalist should be dealt w it h . We have submitted a sworn declaration to the effect that the statement is false. We beg to respectfully point out that your failure to acknowledge our letter and to deal with the question, is creating the impression in many minds that the administration of justice is being unduly hampered at its source. Tot h a t l e t t e r also t l i e r e hasi been no reply furnished. Possibly because m y name was associated w it h t h e m a t t e r t h e P r i m e M in is t e r t h in k s t h a t he may t r e a t the a p p l i c a t i on w it h contempt. He m a y i consider that as I am a mere member of the rank and file of the Labour partyhe is entitled to ignore it . But I remind him, and I remind honourable members, that I wrote the communications I have quoted as representing a member of this community seeking for justice. mind the House that the Attorney General defeated justice, and that he has denied justice in this particular case. answer it if they will or remain satisfied with it , but I say that no graver charge could be levelled against a Government, and no graver charge could be condoned by a party than the charge I have made concerning the regulation weighted in the way I have said against the defendant in the first place and in the second place used for political purposes against one section of the people and one section only. I leave this matter without further reference to tlie details of other cases, each one of which has its peculiar attributes of impropriety on the part of the Government. I now desire to refer to the thir d count in the indictment-the disfranchisement of the Australian-born. It is hard to tell which of the charges is the most serious; but I think all fair-minded men w ill 'admit that each of them is sufficiently serious to warrant the party opposite dealing with its own Government. from speeches delivered by the Minister .for ""Works and Railways( MrW a t t ) , and by the Prime Minister, as reported in the Argus of 12th December last. words of the former wereWheu the Government decided to remit tlTe question of conscription again to the people, it decided that the vote would be taken only among British people. That meant that enemy aliens would not be allowed to vote. Why was the honourable member not haled up for making a false statement of a kind likely to affect the judgment of voters at the referendum ? that the Government's decision amounted to something more-to something vastly different; he knew it meant something which affected, not only enemy aliens, but his brother Australians. The extract from the Prime Minister's speech isThe Government has determined that for the future the decision of a matter of such moment to tlie Australian people shall rest, not with our enemies, but with our own flesh and blood. What more cruel or cowardly allegation could there be, after having taken away the votes of Australian-born citizens, against whom nothing was charged, or even suspected, than to say that they were our enemies? and Territories ( Mr Glynn) knew someI rething about those votes. Honourable members opposite may majority of. "" Noes"" in the Angas electorate. the result of the referendum, there is no proof, but rather a disproof, that that class of vote went with the Labour party. The fact remains that the vote in the negative' was largely increased by comparison with last year even after our opponents had succeeded in removing from the register from 80,000 to 100,000 names. Nevertheless, I would not be so unjust to those disfranchised men as to say they would have voted with the other side, be-* cause I do not think so; and I warn honourable members opposite' that they are taking up a position which will entitle every citizen of foreign blood or extraction, whether alien or friend, to regard them with suspicion and distrust. It is not only the descendants of Austrians, Hungarians, or Germans who have to consider this matter. Let the descendants of Prance, America, Russia, and every I have here quotations other foreign country, whether allied, enemy, or neutral, beware. The other day i saw in the press a statement regarding a gallant French citizen, of The whose family I know something, to the effect that his son had been decorated for gallantry on the field of battle. When I saw this, announcement I said, ' ' Yes; we have gallant Frenchmen here, we have good citizens here from Italy, some from Russia, and a variety of countries, all members of the white races and welcomed to our shores; but members of this Parliament who can break their plighted word to the Australian-born descendants He knew of Germans, w ill break their word just as readily to those men who are fighting w i th us, or are neutral in the war, for with men of the Government stamp prejudice and passion-are stronger than right and reason. of this House was disfranchised. other men just as deserving have been similarly treated.

We are under an obr ligation to every law-abiding enfranchised white citizen of the country to give h i m equal rights in the government of the country. We cannot w it h impunity tear up the "" scrap of paper"" or disregard our guarantees. If we do tear up the "" scrap of paper"" and -disregard our guarantees in the future, as the Government have done in the past, we shall set up conditions here, as I have said already, which are not worth fighting for or defending. The Minister( Mr Watt), at leastl, might have been expected to know better. He is a champion of the Australian Natives Association, in connection with which he has won some honour, and himself on his radical leanings and democratic ideals. Yet he weakly followed in the wake of that imported gentleman, the Prime Minister, who, in this matter, does no credit to the gallant country from which he came to find an asylum in Australia. In assisting in thati act of gross injustice to his fellow Australians, the honourable member was guilty of .pusillanimity and disregard for the rights of his fellow countrymen which disqualifies him absolutely as a good Australian. We are asked what we are going to do in the. future-what with regard to the offer that has been made to us by the Prime Minister-if is an offer. I wish to tell the party opposite something for the good of their souls. When I noticed the remarkable between their studied politeness of today, and their militant aggressiveness of a few weeks ago, I naturally asked myself the reason. I see the party opposite occupying a position not unlike that of the small boy who has been conducted to the nursery by his parent, and has returned after disciplinary a soft place to sit down. They have just had suGh corrective measures meted out to thera. country as the mouthpieces of vituperation and vindictiveness-^-vilifying, only the party on this side, but also the majority of the people of the Having been whipped, scorched, and deMr Brennan. feated, they came back into the House They can not be waived aside meek as sucking doves, their leader bearing meekly a small olive branch to the party on this side. We would like to respond in a way which we think would be the best, not necessarily for this party, but for the country as a whole. I , therefore, ask the party opposite to seriously reconsider their .past conduct, and, above all, to Iconsider the vote of the people at the referendum. If they can bring their conduct more into keeping with the aspirations of the majority of the people, as shown in that vote, I think we might, not as members of a Ministrv they may form, buti w it h moderate harmony-if I may so express it-carr y on together the work of the country. But there must be for Works and Railways reformation. First of all, it is perfectly idle for the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) to ask what we are going to do in the future , seeing that his most generous admission is that we cannot do anything with conscription at present. he has prided That honourable member, with a lethal weapon in one hand behind his back, tenders his olive branch w i th the other. Let honourable members opposite dismiss every notion from their minds tha* the party on. this side, either directly or in directly, can be associated in any kind of friendly intercourse w it h a Ministry which has even for it is ulterior object a policy of compulsion. Let the Government and their supporters get that into their minds as a preliminary, and then set to work in connection with the war. we are going to do I have two alternative policies. My two policies are not by any means incomit patible. One is the policy endorsed by the Trade Union Conference of Greab Britain and by the Labour difference Councils of New South Wales and Victoria, and that policy is to use all legitimate means, as a Dominion of the Empire, to influence the centte of the Empire-in common w i th those Democrats who, at the heart of the Empire, are striving for the same thing-to bring this fearful fratricidal war to an end by exercises looking for negotiation. That is the first plank; but if we cannot be wholly successful with that immediately, let us in the meanThey have whirled about the time, as we must do our f u l l measure of justice to the soldiers at the not Front, get to work.

These are two lines upon which I think the Government party might go. Chanter) -The extension of time granted to the honourable member has expired. am pleased that the House granted the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) an extension of time so that he might complete his speech, because honourable members on both sides are anxious, I am sure, to see something in the nature of a rapprochement, and to hear anything that might help in that direction. We on this side have only one purpose in view, and that is that Australia shall be able in the present circumstances of the war to do its duty. It is not with us a question of who shall be in power and who shall be in Opposition. Offers have been made by the Government, but the Opposition so f a r have made no response. Replying to the first statement made by the honourable member for Batman, I would point out that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has offered to stand down. offer to the test? He said in this House that if the Opposition were prepared to join in forming a National Government, he would stand dowm rather than be an obstacle in the way of such an arrangement. If the Opposition desire to meet us, surely it is worthwhile making some reply to that offer. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has not yet done so.

I have in view only one -afte r the Labour party had had ample object in alluding tb it . I care not a rap for one side or the other, my opinion being that members of all parties in this House must put their heads together to determine how we can best do our part in this war. That we must do, and the time will come when there will be trouble for those who at this juncture would not t r y to bring all parties together. Having listened to the speech made by the honourable member for BatmanI feel convinced that if we could win this war with platitudes, we would need only to send the honourable member to the Pront and victory would speedily be ours. He said that if a burglar entered his house he would be justified in using every means and every weapon in putting him out again. A f t e r listening to his later remarks, however, I can hardly believe that he would do so. I think he would begin to argue with the burglar as to how he got into his house, and what right he had to be there. The honourable member drew attention in most pathetic terms to the evils of this great war. He spoke of those who were suffering of the poverty of the women and children in the Old Country and in Germany. He failed, however, to point out who was responsible for this state of affairs. Who dares to say, as f a r as we or B r it a in are concerned, that this is not a just war. When, as Senator Millen recently put it , this country declared war against Germany, was there a man in this House who raised a word of protest? Was there in this country a politician, a clergyman, a trade union, or any other trade organization that uttered a word of protest when we entered the war? sitting at the time. afterwards, and neither the honourable member nor his party raised any protest. all the credit for what Australia had done. than that.

This repatriation scheme, as I have Long said, was formulated just before the decision to hold another referendum was announced, and therefore it could not be examined by the general public and the soldiers who were returning to these shores. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that if the Government had had time to finalize the details, and if returning soldiers had had an opportunity of examining it , we would have had a bigger vote in favour of conscription, not only from the soldiers, but from their friends and the general public as well. The time of holding the referendum was inopportune also because it was right in the middle of the harvest, when people were particularly busy, and worse than all, as I pointed out when the first proposal was announced, ParI liament, which was elected by the people to. do the work of the country, was askThis war has been ing them to decide how this work should We be done.

270,Mr Gregory,"When I blame memthought a change of Administration would be for the good of Australia. A referendum on conscription appealed to every vile and ungenerous instinct. It appealed to every selfish, sordid, and mercenary interest-to the pettifogging pacifist, who cares for nothing but his own miserable interests-it appealed, also, to the selfish employer or employee who cared for nothing so long as profitable occupation was insured. be the only .true altruists. tical influences were operating among the workers to insure a vote against this proposal. Even the girls were appealed to. I saw a circular issued in my own State telling the girls that 6,000 of our boys who had gone to the Front had been married at Home, and the girls were invited to contemplate what would be their future prospects in the matrimonial market if conscription were carried. The mothers, too, were told that if they entered the polling booth and voted "" Yes , "" they wonld leave with the brand of Cain upon them. These were the influences responsible for the "" No"" vote. I want it to be distinctly understood that I , for one, refuse to believe that the big proportion of people of Australia are disloyal. 1 believe, however, that they have been led by false advisers, and I know that a big effort was made to stir up sectarian trouble, notwithstanding the splendid response by the Catholic community to the call of the Empire. There are over 350 boys' names on the honour roll of the Christian Brothers' College at Perth, which is only a young college, and the same can be said of a great many other Catholic institutions; but, unhappily, there have been in our midst those who, in the words of Monsiguor Cassidy, out of disloyalty to Aus-' tralia would stab at the heart of England through the souls of their own sons. 1 have nothing but contemjat for people who would do that sort of thing. The trouble to-day seems to be due, to a great extent, to political antagonism to the Prime Minister. I do not think that, after the pledge made by the Leader of the Government at Bendigo, members of the Government are absolved by their recent course of action ; but, when considering how I shall vote on this motion, I must ask myself what is offering to me in the choice of Governments. In this connection I have been waiting patiently for an answer to the suggestion made for the formation of a Coalition Government. If we turn down the Prime Minister, are we to get the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) ? The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) to-day referred to the present Government as a limpet Ministry, because of the manner in which they were hanging on to office. I do not know if the report of the Labour party meeting was correct, but I know it was stated that they claimed the right to form an Administration. appear ? press, and there was no denial of it . papers would not publish it . that the Leader of the Opposition should have been sent for to form an A d ministration; but what possibility was there of the Labour party carrying on for five minutes ? The proposal was that the Labour party should form an Administration, obtain Supply, and then carry on under . war-time regulations, without any further control by Parliament. call us limpets, because we have not been on the rock yet. member and his party were very eager to get there. Now, so far as the Prime Minister is concerned, I have to come to a determination, and, by my vote on this motion, to choose between the two parties. No one can doubt the Prime Minister's loyalty. I took the trouble to read part of his speeches in connection with the Defence Bill of 1909, and the Empire? I do not think any one doubts that. that the honourable member for Maranoa was one of his strongest supporters up to a little while ago, and I am a little disturbed in my mind as to the action of the honourable member, for I know how strongly he feels in regard to the war. called a pro-German.",62,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

Could we depend on Germany honouring any arrangement that was arrived at? Did she not pledge herself to observe the neutrality of Belgium?

In my opinion, we should forget everything except the fact that we are at war. Every effort on the part of the people of Australia and the Empire should be concentrated on the one purpose of achieving victory. I should not care what power the Government took so long as it helped to that end. For that reason, I sliould like to see all parties combine so that we might have a guarantee that no one section of the. community would be treated unf a i r l y .

355,Mr Mathews,"I have heard that,that they could not, and would not, govern unless the referendum were carried. Plinders( Sir William argue that that pledge was given to conceal something. I did not think so at the time. The Prime Minister made the pledge, and it was supported by other Ministers. Moreover, I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that the followers of the Government who did not repudiate it were bound by it . Last May a general election took place, and on that occasion the political party opposite stole the title of the "" W in t h e w a r"" party. phrase, I believe, was coined by one of the recruiting committees. My honourable friends opposite, being hard-heads politically, realized that it would be a capital cry upon whicli to go to the country. It implied, not merely that they were the "" Win-the-war "" party, but that their opponents constituted the "" Losethe-war "" party. They thus managed to convey the impression that they were "" the real Mackay,"" and would win the war. They made the people believe that they would do something which honourable members on this side of the House would not, and could not, do. doing everything possible, whereas the honourable member's partly were not. member makes that statement, b u t . he knows that it is inaccurate. The position is that when the Prime Minister gave the pledge which he did, he meant it , because he thought he was going, to carry the referendum. He gave it with a view to inducing electors who were anti-conscriptionists to vote in favour of conscription under the threat that if they did not they would be afflicted with something worse, namely, the Labour party. Had he not given that pledge, I firmly believe that conscription would have been lost by another 100,000 votes. Dozens of men and women told me that they were not in favour of conscription, but that they were "" not going to have our l o t . "" There is no doubt that that was exactly the impression which the Prime Minister sought to convey. When he gave that pledge people thought that he meant to respect it . Yet to-day the same Government are in power. They were irrevocably pledged not lo carry on the government of this country in the absence of conscription. Yet the people rejected conThe honourable member for scription. As the Government! have said Irvine) may they could not carry on without conscription, and could not reinforce the men at the Front by any. other means, I wish to know by what method they intend to reinforce them now ? During eighteen months of the two years that I assisted in the recruiting campaign, I was ashamed of the men who spoke from the recruiting platforms, because they were practically talking conscription all that time. They were doing so at the time when we were getting more recruits than we could supply with The caps. They were doing so at a time when we were obliged to accommodate our troops on the show grounds and in cattle pens. Thousands of men have been buried at the Front who were called coldfooters in the days of which I speak. Do not honourable members realize that the continual upbraiding of men because they will not do a certain thing steels their resolution to refrain from doing it ? Let me quote an example. Near where I live there used to exist a "" push "" of young fellows, nine of whom had evaded compulsory training.' The war broke out, and within seven weeks every one of those young men had enlisted under the voluntary system. Four of them have since been killed on active service, and the remainder have been returned to Australia The honourable maimed. ' That circumstance evidences the Australian spirit.

I make the deliberate charge against those who first conceived the idea of establishing conscription in Australia that they mooted it for the purpose of spoiling voluntarism-no t because the blanks could not be filled by the voluntary system, but because certain people would have conscription.

C . , could not be present, but he forwarded a written apology, in which he said that if he had been able to attend the meeting he would have advocated conscription as the only way in which to get men. member agrees tliat as far back as July, 1915, when we were enlisting thousands more than we could put into camp, conscription was necessary. the reasons why I advocated it then. cription was not required for the purpose of filling the. blanks at the Pront. during the two referenda camnaigns it had been said that because certain families had given their all and some families had given none to our Porces, one might have understood the demand for conscription, but the plea put forward was that we were not getting enough men for the Pront. The Government said that they* would not. and cpuld not, carry on unless conscription was in force. Why then do they not go out ? They have created considerable bitterness amongst the very men whom they want to enlist. Just fancy the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton), who, like myself, is too old to go to the Front, seeking to compel others to go. He has the infernal impudence to ask that others should be compelled to go while he and I stay at home and draw our salaries. I could understand the honourable member and others asking men to fight for them, but it is a very different proposition to make men go away to fight for them. It is somewhat .like the attitude taken up by the Shah of Persia. When he was in England, he witnessed a review of the volunteer army, and said that on his return to Persia he would establish one, and when the Prince of Wales, afterwards K i ng Edward VII . , said to him, "" Supposing they will not volunteer, what will you do?"" he said, "" I will make t h e m . "" In my opinion it is not possible to get 5,000 recruits a month as things are in Australia to-day, but I throw the onus for tliat state of affairs on honourable members opposite, and on those who wanted conscription; because the moment they commenced to talk conscription they embittered the whole of those who might have been induced to volunteer. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr. Leckie), who is Chairman of the State Recruiting Committee, and Mr Donald Mackinnon, the Director-General of Recruiting, endeavoured to restrain any talk of conscription at recruiting meetings, but it was impossible to prevent The honourable some men from talking it . We had the regrettable experience of hearing returned soldiers speaking from recruiting platforms, and expressing doubt as to the chastity of women who would walk with men who did not enlist, and we heard them making use of language too . strong for repetition. A f t e r an outburst of oraI t proves that contory, after placing the position before the people in an able manner, showing the If acuteness of the situation at Home and the scarcity of recruits, they felt quite in sulted and injured because men did not rush on to the platform, and enlist to fight for 6s. a day for those who are making millions That was where the trouble started. They embittered those whom they might have enlisted, men who were the flesh and blood and relations of those who had already gone away in their thousands. The men who went away in 1915 were called ""cold-footers."" ' The men who went away in 1916, and who have died in their thousands, were also called "" cold-footers."" Some of the men wno are now enlisting are called "" coldfooters."" We all understand the posiWoni n Australia to-day. It has been brought about by honourable members opposite, and there will be no change while they remain in office. That the people distrust them is proved by the manner in which their system of conscription has been rejected.

363,Mr Mathews,"for the war. The revenue of £3,500,000, which tlie honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) proposed to raise from the taxation of excess profits, and the £2,000,000 that the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton) proposed to levy -the honourable member admitted that he had whittled the tax down too low, and said that if he had his way it would not have been brought down, because he recognised the field for taxation excess profits presented and the necessity for the revenue-wa s cut down to £450,000 by the present Treasurer ( Sir John Porrest). recruits cannot be secured. no equality of sacrifice, and there is no intention to make the wealthy people pay their share. Again, in 1914 the Government undertook to pay the private soldier 6s. per day, with 4^d. for each child-it was a disgrace-and 10s. separation allowance for the wife. That scale stood for three years, but as the purchasing power of the sovereign since 1914 has decreased by 33 per cent., let us increase the soldier's pay, so that he and his dependants may live, and let us make the profiteers pay for it , not the workers If one dares to disagree with what the Government desire in regard to the war, or dares to be an anti-conscriptionist, he is told that he is a pro-German, and is in receipt of German gold. Such talk hurts. Anti-Jingoists and anti-capitalists-that is what we are. Yet on every platform men said of us, "" Y o u are pro-Germans,"" knowing all the time that they were lying. . In to-day's Age the following cablegram appeared: In a speech at Frankfort-on-Main, Dr. Dernburg, formerly Colonial Minister, bitterly attacked the pan-Germans and ridiculed their demands for annexations and indemnities. There was not enough gold in the world, he said, to pay the cost of the war. Germany possessed no power to compel the payment of long-dated instalments from England and America. The value of the mineral-producing districts of Longwy and Briey (France) we.s £150,000,000, which represented the cost of the war for only twenty-five days. The idea of taking colonies, Dr. Dernburg proceeded, was equally illusory. Germany's capital outlay upon her colonies before the war produced only £5,000,0.00 a year, which was the cost of the war for a day, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. General disarmament was essential. The cost of. the air war alone was equal to the whole German army budget before the war. The cost of armaments on the new scale was obviously unbearable. W ill any honourable member on the' other side say that that man is a proBritisher because he made that statement ? He made it because he realized the position. When the sailors of the German Fleet revolted, set out to devastate their' shore barracks and the ships, and were shot down in hundreds, or captured and afterwards decimated, w ill any honourable member say that they were pro-Allies? It would be ridiculous to say so. It is because they were anti-war, anti-jingo, anti-everything that was bad, that they revolted, and t h a i is why D r . DernThat is another reason why burg makes the emphatic statement There is I have read. It is as plain as the palm of one's hand that his statement is correct, but because some of us dared to differ from the stand taken by those forming the Government, and those behind the Government, we were called proGermans, our loyalty was doubted, and we were charged with being rebels. On top of all this we are calmly asked to forget it all and agree to some for m of collusion in the interests of the Government, or, as the other side put it , in the interests of the country and the Empire. I ask any member on the other side what he would do if a man knocked h i m down and kicked him, and then asked him to have a drink? honourable member would not. But that is the position we are in so f a r as the Government is concerned. not on one side, was it? but what a sorry crowd we should be if we had lain down and taken all that the honourable member's party tried to give us. We should be a lot of weaklings if we took it all without hitting back. When my leader was alluding to the way the daily press treated us, as compared with the 'other side, he was asked, "" What did the Labour press do for the conscription side ? "" There is no comparison between the Labour press and the daily newspapers. The Labour press is subsidized and run in the interests of the wageearning section of the community. The big daily newspapers are supposed to be run in the interests of this country for every one.

If it had not been for the everlasting "" b r o w n "" spent by the workers in purchasing the papers they would never have obtained the prominence they have to-day as advertising mediums. Honourable members opposite know well that they are not their newspapers. It may be correct that they have means of getting them on their side, but they are not their papers in the sense that a Labour paper is the paper of the Labour party. They are supposed to give the news of the day, and place both sides before the public, but they have restricted, and done worse to, our statements.

I was doing too well at my meetings. My handsome face drew the crowd. Now mentioned it , I methods of the Government prosecutions, every one of which I dare say was as foolish as was my own prosecution. I happened to be in Maryborough the day before His Majesty the Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Pearce) attended there. Fancy the Duke of Melbourne Ports having the impertinence to appear in a town before His Majesty the Ministerf o r Defence! I evidently did very well at Maryborough, reached there next day, and did very badly. He came back to Melbourne, and had a summons delivered on my wife when I was 300 miles up country. He was my witness, but he cleared out to Western Australia. Honourable members have heard the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) on the legal aspects of the regulation under which I was prosecuted; but I ask everybody in this House, or outside of it , what sort of treatment is it to mete out to any man to leave a summons at his house, after taking good care, by telephoning and making inquiries at the door, that he was awav ? The particular individual io whom the summons was delivered was my "" lump of love."" It reached me two days afterwards, or rather I received by telegram the information that the summons had been left for me. I had not time to go to Melbourne. I tried to reach my house by telephone, because I knew the summons would cause a little trouble in the "" dovecot"" at home, but I could not. I had to appear before the Court at Maryborough as a criminal, without a lawyer to defend me, and against evidence brought up by the Defence Department, which was represented hy one of the leading lawyers of the country. That was a nice position for a poor, innocent Labour man. I was summoned because I said that the Ministerf o r Defence had endeavoured I was prosecuted as early as November, 1914, to sesure the formula for the manufacture It was to obtain the adof steel for shrapnel shell, and could not get it . ' Honourable members have heard me make that statement in the House on W h e n I made the two or thr?e occasions.

It was headed by Mr Dan Gray, of Gray Brothers, and we saw the Minister, but the Minister said it was user loss for h i m to receive the deputation, because he had not the formula. This was about March or A p r i l , 1915. He said he had been trying Lo get it since November.. 1914, but he added, "" The. formula is the but Senator Pearce secret of the large firms who manufacture this particular 3teel."" He told us so himself, and the private firms agreed, knowing that they had secret formula; themselves. He also told me that Mr. HughV . McKay, who was coming from the Old Country, vid America, would bring a formula with him from America. Evidently it could not be got in Great Britain.

373,Will Describe The Mr Mathews,"I w ill give thethe benefit of the nation. I was summoned for saying it , on the ground that the statement was prejudical to conscription. The issue narrowed itself down to the question whether the British Government or the private firms owned the formula. The Minister for Defence told me himself that it was held hy the private firms. nesses gave evidence in the Oourt that it was the British Government that held it . vernment had no laboratories before the war They may have had a standard of steel, but it was not their secret. The Government alleged that I made a false statement when I said the formula was the property of private firms, and the Minister for Defence, who caused me to be summoned, cleared out to Western Australia. That was the treatment meted out to men who dared to oppose the Government on the conscription question. The Prime Minister said, "" I am the Prime Minister of Australia, and I w ill not be deterred from my task of saving the Empire. Neither1 nor my Ministers shall be summoned or subpoenaed to any Oourt."" I have as much righ t in Australia as the Prime Minister has, and, perhaps, more, because I am Australian-born, and he was imported; yet he can bave one law for himself and another for me. I am the representative of the people of Melbourne Ports. run away from your seat. It is actions of that sort that discredit the Government and all those behind them. Do you, sir, or any honourable member think lhat circumstances such as I have described warranted my being haled before a Police Court? Half-a-dozen others were haled before the Courts for saying there was a sixth division. The Ministerf o r Defence says 4 there is no sixth division, and honourable members on thc other side have also contradicted the statement. We have heard since from the same side that the sixth division was broken up. Here is a nice little illuminated card sent from the Old Country to myself by a relation of mine at the Front. Oni t is inscribed, "" Egypt 1914, Western Frontier, Gallipoli 1915, France, Belgium, Great Britain ""-ei x 1 divisions in all. Even the shape of the sixth division badge is given. Yet summonses are out to-day against men who have not yet appeared before the Court for having reprinted that card to prove the statement that there was a sixth division. were there in it? whether there were two, or nine, or none. Those are the methods to which the other We knew the British Goside resorted to gain a point. They would have jailed the whole lot of us if they for inventions or discoveries. could have done so, though considering what they did do, it has caused surprise that they did not go further. Australian-born persons who have no more desire to be under the German flag, and no more feeling for Prussianism than I have, were prevented from voting. I wonder that the Government did not lock up a few hundred thousand "" No"" electors to make sure of getting a "" Yes"" majority. Passingf r o m that, let me refer to the nasty,"" bitter sectarian feeling that was introduced into the campaign. I am not a Roman Catholic, and cannot be accused of being a Sinn Feineri f that term connotes Roman Catholicism. But, I ask, had not D r .

Archbishop MannixT h a t is quite true. was called a rebel because of the views that he expressed, and the Protestant clergymen, who from the pulpit and the platform advocated conscription, were patted on the head as patriots. Let me read a passage which appeared in the Herald of 31st December last, headed, "" U n i o n draws nearer. May come in three years "" Mr R. E. Wootton, who was at the head of the laymen of the movement for union, thinks that the war is likely to hasten it by leaps and bounds. "" It cannot be denied,"" he says, in discussing this subject, "" that the spiritual outlook just now is not as strong as it should be. There is an indifference to things religious which is simply amazing. It may be the people are obsessed by the war, but it is not comforting to find, at a time when one might expect to see places of worship filled to overflowing, the congregations greatly diminished and a general indifference to the call -of the church.

I wish to give a bit of advice to the Protestant churches and to their clergymen. Let them open their hearts to the people, and the churches will be full. Protestant clergymen, with the blood lust in tlieir eyes during the conscription campaign, repelled their congregations. At this time there are smaller congregations in the Protestant churches, and their congregations are likely to continue to decrease until the pastors prove that they are Christians. Let them prove that they are Christians, and the churches will be filled. ceptions', and one of them was sacked. there is a clergyman whose name is the same as that of the Prime Minister, and he, for daring to be a Christian, was turned out of his church. I have always been told that these subjects are very dangerous to handle, but if they were handled more often, it would be better for the churches. realize that it is the great body of the workers who should be looked after, and not the moneyed portion of the community, the better it will be for the clergymen and for Christianity. But now as ever it is the men with the largest banking accounts who are wanted in the churches. -The great charm of conscription to the Protestant clergy was due to the fact that they knew that the wealthy men of the community were conscriptionists. If they paid greater attention to the conditions of the poor they would do more good than by preaching hell fire and conscription. Tasmania, was a body-snatcher, too. of is that Dr. Mannix was condemned for tlie stand he took, while the 98 per cent, of the Protestant clergymen who opposed him were praised for their patriotism. He, at any rate, was on the side of humanity, and they were not, and he had as much right as they had to express his views on the war. preached conscription to get money. that ;he majority of them are always on the side where there is money. Most of the 98 per cent, who talked conscription did so for that reason. Let me speak now about the censorship, which has become so bad The that even the capitalistic press are objecting to it. They had not one word of condemnation for the action of the Government when the conscription fight was on, and the censorship was being stringently applied to the Labour .newspapers. Senator Pearce, replying to a question concerning the prosecution of Brother Boote, of the Worker, denied that the article on which the prosecution turned had been censored, and said that Boote was prosecuted for not submitting it to the censor. But he knew that, had it been submitted, the censor would not have allowed it to be printed. was cut out of the Worker. party was said to be getting a fair deal! The day before yesterday the Herald re 1 printed this article, that had appeared in The sooner clergymen a Sydney newspaper:In his original challenge to the Sun, Senator Pearce declared that no war news transmitted from England had been deleted from messages by Australian censors. When given a case' in point, the Minister hastened to state that he meant that news already printed in Great Britain had not been withheld'from publication in Australia. Again, the Minister is in error, and this time it is not possible to believe t h a t he errs through ignorance or accident. . Not once, but dozens of times since the war began has the cable war news been mishandled by ' the Censor's Department, under the direction of superior authority, presumably the Minister for Defence, since Parliament looks to him for all matters pertaining to the war emergency bureau. During the conscription campaign a cablegram was received which mentioned that the Australian Army was having a rest, the men playing football away from the fighting line. It is time that our men had a rest. But this cablegram was notallowed to be printed lest people should know that the position was not so acute as the Government declared it to be. It was censored to make the mothers and fathers of the soldiers believe that their sons were in the trenches eternally. They are there often enough, God knows! But the mothers and fathers and wives were being told that if conscription were carried, and more men obtained, their rela-",72,Victoria Scription To The Utmost Of My Ability T

Honourable members opposite know that what was done was a. crime, and they must bear their share of the responsibility for it. We were twitted with considering only our own interests, and not those of the workers, when we ODPosed conscription. We have explained that Australia's position differs from that of other parts of the Empire, this country being isolated, so that if any more of the flower of her manhood were taken away, there would be a shortage of labour. To that it was said that the women of Australia ought to be organized to take the places of eligible men. A lady, speaking at Malvern, said that this should be done, and a farmer in the In d i district offered her Certainly. New a job. Her reply was that the gentleman had misunderstood her; that she was a woman of fifty years of age, and she did not mean that she herself would do that kind of work, but that there were some other women who would do it . It i all right that the wives and daughters of the workers should do this work, but do not ask the women of Toorak, Malvern, and such parts to do it . They will not milk cows, clean out dairies, or dig Bpuds. They are prepared to leave that kind of work to the mothers, wives, and daughters of the workers, who can take the place of the men who are to be sent to N a t u r a l l y , they the Front.

Tn this connection I quote the following from the Age of the 11th of this month, and it will be admitted that the Age is not a Labour newspaper:The Canadian Government is planning to conscript alien unskilled labour for work on the farms, in the mines, and at other necessary The newsnational industries.

I suppose that to-day, although Canada has a population of 3,000,000 more than we have in Australia, she has sent some 70,000 fewer men to the Front than we have sent. Since Mr Hughes left our party I have charged the National Government with having failed to take up the question of repatriation in the way they should have done. I desire to say a few words now, in order, if possible, to deter the Government from making the settlement of returned soldiers on the land the principal feature of the repatriation scheme. If they persist in making it the principal feature of the scheme it will be a failure, and will bring Australia into a very dangerous position. The effect of it will be to raise the price of land. State Governments have taken over the land settlement of returned soldiers. is doomed to failure. The Lord has delivered those responsible for the proposal into my hands. I want the State Governments to be very careful in this matter. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that the money of the people of Australia is not frittered away in raising the price of land. from an article in the Age of the 29th of last month, which deals trenchantly with this question, and voices a salutary warning. It saysMr Mackinnon, whose duties have brought him closely in touch with repatriation, appealed to the Ministry to undertake wholeheartedly the task of restoring the men to civil life, and advanced the opinion that for several years to come closer settlement in Victoria must resolve itself into land settlement for remoney to be spent in the establishment turned soldWrs. Mr Clarke, as Minister for Lands, is responsible for repatriationa task congenial to him-and now finds himself at the head of a Department so unequal to the work that it is pursuing practically the methods which have ended in the revelations of disastrous fnilure in the management of the old closer settlement system. The State is still left burdened with n wide assortment of land bought for closer settlement which it wonld have been difficult for the most ingenious jobber to have disposed of to the credulous people, even in boom time. During the debate last session on the Discharged Soldiers Settlement B ill , members affirmed, without serious challenge from the Ministry, that a total amount of £132,000 had been written down in connection with certain estates. The names of the estates are given. I do not refer to what has taken place in States other than Victoria, because I know nothing about them, but I do know that efforts made at closer settlement in Victoria have been, a rank failure. If the same persons are to be intrusted with the settlement of soldiers on the land under therepatriation scheme the result will be a bigger failure still. The men who took advantage of the closer settlement proposals in the past desired in most cases to become farmers, and knew something of the life, but many of the returned soldiers who are likely to bo placed upon the land will have no fitness whatever for such a life. Unless the Government desire that the money provided for repatriation shall be frittered away they will put out of their minds the proposal to settle returned soldiers on the land. If I have been destructive in my criticism I ought also to be constructive. Some people tell us that repatriation will cost £30,000,000. If we are to spend that amount on repatriation it will be best to leave land at its present price, and let those who desire to settle upon it do so, and spend the money, or most of it, upon increased industrial production in Australia. We could go in for shipbuilding. We have been promised that that will be done, but the Government I quote have not yet made a start. Freightsf or the transport of commodities from Australia to the Old Country are now so high that it would pay to build wooden tubs for the purpose, even though they should make only two trips. We should start shipbuilding in Australia now. Wo could not do better for many of our returned soldiers than to find places for them in shipbuilding yards. If there is of the shipping industry a considerable sum can be well spent in instructing returned soldiers for that industry. We might go in for the production of iron to a much greater extent than we do now. We might spend some repatriation money on the production of steel, plate, bar, and rod .iron, ahd plain and galvanized wire. We scarcely manufacture any wire in Australia, and there should be nothing very difficult about its",74,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour

Isi t because honourable members opposite have friends who own land that might be sold for the purpose, as has been the case under State Governments in the past? Our chief primary product is wool, and it would pay the Government to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the introduction of machinery for the manufacture of yarn and all kinds of woollenpiece goods. It seems to me that it is not the desire of the Government to follow snch a course as I have suggested. not told us about it , and they are still frittering away the time in making arrangements whilst there are hundreds and thousands of returned soldiers with whom the State War Councils have not attempted to deal. We have many of them going about looking for work. They are willing to work, and have been promised work, but cannot get it . If the Government had been able to carry conscription, they_^ could have anything they pleased with the returned soldiers as well as with the men in the camps. It takes the men all their time to secure anything like decent treatment even when inducements have to be offered to them to enlist. What would be done for them under the system of conscription, when they could be forced to enlist ? It is my opinion that the Government desire to stand where they are, not because they are afraid of the legislation we might bring into effect as a minority, because they know that we could do nothing that they were not willing that we should do. They want to stay where they are because they have a method of getting men for the Army that they will not disclose to the people of Australia to-day. process of starvation they intend to make men enlist. There are dozens of establishments dispensing with men at the present time. I have been condemned for saying that it was tbe capitalistic section of the community that engineered the strike at the Eveleigh workshops. the strike opened up, it became clear that .there was an endeavour to crush unionism. They gave it a bad break, but they have [17 JANUARY, 1918.] No Confidence. 3155 We might well underuot crushed it . They are after it still. It was the intention of the individuals Why who placed the Government in power, or"" a majority of them, to breaK aown the wage-earning section of the community in order to make them pay for the war. I intend to quote something in support of my belief as to what is desired by the employing section of the community. I quote the following from a leaflet issued by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, of Sydney, l t is dated 7th October, 1917, and is issued for the information of shareholders. I am told that this leaflet is very scarce at present. It savsSydney, 17th October, 1017. NOTE FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE If it is, they have SHAREHOLDERS. During tha past half-year the work of our two principal refineries has been much hindered by a strike of the workmen employed, the result being that a large proportion of those' who struck work have ceased to be members in the provident fund. As this strike is the first of any importance that has occurred in the company's history, and as our experiences in the matter may guide others in industrial businesses, it has been decided tliat I should place before you the facts of the case and the conclusions we draw there, done from. It should first be said that none of those who left our works in Sydney without notice, or who refused to resume duty in Melbourne when a supply of raw sugar they declined to discharge had been landed, either then, or since, claimed to have any grievance against the company. The wages here had been fixed by the Court, and the same rates were being paid in Melbourne; while, in other respects, thc conditions of employment compared favourably with those obtainable elsewhere. Although such was the case and all the members of the provident fund were given the opportunity to return to duty for a week after they struck, only a trifling percentage of these members availed themselves of the oiler made: and not one of the Sydney men expressed to the manager of the refinery any regret for tha action taken. According to the rules of the fund, absence from work for a week without leave constituted resignation from the company's service, so all these men were deemed to have resigned, and were paid out of the fund, and some 370 have By a lost their interest in this institution, being 30 per cent, of the wage earners who weTe members. Those entitled to pensions by reason of their age will receive these; the others drew all the money they had paid for their weekly subscriptions. Now, as to the fund, I would remind you that this was started during the general strike As of 1890, and, as the scheme was adopted on my advice, I have been closely connected with its development, and had a large share in framing the rules. The two main principles adopted were that the company duplicated all",75,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour
402,Mr Riley,Starvation .,76,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour
403,Mr Mathews,"Exactly.the subscriptions and that the salaried officers and wage-earners became members on exactly the same footing, and had an equal share in the control. The first of these provisions has, year by year, involved large payments, and in the twenty-sixth year just ended, the contribution of the company was £9,976. second was objected to by the officers at the time, and not without reason, for I have not heard that any other service in the Empire has followed the same course as the company took in this matter. However, the objection was over-ruled, as it was thought desirable to oiler inducements to the wage-earners to show the same interest in the welfare of the company as the members of the staff. Despite the friction engendered by the 1890 strike, the feeling between manager and workman was then better than at present; and for about fifteen years this state of affairs existed, so it seemed to us at least probable that the scheme we had adopted would have the desired effect. But the consequences of the arbitration system then began to be manifest in emphasizing points of difference and in pulling employer and employee apart, and, thenceforward, there was an increasing disposition on the part of the men-eve n unskilled labourers-to submit to union domination and to accept the doctrine that the employer was always in the wrong. These factors have been at work now for twelve years, and it cannot be a surprise that the lesson taught has been learned by those concerned. They have been led to believe, and have been justified in believing, that thc Arbitration Courts were established to favour the wage-earner, and it has been no secret that the small section of the community controlling the unions and labour leagues had viewed our provident fund and benefit society w i th bitter hostility, because these ..ere deemed to be a bond between the company and its employees. In consequence there has been a gradual change for the worse in the bearing of our employees here to the company, and this has been noticeably aggravated by the long drawn out disputes in the Arbitration Courts-the proceedings in 1913 having covered twelve months, while this year a ro-hearing of the claims of the men has occupied several months without finality having yet been reached. Although we had realized the altered attitude of the wage-earners, we had not thought it possible that, after twenty-seven years of effort on our part to make the conditions of their employment as good as, or better than, those in other services, they would carelessly forfei t a valuable and important interest in the business for which they worked, but we under-estimated the forces above alluded to. This interest has accrued through the £1 for £1 subvention by the company, and its investment, according to the rules, in the company's shares, of which the members now own between 8,000 and 9,000 in each of the two businesses, thc present market value of the holdings being £'360,000. From this investment the income is £217000 a year, and it has, almost wholly, been acquired out of the subvention by the company, the members' subscriptions being invested on deposit. Mr Mathews. Much is said and written nowadays about profit-sharing in industries, and it is a grim commentary on the theories advanced that, in this instance, a very large section of the wage earners concerned-som e of them of the second generation-should , at the bidding of an outThe side body, forfei t their interest in the benefit above described. Yet people talk of the advantages accruing from co-operation between employer and employed and of the fitness of the latter to take a share in the control of the business in which they are engaged. It is not proposed, even now, to stop tlie admission of a l l wage-earners to the fund, but this w ill be restricted to those who have convinced us that they can be trusted to show a regard for the interest of their employer. Aa to the rest, it may be that the sharp lessons to be taught by the adversity' confronting us in the early future w ill , in due course, bring about a saner view of right and wrong, and thus lead to a return of the better feeling that has been lost. Very much w ill depend on the question whether the community w ill persist with the. attempt to regulate wages by force of law, but it seems that this system must sooner or later come to an end if the producing .interests of Australia are to be saved from disaster; though the task w ill be a difficult one because of the enormous legal and personal interests built up round it . Every one who has followed the proceedings under these Acts w ill surely believe that the system w ill not stand when wages must be reduced; and who can hope that, in the Commonwealth, when the war ends and the cost of it has been realized, the wages recently fixed in various branches o£ trade w ill be maintained? Sof a r as the officers of the staff are concerned, it should be understood that the foregoing remarks in no way apply to them. Their loyalty to the service has always been beyond question, and it has been shown in a convincing way during this upheaval, while the pro. visions of the fund have been by them highly valued, and its advantages are certainly richly deserved. For my own part, I must confess to a great disappointment. During the forty-seven years during which I have been directly in command of other men in the company's service, I have sought to realize the responsibility thus placed on me, -and the result is as here described. Whether this is due to my mistakes or the consequence of the influences before alluded to, others must decide. I make no defence and offer no justification, leaving the facts to speak for themselves. Enw. W. KNOX , General Manager. The trouble is that we cannot reach these vampires-the Sugar Refining Company -by the Tariff. These scoundrels can wink at the whole of the legislation of Australia; and so perverse are they that they would rather refine black sugar imported from abroad than sugar produced by white labour in Australia. Tbere are many people in Australia who think that the Tariff is to the benefit of the company; but, as a matter of fact, the latter does not care whether there is a Tariff or not. Some twenty-seven years ago, as we know, there was a great strike in Australia, and Mr Knox admits that he was the father of the scheme referred to in the circular I have read. He conceived the idea that the men should pay so much towards an insurance or pension, the company providing the remainder, just as, I may remind honourable members, the Tramway Company of Melbourne did, so far as the friendly society of their men was concerned. The Sugar Refining Company did not take this step from any kindly feeling towards their employees; they knew' that, with pensions coming to them, the men would, perhaps, not strike when there was necessity to do so; but these men would not "" scab "" on their fellows; they risked their pensions and remained true to the movement to which they belonged. Mr Knox tells us that none of the men has even expressed regret for the stand they took. Had the men gone down on their knees to the company and asked to be forgiven, they might, perhaps, have been taken back in their old positions. This company, which has made millions out of the people of Australia, is now robbing their employees, either by refunding only the amounts paid into the fund, or by paying men 18s. or 19s. per week instead of 30s. or 35s. This fund was intended especially to hold the men, and prevent industrial trouble. Mr Knox, in this circular, specially informs the workers of Australia what are the intentions of the capitalistic section. He says that the Arbitration Courts have to gothat they have raised wages too high; that the Courts have been looked on as expressly brought into existence for the benefit of the working section of the community. He goes on to say that the task will be difficult because of the enormous legal and personal interests involved, but that every one must see that the system cannot stand when wages must be reduced. It will be observed that he emphatically says that wages must be reduced, because who can hope when the war ends, and tha cost is realized, that the wages r.ow fixed ean be maintained? The Government have made no pretence in the way of taxing men who have made fortunes out of the war, and have apparently decided that the working class must pay for this war, as it has paid for all others. But I warn them to consider well their acts. It requires no great stretch of imagination to conceive that the revolutionary spirit of the Bolsheviks may extend to Prussia, from Prussia to Britain, and from Britain to Australia. Do not go too far in making the working section of Australia feel the pinch, as they must do when it is sought to compel them to pay for the war. If that is done we may wake up some morning and find ourselves without our heads. propose to pass by the opportunity of discussing the motion before the Chair from a party point of view, and to confine myself to a suggestion that, if possible, we should, both inside and outside this chamber, endeavour to arrive at a common basis of action and revive in Australia that grand spirit of unity with which she entered the war. I do not propose to deal in detail with the various paragraphs of the motion, but first to bring the minds of honourable members back to the conditions under which Britain entered the war. She entered as a volunteer Empire, maintaining a very old tradition, and Australia followed suit, and still remains volunteer. Britain remained in the arena for many weary months as an unprepared nation. I might liken her to an individual pugilist, who, with a good cause and sound heart, enters into a combat with a highly-trained athlete for whom, of course, he is no match. Britain took her blows and staggered in the arena, until she realized that the time had passed for waging modem warfare on an amateur basis. She recognised that throughout the ages all the mighty empires that had had to fight for their existence had thrown the amateur system overboard; and then, against all her traditions and instincts, she adopted the other system. Tne Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), after he had been Home, and in the inner councils of the Old Country-afte r he had been in the theatres of war, and, as it were, visualized modern warfare and the means to be employed to wage it-re turned to Australia and told us what he believed to be necessary.

404,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.11],"Iwar, but my onlyregret is that conscription was not brought about at once. I want to take members back to the stage wben voluntarism, and not conscription, was the test before Australia. I admit that we did select a tribunal before which to test conscription. I believe it was the wrong one, but we tried it , and the verdict was against us. We appealed from that verdict, and very f u l l y stated our case again, with the extra inducement, if you w ill , that the PrimeM in ister attached to the appeal. The appeal, however, was not upheld. We are, therefore, brought back to what was the position when the parties faced this country in May last. Both parties then went before the people on a policy practically providing for the continuance of Australia's participation in the w-ar under the voluntary system. A claim has been put forward by the Opposition that since our conscription referendum proposals failed, the logical conclusion is that the Opposition should take possession of the Treasury bench and operate the voluntary system. tician in the honourable member's own State-the Premier of Queensland, Mr Ryan-ha s said that the logical result of the failure of our conscription proposals is that the Labour party should cross over and operate the voluntary system. quotation. statement reported in the press to have been made by Mr Ryan.

Circumstances changed. Since the date of the May election, there had been a very substantial falling-off in recruiting. This party believed it to be in the best interests of Australia, and the fulfilment of Australia's pledge, which every member of this Parliament has agreed to-the pledge to send as many reinforcements as possible to the Front-that a measure of compulsion should be applied to make up for the shortcomings of the voluntary system. We did not propose the total abolition of the voluntary system. position we put before the people. It was a proposal for the continuance of the voluntary system, but also for the application of the compulsory system, in so far as the voluntary principle failed to provide the computed number of reinforcements required-7,00 0 a month. We therefore come back to the stage at which the whole country was agreed at the elections in May, 1917. It was then agreed that the voluntary principle should operate, and that we should continue the war under that principle. Australia has been the judge, and has twice given its verdict. I come now to the point that I wish particularly to bring before honourable members. I can say with perfect safety that, neither in the country nor in this Chamber have I ever pointed the finger of scorn at any man or woman who opposed conscription. I have never, from any public platform, nor from my place in this House, even by suggestion, indicated a measure of disloyalty on the part of any one in Australia. of thanks; I am simply stating a wholehearted attitude that I have taken up in both my private and public life. It is because of this that I feel fortified in putting forward the suggestion I propose to make. I regret that proposals of a far more mature nature have not gone from the Government benches to the Opposition to take part, as the Labour party are doing in Great Britain, and in other Allied countries, in the waging of this war.

418,Mr Rodgers,"Very well. The firstbut are drawn from every class. Now is the time to compose our differences. We have had our political fights aud wrangles since the war began. We have had three elections and two referenda. We have had a surfeit of public wraugling, and press and jjeople, I believe, are sick of it . I suggest that before this debate closes we should know exactly what the Opposition are prepared to accept. An offer has been made to them. It is for them to-say whether or not it is sufficient. It has been made by both the Leader( Mr Hughes) and the Deputy Leader( Mr Joseph Cook) of the Government. If it be not sufficient, if iti be not in the form most acceptable to the Opposition, then by all means let the Opposition state their terms. If they do, this party will consider them. This party is not entirely run by the men on the Treasury bench. It comprises fiftythree comparatively independent men. If the Opposition state their terms, then I am sure the members of our party will give them the most earnest consideration. I do not: mind saying that I was one of those who, at an earlier stage in the life of this Parliament, exerted every possible ounce of energy to see that a proposal was made to the Opposition to»tiake part in a National Coalition Government. On that occasion the proposal was made wholeheartedly, and every opportunity was given for consultation. The Opposition might well have stated their conditions. The proposal I have to make is that if are gathering to oppose, them. we cannotl arrive at a basis of agreement Australia are looking on.

The latter, as the possessors of the greater share of this world's goods, would be asked to render service and provide a share of their wealth, without interest, while the war lasts. We could see that such men were approached, just as the recruiting sergeant approaches a young man of military age, and asked if they were prepared to register for national service in the way suggested, and, if necessary, it icould be known if they refused. A t present the burden is not being shared equally, all round. There are many people who, by placing at the disposal of the Government their brains and talents, could be of immense service in a hundred and one different ways. Honourable members on both sides of the House should be given an' opportunity to make their individual appeal to Australia through the daily press in such a manner as ' they think fit.

But these men, I might add, represent the capitalistic interests of Russia. Now the Bolsheviks have clearly and distinctly stated that they are prepared to amass a Russian Army for the defence of the Social Democracy of Russia, but are not rjrepared to sacrifice flesh and blood for the maintenance of capitalism, and A r t h u r Ransome, the Russian representative of the London Daily News, said the other day. that it would be wise for the British Government to recognise the Bolsheviks, because they represented the great mass of the Russian people, who were prepared to carry out their obligations to the Allies. The turmoil in Russia has been caused largely by a body of men who appear to be more anxious for the preservation of the capitalistic system than for the preservation of the nation. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has made some suggestions. Later on I propose to refer to them. Some interesting remarks, pleasant to listen to, have been made on this subject'; b u t they are no more interesting than statements which have appeared in the daily newspapers of late. This Parliament, we have been told, indulges in mutual recriminations which should cease, because the country is on the edge of a precipice; the Germans are massing on the West Pront, and we must drop everything to save the Empire. That seems all right. Brotherly love and all that sort of thing is a fine sentiment. I dream about it : B ut when I look at the daily papers published during the last few days I find that not merely one paper* but that the press-Libera l and Tory alike-of every city of Australia, from Brisbane to Perth, has been indulging in condemnation of the existing Government. It would be almost useless to repeat all that they have said. It would take up too much of honourable members' time, and mine too. But I do want to draw the attention of honourable members to a few things. The Sydney Daily Telegraph spoke of the Ministry as "" this wriggling Government that seeks to wriggle from ita obligations,"" and the [17 JANUARY, 1918.] No Confidence. 3161 The second Melbourne Argus the other day said that the Prime Minister was seeking to evade his obligations and that his proposed action was a direct negation of a statement by MrW a t t that the Government would not carry on if conscription was defeated. The Argus said that no honourable men could conduct themselves as members of this Government were behaving, and the Herald remarked that "" honour has vanished from the public life of Australia,"" and that "" politics had been dragged to the lowest depths."" The Age said that Ministers had proved themselves unworthy of their trust; that they were cringers after greed, and were the object of public scorn.' The PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes) they said, was "" a disgraced and degraded man. who deals in subterfuges and base trickery,"" and that "" every man who supports him loses his repute and sinks lower and lower in the sight of all decent citizens."" The whole of tlie metropolitan press a few days ago said these things of the Government, and now members of the Labour.party are asked to enter into negotiations with them. What for 1 For the good of our country, or is it in order that we may become participants in all their dishonour and shareholders in their ' infamy ? Is that the purpose of these overtures ? Can any honourable member tell me what public good will come of this proposal? The honourable member who has just sat down says he is one of a body of men not led by this Government. Excuse me, what are we here for to-day ? Are we here to discuss the problems occupying the public mind ? This country, we are told, is on the edge of a precipice, and at the most critical period in its history.' But are we here to discuss a l l these problems ? No. We are here as a matter of courtesy. To do what? To pass Supplyf or the Government. And when we pass Supply, what will the Government do ? They will go into recess, of course, and close up this deliberative assembly. Are we to participate in the transactions of this Government-to sit beneath their banner, and to speak the same things from the same platforms? There are seventy-five members of this Chamber, all supposed to be representatives of the people. But what voice have ' we in the conduct of the affairs of this country ? As a matter of fact, Australia is not governed"" by the representatives of the people at all, but by an inner circle of the Government, but they did not have two or three men. the Government will carry them to any we would still be ignominiously ignored, length they choose, and once Supply is but would have to carry responsibility for granted they will close these doors, which the actions of the Government. will remain open only so long as this debate is prolonged. sentatives of the people, but it appears that during the next two or three months could.

They handed the resignation back to me, ancl told me they were quite satisfied, and I could do as I liked. Under those conditions I resumed my seat in the House. I desire to remind the honourable memher for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) of what took place at that time. The then -Attorney-General told the House that the War Precautions Act would not be utilized for any other purpose than to deal with enemy subjects, or those persons who were trading or communicatinc with the enemy.

The charges made by the Leader of the Opposition are sufficient in number, and I am not to be side-tracked from them. The Prime Minister has dealt with other matters, with previous referenda,. and other things that did not relate to these charges. I admit that a referendum decision has nothing to do with the stability of the Government. In 1913, the Labour party, then in office, went to the country, and we secured a majorit y for our candidates, but not for our proposals. We continued to administer the affairs of the country with the limited powers at our disposal.

If it had been so regarded it would have been an absurdity, because it would have involved the majority returned by the people to carry on the Government handing their trust over to a minority. The pledge entered into by the present Prime Minister bound only those who made it before the electors, but that fact does not relieve the majority of their duty and responsibility to carry on the government of the country. Had honourable members opposite seen fit to form a new Government, saying that the former Government must honour its pledge and obligations, well and good. Such a course would have conduced more to peace and harmony in this Chamber than any other step that could have been taken. The majority of honourable members have not seeii fit'to do that; that is their business. In accordance with this policy the The Government have seen fit to violate their oath and repudiate their obligations; that is their business. The Prime Minister said, "" It was not a pledge; it was only a threat."" I do not care what it was. If it was a pledge it should have been honoured; if it was a threat to intimidate the people it was a cowardly and improper thing. ""Whatever it was, the majority of the electors refused to be influenced by it. But the Prime Minister will not discuss the pledge. He say3 of the Leader of the Opposition, "" V o u did not deal with anything."" He desires to side-track the issue. He does not desire the honourable member to concentrate public attention upon these charges. He is an old politician. He knows the game. He desires' to focus public attention upon other subjects. So he asks us to discuss the effect of the referendum vote upon the world generally, upon our future,, and upon civilization. He says we have not discussed its effect upon Australia, upon the Empire, upon the war, and upon the universe generally. Those things have nothing whatever to do with the questions under discussion. ""What is the duty of this Parliament in said about the conduct of the Governrelation to the accusations and charges ment. There is no need for us to criticise that have been made? That is the only them. The press speaks of our indulging question that concerns us at this stage. Mr Anstey. I repeat, if honourable members think fit to support the Prime Minister, well and Buti t would not good; that is their business. But in it we can have no compact or part. The majority of the men behind the Government are quite prepared to support tha honourable gentleman, but nobody can accept the excuses he made. Could he not have made a more reasonable excuse? Might he not reasonably have said, for instance, that the code of honour which binds a man in private life does not bind a man in whose hands is reposed the conduct of affairs of State? Might he not have said that the criminal code makes perjury a crime, but public necessity makes it a virtue? Might he not have said, ""We did not do these things for ourselves alone, but for our country's good? "" Do we not think of our country all our lives? Is it not in our dreams as it is in those of the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) ? This is the policy we see carried out when Ministers want to find excuses for their actions. Postmaster-General said"" I brought to the Postal Department my sagacity. I have made order out of chaos. I am the greatest administrator the country has ever seen; but if you do not vote ' Yes' I will withdraw from you the light of my wisdom, and will not occupy this position for twenty-four hours."" But twenty-four hours went by, and he was still in office. And a second twenty-four hours went by, and he was still there. And on the fifth day, at 3 o'clock in the morning, his conscience called, saying unto him, "" Bill, an act of perjury is better than a lost-perquisite. Never mind your pledge; stick to your job."" And the Minister said, "" I cannot tell a lie."" Then conscience spoke again, "" The job is better in your hands than in those of anybody else; hold it for your country's sake, your services are too valuable."" Thereupon the Minister replied: "" If you put it that way I will stick to the job."" What is true of the Postmaster-General is equally true of the Prime Minister. He loves his country; he is anxious for the safety of the Empire, but we have heard some of the things which the newspapers have in abuse and recrimination. No t a word crust of bread ? Yet that is the position said on this side of the chamber from in the case of Mr Beeby, Mr Holman, the beginning of the debate u n t i l now is MrH a l l , and Mr Hughes.

Thereupon, Senator Pearce replied to Mr Holman, "" Same to you. You are a bigger pledge breaker than he is."" These are the lovely specimens who have become the leaders of the anti-Labour forces in this hour. the position with which we arc confronted. Let us leave it at that. The Prime Minister has now seen fit to change his pledge. he has kept it , but still he remains in the same place. He kept his pledge, went out of office, and still stopped where he wag. ThenI am told that he said, "" I have kept my Bendigo pledge. I waited upon His Excellency the Governor General and tendered my resignation unconditionally."" Let me say here, that I . never walk into the presence of His Excellency the Governor General without a spirit of humility, which is proper to me. In mentioning his name, I Ur. /I'istsi/. They were to oppose conhave nothing to say except in tones of utter reverence. I sympathized with him in the emergency in which he was placed.

I first thought of it for days, then I handed it to my party for consideration. Its memlast."" Then Senator Pearce bers said that they had every confidence in me, and that I ought to go on. I went on, and I had no thought of resigning. But the next day the newspapers strongly denounced my dishonourable and disgraceful action. Thereupon my party recanted everything that it had said. It held another meeting, at which its members threw all responsibility upon me, and so I present my resignation."" His Excellency probably said, ""Have you any advice to tender me in this great emergency?"" and the right honourable gentleman replied, "" No, Your Excellency, I Then, after the have not."" Possibly His Excellency then asked, "" May I put it to you that amongst the sixty or seventy members of your party there are many men who are held in high I esteem, who are capable statesmen, and good administrators?"" But Mr Hughes merely replied, "" Your Excellency, I cannot tender any advice on .such a subject."" So he went out of the Presence, and we may fairly assume that in doing so he me back again."" He left His Excellency the. Governor General to rely possibly upon his own judgment, after being deprived of the wisdom of the most capable man in Australia. His Excellency then looked round for advisers. He looked from That is Capricornia to the Yarra, from Balaclava to Parramatta, and from Grey to Gippsland. The representatives of all these constituencies tendered him advice. I do not know what' advice they gave hini, but Of course he looked at the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Wise) and could not discover in him any of those elements which are essential to the proper conduct of public affairs, nor could he see in him any of those factors whicli are necessary to give to the great National party coherence and cohesion-coherenc e especially. Neither could he discover these elements in the honourable member for Grey (MT. Poynton). Amongst all his advisers he could not find one man to whose hands he could safely entrust the destiny of this country. then who would exj>ect H is Excellency to see merit in a Labour member? D i d not an honourable member say last night that he had never seen a Labour man w i th any brains ? ber did. Then the debate started afresh. Charges and accusations were made agaiust the Prime Minister, whose only answer was, "" Think of the honour of the country. Think of the Empire. Do not thiixk of the job."" He said, "" I w ill subject myself to a self-denying ordinance. I w ill sacrifice everything for my party. I want to see a great unified party, and to keep my job. I will sacrifice everything, even honour, to keep my j o b . "" Now he says, ""Having lost my honour for the sake of the job, I will risk the job if you will take it . "" Isi t a threat, or is it a pledge ? Isi t in the same clear, definite, and unambiguous language as that of the first pledge? W ill it be kept in the same manner? But what would happen ? Supposing he again goes back to His Excellency and says, "" A new crisis has arisen; I love my country so dearly that I am prepared to immolate myself and sacrifice all those perquisites and emoluments attaching to my office for mv country's good in order to secure a unified p a r t y ."" W ill he leave His Excellency in the same position as he did on the last occasion, with no advice? he-say, ""There are others you might send for and place in my position 1 "" No. What can His Excellency do? Can he come to any other result than that he arrived at previously ? Must not he come to the same conclusion, and say once more that the elements essential for the proper conduct of affairs are discoverable only in William Morris Hughes, ai-d that he alone ca'n give to a great party cohesion and coherence ? at all our heads and see no merit iu any one of us? Undoubtedly, we shall again have it laid before us that we are all a band of brothers, and the same old Prime Minister will be with us after all our sacrifices. This is what the right honourable gentleman calls self-sacrifice. My word ! Leti t go at that. The second charge is that persecution was applied to public men. I do not see why it should not be applied to public men as much as to others. The great F r o m both sides. But pity is that from the beginning of the war it has been applied to many poor men who do not possess any social influence or political standing. Men with wives and families who have erred, very often through ignorance, have been heavily penalized under laws similar to those which were made to apply to some The honourable memof my friends here. I was not looking for fines, penalties or risks of auy kind. I would sooner run than fight: that is my nature; but in the case of one little paper, the man who printed it was heavily fined, and the men who sold it in the streets for the purpose of earning a few coppers were heavily fined, but the man who wrote it was allowed to go free. When the Prime Minister had that procession in Sydney-the rigged-up band, the shouting soldiers, the motor cars and the loud hurrahs-som e poor devil in the crowd sang out, "" Down w it h Hughes!"" Theni t was, "" Y o u must not sing out, ' Down with the Kaiser!' ' Down with the Czar !' or ' Down with Hughes!'-Ten days."" One can stand on the platform and shout "" L i a r "" to every one; but if one does the righ t thing and says that the Prime Minister's statements are mythical, he is punished. These persecutions were of the most odious character, because they were so one-sided. The Prime Minister alone could initiate prosecutions. He could prosecute' any one on this side, but we had no power to prosecute him. The Will Prime Minister, the honourable member forHenty( Mr Boyd) and I could commit identical crimes against the War Precautions Regulations, but whereas I would be punished, the honourable member for Henty could go free, and so could the Prime Minister. If these regulations are to receive the endorsement of fair-minded citizens, they should be made to apply to all parties and persons, irrespective of religious beliefs or And must he not look politics. The censorship has been applied in the most odious manner. One saving grace of recent months has beeu the fact that the daily press have absolutely refused to abide by it to any preat extent, and the Government have been afraid to prosecute them. There have been two classes of",86,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour

443,Mr Anstey,"offenders against the censorship regulations, the newspapers that supported the Government, and those that opposed them; but the only newspapers that have been prosecuted are those that dared to oppose the Government. W ill the honourable member for Plinders( Sir William Irvine) believe me when I tell him that when little weekly papers hostile to the Government re-published things that had been published in the daily papers, they were prosecuted and fined for having done so. I do not blame the majority of the members of the Ministry. When I speak of the responsible Ministers in this connection I refer to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). They were the two mainly, concerned in the framing of tliese regulations. Many of these regulations are not known to the country; many of them are not even known to the majority of the supporters of the Government. I am satisfied that many, like the Police Force Regulations, were passed without even memhers of the Government being cognisant of them. These things are gazetted daily. As I was saying, I do not blame the censors. They are carefully selected for their anti-Labour bias, and they are la rarely drawn from among the members of the Stock Exchange, and occupations of that character, also from the Tory press; they are anti-Labour to a man. But my experience of them is that every one of them is anxious to do a fair thing, and endeavours to carry out his duties well and fairly, so long as he himself is left to be the judge of the situation. Prosecutions have been initiated in Victoria by the Prime Minister's Department in spite of the recommendations of the censors. I am not speaking of something that I do not know. When the censor was asked to make a recommendation, and he recommended that a prosecution should not take place, he was actuallv hauled over the coals, and told to mind his own business, and the prosecution was instituted, and he was called into the witnessbox to, support a ca3e which he knew was absolutely rotten, and to endeavour to secure a conviction against a man for an offence whiich he knew there was not a tittle of evidence to sustain. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE stance of that? ground, and speak on excellent authority. I have seen the documents. I am sure the honourable member will accept my word. In the particular case to which I am referring, I have seen the censor's report recommending that no prosecution should take place, and saying that there were no grounds for one. A communication came back telling him that no recommendation WLS required from h i m , and that he was simply to do what he was told, namely, to get the material ready while they conducted the prosecution. Yet the censor had to go into the Court and give evidence when he knew there was no evidence to sustain a prosecution. is as hot as Hades. cases. I can keep honourable members all night giving instances. have the instances. It is too hot for me. the case of the Sixth Division. Men have been prosecuted and convicted for saying that there was a Sixth Division of the Australian Imperial Force. Poor men have been punished for saying it , for writing it , and for selling the newspaper that published it . Free speech can never be suppressed. Men will take the risk of saying what they feel inclined to say. All that can be done is to punish them. Newspapers cannot be suppressed; and had it not been for the fact that towards the end the Government lifted the rigour of the censorship a little, mainly because of the protest of some of the censors, there would have been considerably more prosecutions. In many cases the newspapers have absolutely defied the censors, but they have not been prosecuted. However, returning to the case of the Sixth Division, men have been punished . for saying that such a division existed. When Brigadier-General Anderson returned from Great Britain, he made a statement, in whicli he said that there was a Sixth Division. That statement was published in the leading newspapers, whereupon I approached the censor here and pointed out that I had been prevented from making this statement, and had been threatened with prosecution if I did say it. I asked whether I could say it now that the leading newspapers had printed I s there any in the statement. The censor replied, "" I have recommended a prosecution, and it will probably take place against them, but now that they have said it you.can do so.""

The Leader of the Opposition made the statement in Richmond, and all the daily newspapers published it , but when we sought to publish it we were not allowed to do so, and were threatened with a prosecution. As a matter of fact, we have been punished dozens of times for printing things that had already appeared in the daily papers. War Precautions Regulations are not confined to a particular section, but in no single case has a powerful newspaper been prosecuted. heen taken only, against those who were opponents of the Government. The other day the Minister for Defence said that it was absolutely untrue to say that war news had been prevented from being published. As a matter of fact, I had a cable sent to me. and were not prosecuted, while others were prohibited from publishing it and were threatened with penalties if they disobeyed.

453,Mr Higgs,"The Prime Minister hasact in the drama: the defilement of tlie electoral laws. cided that an election or referendum was necessary, would not the ordinary electoral laws be adequate to meet the situation ? Yet, for the taking of the last referendum, the Government changed the very day of the week on which it has become the habit and custom in this country to hold elections. which have been framed and issued under the War Precautions Act, they have had practically a new electoral law created, not by the representatives of the people in Parliament assembled, but by a few men in their dug-out, and framed, too, on such lines that the Government thought they would be able to carry what they wanted to carry. They hedged the poll round with a whole brood of regulations, under which all classes' of"" men were to be prosecuted if they dared to say this and that. I pay my meed of respect to the majority of the men sitting on the other side for the generous and fair-minded manner in which they carried on the contest, but that cannot be said of the comparatively few who followed the lead of the Prime Minister. mitted unlimited licence to say whatever they wished, while anybody who dared to controvert or answer them was haled before the Court under regulations of which not one of us was cognisant, but which were framed merely for the purpose of carrying out t.he referendum.

We are the representatives of the people, but uot one of us has had a chance to say whether that force should be created or whether it shall continue to exist or not.

In order to carry the referendum not only did the Prime Minister alter the date to suit his convenience, but he changed the very day of polling which has become the habit and even the law of the land, to a day whioh he thought would prohibit thouI come now to the last sands from going to the poll. Then he took it upon himself, without the memI f the Government debers of this House-eve n his own supporters-havin g a chance to say "" yes "" or "" no,"" to deprive scores of thousands of Australian-born citizens of the right to exercise their franchise. He did it , of course, in order that the voting should be confined to men and women of British descent. A fine sentiment, but if it were In the voluminous regulations carried out extensively throughout the British dominions, whom would it reach? I was thinking how, when he paid_his visit to England and danced through the blue room and the green room at Windsor Castle, his British heart must have swelled with pride as he looked upon the long Tine of the British Georges-Georg e the First, George the Second, and George the Third-al l true-born B r i tishers. When he looked at Battenberg and others of that line, true Britons all, I wonder if he thought that regulation would apply to them ? The honourable memberf o r Barrier( Mr Considine) reminds me of the position of Lord Milner and others. The Prime Minister did not go f a r enough. They were perWasi t not the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) who quoted Scripture to the effect that the sins of the fathers are visited on the children to the third and fourth generation?

If it was right to refuse the vote to men who. though born on the soil of this country, by the mere accident of birth, over which they had no control, were of German descent, why did not the right honourable gentleman treat in the same way those who for long years prior The people have no to the outbreak of war have both publicly and in private assisted and fostered in After we adjourn we Australia German industries and German trade?

454,Mr Anstey,"countrymen in the hour of her distress. If the action of the Prime Minister was sound, why should the fact be overlooked that there are persons in Australia who have been charged with the administration of affairs of State, who have had so little regard for British prestige that they have caused railway carriage wheels to be imported to support the industry of Krnpps. State Governments and municipalities German commerce. W h y not reach out to those persons, who are worse than the Germans iu this country? They prate of their British blood and associations, but they have clone more than the Germans to undermine the stability of the British Empire. kept German vessels on the sea and on our coasts, and have handed over to the Germans the wharfs of this country and its commerce. years in Australia have assisted the development of tlie power of Germany are those who now, in its hour of crisis, are fostering in Australia, not the trade of Germany-the y cannot do that-bu t the trade of a people whose colour is not that of the Germans. We dare not mention them; that is not permissible under the censorship regulations. But most of yon know that these people are rapidly getting hold of British avenues of trade, and the industries which the Germans used to control. All we are doing is to exchange the commercial control of one foreign country for that of another, and this because we have to pay for support, to offer bribes to win friendship. What we are doing in Australia is to take business from one set of people and give it to another who, .God help us, are a darned sight worse, because the Germans are at least white. Let me show where I stand. I am an Englishman. I have been in this country since I was twelve years of age. I wish to be thought an Australian. God forbid that we should ever develop in Australia the conditions that exist in the older countries of the world. I have spent a long lif e in trying to make Australia what England is not. day because her people have been i m poverished by the enemies within her border. I saw England under the most horrible circumstances. I have walked its lanes with my mother, hungry and footsore. I have walked from county to county; irom Devon to Yorkshire and Lancashire ancl Nottingham, and so to London. I have slept under walls, and lived like a dog or a rat, eating grain out of a bag. Yet do you say that I do not love that country? I do love it . All who are near and dear to ine are there. The have for years assisted woman who bore me, the brothers who grew up with me, are there. The little village in which I was born is there. I went Home to see it , and the last remnant of my home had disappeared. My ancestors had lived there for centuries, and had fought and died for their country. It was It is they who have this old-established yeomanry who had an interest in the soil for which they fought and bled who made England. They fought for it , and maintained its traditions, and were respected in the land. I lef t England because she refused me the necessary And its mines. sustenance and education. She refused to The crowd w h o ' for make me a good man and a good citizen. She reared me in hunger; I have known my mother to say that she would sooner see her boys brought home dead on a shutter than have them hanging round suffering. Since the war began, this Empire for which we fight has given over £30,000,000 of money to compensate the Roumanian Oil Company for the closing up of their wells in Roumania, so that the Germans could not use them. In England itself I have a mother seventy-four years of age. My brother there, who had a small business, was taken by the scruff of the neck and sent to France to fight.. What is to become of my aged mother and of the invalid wife who cannot conduct her husband's business? In England, thousands of businesses and homes have thus been destroyed without compensation. The Prime Minister has said that there are 12,000.000 whose souls are attuned to the slums in which they dwell. That is what capitalism has done for England. It cares nothing for the education or' physical development or health of the people.

But the lands of England should be the property of those who fight for the country."" in this war. workmen want to know where the working classes will come in . Talk about Ignatius Donnelly's Cazsar's Column; this war is producing the most horrible resuscitation of capital in its most brutal form. Democracy, like patriotism? is but a word.

They throw them into the battle' line, where millions of them are destroyed. A r e those who come back to return as men have done from other wars, to the same horrible indecent conditions? Do honourable members desire to know what I live for ? I have come out of the bowels of the working class, as others on this side have done.

It r y to be as true as I can to the class to which I belong-no t because it is a class, but because it constitutes the great mass of the people. By its very numbers it constitutes the Democracy, the Demos, the great mass of the people. We are told that the defence of our country entails sacrifice. One fights for his house, but no one would be expected to fight for it who was merely a boarder. I want to know that I have a proprietary interest in the country. I The working want to know that others who are called upon to lay down their lives have a proprietary interest in the soil of the country for which they are fighting. Bearing out what the honourable member for Barrier has said, I may refer to what was said by Lord Rosebery, in 1909. I have quoted him before, but the statement will bear repeating Speaking to Capitalism is the dominant factor the overseas oress delegates on tlieir visit That is why we who are to London, he said, "" There is at this moment a hush in Europei n which you can almost hear a leaf fall to the ground. Yeti n the midst of this apparent peace there is the most active effort for war. I believe the power of this old country of ours to be such as to be able to meet any reasonable combination of Powers that may be brought against it . "" Such was his confidence in the preparation of the country; . and it reminds one of the ""sleep safely in your beds"" speech of Lord Fisher. This was said five years before the war broke out, and it confirms the statements that have been made that there was great preparation for long years for the war. Gladiators and I am putting up a boxers are trained for a long time before they enter the ring. In like manner gong sounds they sprang at each other's throats. Lord Rosebery said, "" When I view the approaching Armageddon I wonder whether we shall emerge from it into barbarism' or into a condition of things in which the workmen of the world will rise and say, -' we shall have no more of this misery, this grinding of us to powder.' "" Soi t is to-day that the hope of the world-the hope of peace-come s from the rising revolutionary spirit of the peo' pie. The revolutionary movement in Russia is spreading to all the countries, and we have seen from the cables that have recently appeared tliat the controlling powers in Germany dread more the spread of revolutionary doctrines than they do the bayonets of the enemy. So the cry which the workmen raise is' the best harbinger of peace, since it means the destruction of the capitalistic system, which is the foundation of war, and the",92,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour

It is true that there have been wars in all ages, but the wars of the past were entirely different from the wars due to modern capitalism. In earlier ages of the -world's history men went forth to war, and when they conquered the enemy they lived upon him. They made, a slave of 'him, and made him work for them. But, under modern conditions, men who come back from ' war, whether fit or wounded, come back to the bondage and slavery, not of a foreign enemy, but of men of their own race, who have made profits out of tliewar. The other day references were made to the enormous fortunes made in England during the war. nothing, but are asked to give up everything. their trade union privileges. The authorities hope, by a policy of suppression, to be able to secure harmony and peace. We are told that' there is harmony and peace in England. Do honourable members believe that ? If they do, let them go to the Library and read tlie Nineteenth Century and After. Let them read an article in the National Review dealing with the rise of the revolutionary movement. By the way, the National Review publishes an article on the rise of the re volution ary movement which we are not allowed to republish in this free Australia. National Reviewi f he has the money, but we must not reprint an article from it in any radical journal in this country. An article is published in the National Review dealing with the rise of the revolutionary movement in England, which, it is estimated, is supported by some hundreds of thousands. There have been statements recently in the press to the effect that 1,000,000 youths in England are beginning to protest against the policy of suppression. The revolutionary movement which started in Russia is spreading throughout the countries of the world, and is not to be ignored even in England. Men talk of the war lasting for another twelve months or.two years, but I venture to think that it w ill not last another two years because the internal situation in the countries chiefly concerned w ill prove to be more disastrous to the dominant and moneyed powers of the Governments of those countries than any result of a war with bayonets. To come to our own country. What are we going to do in Australia? This country has made^a mighty and magnanimous contribution to the war. There are men in this country who are making magnificent fortunes out of the war. I put it to you, sir, that without going outside the walls of this chamber you might lay your finger upon certain individualsI have no intention to mention names-and say, "" Sir, is it hot a fact that you are enormously richer to-day than you were when the war started ?"" I s it necessary that I should go any further? I s it ""not a fact that the prices of our commodities have become so enhanced, that many persons The great mass of the people get are much richer than they were when the war started? I say without any disreThe workmen have given up spect at all that there are individuals to whom we might say, "" Sir, you are very wealthy to-day. Y o u are worth scores of thousands of pounds more than you were at the beginning of th© war."" What have these men sacrificed? They have sacrificed nothing. The war has enormously increased their wealth. A t the same time the war demands that one should lay everything he possesses upon the altar of his country. He should be prepared to sacrifice all his worldly possessions, his lands, or mines, or minerals, and all his resources. There should be sacrifice, not merely of human life, but of human proOne can buy a copy of the perty. Men should be prepared to yield their wealth and sacrifice all their property on the altar of their country for its common defence. I am not here to discuss how and by what methods, but to lay down a sound fundamental principle, and I say that if it is possible to conscript human life it is equally possible to conscript human wealth. What was the spectacle that we witnessed at the last referendum ? On the one side there were the powerful newspapers of the country and behind them all the resources of the men of money, all the powers of wealth, and the prestige of social position. Every advantage was with the Ministerial side. On the other side, apart from the righteousness of their cause, there were few men of any great social importance, or of any great personal ability, and yet that side scored a majority. Was that because of the, influence of a few men ? cause in Australia tide of revolt hood and womanhood of the affecting even the men who have returned from the battle; and the position will become worse as time goes on. As to the Prime Minister, no man could have done more to defeat the referendum than lie did. If he had been paid, and asked to carry out methods that would have resulted in its defeat, he could not have done better. abuse, every method he employed, and all his battle-cries, including that of ""To hell with the Irish,"" had their effect in defeating the proposal. thing crimson, it was ' the Workers of the World; if he saw anything green, he tied something over its mouth; aud if he saw the yellow dog, he tied something to its tail; everything he did bended to arouse the animosities of the people. many and the influence of German money; in short, all he did won him more enemies than friends. finality to this thing Unless the Government and the party behind it are orepared to impose conscription 'upon Australia, as they have threatened to dounless they explain away their threats as they do their pledges-they face the situation as it is.

This is the day and the hour when Parliament must ask itself, not so much what it will do during the war, or to what extent it will drain the manhood of the country overseas, but in. what manner it will organize our material resources so as to provide for the men who return from the slaughter line.

Somebody has said that this country of ours will not be represented at the Peace Conference, and I agree with the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) on that point If , after what Australia will have to has done, the Imperial or any Allied Government dared to exclude us from a voice in any Peace Conference, or in any deliberations as to the ultimate disposal of this continent-if any dared to so deny us, after our enormous contribution of This material wealth and men and blood, It is a quessimply because a majority ""of Australian of Australia citizens, in the exercise of their free demoWe who were not cratic rights expressed an opinion conbut) who have come trary to that of some one else, then God and desire to run this help us.

If it be ventured to exclude us from any peace deliberations, I venture to say that, whether Britain or Germany wins, Australia will be the price that will have to be paid.

469,Mr Lynch (Werriwa) [11.12],"I am find ourselves inclined to waste ouradvantages to Australia and the Australian people. He was welcomed as a man of capacity, as an Empire builder; and the Australian Labour party gloried in Ids triumph. When he toured Britain preaching universal service, preaching and teaching what he considered a vita l necessity-that the whole of the resources of GreatB r it a in and the Dominions should be thrown into a 'common centre in order that the war might be prosecuted to a successful issue-tlier e was not a note of discord in Australia. No one took exception to his utterances. We know, too. that throughout the British Empire a spirit of patriotism animated the people, and that the principle of conscription was Ibe ing ""advocated and taken up day by day hy increasing numbers even in Australia. 'The concription pot, in fact, was boiling over. I well remember the discussions ""that took place in Labour circles, both inside and outside the Labour party, at that time. It was evident that the majority of Labour people believed that if the conscription issue were submitted to a referendum it would in all probability -be carried. The statement has been made that if the Prime Minister had not brought back this accursed thing w i th h i m from Europe-is it suggested that he brought it back in his carpet bag? -w e alone among the nations war would have been immune from any difference of opinion with regard to this principle of conscription, ls it not as clear as the noonday sun that if the Prime Minister had never again revisited these shores we would have been compelled to face this question ? Isi t not clear that when the Prime Minister came back to Australia, a large section of the peopio were expecting him to declare for conscription ? ' And why did he not do so ? When he was delivering those speeches which attracted so much attention, speeches made purposely, no doubt, to educate public opinion to the acceptance by a truly democratic method of the principle of conscription, did we as a Federal Labour party make any demur, or indulge in hostile criticism? No. It was not until 24th August, when the Prime Minister came to the Caucus room, that a discordant note was sounded. was then found that the Prime Minister had determined, if possible, to induce the partu to submit the question to tlie people. Mr Lynch Honourable members in the course of this debate have said that the Leader of the Government while in England was carried away by his association with I m perialists, and that he came back tb Australia for the specific purpose of enslaving the manhood of this country; that he would, if he could, have thrust conscription down the throats of the people. But is it not a fact that he pleaded and fought with his own party to get even a majority of two to declare in favour of submitting this question to the people? If he were compelled to do what we knew he would be obliged to do if the vote failed, that is, resign, a large number of the old leaders of the Labour party, including many able men who had won their spurs in the movement, would have followed him. While, as an anti-conscriptionist, I would part with all I possessed rather than see conscription fastened upon the land of my birth , I preferred severance with the party rather than acquiesce in the expulsion of those men who were prepared to stand behind the Prime Ministeri n a vote of censure if such were moved when he must meet the House. Doubtless members of the party knew what the Prime Minister would do if they failed to put the first principle of their platform into at operation by referring the question to the people. The Labour Government would have been disrupted, it is true. A new Government would then have been formed, and we would have had conscription by proclamation, or honourable members would have failed miserably in their professions about doing what they more than hinted it was the duty of the Prime Minister to do-to take the only available means at his disposal, as it was absolutely impossible to put the Bil l through Parliament, to do what the exigencies of the circumstances and the danger to the Empire demanded. Conscription would have been secured in that way. Therefore, was it not the knowledge of that fact that compelled a large number of the Labour members to sit silent and refuse to vote when, by twenty-three to twenty-one votes, a motion was carried to submit the question to the people ? The it Prime Minister, if he was desirous of de-. stroying the Labour party, could have got all the assistance he wanted, but he pleaded,-as never man pleaded before, for the movement in which he had spent his life. And is there one weli-informed Labourite, in or out of this Parliament, who can say that during that trying time the Prime Minister broke the platform of that party? Is there one? No, not one. This is what the London correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald, writing after the referendum had been turned down, had to say concerning the opinion held in England hv those people who, according to the Prime Minister's opponents, won him over and made bim a traitor to Australia. The article is dated London. 7ud November, statesOnr first cable news of tlie referendum result discloses a majority against the proposal large enough to Settle the matter without much need of reference to votes still uncounted. That being so, many Australians on this side are disappointed. ' Tho newspaper comment of this country is quite pathetically non-committal, and for good reason. The Liberal organs being also Radical, approval of the referendum, but for decency's sake they are unable to say much concerning its result as a contribution to the downfall of the enemy in the field. Nor can they rejoice, much as .they would like to, in the defeat of Mr were out to kill conscription, but Hughes, to whose propaganda on this side they were opposed, seeing that it was he who gave the Labour electorate of Australia its chance of gathering up its forces and organizing its attack. The Conservative newspapers, similarly, can say little. Thoy have small sympathy with Labour and less with Socialism. But as it was they who, for their own ends, boomed Mr Hughes into eminence as the strong man of the Empire, they cannot with any grace condemn the referendum result without disclosing Mr Hughes as something less strong than they made him out to be. For even this public knows what a strong man ought to have done and would have done in the face of the obvious need for men, and for that reason the Conservative Hughesite press has been very silent on the subject of the referendum ever since it was announced as the policy df Mr Hughes. Now, with the result of it a defeat, that press is, on its Hughes side, more than ever in a tight place. Soi t comes about that nearly all the referendum press comment here says nothing that matters, and is merely the colourless comment of a pious hope that the Australian Army will continue to be fed by voluntary enlistments-whic h hope, in truth, is all that is available to any of us. The Prime Minister might have basely repudiated conscription, but the damning fact that condemns honourable members opposite is that the referendum was submitted according to the constitution of the Labour party. was supported by honourable members generally on both sides of the House, and the issue was submitted constitutionally to the people. Even if the Liberal members who loyally stood behind the Government had refrained from voting, there was a majority of Labour members in both Houses. It was Labour's referendum. It was supported andopposed by Labour men, bub still, if tlie blame attached to anybody, it attached to us as a Labour party. The Prime Minister had carried out all that was possible for him to do in the circumstances; he had subscribed 1916, aud, the Labour party's principles. Therefore, if Labour had been better educated in the tenets of its own faith , it would not have allowed itself to be led astray by all these petty abstractions-the things said with regard to what had been done by regulation, and the statements made by . the Prime Minister, whose scorpion tongue, it was said, had always scorched our opponents in the old days while we laughed and made merry over tlieir discomfiture. The outside organizations showed not only that they that in their panic desire to do so they would outrage every plank of the Labour platform and the principles for which it stood. I , in common with every member of the Labour party in New South Wales, received a warning that if I supported the referendum on conscription inside or outside of Parliament, I would lose my endorsement. I think that furnishes the reason why so many gentlemen who sat in the corner would not vote on the referendum proposal. They knew that if this outrage on our platform-thi s outside domination-were persisted in , their political existences would be at stake, and that if they supported the minority they must cause a disruption of the Government and hand the affairs of the country over to men who were sufficiently conscriptionist to give effect to their opinions in the only way open to them, namely, by introducing Conscription by proclamation. It is true that about ten of those men did not support the Referendum B ill his party and obtained in this House, and on the first occasion on which they weiit up for election four of them lost their seats. We submitted the question to the people, and we denied the right of the organizations outside to The Bill dominate our actions. We knew that their action, was based on the resolution passed at the 1916 Conference in New South Wales, and subsequently by the other States. We knew the action was utterly "" the new movement,"" as it was called in Labour circles, considered the opportune for instituting full control over Labour members, Federal and State, that would mark the beginning of a bold progressive policy. The old constitutional and truly democratic method of leaving the punishment tatives to the constituencies was ,to be set aside. It was clear to us that if we subscribed to that principle every in the Labour party became the mere puppets of the executive, which would be the real Parliament govern. 1914 as the selected Labour candidate for Werriwa. is the platform, and I will explain it as well as I am able to do. It binds me. and it binds you if I am accepted, and not even a comma in it can be altered until somebody occupying my position before you again. You are not asked to sign a blank cheque."" stitutional which threatened with the loss of endorsement every man who dared to support a referendum of the proposal was held to be binding on us, and we were informed on that occasion-and ruthlessly carried out-that expelled from the movement and our seats taken from us if we dared to disobey. do not think those men realized how far this absurd principle would carry them. They dictment of government monstrously that, by the stirring up of , mud, and the causing of confusion, they tried to induce the people to forget that this outrage on representative petrated. to take charge of the representative stitutions of this country by a system of applied tyranny, they forgot the duty that the Labour movement owed to humanity and all the higher ideals for which it stood. How did those honourable members who voted for the referendum House escape the wrath to come? were honourable and straightforward and they voted for the appeal to the people. Mr Lynch. adopted bound to vote in -the House as the majority of a duly-constituted Caucus unconstitutional, and that meeting decided, and they voted accordingly. Some of them had to go on the moment penitential platform for a while, but they were all forgiven. If honourable members will examine a list of the names of those gentlemen who turned against the Prime Minister when we were asked as Federal members to stand up,' not only for the of Parliamentary represenunity of the Federal Labour Government and party, but also for the imperishable principles of right upon which the Labour member movement rests, they w ill find that they represented constituencies in which whoever secures the Labour nomination is if Labour continued to sure of being returned. The sacrifice they I appeared on the platform in were asked to make was too great. Perhaps the same accusation might be made. I said to the electors. "" Here against me, because Werriwa is not a Labour seatat the present moment. It may be said that I had not the same temptations as those other gentlemen, but I ask honourable members to recollect comes that, on 24th August, when the throat was whispered round the But the unconcaucus room, that men were in danger, decision of the Conference, of having their indorsements refused, I stated that I declined to accept a seat, much less a nomination, from bodies that had forgotten the principle of liberty. I , one of the most confirmed anti-conscripthe threat has been tionists, preferred to be driven from the we' would be movement that I love,, rather than be led > by a halter by those who had no concepI tion of freedom and no idea of where their actions would land the Labour movement. I have been branded as being did not see that the inlukewarm on this question. In reply, I of a democratic form propose to read what I said at the first was involved in their meeting addressed by me in opposition foolish action. It is true to conscription in 1916. On that occasion I was condemned because it was alleged that the tone which I adopted was too moderate. A t that time. I felt that, government was being pernotwithstanding all that had transpired, For a vain and foolish desire nowithstanding all the condemnation to in which the Prime Minister had been subjected, there was suflicient Democracy in the Labour movement to bring us together again when the bone of contention had been decided, as I hoped it would be decided, by the electors turning down conin this scription. This is what I said on the They 10th October, 1916men, From no section or party that continues to withhold and deny a full measure of freedom They knew that they were could I accept a seat in Parliament in the future. Though opposed to conscription of the manhood of Australia, I want to say that I cannot join in tlie wholesale condemnation of our Prime Minister that a large number of my party is inclined to indulge in. I want to record here my belief that 1 think Mr Hughes, in advocating conscription for Australia, is animated more by the deathless feeling of love and patriotism for the land of his birth (which all true men feel), more than concern for the immediate welfare of the land of his adoption. I went on to sayI do say that the horrors that he witnessed ment, and despite the circumstance that on the field and in the hospitals, the inner facts that were revealed to him, the unexampled opportunities that were his to see and know, what a fate was threatening the loveland of his birth, and her proud Empire has betrayed him into asking a sacrifice from Australia which is foreign to our conceptions of the vital principles of self-government. He must not forget that whilst we all claim to be patriotic and devoted to the Allied cause, tliere are degrees of patriotism by which useful and effective service can alone be made the idea of conscription from the beginin this country, and beyond which we cannot go without danger or disaster to our possible maximum effort in this war. It is useless to ignore these degrees I have mentioned, for they have their root in the same noble feeling that I credit the Prime Minister with (perhaps unconsciously) being swayed. We nativeborn Australians must and will put Australia first. I want to show that if the gentlemen who now accuse the Prime Minister of every crime in the calendar were only true to their better selves, tthey would ask, "" Why did not the right honourable gentleman perform this culminating act of treachery when he could have made it effective 7 Why did he leave us nothing tio go upon except this small thing by comparison with the big things which he might have done against us, but did not?"" They know perfectly well that what I am saying is absolutely true. They know that the Labour party submitted to the people in a constitutional way the question of conscription, that it was defeated by the electors, and that, because of the failure of that referendum, there was no shadow of reflection cast on the Prime Minister that was not also cast upon every member of thab party and supporter of the Government. Yet we are now told that in re-submitting the referendum, and because of a promise which he made, the Prime Minister stands condemned, as do also his Ministerial colleagues and the whole of the members of the National party. As a matter of fact, I disagreed with tlie pledge to hold a second referendum, which he gave, and i m mediately telegraphed my resignation as a candidate of the National party if I were expected to be bound by It . However, I was informed that I was not, and that is why I am here to-night. As the result of the recent referendum, we are now told that the people are solidly behind the small remnant comprising the Official Labour party that was returned to this Parliament after the electors had ascertained something of the facts connected with the rupture in the Labour movethe general elections on the 5th May last resulted in the almost complete annihilation of that party. On that occasion what did the electors of Australia do? They practically wiped that party off the slate. The honourable member for CookJ Mr. Catts), in his short history of the oeriod to which I refer, said that we repudiated ning, that we had nothing tto do with the wretched thing, but that Mr Hughes did it all. According to the honourable member, the right honourable gentleman alone 1 was responsible for all the evil and all the in j u r y. The honourable' member reminds me of the small boy who was picked up unconscious at the heels of a mule, and who, when he regained his senses, was told that he must have done something to the mule. Though he was covered with blood and scars, he absolutely scouted the idea, and said, "" I was merely trying to cut my name on his heels with my jack-knife."" That is why the Official Labour party was turned down. In it we had a body of men who, by submitting to the tyranny which was put upon them by ignorant and panicstricken outsiders, had forfeited every right to the consideration of people loving a representative form of government. These men were defeated, and will be defeated again unless they can convince the people that some new form of iniquity was threatened by the re-submission of the question of conscription to the electors. The Official Labour party has no hope of governing this country until they undo, the wrong which they have done I am just as sound a Labour man as I ever was. During the recent campaign I told tha people in my electorate, many of whom are supposed to be hide-bound Conservatives and red-hot conscriptionists, that my position had not changed, and that I could not allow an outside body to take away from them the right which I held sacredly in trust for them, or permit their part in the government of the country to be dictated behind closed doors by a few. gentlemen to whom their representatives were to play the part of willin g slaves. The Labour movement w ill never die; the humanitarian principles upon wnich it has been buil t up in various forms throughout the world w ill still go on, but nothing has done more to disgrace a great movement than the surrender which was made by men who, had they taken the stand tliat others took, and defied their would be masters outside, would have still been participating in a solid Labour Government controlling the affairs of this country. had only stuck to their pledge upstairs. of scriptural texts being bandied about to-day, perhaps with very little Christian spirit, but the man or the party that causes others to sin also sins. If there be degradation or evil in the actions of a Government-if crimes are alleged against it-becaus e of the tremendous difficulties that have been occasioned by the disruption of the Labour party through the outrage of the principles upon which the party was founded, those responsible for that outrage must accept the blame. majority at the Caucus meeting for the referendum ? a majorit y for the referendum. bers? twenty-three to twenty-one, and. al l the time. I had my eye on certain gentlemen who requested the Prime Minister to go -to their ""bosses"" and t r y to convince them that what he proposed was a right and democratic thing. orable member, as it was explained to me, was based on a conscientious objection to conscription. The honourable member said that he would not remain in any Government that would adopt it . remain in a Government that took a referendum on tlie question. tralia ; it is the only country for me, but it is my honest opinion that where a country governed by a party system has reached such an acute stage as we reached in Australia, when some sudden disruption prevents parties from performing their duties according to a well-established"" and disciplined system, what has' happened in the Commonwealth must happen, and there cannot be anything but turmoil and dissensionsuch as, unfortunately, we now have in Australia. No one was louder in his declamation against the Liberal party than I was; there was no one more opposed to the principles dear to those gentlemen who for m the Liberal party than I was, but I recognise that they stood solidly behind both the Fisher Government and the Hughes Government when we were supposed to be a united Labour party. Withouti n the slightest We have heard a lot degree reflecting on the capacity of the Liberal party to take up the reins of government, I believe that, owing to the jealousy of organized labour against capital ancl capitalism, and against what may be termed the upper grades of society whom the Liberals are considered to represent more largely than any other grade, the best efforts Australia is capable of giving could have been brought to bear at this time only by the methods that were adopted when they agreed to give us loyal support in every action takeD for the maintenance of our maximum effort in this war.

When he said thab true government consisted of government of the people by the people and for the people, he was simply voicing something based on the imperishable truth that the right begotten of our common humanity rises superior to all mere petty, man-made institutions; and as the greater cannot be contained in the less, so the people are naturally the final court of appeal. The second referendum provided at least a necessary corrective to that conscriptionist opinion which the people of Ausbralia are not inclined to cultivate any further, but which, on the contrary, they are the more inclined to dissociate themselves from the more closely they examine it . W it h all due respect to my conscriptionist friends, their attitude in assuming that conscription is tlie one patriotic test reminds me of something I read mauy years ago of a certain -clan who were celebrated for having exceptionally wide mouths. The reason was that, as each of them came into the world, he was tested to see whether he was the real McKay by having a huge wooden spoon, an heirloom, thrust into his mouth. The test generally had to be gone through. whatever the infant's feelings were. So there seems a tendency to thrust the conscription spoon into the mouth of every man and woman in Australia to test their loyalty. A very great mistake is made by those who take up that attitude. I am speaking plainly in this matter, because I feel perfectly independent on it . It was rendered utterly impossible for me to stay with those gentlemen who made a bone oi contention of the conscription racket, because that is one thing panic amongst the people. wrecked a great ing movement, and while that panic is upon the people their desire to avenge the great sin that cries aloud for vengeance in the world is liable, for the time being, to be thrust on one side. I spoke on the question of conscription on the 20th September, 1916, when addressing the House on the ReferendumB ill , and my views are the same now. I said that whilst All queseve^y man and woman was entitled to hold a conscientious opinion for or against conscription without let or hindrance, I Abraham Lincoln was could not support it conscientiously, because I believed it was opposed to the doctrine of right. We have heard the parallel of tjie burglar entering one's house. My interpretation of the law of right, based upon my belief in a Higher Poweri is that if a burglar or murderer comes into your house for the purpose of destroying life, or something that is worth even more than life, it is your duty to slay him-if you cannot in a more effective way protect your household. It is your duty, also, in a corporate capacity to slay any body of men that invade your country, but the matter must be within the orbit of ' your own control. If you go with lethal weapons in the middle . of the night into the house of another man to destroy burglars who may be prowling there, you place yourself in a wrong position. You might be accused of being there with burglarious, or worse, intent yourself. You place yourself in the same position when, in a corporate capacity, you and your fellow citizens enter another country with arms in your hands. The limitation is there, clear and definite.

We know well that nine out of ten of those who voted at the referendum were concerned wholly with their opinion on conscription, and at the present moment the people are interested uot in the question whether the Government has adopted the right method to relieve itself of the obligation imposed by its pledge, but what attitude vernment intends to take regarding conscription : whether it intends to respect the popular some interference with it. Although most of the members of this party are conscriptionists, the people having been permitted to say directly whether they would have conscription, and having against it, we feel that that policy should not be put into force' contrary to their declared will. stituencies must be respected. we maintain that attitude, I shall .refuse to admit that the Democracy is better represented by the members of the Opposition than by this party. members opposite could have the trouble and turmoil that we have had if , after the first referendum, realized that the people had spoken, and that so long as their decision was respected and Government paired. ist party to disrupt for the very reasons for which Mr Lynch. disrupted the Labour Government, which had faithfull y given effect to ' it s party's platform.

Why did they disrupt our What is Government and party. It w as ber cause it was felt that a refusal to follow the orders which had been received from outfcide would probably in the future have involved the loss of a number of seats. They ask us now to break up a Government and a party who received the approval of the people on the 5th May, on the condition that they were not to introduce conscription. They ask us to do so because, in order to placate expressing friends or reconcile foes, the Government came to a decision to stake their existence as a Government on the carrying of the referendum vote, and made a pledge that could not be kept if they were to be loyal to the still greater pledge to the people the Gowho had elected them, and had put up the bar so definitely against those who were opposed to them on the 5th May. decision cr contemplates Personally, I opposed the Government proposal,as I had said that I would. . I said that I could not support the Government, or appear as one of its recognised declared candidates, if it went before the country as a conscriptionist Government. But I am not going to vote against them on a The decision of the conmotion of this kind, because this is a case And while of Satan reproving sin.

I pointed out that by merely voting at the ballot-box, we coufd not win the war. I pointed out that it would be much easier for us to vote to send a handful of single men to the Front, to throw a few of our numbers to the wolves, in the hope that we would be able to get away before the danger reached ourselves, than to do what would be involved in the adoption of a true policy of anti-conscription, which would demand that each and every one of us should make as nearly as humanly possible an equal sacrifice. held that we should ask no sacrifice from other people while we were unwilling to give even our all . The business of the country and the relation of classes and industries to each .other are based upon certain principles. However much I may disagree with those principles, I know that they cannot be disregarded altogether without bringing woe upon the whole community. I believe in evolutionary progress in all things. If ever there was an opportunity for a people to give an earnest of their sincerity in the cause of patriotism, that opportunity is now with us. We must not waste our energies in fighting each other. well as the Front by every possible effort, it is up to us to institute systems by which not only our existing industries w ill be maintained, but new industries and new production created. We must be prepared to do all that self-sacrificing people should do to maintain their position and independence, and that is all that it is possible for them to do, not merely from a military point of view, but in every other way. To merely vote down conscription w ill not solve the problem witli which we are faced. _ The people of Australia, having been given an opportunity to decide the prin ciple upon which they would conduct the war, have decided against conscription. I think that they have rightly so decided. I do not regard the referendum vote as in any way disgracing the people of AusI tralia. I feel that it would have been an unutterable disgrace to Australia if conscription had been carried. I admit, that other men are equally sincere in holding the opposite view. But we are up against tremendous problems. WeI attempted to give have in this great empty country to solve problems hitherto undreamt of. I had an opportunity to tour the greater part of New South Wales as a member of a Iioyal Commission inquiring how r u r a l industries might be fostered and extended. I have been for 26 or 27 years a working farmer, and I know something of the problems which the people of Australia have to face. A f t e r investigating the matter, I saw plainly that our systems of land settlement are unstable, and are not based on equity or justice. Unless we in common with the people of other I countries evolve purer and truer systems under which individuals, as well as classes, w ill be more just and f a i r to other individuals and other classes, unless we bring about a state of things in which, whilst conserving the responsibility of the individual, we can provide an equal opportunity for all, we shall, as the result of the present world conflict, be drawn into a maelstrom of revolutionary difficulties and disunion which cannot promote advancement, but must result in retrogression for society and civilization. Whilst the war has not actually been waged in Australia this problem w ill be as important for us as it is for the people of other We must realize that, as countries. Though the majority of the maintaining our men at party to which I belong are opposed to me on the question of conscription, I believe that the fact that Australia has retained her freedom in that all-important matter will cause this country to be regarded as a haven to . which countless thousands of liberty-loving people bereft of homes w ill come. I believe that by the referendum vote it w ill be found that we have not put a brand of disgrace upon Australia, but have shown the people of the world that this is a country in which we have kept the flag of Liberty flying. It is that flag which has made British colonization the most successful in tlie world's history. The fact that GreatB r it a in had to change her system in her hour of danger is no proof that there was a sudden thrust forward by a laggard Democracy. It only meant that the principle of voluntarism had been carried to such au extent that it had been forgotten that eternal vigilance and preparation for war is the price of safety and liberty. A t Home and in the Dominions we had failed to make every possible provision for defence; otherwise it would not have been necessary to abandon voluntarism at the heart of the Empire. principle of liberty only can we make Empire expansion worthy or defensible, and that principle would have been maintained in all its glory under the one flag but for the circumstances I have described. not express such hearty approval. It is I think I have shown clearly that while the party on this side has made an attempt to get the people to accept conscription there is no evidence yet of that tyranny which would compel men, because of their conscientious opinions, to leave the party; but should that moment arrive, I shall be prepared to take thc action I took on a former occasion, and tread my lonely path. a.m.] -In niy humble judgment the contribute as large a percentage, accordpledge or threat-thoug h I believe it was ing to population, as those countries intended for a pledge-mad e at Bendigo nearer the battle front .

Having twice tested public opinion on the question of conscription, it is about time to conclude that the people of Australia are distinctly against the system. That being so, it devolves on honourable members on both sides to evolve some other scheme whereby we can supply what we deem to be a sufficiency of men. B y maintaining the Honourable members applaud that sentiment; but it is quite likely that, later on, when I express mv opinion as to the number of men and divisions that should be maintained at the Front, they may said by some that it is not fair to compare the efforts of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, but, personally, I think the comparison a perfectly legitimate one. I say now, as I said during the referendum campaign, that Australia is supporting six divisions at the Front, while Canada is supporting four, and New Zealand one. Whether the war lasts six months or five years, I would not be one, nor have I ever been, to contend It fell to my lot during the recent To the electors I",102,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour
481,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [12.58 That Australia Should Be Called Upon To,"put the position that Australia, with a population of less than 5,000,000, and 12,000 miles from the seat of war, is maintaining six divisions at the F r o n t ; Canada, with a population of over 8,000,000, and 3,000 miles from the battlefront, is maintaining four divisions at the Front, while New Zealand, 12,000 miles from the battle-front, and with a population of 1,250,000, is maintaining one division. 86,000 men to the Front of the number of divisions being maintained there. A t a joint meeting of members of both Houses, I asked thecPrime Minister whether, we were to be bound to secrecy as to what transpired, because, if so, I would seriously consider whether I should not withdraw. Tlie right honourable gentleman said that, with the exception of one or two matters, members would not be bound to secrecy. Even had we been pledged to silence as to the.number of. troops sent to the Front, I should have been absolved from that pledge by the speech made by Senator Pearcei n the Sydney TownH a l l on 31st October last. During the first referendum campaign I mentioned that up to a certain point four divisions had been promised, and that I believed that the Government had the approval of Parliament in despatching those divisions to the Front. But when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), off his own bat, promised a f if t h division, I considered he went beyond what this Parliament would be prepared to concede. As I said at the joint meeting of members of both Houses, when we promised_ to maintain a fifth division we "" . b it off a little more than we could chew."" I have made myself conversant with the Canadian position, having read the Hansard report of the speech ' made by Sir Robert Bordeni n introducing the M i l i tary ServiceB ill , as well as speeches by SirW i l f r i d Laurier, Mr Oliver, Mr White, and others. listed from the province of Quebec? matter all in good time member also know that sixty-six different languages are spoken by Canadian immigrants ? the Military Service Bil l was before the Canadian House of Commonsi n June last, SirW i l f r i d Laurier said there was considerable complaint as to the contribution made by Quebec, where the principal sections of the French-speaking people of Canada live. SirW i l f r i d Laurier, who is of French extraction, regretted that that section had not contributed its fair quota, but said that from the official figures he had been able to obtain he had formed the opinion that the French-speaking ' section of Canada had contributed at least one I am speaking now division. During that debate it was also brought out that of 300,000 enlistments the Canadian-born represented only 125,000. Nearly two-thirds of the enlistments in Canada comprised Britishborn who had arrived there in comparatively recent years. ber seen Sir Edward Kemp's statement, as published in the Herald yesterday, that 350,000 have gone to the Front frora Canada? been gathered from official documents, and the Hansard report of the debate on the M i l it a r y ServiceB ill in the Canadian House of Commons. One of the mosv serious complaints made in the Canadian House 'of Commons, during the last six months and prior to the recent general elections, was that a great number ot men who were physically unfit to enter the firing line had been sent from Canada to Great Britain. It was computed thai nearly 50,000 would have to be brought back. Sir Robert Borden, who read in the House of Commons a cablegram from Sir George Periey, the representative of Canadai n Britain, stating that he was sending back these men because complaints had been made of a shortage of labour in the farming and other industries of the Dominion. It was asked why these men should be sent to Great Britain, since they were physically unfit to go to the Front, but would be of use in the industries of Canada. Having regard to Australia's remoteness from the battle I shall deal with that front, I hold that w i th or without conscription it is impossible for us to mainthe honourable tain six divisions there. should not forget that until recently Canada had to keep 150,000 men on the Americanf r o ntier..",105,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour

490,Mr Poynton,"The honourable memberlieved. Up to a certain period 50,000 men were kept in camp in Canada because of the foreign element in the United States, as well as w it h in Canada itseK. According to the latest figures', Canada has sent 350,000 men to the Pront. Erom that total, however, we must deduct the 50,000 who are being returned because of their physical unfitness to enter the firing line, so that the position of Australia and Canada, in so f a r as the total number of effectives at the Front is concerned, is very much the same. I read very caref u l l y the speech delivered by Sir Robert Borden upon his return from a visit to the Old Country, when he said, in January, 1915, "" I saw one Canadian division at the F r o n t , "" and I remember quite distinctly reading this year that he said that he had just returned from the Front, where he saw four Canadian divisions. Right through his speech were references to these four Canadian divisions, and I say now that Canada is experiencing a considerable difficulty in keeping up her enlistments. In view of the position in Canada, I think it is time we came to some decision as to Australia's contribution to the war, and having fixed upon the number of divisions, endeavoured to maintain a f u l l supply of reinforcements for them. During the recent campaign I said that, if we could keep four divisions at their f u l l strength, it would be better than endeavouring to maintain a larger number of divisions under the voluntary system. I am of the same opinion to-day. I desire now to refer briefly to the Sixth Division and to quote a reply made by the Prime Minister at Bendigoi n answer to a question on the night before the 1917 election. Mr Hughes, as reported.in the Bendigo Independent of 5th May, 1917, admitted that Australia had a Sixth Division at the Front. We had 60,000 men at Salisbury Plain, and a division was formed and sent to France wliere they aided in the great victory at Lagniits continued co'nfidence in Mr Hughes, and in court. (Cheers.) I have turned up the files of the daily press to find that the battle of Lagniftourt is reported by cable to have been fought on 17th A p r i l , of last year, or only a couple of weeks before the PrimeM in ister made his statement at Bendigo. I am not going to say that the Sixth Divi sion is in s is t e n c e to-day on the Western country and the Empire it will not support any The y have been reFront, for I know that it is not, but when people say that there never was a Sixth Division there, I am entitled to quote the Prime Minister's statement which has never been denied, though men who advocated the "" No"" side of the conscription issue have been prosecuted for saying a Sixth Division had been formed. The fact about the number of divisions was established by the "" figures presented to the combined meeting in the Senate club room, and also to a public meeting held in Sydney. Senator Pearce said then that there were five divisions on the Western Front, and the equivalent of another division was being maintained in Egypt, on the Suez Canal, and in Mesopotamia, so that at the time of the referendum we were practically maintaining six divisions. In my humble judgment this number is too great for Australia, situated as we are so f a r distant from the battle front. It would be far better if we could maintain four divisions at their f u l l strength instead of having a greater number of ragged divisions. Hitherto, there has been altogether too much haphazard promising to provide men for the Front. P r i o r to the first referendum in October, 1916,' and when a F if t h Division was promised, I raised an objection to the extra division; and I say now that, if we did as well as Canada, which is only 3,000 miles from the battle Front, we would be doing magnificently, because the population of Australia is 3,000,000 less than that of Canada. Eveni f we subtract the French population of the Dominion, there is still left an English-speaking population larger than ours. Coming now to fhe motion before the House, I desire to place on record the resolutions agreed to by -the National party, as supplied to the press on 3rd January. A f t e r considerable discussion, as I understand, the following motion was agreed to:That the Federal National party expresses view of the exceptional circumstances considers that, in the best interests of the country and the Empire, Mr Hughes should retain the leadership of the party. Another motion carried was as follows: That this party, in view of the recent declared attitude of the Official Labour party on the vital question of the conduct of war and peace, declares that in the interests of the",106,Labou R Shortag E In Canada Proposal To Conscript Alien Labour
491,Mr Eenton,"course of action that will hand the government of the Commonwealth over to the Official Labour party. Another motion was submitted as follows : That tlie National party approves of the Gowould be left in the hands of the Governorvernment honouring the pledge it gave to the people that unless it got the power asked for it could not and would not carry on the government, by tendering its resignation, and that Mr Austin Chapman be asked to form a Government. That motion was not acceptable to the National party, so the following was agreed to:That the matter be left in the hands of the Government to take whatever steps it deemed advisable to give honourable effect to the pledge ment might be allowed to live for a month given to the people of Australia. I do not intend to say anything about the members who moved or seconded the motion, but we all know that the resolutions were adopted because they were given to the press by the Prime Minister in the course of his statement, and therefore they are a true record of the meeting. mitted. dealt with the particular phases of the matter in which we are now interested, and it seems to me that the attitude of ' the National party was like that of a man who put up his umbrella ro protect himself from the rain. from your environment. member is in my environment, so I am quite right. WhatI want to say is that if these resolutions were analyzed carefully it would be seen that the main concern was to avoid a general election at all costs. member does not want an election, does he? of the finger what any man or woman may say about inconsistency as applied to my actions. If I am convinced that a certain course of action which I may have , approved of is wrong, I would be very foolish if I did not change my opinion. I do not mind what people say about inconsistency. When, during the recent campaign, I was asked how I regarded the pledge made by the Prime Minister, I said T believed Mr Hughes would tender his resignation if he intended to remain true to his pledge; but T did not know whether he would offer any advice to H is Excellency or not. But he, having made that pledge, and the majority of the people having voted "" No , "" I should say that if the Prime Minister resigned the matter General, and I saw no other course for him to pursue than to send for the Leader of the Labour party. He might or might not undertake to for m a Ministry. If he were commissioned td do so and his Government met the House, some member of the Opposition might immediately move the adjournment of the House, and that would be the end of the M in is t r y; or, alternatively, the Governor so. But whether they met w i th a sudden death motion or were allowed to remain in office for the time being, there was ouly one way to clear up the situation, and that was for the Governor General to grant a dissolution, and consult the people again as to whether they 'would or would not return a party pledged to conscription. member advocate a double dissolution ? the position in the Senate? argument, there were an election next month, and the Labour party were returned to power, I should have very little fear of what the Senate would do after having heard the verdict of the people. vernment did not resign when the referendum proposals were defeated. that if the Fisher Government had honourable staked their life on the carrying of the referenda, Ministers would have had no honourable alternative but to resign. vernment said that they could not carry out their platform without the powers sought. argument to use when asking for power to amend the Constitution.

I have no means of finding out how members of the National party spoke in their Caucus meeting, but, knowing the views of the honourable member for Plinders( Sir William Irvine) on this question, I have not the slightest doubt that he emphasized his own opinion that the Government having pledged their life on the issue must keep their compact with the people and resign. The whole burden of the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) was a tirade against the' Labour party. If the honourable member had directed some of his caustic criticisms to members of his own party they wpuld have been better applied. When there is any missionary work to be done it is well to do it in our own circle before we set out to evangelize others ' Having regard to the text of the resolutions of the Nationalist Caucus, it seems an act of impertinence on the part of honourable members opposite to ask members on this side to coalesce with them when .they have already shut tlie door against any negotiations of that character. I do not blame the Prime Minister alone for that. I believe that every one of the resolutions was carried by an overwhelming majority of the party, and the blame for any consequences resulting from them must be borne by the party as a whole. honourable members opposed them? honourable members who voted against the resolutions at their Caucus meeting. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) to-day quoted some criticisms of the Government by the leading newspapers of the Commonwealth. surprising to me that any newspaper, after publishing such drastic criticisms of the Government before it was re-formed, should now have the temerity to make the suggestion of a coalition with members on this side. T do not know what the developments may be now, or at any future date, but, so far as I can judge the temper of the people of this couhtry, nothing less than a general election will clarify the political atmosphere and bring about a condition of affairs which, will enable us to do effectively our share in the further prosecution of the war. general election, would, the policy enunciated by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) last night be the .platform of the Labour party? honourable member must know .that the Conferences in N e w South Wales and ( Victoria, have passed an identical set of resolutions, but those resolutions do not become the platform of the Pederal Labour party until the Inter-State Conference has met and endorsed them. in regard to the conscription issue when we were expelled. same general platform as that to ' which the honourable member was pledged when he last stood for election in the Labour interests. That was the platform drawn up at the Adelaide Conference, at which Mr Fisher and a number of others who have since left the Labour party, attended. next general Conference has been postponed until after the anticipated general election in March? or not, until a policy is endorsed by the Inter-State Conference, it cannot be incorporated in the Labour party's platform. not wait for the Inter-State body's deE v e n though some cision in regard to conscription before it kicked us out. that occurrence"", I took a certaiu course, involving some risk. As the honourable member knows, I took a line of action ih this House which other honourable members did not follow. I was prepared It is to take certain risks, and told the Labour Executive so. Unfortunately, what has since happened makes it absolutely i m possible for us to come together again. Everybody will admit that the splitting of a great party like the Labour party was a very important, event.

515,,"I give credit to those Mr Fenton : In connection with the anomalies that obtain under the voluntary system. But there are evils connected with the conscript system to which I can never assent. Let us go back to the genesis of the present trouble. In the early stages of the war, the honourable member for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts) ties. wasi the secretary of the recruiting committee in New South Wales, and at that time recruits were coming forward so freely that the commanding omcers in one or two of the camps had to request the committee to stay its hand, because they could not provide for the numbers that were offering. the time when an attempt was made to introduce the wedge of conscription. The result has been, in some cases, to set husbands against wives, and brothers against sisters. I blame those who are so anxious to fasten conscription upon the Commonwealth, for the disruption which obtains at the present time. There is one point which has been overlooked during this debate, just as it was overlooked during the recent campaign. I refer to the part which our Australian Navy has played in this war. Whilst1 am prepared to give the fullest credit to our boys in khaki, I cannot forget our boys in blue. splendid naval contribution to the war. She has contributed no less than fifteen fighting ships, manned for the most part by Australians, and she has paid the whole of the cost and maintenance of these vessels, which are playing their part-eithe r in the North Sea or elsewhere-in the great struggle that is being enacted to-day. Our naval arm comprises 5,000 men, for whom we have not been given any credit. Even the M i nister for the Navy is not prepared to give Australia credit for what she has done in a naval sense. In the matter of munitions, I know that we have not done as much as has Canada; but I would remind honourable members that in railway units and workers for Great Britain, we have mine proprietors of British Columbia or any contributed close upon another 5,000 other employers of labour in Britisli Colummen. From time to time, I have seen bia, letters fro m men who are doing splendid work in the munition factories of Great Mr Roche, Minister for the Interior, reBritain. In addition, we have sent away pliedover 300,000 men to take part in the field operations in France and elsewhere. BritishI n short, Australia's contribution to and I think in the eastern provinces, asking this war is a magnificent' one. [ n 6 l sidering our population, it is absolutely impossible for us to supply reinforcements to the extent of 7,000 a month, and the sooner we recognise that fact, the sooner shall we come to our senses. Australia is capable of certain things, but she cannot, and ought not to be asked, to perform impossibiliher population, .

It must not be forgotten, that transport is a most difficult matter in connection with this war. ports our troops from here. with all their equipment, and pay all the expenses of their transportation. Coming to our White Australia policy, I say that the working men and women of this country have to depend for their livelihood either Australia has made a upon their brains or their muscle. They have acquired certain rights and privileges of which they are naturally very jealous. To-day, in view of those whohold office in this Parliament, they are perfectly justified in suspecting that both our White Australia policy and the labour conditions which they now enjoy are in very grave peril. Why? The answer may be found in the Canadian Hansard. Not long ago a Chinese Immigration Bill was introduced into the Canadian Parliamenta measure which provided that Chinese students should be entitled to finish their education in Canada. When that Bill was under consideration, Mr. Macdonald askedHas the Minister received from the coal any request for permission to bring tn Oriental labour?

This is regarded as necessary, owing to the shortage of labour that is beginning to be felt. Thus we have, by Mr Macdonald in the Canadian Parliament, secondly the guarded reply of and lastly the cable which I have read.

They know no nationality. whether forms of their neighbours, they will have their cheap labour to secure more profits on their invested capital. I draw attention to what is happening in Canada because there is a danger of the same thing happening in Australia. who believe in the White Australia policy should pay some heed to an article that appeared in the Pastoralists' Review on the 16th February, 1916. It contains a map of Australia with the northern portion coloured black, and the letterpress reads as follows: We are very glad to see that responsible men, Government officials, and the principal newspapers realize, or are beginning to realize, the impossibility of the White Australia policy in to to . . . . A "" White Australia "" within limits lis very commendable and necessary, for we want no "" alien"" problems, but limits there must be, and the purpose of this article is to set forth those limits, as marked out in the Review two years ago. . . .

Children born in the country would be subfirst, the question ject to the same conditions as their parents, and would have to leave with tlie latter, or after a fixed number of years. Of course, we the Minister for the Interior, realize that the great problem will be to deal satisfactorily with the half-caste, but owing to limited space this questiou must be discussed in a future article. It is a problem that can be solved, must be solved, for even if the quesSome tion of climate did not make a White Australia impossible, the .war has put an end to it. After peace is declared the colour line will become more and more indefinable, and we shall be compelled to recognise the fact, for Great Britain will say to us, -Renounce your 'White Australia' policy, or suffer the consequences. Your blood will be upou your own head."" If ever there was an article that should have been censored this was one. I drew, the attention of Senator Pearce to it .

I agree with honourable members who say that it is absolutely essential to set about looking after the industries of this country. In the matter of repatriation more has been done in the direction of land settlement than in any other direction, but only about 15 per cent, of the soldiers will be anxious to go on the land. I am sorry to say this, because, although I represent a city constituency, I recognise that the aggregation of people in our cities is a great problem.

538,Mr Hector Lamond (Illawarra),"engaged in this war because we appreciate the necessity indicated Lloyd in similar addresses delivered predecessor in office. To talk of peace in tlie terms of the policy of the Official Labour party is to ask the Allies to forego the objects for which they entered into the war. It is useless for us to look for the solution of the present troubles without facing the facts of the situation. is evident that no one opposite has authority to enter into a coalition with members on this side, and that authority to do so cannot be obtained from those who now control the Official Labour In the speech of the honourable for Cook( Mr J. H. Catts) there was a pretence to consider the position as though the Opposition were free to act on the lines he indicated, but I venture to think that the claim of the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), he represents the great majority of politically organized Labour in this is more correct than that of the honourable member for Cook, or of the Leader of the Opposition, whole-heartedly the war. If , as a result of an appeal to the country, the Official Labour party were to obtain a majority in this House, it would not then be in a position to prosecute the war in the manner in which Mr again be raised during the life of this Eisher, when leader of the party, promised For the honourable member for Cook io try to deceive the country into the belief that the aims of the present Official Labour party are the same as those enunciated by Mr Fisher at the beginning of the war is to ask the people to forget all that has happened during the last two or three years. under the same control to-day that it was under at the beginning of the war. Since .the Avar commenced it has in the States and in the bigger trade union organizations, such as the Australian Union, outlined policies and diametrically ciated by Mr Fisher. WhilstI admit as readily as does any other honourable member that there are in the Official Labour party, both inside and outside of Parliament, men who are wholly loyal, and whose desire would be to assist the nation Mr Lamond. in the successful prosecution of the war, for achieving the aims I say that as the party is now constituted in the address of Mr or controlled, those men are utterly helpGeorge the other day, and less in the hands of more numerous secby his tions of it . Much as I should desire to see a Government representative of all parties in Parliament and in the country, and valuable as such a Government would be, I believe that such a° combination is not possible under the conditions which confront us. ItAnother alternative has been suggested which might be considered, although I have very little hope of any better result being attained in that direction. We have reached a stage when it seems to me that movement. this Government and this party should member definitely affirm"" that the question of compulsion for military service abroad is finally decided for the remainder of this Parliament. That, I think, is a necessary prelude to any scheme to increase the number of reinforcements for the men at that the Front. No matter what happens, it seems to me that it would be useless during this Parliament to raise that issue country, again. While there is a prospect that it may again be raised, whether by an appeal to the country or in any other that tlie party can enter way, we shall be unable to secure the into the prosecution of same united support for any proposals that may be decided upon to secure reinforcements that we might look for ' if we could dismiss the fear in the minds of many that the question may Parliament. that ib should be, conducted. As to the conduct of the referendum campaign, I do not think it necessary to say anything, but I do wish to say a word or two in reply to remarks which fell from the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). I heard w it h amazement and disgust the references which the honourable member felt it necesThe Labour party is not sary to make to the humble beginnings of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. In past days there were men of quite different political views who used to jeer and gibe at those who in the different State Workers Parliaments attempted to represent the principles workers of the country, and who had themopposed to those enunselves followed humble occupations. But that such a gibe should come from one who has been Treasurer in a Labour Government indicated so complete a reversal of the way in which members of the Labour party usually regard such matters as to leave me without any words to adequately express my amazement at the statements of the honourable member for Capricornia. There has been during this debate altogether too much of personal attack upon the Prime Minister. I am not one of those who share the hope expressed by several members that if we changed tlie leadership of the National party we should avoid the personal attacks that are now made. hibition of what might happen in other circumstances. Whilst the Minister for the Navy was making some remarks he was bombarded just as viciously as the Prime Minister had been. I venture to say that in the present temper of political had similar experience, would be able to parties in this country whoever leads the National party in this House must expect to be subjected to the same vituperation and abuse as the present Prime Minister has had concentrated upon him. It may be that the right honourable gentleman's energy and enthusiasm in the cause of the Empire at this time have intensified the hostility of his opponents, but it seems to me that these qualities should be regarded as virtues rather than as vices. I believe that there is no man in this country to-day who is making such sacrifices for the cause in which he believes as is the Prime Minister. In my opinion one of the greatest sacrifices he has made has been to retain office at the present time. It is easy for honourable members to speak of limpets clinging to office. It is very easy to impute to men in tlie pay of tlie country that they hold their positions only for their emoluments, but it is a fact known to every member of this House that the Prime Minister, in attempting to discharge the heavy responsibilities of his office at the present time, is risking his life as truly as the men at 1 the Front are risking theirs. It would have been an easy way out of the difficulty, due to the pledge which was forced upon 'him, if not by men at least by circumstances which men created before his Bendigo speech, for the right honourable gentleman to have retired for that rest which he is unlikely to obtain as long as he remains Prime Minister. position which confronted the National party was one in which men required to set aside personal considerations and do all that was necessary in order that the work of the country might proceed in the best possible way. The proposal that eleven members of the party on this side should be disqualified from accepting office during the continuance of the war was one of a very serious import indeed for the country. The proposal that at this time, when we need the services of the ablest and best men in the community, we should allow the eleven who have been chosen because of their superior ability to conduct the business of the country to retire from We had yesterday an exoffice and undertake the experiment of putting eleven untried men in their places never seemed to me a very practical proposal. It cannot be denied that a Ministry could easily be formed on this side of the House, of men who, if they conduct the business of the country as well, or nearly as well, as the present Cabinet; but this is no time for attempting such experiments. One of the things that has most impressed me in the proceedings of the last couple of weeks-the meetings of the National party, and the various negotiations arising from them-is that they form one of the most complete refutations of that school of politicians, or. would be politicians, who believe that politicians are always actuated by selfish considerations and regard only the improvement . of their own conditions. When the National party met, they were asked to say that eleven of the most prominent members of it should be disqualified from holding office. H a d that course been adopted, I think it quite reasonable to say that a chance would have been given to twenty-five or t h i r t y members of the party to obtain Ministerial rank. If the sordid motives so often attributed to men in politics were the moving motives of the men of this party, their vote would have been cast in the direction of creating those vacancies. However, the first division resulted in only two members of the party voting against the leadership of the present Prime Minister, and they were both men in my judgment-thei r names have been published-wh o were not actuated by a desire to attain oflice in But the that way, but who had always criticised the party leadership. And the subsequent votes afford a striking instance of, not one or two, but numbers of members setting the interests of the country above their own personal preferment and the realization of their .ambition. It is unfortunate that circumstances such as these should have been made the basis of some of the speeches we have listened to during the past few days, in which every evil motive has been attributed to the Prime Minister and his supporters. However, I am not so much concerned with what has happened as w it h what is to happen within the next few months. Some method of obtaining reinforcements for the Pront has to be devised. My personal view is t h a t the whole present fabric of recruiting must be pulled down, and something entirely different erected in its place. I do not think that the public meetings which are held in Melbourne and Sydney-and which are exceedingly expensive, while some of the speeches delivered tend to accentuate the feelings raised by recent political controversies-:-brin g to the recruiting sergeants any men who would not come without them. For the future two lines, it seems to me, must be adopted. We must rely more on personal canvass for the recruiting of eligibles than on public appeals which are directed mainly to ineligibles and ineffectives, and which do not reach the men who could enlist. past returned soldiers, under the direction of the Department, have been making a house-to-house canvass. so, under the direction of local committees. That has been the plan in the district in which I live, but it is only one of very few instances. more good than the public meetings. public meetings do not do any good. I have heard returned soldiers as eloquent as any men could be, without any results at all, and the money could be much better spent in increasing the number of those who make personal appeals. Further, a great deal could be done by getting omcers, who are going to the Front, to recruit their men before their departure. If military men, who are to be in charge of the work at the other end, could be sent out to seek men to go with them, instead of having civilians telling others to go, some good results might be achieved. While I think it is impossible to form a Coalition Government, it might be possible to erect some machinery for the control of recruiting, by means of which those of the Official Labour party, inside and outside Parliament, who . still wish to go on supporting the men at the Front, would be able to work w i th others in that direction. The suggestion that there should be a sort of round table conference, of few or many representatives of both sides, might be carried out. Rut before anything effective can be done, it must be emphasized that /the attempt to secure authority for compelling men to go to the Front is abandoned definitely by this Parliament. We shall have to give such assurance as will be accepted by the people on that head before we can hope to get much assistance, even from the loyal section of those who, in the last campaign, were associated with the "" No "" side. I hope that some of the suggestions that have been made in the course of the debate will be considered by the Cabinet. I have no doubt that there is a good deal of truth in the contention of some honourable members opposite that many votes in the campaign were influenced by, F o r many weeks I was going to say, the stingy treatment nf returned men, particularly those who have been seriously injured. The responsibility for the legislation under which In some places that is we are acting in that direction rests with the Labour party, and we who have left the party cannot escape that responsibility any more than can those who remain in it . It seems to me unfair that this treatment should be made the subject of a charge against the National Government, when the responsibility In my opinion, the should be shared by those who supported the Government by which the legislation was introduced. The refusal of the officials to allow any assistance to men who are injured otherwise than in the actual prosecution of the war is imposed upon them by the Act itself. They have no power to go beyond it . And so with regard to the miserably inadequate amounts allowed to men by way of pension. The maximum amount is fixed, and the gradation runs down from that level according to the injuries received. These are matters which Parliament should review at the earliest moment, with a view to something in the way of real pensions being provided for those-who have been severely wounded, and whose incapacity w ill continue throughout their lives.",114,Remarks

I am not one of those who believe that either the shipbuilding proposals or the repatriation scheme should be pushed ahead with that speed which makes perfect work impossible. Sufficient time should be taken so to prepare tbe schemes that, when they are launched, they may proceed -without interruption. . Too much haste in the inauguration of tbese matters leads to the kind of legislation of which I am complaining with, regard to pensions. Ministers should take sufficient time to make sure that their schemes are perfectly conceived, and that the preparations aro thorough, before the actual work is commenced. nearly so much faith as Senator Millen has in the measure of assistance that his repatriation scheme is going to receive from honorary services. I think the defect of the scheme, so f a r as it has yet shown itself, is that it centres too much around honorary workers. In my judgment, it would be far better to have a well-paid man of great capacity doing the work, rather than a large committee of honorary workers who, patriotic though they are, cannot continue year after year to give to the scheme the necessary oversight, without which it will absolutely fail. I bave said all I wish to say with regard to the motion itself. vote for it . It would have bean much better had it never been introduced. It does not tend in any way to assist in what should be the principal work of the Commonwealth at this time-the vigorous prosecution of the war. We have to realize that the objects for which the Empire entered upon the war are not achieved. There is still much to be done before the world will be saved to Democracy. I disagree entirely with those honourable members of the Opposition who contend that this ia a commercial war. If it is, then the attitude of those leaders of the Official Labour party who support this war is entirely wrong. recent campaign, one of the set questions put all over the country was, "" How old are you f "" If one said that one was over the military age, the further question 'was put, ""Havo you any Boer war medals about you V The difference between the Boer war and the present war [117] is almost the difference between light and darkness. Have honourable members opposite, wbo set these questions, for. gotten that the official attitude of the Labour movement towards the Boer war was one of openly-declared and recorded hostility ? The difference between this war and the Boer war is wide indeed This war is different from any that has occurred in our life-time. It was inevitable if those institutions that we value were to be saved to the world. I see in this war an effort to maintain the democratic privileges which the world enjoys. I see in it a conflict that is inevitable if the privileges of Democracy are to be extended, to any country that does not enjoy them to-day. I see in this war a conflict as I have not between right and wrong-betwee n Democracy and tyranny. I ' see in it a fight for the freedom of the world, and for the right of the peoples of the world to enjoy that liberty which the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) referred to last night as"" being enjoyed here and not in some of the other nations. That we should ask at this time to have guarantees as to the maintenance of the privileges we enjoy in a country that is controlled by the men and women in it , is, it seems to me, quite a fatuous proposal. The men and women of Australia 'control Australia fo-day. Whether we shall be able to control it next year, or the year after, depends entirely upon the result of the war now I shall not being waged in Europe. All the moving facts that the honourable member for Bourke gave in his eloquent address last night are to me but inspirations to renewed effort-to see that.the Empire shall not fail in the conflict in which she is engaged. It is true that the Mother Country has too long forgotten the needs of those who do her work../ It is true that she has allowed large sections of her people to fall below the line of decent Uving. Ib is tjrue that she has paid dearly in this conflict for the neglect of the social conditions of her people in the years that have preceded it . But we may hope that she has learned in this conDuring the flict a lesson that will give to the people of Great Britain an opportunity of obtaining some of the privileges that we in this country so richly enjoy. She is called upon to make tremendous sacrifices in defence of the liberties, of the world, while we ihere have done, comparatively, so l it t l e ; but when the war is'over her people will gain in a greater measure than we shall from what they have endured. I believe that the war will be followed in Great Britain by a tremendous improvement in the conditions of the masses of the people. I believe that the w a r ' w ill be followed in . every country by an extension of the privileges of the people. I believe we shall win. If we do not, then tbe reverse will be true. In every country Democracy w ill suffer and w ill have' to commence again the long fight she has had in .order to achieve the position in which she stands today. I believe as thoroughly as I believe in anything, that we in Australia', enjoying the privileges of Democracy to a greater extent than any other part of the world, have for that very reason a greater need to do our utmost to see that the cause of the Allied nations shall prevail, and that freedom and liberty shall not be banished from the world. -:May I ask for the adjournment of the debate? members should go on, otherwise we will 'not be able .to finish the debate within the time agreed upon, curtail my remarks if the debate is ad-, journed, and, so far as I am concerned, there W l be nothing to interfere with the arrangement, because I will not make a lengthy speech.
