Department Of Meteorology Has Yet Taken Steps To Procure The Publication Of Rainfall Reports At The Post Offices In Leading Country Centres, And, I F Not, Whether The Minister Of Home Affairs Intends To Provide For That Being Done? Commonwealth Taking Over The Meteorolo","gical services, a system prevailed in New South Wales of exhibiting a limited amount of weather information at certain country post offices, and this has been continued. An extension of the system to other places in the Commonwealth has been considered and is kept in view, but it is not at present possible, as the Postal Department represent that the telegraph lines would be unable to carry the additional messages without interfering with the ordinary business for which they receive revenue. ister aware that only a limited number of offices in New South Wales have been supplied with weather information, and that a large number of offices require it? Will he, by increasing the efficiency of the telefence, upon noticegraph service, or in some other way, see that this information is supplied to all places requiring it? able member should put that question to the Postmaster-General. I am willing to provide for the supplying of the information if my honourable colleague will arrange for its transmission. of the Postmaster-General to the fact that this is the first day of September, and ask him whether, in view of the numerous petitions which have been presented to Parliament, he is determined to pursue his relentless policy regarding the application of the toll system to all telephone subscribers ? force to-day. ternal Affairs, upon noticei.

W ill the Minister lay on the table of the House a copy of each Ordinance concerning the rates of pay, rations, hours of labour, also methods of recruiting the natives of Papua? the honourable member's questions are1, 2, 3. The Native Labour Ordinance of 1906 was enacted by the Administrator, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council of Papua. It was approved by the Governor General in Council on the Sth March, 1907. A copy was laid before Parliament and printed, see Parliamentary Papers, 1907-8, volume 2, page 1645. That measure provides the conditions of recruiting, see sections 12-27. It does not provide a rate of wages to be paid, but attention is invited to sections 47-51, which deals with wages. The Ordinance gives power to make regulations. These have been made by the Executive Council, and were approved by the Minister on the 14th September, 1909. They provide for rations and hours of labour. I have caused a copy of the regulations to be sent to the honourable member. ister representing the Minister of DeWhether, in view of the great delay which would be caused in the transportation of troops, and their equipment, to different parts of the Commonwealth, owing to the . want of uniform gauge in railway lines, will the Minister for Defence consider the advisability of offering a substantial prize for such invention as will overcome the break of gauge? fence has supplied the following answerThe question of break of gauge appears to be one for the State Governments to deal with, but with a view of making some workable scheme by which efficient arrangements can be made for all the details of military transport in time of war, it is proposed to invite the Premiers of the several States to approve of a conference Between their Railways Commissioners and representatives of the Defence Department.

In view of the evidence of Mr Sparling's record as disclosed in the papers, I do not feel justified in re-opening the case. Indeed, I am doubtful if I have the legal power to do on A behalf so. Debate resumed from 18th August (vide contends that this system of inspection is detriThat, in the opinion of this House, the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing from State to State. sympathize with the honourable member for Wilmot in his desire to remove unnecessary restrictions from Inter-State trade, because I am sure that he would, at the same time, do all that can be done to protect each State from the introduction of fruit and vegetable diseases and pests. argument in favour of Federation was that it would open to the producers and manufacturers of the States the markets of the whole continent; but I am afraid that the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution, has often been violated, though we are apt to consider that State inspecting authorities are actuated by parochial motives when they are not. I do not impute such motives to those who are charged with the inspection of prociuce passing from State to State, but I think that whole States have been quarantined by other States when it would have been sufficient to quarantine merely infected areas. The Inter-State trade of Australia has now assumed very large proportions, ancl will continue to grow. Our climate has such a wide range-fro m the temperate to the tropical-that a large interchange of produce is inevitable. The present system of inspection is expensive, and increases the prices paid by the consumers without benefiting the producers. Although fruit can be grown in Australia all the year round, and is almost a necessary food, it costs so much in Melbourne and in the other large cities that it is practically beyond the reach of persons in ordinary circumstances. When a case of apples is brought here from Tasmania, 6d. is charged for inspecting the fruit3d. at each end. the Victorian end is i d . per case. manian end is iod. a ton. tion fees are charged at both ends. Let me read the press report of a meeting recently held at Doncaster, Victoria, complaining of the cost of inspectionprotest has been made by Mr E. Lawford, of the Doncaster Fruit-growers' Society, against the practice of the various States in compelling the growers to pay fees sufficient to defray the cost of the inspection of their fruit at the place of importation. The society mental to the fruit trade generally, and harassing to the grower individually, and claims that it should be discontinued. It points out that it costs a grower £ 3 ios. per acre of full-bearing trees to combat the various fruit pests to which Victorian orchards are liable, but that the present inspection fees amount to about £ 1 5s. per acre. Those who have any knowledge of fruit growing are aware that that is an enormous charge. The honourable member for Wilmot deserves the thanks of the people of Australia for bringing this matter forward, A great because good must come from its ventilation in Parliament. But the problem is a difficult one, and the Commonwealth is not, at present, in a position to deal with it. Before the Commonwealth can take over the inspection of produce passing from State to State, it must create a huge inspecting department. quarantine officials? enlarge the Quarantine Department, ancl thus provide for the inspection of fruit and vegetables passing from State to State without imposing any additional burden on the taxpayer. As a matter of fact, it is the producers, and not the general public, who now pay the whole cost of inspection. the imposition of duties on their produce. cases, to the imposition of very high duties, and as I said before, the spirit of the Constitution is violated by one State prohibiting the introduction of the produce of another State. tion be carried out expeditiously by a State, instead of having the power to quarantine a portion of it?",14,Dismissal Of Mr Sparling

23,Mr Sampson,"Can a system of inspecleft to the States there is always a suspicion that they are acting from a parochial point of view, that is, that one State is trying to protect itself against the fair and just competition of other States. I do not know if I followed the honourable member's question correctly, but I think that when Federation took place one of the rights which the States gave up was the right to tax the produce from other States. We find that taxation is being levied in many ways, not only by regulation under the health authorities, but also in the form of harbour dues. I think that an inquiry might well be instituted, with a view to action being taken in the very near future. The need for such action is growing more urgent every day. We have heard of the Irish blight in potatoes and of a number of pests in fruit ancl other crops. There is also that terrible scourge which is going to make itself felt throughout Australia. I refer to the tick pest which, I understand, started some years ago in the Northern Territory. It has gradually worked its way southward. The New South Wales ""Government are trying to stop its progress at their northern border, but they might as well try to stop a tide with a pitchfork as attempt to prevent the spread of that pest. It is now making itself felt in parts of Queensland, and later it will spread throughout Australia. The Commonwealth Government could do very much to check its progress. In my opinion they would be warranted in making a thorough investigation into the spread of the tick, because it carries with it a dis-' ease which must in time decimate many of our herds. nothing which would help that pest to spread. I am not proposing to remove any safeguards. to the motion. The argument which I am now using is that a Commonwealth Department could deal with all these questions more effectively than the States can do. In Queensland the tick pest has gradually worked its way southward. We have proclaimed buffer areas and clean areas, and gradually the latter have had to be converted into the former. New South Wales has, I understand, proclaimed a buffer area on its northern border, and it will only be a matter of a few years when that area will become infected. Northern stock may be prevented from crossing the border, but it is impossible to stop wallabies, kan[87] garoos, snakes, and birds from carrying the pest southward. The producers are suffering under border restrictions. It is an utter impossibility to get our stock across the border of New South Wales. During a drought in parts of Queensland we have stock which are quite fit to kill for beef. Even now our cattle are selling in Queensland at from 16s. to 20s. a hundredweight to the freezing establishments, and, as honourable members know, the cost of meat to the consumer is 4d. or sd., or perhaps 6d., a pound. The restriction upon the movements of our cattle has something to do with that position. I do not for a moment advocate the indiscriminate admittance of cattle into New South Wales and Victoriai f they would spread disease amongst the cattle of those States. Those who understand the tick question know that the tick itself is not a pest, but a conveyor of disease to cattle. Until there is an outbreak of Texas fever in any particular area, the tickis no more harmful than the ordinary bush tick would be. But when Texas fever makes its appearance in a locality, if it is only in one beast, the disease is spread very rapidly by the ticks. These are questions which might be investigated by a department which I trust will be created before long by the Commonwealth. Under the Commerce Act, the Commonwealth Government have taken some control with regard to exports. They made a start before they were ready; they have had to ask the States to administer the Act for the Trade ancl Customs Department, and the result is that we now have six methods of inspection. In some States fees are charged. In Queensland we pay for the inspection of our produce. the Minister to hear that we pay for our inspection. any fee to the Commonwealth. The State may charge a fee. stand, no charge is made for an inspection under the Commerce Act. Three or four years ago, .£150 per annum was paid in inspection fees under my management. In New South Wales and Victoria inspection is free. In most industries where a large number of hands are employed, and large interests are at stake, those who are engaged therein are consulted, so that some idea of their.requirements may be gathered.",15,Inspection Of Produce

30,Mr Sinclair,"In Victoria, I underBut we find that primary producers are not consulted. When the honourable member for Hume was Minister of Trade and Customs, he convened a Conference of producers, to discuss the proposed regulations under the Commerce Act which were then about to be put in force. I am afraid that they treated the honourable gentleman with rather scant courtesy. I plead guilty to being a member of the Conference, but the Minister himself treated its members with much less courtesy than was extended to him, as he simply told us what to do, and retired, leaving us to grapple with the question on which we were supposed to be conferring with him. The Conference came to the conclusion that they were assembled to decide whether they should be fried or griddled. Practically nothing came of the Conference, so far as the producers were concerned. Regulations were drawn up under the direction of various State officials, right way in compiling it. who remained behind to confer. It is time that the producers were consulted. The importance of the industry may be gathered from the fact that in Australia we have 10,000,000 acres of land under cultivation; pastoral country carrying 10,000,000 head of cattle, and dairying country carrying 2,000,000 head of cattle. We produce annually 448,000,000 gallons of milk, 146,000,000 pounds of butter, 15,000,000 pounds of cheese, and 4,000,000 pounds of condensed milk. and agricultural production represents ^85,000,000 per annum. It will be seen that it is not a small industry, but one whicli deserves great consideration at our hands. The Inter-State and export proportion of the trade is a large one, which also deserves very serious consideration. So far, the producers have not been consulted as to the best method of dealing with the question of inspection. I may be asked ''Why should it not be investigated by the Trade and Customs Department ? '' I wish to refer particularly to what that Department has done. One feels a certain amount of delicacy in criticising the work of an official, and the fact that a critic does not deal with his work seriatim, and point out the portions which he agrees with, should not lead any listener to infer that the whole of his work is condemned. . Mr Lockyer was asked by Sir Robert Best when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, to report on the butter export trade. Mr Sinclair. quire into the working of the Commerce Act, and not necessarily in regard to any particular item. He dealt with butter and meat, and is getting a report ready on fruit. deputation of producers made certain representations to the Minister with regard to the butter industry, and he very kindly promised to defer action until the matter was investigated. I do not know the nature of Mr Lockyer's instructions, but I know that he furnished a report on the butter export trade, and also a report on the meat export trade. The former report reached me first, although the two reports were ordered on the same date to be printed. I glanced through the report on the meat export trade, and it appeared to me that Mr Lockyer went to work in the He went to those who were directly interested in the industry, and got his information at first hand, and consequently his report is an excellent one. There are many things in his report on the butter export trade which commend themselves to me. But I wish to refer to a few matters which indicate that he was asked to do something which he was hardly capable of doing. One naturally expects the Minister or the offi-: cial head of a Department to be guided by the reports of his officers. It would be a pity if , in a general sense, it were"" Combined pastoral otherwise, but while that is so, I think it is the duty of every Minister to see that he surrounds himself with officers who are capable of advising him. That statement, I trust, will not be construed into a reflection upon Mr Lockyer's capabilities. I have no desire to make any reflection upon him, but I do think that, either he should' not have been asked to furnish this report, or that since he was, he should have gone a little further and have obtained his information from a first-hand source. very conscientious officer. say at once that some portions of his report are excellent. I wish, however, to refer to one or two of its misleading features in relation to the question of gradyer saysCompulsory grading is in favour of all that is best in the industry.

Butter-making is one of the industries in which excellence brings its own reward in the shape of increased values. grading system are described in the report asThose whose interests are purely personal and tralia. foreign to the true interests of the industry at As the report points out, that is a developlarge. The literal meaning of those words is that the whole or a very large percentage of those engaged in the production of butter on co-operative lines have interests foreign to the true interests of this great industry. I wish now to refer to a paragraph in this report in which Mr Lockyer comments on a Conference which was held in SydneyAlthough fifty-six factories were represented their own pockets. at this Conference, only seventeen rep""resentatives were present when the resolution was carried. [87J-2 The reference is to a resolution carried at the conference, condemning compulsory grade marking. At no time during the sittings of that conference were there more than twenty-six representatives present, so that only nine were absent when the resolution was carried. It is quite possible that the seventeen delegates present at the time represented a very large proportion of the fifty-six butter factories concerned. The unfortunate phase of this comment lies in the fact that it comes from an anonymous writer. His identity is well known to some of us, but it is a pity that Mr Lockyer should have accepted the statement of an anonymous writer, and have The object of the Danish authoriembodied it in his report. statements correct? but they are misleading. They are half truths. Mr Lockyer goes on to sayIt may be added that Weddell and Co. are probably the greatest authorities on the colonial produce trade. It means taking the management As one who has been in the trade, I disagree with that statement, and do not hesitate to say that Messrs. Weddell and Company were never recognised by the Australian butter producers as authorities on butter. They are well up in the beef trade. I should take their word in respect to the beef trade, perhaps, in preference to that of any other firm, but not in regard to the butter industry.

44,Mr Sinclair,"They may be correct,that term is stipng enough to describe the practice. The desire of this Parliament at all times has been to break up monopolies, no matter how short their duration may have been. But speculators, for the last twenty-five years, have been trying to monopolize the Australian butter trade. TGey have been making such efforts, ever since we have been able to send butter to London in refrigerating chambers, and we have been able to fight them successfully, simply by a combination of dairy farmers to protect their own interest, and to place their own butter upon its merits on the London market. As I have already remarked, the Minister has a right to be guided by official reports, and he has been good enough to send me a copy of a report received from the officer administering the Commerce Act in Queensland upon some remarks which I made as a member of a recent deputation that waited upon him. That reply has reference to the cypher system. system to grade marking, but, after all, it appears to be a "" smothering up "" practice, and one that does not express exactly what it should. It is pointed out by Mr Lockyer, and Mr Scrivener, in writing to the Minister, confirms this statement, that under the cypher system the proportion of first-grade butter in Queensland decreased from 47 per cent, in 1909, to 26 per cent, for tbe year ending 30th June, 1910. The percentage offirst-gradebutter for the year ended 30th June last, according to the reports, was 26 per cent., whereas the returns from the London market show that the butter sold there on its merits as first grade amounted to 75 per cent. Thus the man who puts his money into this business in London is prepared to take 75 per cent, of our produce as first grade. It is not true that we work nff our inferior grades of butter upon the local consumers. I find that that is impossible, except in regard to sales of inferior butter for pastry purposes. Australian consumer knows what good butter is, and, consequently, the best butter is consumed in the Commonwealth. Buyers at the other end, however, grade 75 per cent, of our butter as first class. By way of illustration, I would point out that a firm in Queensland-the only firm competing with the Australian Sugar Refinmg Company-wa s asked to quote for 1,000 tons of sugar, for, I think New Zealand, One of the conditions was that the sugar should be put up under a special brand. The Commerce Act provides that the name of the factory and the word "" Australia "" shall be printed on every packet. The result was that this very large order went to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which probably supplied sugar produced outside Australia. I am not sure that I would suggest an alteration of. the existing system, but I do think that the whole matter should be investigated. No other countiy in the world, except New Zealand, has attempted the grading of produce for export. cessful in New Zealand. honourable member object to grading? grading, but to grade-marking. honourable member object to grade-marking ? It ought to be in the interest of the butter I certainly prefer the cypher companies that that information should be given. industry is concerned, it is practically impossible to grade according to an absolute standard. A grade can be determined upon only in accordance with one man's taste and judgment. The man who buys is sometimes prepared to pay a higher price for butter graded as second-class than for that with a first grading. But the fact that a second grading mark has been put on boxes or packets gives the buyer at the other end a lever to bring down the price of a commodity for which otherwise he would have been prepared to pay a reasonable price. I may give an instance from the experience of two factories working side by side in my own electorate. One factory believed in grademarking, and had the whole of its butter grade-marked during the past twelve months. The other factory objected to grade-marking. The returns from London The showed that the factory that insisted on grade-marking received from is. to 6s. per cwt. less for its butter during the twelve months than the one that, adopted cypher marking. I should say that the two butters were equal in quality. At all events, both came from the same part of the country, and their produce should have been equal. But the placing of grade marks on the boxes led to a loss of .£600 for the twelve -months, simply because the buyer had those marks to work upon.",18,Inspection Of Produce

I move That all the words after the word "" House"" be left out with a.view to insert in lieu thereof hitherto been strong State Righters, to the words (i) "" A Select Committee with a reprefavour the practical wiping out of State sentative from each State should be appointed to inquire into the best means of inspection and effective control of produce passing from State to State; (2) That such Committee should also inquire as to the most suitable means of inspecting, grading, and marking of produce intended for export."" and Customs) [11.30] I am sorry to have tcftappose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton. I promised the honourable member for Wilmot that, as soon as his motion had been disposed of, it was my intention to communicate with the various Ministers of Agriculture in the States, and endeavour to obtain uniformity in inspection charges, or, if that were not possible, more harmonious relations than apparently exists at present. Only yesterday Captain Evans, ex-Premier of Tasmania, brought under my notice a case, the facts of which are reported in the newspapers of to-day. It appears that on a shipment of apples to another State, the inspection charges amounted to over ,£100, although the work was completed in an afternoon, and should not have cost more than £ 1 0 . If that be so, I consider, speaking, of course, as a layman, that there has been an undoubted violation of section 12 of the Constitution, which is as follows:After uniform duties of Customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied should be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Complaints are made that certain of the States levy such charges for the inspection of imports as to practically pay the whole cost of inspection, not only of imports, but of exports; in other words, the whole cost of the Departments. of his own knowledge? matter was brought under my notice as late as yesterday by Captain Evans. When speaking on the original motion I urged that the action of the States was doing more than anything else to force the Commonwealth into a system of unification, so far as this phase of Inter-State trade is concerned. The charges at present levied practically amount to barriers against other States; and this will undoubtedly tend to make many honourable members, who have administration in this connection.

When the Commerce Act was passed, it was decided that, instead of creating a new Department, the services of State officers should be utilized, there not being work enough to keep them employed all' the year round. In Tasmania, for example, the apple season lasts eight or ten weeks at the outside, and the butter season, in fhe other States for six or eight months only; and hence it was decided by the honourable member for Hume, I think, when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, that State officers should be employed.

Honourable members will see in the Estimates that the charges in the various States are disproportionate to the services rendered. Some States charge infinitely more than others, and this made it absolutely necessary to appoint one officer to exercise a general supervision.

It may be interesting to honourable members engaged in tihe butter industry to know that, so far as the percentage of butter fat is concerned, it will remain at 82, and that, while I should be very reluctant to increase the percentage of moisture beyond 14 for superfine, I have no intention to reduce it in other cases to less than 15 per cent. It will, however, take a little time for regulations to be forWe should, mulated dealing with the whole matter.

The honourable member for Moreton asks for the appointment of a Select Committee to consider the question of grading and marking butter for export Inter-State and oversea. Although the Minister has already indicated that he If it were decided to is not disposed to accept the amendment, I believe that thorough investigation of the whole matter by a Select Committee would be beneficial to the great producing industries of Australia. I admit that the Minister has given the matter a great deal of his time ancl consideration, and has listend to many deputations with exemplary patience. But I do not think he has yet fully grasped the technicalities of the butter trade alone, which is only one branch of our great export business.

139,Mr Tudor,"Except the worse quality.butter to be exported, except as pastry butter. We do not wish stinking butter to go Home without a distinct brand upon it. I wish to show the Minister how grade marking !n New Zealand has worked out as against our not marking. He states, quite correctly, that New Zealand producers are getting in the markets of the world a higher price for their produce than the producers in Australia. On the other hand, taking the principal co-operative factories in New South Wales and Victoria, and comparing the prices which the farmers are receiving from them with the prices which the New Zealand producers are getting, the producers in Australia are getting, on the average, more than the producers in New Zealand. The reason is this : We in Australia have been putting the whole force of co-operative effort against the spot selling of our produce. We have been endeavouring in every possible way to dispense with the speculator-the middleman. We have succeeded to this extent, that speculators can come, as they have come to me, as chairman of directors of a butter factory, and offered me 4s. a cwt. premium on Sydney prices, and we have been able to refuse that offer, consign our butter on our own account to our selling agent in London, and beat the spot buyer's offer, made in Australia. That is one of the principal reasons why we are opposed to the grade marking of butter in Australia, and Mr Lockyer has pointed out, in his report, that one of the great gains that grade marking will produce is that our butter will be sold on the spot. That is the result which grade marking has had in New Zealand, because there the great bulk of the butter is bought on the spot, and it is the very thing which we have succeeded in breaking down here by the whole force of co-operative effort. Now the Department come along and try to force upon us the very thing against which we have been fighting tooth and nail for the last ten years. The result in New Zealand is that the man on the land is not getting as much for his butter as we are getting, although the New Zealand butters are commanding a higher price in the markets of the world; and I believe will always do so on account of the different conditions of climate, and other factors in the two countries. As we get still closer settlement, and the factories are brought nearer together, we shall be able gradually to improve the quality of our produce; but under existing conditions we cannot produce as good an article right through Australia as they can in New Zealand. We are working under disadvantages of climate, pasture, and so on, which will never enable us to produce quite as good an article, on the average, as they do in New Zealand. We may find in Australia here and there a district that can and is doing it, but, taking Australia as a whole, it will be found that the price must always be a little lower. I do not. think that any system of grade marking will ever bring our prices up to the New Zealand level, but it will lead to spot selling, which is detrimental to the best interests of the producer, and which we, as producers, do not want. member argue that the New Zealand producers would get more if they did not sell on the spot? producers, because we do not sell on the spot. We consign direct to London on the factory's account, and sell the butter there purely on its merits. We are thus able to pay our producers a better price than the New Zealand people get under their grade marking system, and with their spot selling. ducers would get still more if they did not have spot selling? would get more in London for their butter, but the producer would receive more. The figures prove conclusively that we areable, even with our lower price in London, to pay our producers more than the New Zealand co-operative factories pay theirs. orable member explain how grade marking by the Government would interferewith, that ? point. The Minister asked why, if we grade down pastry butter, we should not put the grade mark on every box sent Home. He says, "" Why not grade it superfine, first class, second class, and so on?"" That is where the whole casebreaks down from the departmental point of view. Any one who has had experience of butter knows that it is a product which varies greatly under different conditions. Under certain conditions of temperature,, and so on, you get the most extraordinary changes in it. I do not know why it is so, but it is. There are all sorts of",24,Inspection Of Produce

We get that in ment moved by the honourable member for Moreton? show why it is necessary that a Select Comon keeping. If the butter were graded two mittee should be appointed to consider the question of grading. The matter is most important to the producing interests, and as the Minister has raised these issues, I am endeavouring to show why he should, from the producers' stand-point, appoint a Select Committee, or take any other action necessary to have the question thoroughly investigated. If you grade butter, calling 95 points superfine, 90 points first class, and 85 points second class, with anything below that third class, you establish certain standards. But, after all, it is to a great extent simply a question of taste. If you say you will give so many points for colour, moisture, texture, flavour, and so on, one man may consider that certain butter should be graded as 95 points, and another may give it only 90 points. have seen the greatest variations in the opinions of judges on questions of that sort. When it comes to a question of only two or three points between first, second, or third grades, the Minister will readily understand that it is a very serious matter to grade a butter down by even one point, in such a way as will reduce its price when it gets to London. When the deputation waited on the Minister recently, one of the factories was able to produce the reports as to the butter graded in Australia, and the butter graded in London, in the case of two different lots of butter that were sent Home. case the Australian officer graded the butter down to second class, and gave his reasons, but when it reached Home the London grader classed it as first class, and of New South Wales which does not grade -gave his reasons. Possibly, on the journey that article had changed to a great extent. 'Often with lucerne-fed butters you get a -volatile flavour, which may be very unpleasant for three or four days after the 'butter is actually manufactured, but which will disappear altogether during three weeks in the freezing room. These volatile tastes are well known to those connected with the industry. I do hot know why they should disappear under keeping may recognise the distinct flavour in lucerne-fed butter, but when it is kept for three or four weeks under proper conditions, that taste will have gone. The same thing often happens with rank food durour part of the world, particularly -in January and February, and it gives the butter a volatile flavour, which disappears days after it was manufactured, it would be put down as second class, on account of its distinct flavour, but it would probably come out first class in London. That is one of the reasons why we say that it is practically impossible to put on the butter in Australia a grade which will work out correctly at the other end, especially seeing that butter grading depends only on a few points of difference. Nevertheless, the placing of that grade mark on the butter in Australia will ""materially affect the London price. The buyer may recognise that it is a first-class article, but whilst he will always buy it on its merits, he will not pay for it on its merits if it bears the second grade mark. The Minister asks why, if we grade cream we I should not grade butter also. There are certain definite and well recognised characteristics of cream which enable a factory manager to say at once whether it is or is not fit for the making of good butter. There can be no question where over-ripe or dirty cream is second class, but it is a different thing to determine whether butter is first or second grade. The latter is simply a question of taste, whereas the former is a matter of actual fact. That is the great difference. One can, as a rule, instantly recognise whether cream is over-ripe or dirty, and one can therefore immediately grade"" In one it. But in the case of butter the position is entirely different. That is why we should grade our cream. There is no co-operative butter factory in the north the cream supplied to it thoroughly and effectively, and there is not a single supplier to a factory there who does not get his proportion of second-class cream at certain seasons of the year. Anybody who is familiar with this subject knows that climatic influences wili frequently cause cream to ripen upon one day several hours in advance of the period that is required to ripen it upon another day, and consequently it cannot be got to the",25,Inspection Of Produce

We are endeavouring in every possible way to improve our Australian butter so that it will command the best price upon the London market. learn that the Minister of Trade and Customs has decided that the proportion of butter fat should not be raised beyond 82 per cent. The standard mentioned by Mr pleased to know he has decided that the Lockyer cannot be attained. The quantity of moisture allowed in butter should not exceed 16 per cent. contain above 14 per cent, of moisture. never contain more than that quantity of moisture. Butter which does contain more than 14 per cent, of moisture will not be superfine. Buti f we fix a standard of 14 per cent, in the case of superfine butter we must also allow producers a sufficient margin to work upon, so that they will not have to make their butter too dry in order to insure that every pound of it which goes Home shall not contain more than that percentage of moisture. I think myself that 16 per cent, of moisture in butter would be a fair thing to allow, because it would give the producer a sufficient margin upon which to come and go, and as that is the standard fixed under the Board of Trade regulations at Home, we should be perfectly safe in adopting it. per cent of moisture in butter will be allowed. should give the producers the extra one per cent, as a margin upon which they may come and go. Anybody who is possessed of practical experience must recognise how difficult it is to make every pound of butter conform to a fixed standard. Of course every careful manager of a factory repeatedly tests his butter to ascertain the quantity of moisture in it. But it would be exceedingly difficult to insure that every pound of butter produced did not contain more than 14 per cent, of moisture. run sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs cannot see his way to sanction an inquiry into this question by means of a Select Committee, but I have not the least doubt that he will give the point which I have mentioned his fullest consideration. that the whole of the co-operative moveOf course, if ment throughout Australia is opposed to this grade marking of all our butter. Let us ship our butter to England, and let it be sold there upon its merits. AlthoughI think that if a Select Committee were appointed to inquire into this I am very glad to matter it would collect very valuable information which ought to be considered by the Minister before he fixes a standard in regard to our export products, I am Commonwealth shall undertake the work of inspecting products passing between the States in addition to thoroughly regulating our export trade. I believe that our export trade can be satisfactorily controlled only by a central authority, and I have long thought that the Commonwealth Parliament has been backward in tackling this question. ber think that we should take control of the whole export trade of Australia? grading which may be introduced under one central authority must be taken into very serious consideration, and I have no doubt that the Minister will give it that amount of attention which its importance deserves. Many experts have shown that there are two sides to the question of grading butter, or marking it, and of determining the quantity of moisture that it should contain. I believe that a Select Committee would be able to collect very useful information on this matter, notwithstanding the very able, valuable, and exhaustive report of Mr Lockyer. I am quite in accord with the determination of the Minister to make the general system of control a Commonwealth affair. I know that there is a difference of opinion in regard to the constitutionality of the present system of inspection in the case of products passing from one State to another. I agree with the honourable member for Wilmot that the practice of levying certain charges for the inspection of such products is a violation of the true principle of Inter-State Free Trade, which is one of the bed-rock 1 principles of our Constitution. I know that this matter was very ably debated by the honourable member for Bendigo when the Quarantine Bill was under consideration. Upon that occasion he raised the question of how far our constitutional powers extend in regard to the inspection I would again remind him of goods passing from one State to another. Personally, I believe that as far as",26,Inspection Of Produce

As the representative of a country constituency, I am -pleased that this matter is to be taken in hand by the Minister, and I hope that he will, as speedily as possible, not only assume control of goods passing from State to State, but appoint ofiicers to insure the control of our export trade generally in a way that will be satisfactory to this Parliament. adjourned. Order of the day read and discharged. ment-whic h it is proposed shall contrijourned. [12.29] I move That this House is of opinion that a pension system should be forthwith initiated in the defence and civil services of the Commonwealth. I do not propose to occupy the time of the House for more than a few minutes, because I recognise that it is desirable to dispose of private members' business as quickly as possible, in view of the wish of the House generally, and pf the Ministry in particular, to terminate the session at an early date. I shall, therefore, not extend myself in moving this motion, and I shall ne-essarily have to omit a great deal of matter which, under other circumstances, I should have deemed it advisable to lay before honourable members. We all recognise that the principle underlying the granting of old-age pensions is one which has been accepted without question by honourable members on both sides of the House. Whilst we are careful to provide pensions for those employed in private occupations, we have not provided pensions for public servants, although the great majority of the latter labour under the disability of having to pass years of their term of employment in receipt of small salaries, it being only in the latter period of their service that their salaries become large enough to enable them to put aside any reasonable savings against a rainy day. Furthermore, the Public Service Act requires the retirement of public servants at the age of sixty years. A praiseworthy, attempt has been made by the Public Service Association to devise a scheme of retiring allowances, which I propose in a condensed form to put before the House. It is proposed that a fund shall be established to provide for the payment of retiring allowances and pensions, and that contributions shall be levied upon the salaries of all permanent officers, the fund to be actuarily investigated every five years, and should such an investigation show the need for a re-adjustment of the rates of contribution and retiring allowance, the re-adjustment is to be shared proportionately by the Governbute 3 per cent, upon the salaries of contributing officers-and the contributing officers. Officers receiving over £600 per anportion of their salary which exceeds ^600. The contributions to the fund are to be payries in accordance with the following Exceeding Exceeding Up to and £110 and £300 and Age at First Contribution. Including not not £110. exceeding exceeding £300 £600. Under 30 3 % 4 % 5 % 30 and not exceeding 35 4 % 5 % 6 % Exceeding 35 and not exceeding 40 5 % 6 % 7 % Exceeding 40 and not exceeding 45 6 % 7 % 8 % Exceeding 45 and not exceeding 50 7 % 8 % 9 % Exceeding 50 and not exceeding 55 8 % 0 % 10 % The scheme is not to apply to officers now possessing pension rights, nor to those contributing to any existing State or Public Service superannuation fund. The retiring allowances to be paid to contributing officers are these : To officers receiving ^110 or less, a minimum of £ 6 0 per annum; to officers receiving ,£200, £100 per annum; to officers receiving £300, ^ 4 0 per annum ; to officers receiving ^400, £180 per",27,Inspection Of Produce

The retiring allowances are to be computed on the average salary received during the last three years of an officer's service, and officers receiving salaries between the sums mentioned are to be paid proportionate retiring allowances.

The whole matter, of course, is one for the consideration of Ministers, and, without debating the proposal further, I submit the motion to the House. I second the motion, but should be glad, before making a speech, to hear the views of the Minister regarding it. stand from his attitude that he wishes to have an opportunity to consider his remarks, but I hope that when he speaks, it will be to express, in fitting language, the pleasure felt by Ministers in supporting the proposal. hearing the remarks of the honourable member in support of it. would be necessary to speak in support of it. deliberately rejected a proposal to establish a Public Service pension fund. members of that Parliament are not here now. they intend to do in this matter? the Government proposes to do. session the honourable member for Maranoa desired to provide pensions for the Defence Department, and we were informed by the Minister of the day that the question of providing pensions for the wholi Commonwealth service was under consideration. has been tossed out. promised to consider the establishment of a Commonwealth Public Service pensions scheme. What happened to his predeof the Minister in regard to a proposal for doing simple justice to our public servants. fered with the continuity of the consideration though. continuity of policy in this instance? It will be very unfortunate for civil and military servants if, because one Minister was "" tossed out "" of office, the continuity of the Commonwealth's policy on a matter of this kind should be interfered with. That: is, I think, a strong reason why the Government should get straight to grips with the question, and have the pensions system initiated forthwith in these Departments. One of the most deplorable features in connection with some Departments is the very unfortunate position in which the older public servants occasionally find themselves, when they have reached the age at which they must retire under the I underprovisions of the law governing their service. It is pathetic to find that a man who has devoted all his energies, practically his whole existence, to the service of the State, and has reached an age when there is no more work left in him, is dealt with by the State hardly more mercifully than are horses which are sent by their owners to the Zoo. I believe that in pen-: sions we shall find the key to an efficient system of officering the Military Forces in"" the near future. An officer ought to be in a position to retire when he feels that he has passed his period of usefulness Under the present system, an officer is bound to hang on in a public Department, as long as he possibly can, because that is his only means of living. Why do not Ministers say what wharf labourer, too. is not, but we are now dealing with public Last Departments.

I remind honourable members that a man who enters a public Department in Australia has his eyes open to the fact that the very utmost which he can expect to get, after many years' toil, is £800 or £900, or perhaps ,£1,000 a year. He sacrifices the bigger rewards of life for continuity of employment. My honourable friends know that if a man starts in the battle of life free from Government employment all the rewards of life are open to him; he may become almost as wealthy as some of my honourable friends are. But he cannot arrive at that great result by being in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. The maximum salaries are cut down, because we wish to guarantee continuity of employment. It is that which these gentlemen prefer to accept in place of the opportunities of getting great rewards in other walks of life. Surely continuity of employment ought to include some consideration for men who have reached an age when they can nolonger labour for the State! I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will do what he can to carry out the idea of his predecessor. A pensions system is wanted by the House and the country.

In the Bill it is not intended to interfere with any right of white parents as regards their children. It may surprise some honourable members to hear that at present it is quite possible for an Asiatic to marry a white"" woman who has been the mother of children by a white husband, to take those white children out of Australia, to proselytize them in his own country, and to bring them up as he pleases. An incident of that kind has come under my notice. It is the duty of this Parliament, I think, to prevent white Australian children from being subjected to such a fate as that.

Under the existing law it is only possible to deport persons who have committed crimes of violence, and I propose to amend the law in the direction of empowering the Minister to deport persons for the commission of any crimes which are contrary to the welfare or the morality of our community. I do not propose that we should empower the Minister to deport any person who is or can become an elector of fhe Commonwealth.

I would say, in the words of the general newspapers, in Australia, and the poetI must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom 1 please. On the last occasion of a similar kind the honourable member for Parramatta took us back to the recent elections, and gave us some very pertinent reminders of the way in which the Fusion had betrayed its principles. Save in one small particular, the honourable member did not controvert the statements which he read from the newspaper with which I am associated, but his argument was, "" Well, if I was bad, the other fellow was just as bad as I was."" I wish, in the first place, to remind him of some of the tactics of his own party, which are worthy of a place in Hansard,, and, secondly, to remind him of some quotations which he failed to make from the newspaper to which he referred. I have before me some of the pamphlets issued at the last general election by the Fusion party, with which the honourable member was associated. One of them, entitled "" Socialism and the Churches,"" was distributed broadcast in my own electorate, as well as in others. Labour -members were asked to shoulder the responsibility for utterances, opposed to Christianity, by miscellaneous writers in Labour papers-in some cases correspondents writing in the open columns, and in others gentlemen in direct antagonism to our party. quotations are garbled. Mr J. H. CATTS -That is so. In some cases a sentence was so extracted from a paragraph as to allow the context to be misconstrued. A more deliberate attempt to mislead the public could scarcely have been made. In this pamphlet, we have the following quotation from the Brisbane Worker:When the Labour movement has to turn to God for help, it will be God help it, indeed; labour writes on its door-posts, "" Wanted a Saviour, no Gods or dogs need apply."" That is very ancient. It was written by a correspondent to the Brisbane Worker, and the Labour party was not in the slightest degree responsible for it. As a matter of fact, even had it appeared in an editorial we could not have been held responsible, since the Labour movement is in no way responsible for editorials in the Brisbane Worker. That newspaper is one of the most powerfully edited Labour journals, if virility of the editor's pen arises from his absolute freedom from control. from which the quotation was made was not an attack on the Christian religion. Mr J. H . CATTS -It was not, and the quotation, if it had not been removed from its context, would have shown that. This pamphlet goes onOne of the leading objects of the LabourSocialist teaching is to discredit Christianity and to hold up its teachers to contempt, as the terms "" whited sepulchres,"" ""reptiles to be loathed,"" & c , demonstrate. Ours was the only party challenging the Fusion at the recent election, and the honourable member for Parramatta labelled the Labour party as "" Labour Socialists"" wherever he went. These pamphlets, purporting to be opposed to tlie candidature of what the Fusion described as ""Labour Socialists,"" contained what were construed to be anti-Christian sentiments, which our party were asked to father. were asked to judge Labour candidates upon them. Mr J. H . CATTS -Fo r instance, the honourable member for Calare, who for many years has taken a very prominent part in the counsels of his church, had pamphlets of this kind distributed throughout his electorate, and the electors were asked to judge him on his alleged association with men holding such views. I also find in this pamphlet a statement relating to the Sunday school established by the Socialists, under Tom Mann, in Melbourne. It is a reprint from an Argus article on "" A Socialistic Sunday School,"" in which the Christian religipn is said to have been discarded. As a matter of fact, Tom Mann has be-yi opposed for many years to the Labour movement as at present organized, and to the Labour platforrri as now propounded. If he himself has not, others, at all events, associated with him in the Socialistic organization, have gone so' far as to say that it would have been better had rank Conservatives rather than the Labour party been returned to power. Yet these statements are put forward and the public are asked to judge the Labour movement upon them.

Mr J. H . CATTS -Some of those known as the international Socialists. it. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member knew, at all events, that these pamphlets were scattered all over the country, and he was not fair enough to repudiate them. He and others who claim to be good Christians allowed them to be put forward, and thus bore false witness against their neighbours. Another of the pamphlets issued by the Fusionists was headed, "" Are you loyal or only lip loyal?"" and it contained this statementWe have heard much during the last few months of loyalty to the Empire. While the offer of a Dreadnought to the Mother Country was condemned lustily by the Labour party, they were particular, through their leader, to proclaim that they were not one whit behind others in loyalty. Are you not doubtful on this point? Have you not memories of various actions by prominent members of that party which justify doubt? Do not their favourite press organs reek with abusive and malicious attacks on Great Britain and her institutions and all her actions? If she becomes involved with another nation, is it not always contended that she is disgracefully in the wrong? A statement, said to have been made by Mr Keir Hardie in the British House of Commons, is then quoted. enough to say that certain individuals somewhere in Australia were supposed to hold views disloyal to the Empire. These Fusionists had to go all the way to Great Britain, and to take two or three disconnected sentences from a speech said to have been made by Mr Keir Kardie, with a view of showing that the Labour movement was disloyal. made from Keir Hardie's speech? Mr J. H . CATTS -It readsThe Socialists might have to interfere to prevent children being taught in schools to wave Hags and sing a ghastly bit of doggerel like the National Anthem. That is one statement which he is supposed to have made. The subject upon which he was speaking at the time is not mentioned, nor is the context given. Even assuming that Mr Keir Hardie is the very essence of disloyalty, what has that to do with us ? The Labour movement in Australia has nothing to do with the Labour movement in England. is a great Scotchman. Mr J. H . CATTS I have the greatest admiration for his giant efforts to lift the workers of England from the slough of despond to a position of something like manly independence. These are not criticisms of our party, but malicious falsehoods, and they were distributed all over the country to prejudice the electors against the Labour movement, and its humanitarian platform. Another pamphlet circulated by the Fusion party was entitled "" An impudent try-on."" It appears that a union was called upon to be a party to a test action to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It had thus to incur an expenditure totalling some hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds, and a request was made that the Commonwealth should pay its costs. In the account submitted to the Minister was an item of £1413 representing a claim by a union secretary for £ 5 5s. per day in respect of twenty-seven days' attendance at Court. This pamphlet was put forward as though the Labour party had accepted the account, and had decided that the Commonwealth should pay it. The statement was never sent out with this lying pamphlet that the expenses in respect of the union secretary's attenI t was not dance were not endorsed by the Labour party, and that, on the the contrary, it refused to recognise, at all events, that particular item. It ""was represented as a cool unblushing attempt to make the public pay.

It would have been very interesting, when a suitable occasion offered, to hear the honourable member for Parramatta explain away the intimidation and coercion exercised on members of the Fusion in con-: nexion with the Financial Agreement. As a matter of fact, members on this side are infinitely freer than honourable members opposite. We are elected oh a distinct platform, which sets forth a number of defined principles. The party meet, and decide details as to the best means of carrying those principles into effect, every member having an equal say on the floor of the party room. What is the position of members of the Fusion? The late Government came to an understanding with' their supporters in regard to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, but, without even saying "" by your leave,"" or consulting his followers in any shape or form, the Prime Minister not accepted an. agreement, drawn up in secret' conference with the Premiers. This was a violation of the Fusion contracta violation of the agreement between the two"" wings which had come together in order; to "" dish "" the Labour party. The extracts' from Hansard, which I have read, show that members of the Fusion voted against: their convictions, and complained bitterly of the coercion and intimidation exercised on them by their leaders.

195,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"I said disthat all the freedom is on the Opposition side; but ex-Senator Gray, in his election campaign in New South Wales, ""gave ihe show away"" in a speech which he delivered on 3rd February, and which is reported in the Richmond River Times, as followsRegarding the Deakin-Cook Fusion, he had sunk his principles, but it was for the benefit of the country and not for himself. Ex-Senator Gray has since been dealt with by his constituents for sinking his principles, and sent about his business, while another man, more faithful to his election pledges, has taken his place. The honourable member for Parramatta, when criticising the' defence scheme of the Labour Government some time ago, referred to the "" River"" destroyers as boats that ply up and aown rivers. ber knows that is not correct. Why does he repeat it ? Mr J. H . CATTS -Her e is a quotation from the Adelaide Register of 5th March, 1908. The honourable member at an immense meeting in the Town Hall, criticising the Labour party's defence scheme and trying to throw ridicule on the destroyers which the Labour Government had ordered, is reported as follows :He place regarding the kind of boats we had ordered, because Captain Creswell had reported in favour of sea-going boats, and not boats for scheme of old-age pensions to be initiated at river work. word wrong. I said ""coastal,"" and not ""river."" Mr J. H . CATTS -As a matter of fact, these boats have sea-going qualities, enabling -them to travel 3,000 miles from the mainland, but the honourable member apparently referred to them as little boats that would travel up and down rivers and topple over with the first wave that struck them outside. 3,000 miles from the mainland, would the honourable member state how ° they could travel 3,000 miles back, because they had a steaming capacity of only 3,000 miles? Mr J. H . CATTS -If the honourable member now wishes to emphasize his previous statement, that these were boats for plying up and down rivers, he is welcome to do so. Here is another little quotation here from the honourable member for Parramatta which will no doubt be very appropriate for the use of some honourable members in connection with the discussion of the land tax :Confiscation -Hon. Joseph Cook, M.P., his real opinions-(Ne w South Wales Hansard, p. a 543) 7 December, 1892)t n "" T do not believe in paying for land at all . I believe in taxing it, and if . we tax it to its f u l l unimproved value we shall have no need to sell it : indeed, no one will buy it. When a man wants a bit of land in this colony he has to go hundreds of miles back into the bush, behind his strong neighbour, who has picked out the eyes of the country. We ought to tax the strong neighbour for every ounce of privilege over the man who proposes to go into the bush."" That is infinitely more extreme than the proposals of the present Government, which I have no doubt the honourable member will find some excuse for criticising before the debate^ ends. There were some further quotations which the honourable member did not think it wise to use. They referred to the debate on the Surplus Revenue Bill which the Reid-Cook wing of the Fusion found themselves called upon to oppose, although they knew perfectly well that the funds for paying old-age pensions at that time were to be raised by those means. The honourable member for Wide Bay on 29th May, 1908, during the discussion on the Surplus Revenue Bill, as believed an investigation should take reported in Hansard, at page 11710, saidThis Bill, if carried, will enable a Federal least eighteen months earlier than would have been possible by any other means. This shows clearly that it was in the mind of the party, who were on this side of the House at the time, that old-age pensions should be provided eighteen months earlier by means of that Bill, and yet the ReidCook wing of the Fusion, then in Opposition, fought the Bill tooth and nail, and afterwards tried to make out to their constituents that they had supported the introduction of old-age pensions at that early date. The honourable member for Lang, speaking in the same debate, on 1st June, 1908, as reported in Hansard, on page 11749, saidSomething of that kind must have been in the mind of the Prime Minister when he gave notice of his intention to ask leave to introduce an Old-age PensionsB i ll to-morrow. That distinctly shows that to his mind the Surplus Revenue Bill and the Old-age Pensions Bill were linked together, and yet the honourable member delivered to us some",34,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales

The honourable member for Flinders is reported to have said on 2nd June, 1908, as reported in Hansard, on page T1824Now, sir, the passing of an old-age pensions scheme has been -discussed in connection with this Bill. This proved that the payment of old-age pensions was dependent upon the passage of the Surplus Revenue Bill. Yet those gentlemen saw fit to oppose the Bill, and tried to take equal credit with the Labour party at the elections for passing old-age and invalid pensions at least eighteen months earlier than would have been possible under any other scheme. There are a few other things which the honourable member for Parramatta did not quote. In the issue of the Co-operator, of 14th July, 1909a considerable time before the elections-thi s prophecy was recorded. issue, which was sent to me. Mr J. H . CATTS I am sure the honourable member will now appreciate the effort of one. of our minor poets, referring to the formation of the Fusion, and its probable fate when the people had an opportunity at the elections of dealing with it.

That little jingle, published in the middle of last year, was used by a good many of our supporters at the various shearing sheds to depict the throwing overboard of their principles by the members of the Fusion. I am sure the honourable member for Parramatta has not seen another little rhyme honourable member consider that he will effect any good purpose by continuing that line of argument? Mr J. H .

I cannot, of course, rule the honourable member out of order. It is purely a question of taste, and of the proper conduct of the business of the House, whether the honourable member pursues this line of argument further. Mr J. H .

The The honourable member must not expect to be allowed to criticise another honourable member in his absence without getting back something of what he gives. I am sure that the readers of Hansard will be pleased to have this rhymed account of his history. During the election campaign there was issued a production called The Federal Liberal, which bears a great eagle on the front of it. To show that the Fusion party was associated with land monopolists, I have only to mention the fact that it was printed and published "" for the proprietors, the Federal Pastoralist Company, iz Wool Exchange, Sydney."" This was the official Fusion manifesto. I understand that the production was preceded by another, whose title was altered during the Federal campaign, some one stating to the postal officials, on behalf of the Fusion party, that it was a newspaper which it was intended to publish henceforth at regular intervals. Thus the party was able to send through the post at newspaper rates what was really electioneering literature, perpetrating a fraud on the public revenue. The paper was supported by some of the great institutions directly connected with the landed interests. For instance, there is an advertisement from the Australian Mortgage Land and Finance No doubt, he Company Limited, in which it is stated thatThe company makes advances on grazing properties, acts generally as pastoral banker and agent, and undertakes the supervision of sheep Liberal advances granted on the ensuing clip of wool, and on produce consigned for sale in Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, or for shipment to London. There is another big advertisement from the Bank of New South Wales, and others from the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, Hill Clark and Company, and the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company. These firms, by advertising in the Fusion manifesto, helped to pay for the circulation of the electioneering literature of the party. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Absolut e rubbish. This advertising is done by contract. firms advertise in the Bulletin. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is significant to find their advertisements in the Fusion manifesto, of which thousands of copies paper contains pictures of the honourable members for Ballarat and Parramatta, with personal letters from each, addressed to the electors, that from the honourable member for Parramatta being signed "" Your faithful servant, Joseph Cook."" This paper was a good text at a large number of meetings, where I pointed out to large working-class audiences that the big companies which I have mentioned were behind the Fusion party, who were defrauding the revenue by sending through the post, at newspaper rates, a publication which was in no sense a newspaper. A similar publication was issued during the previous electoral campaign, but I called the attention of the Postmaster General of the day, the honourable member",36,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales

Some eighteen months ago, I felt so strongly that this was the proper course to pursue-that not only would it grant relief to the Parliament, but that the employees would have their case thoroughly threshed out, and secure more substantial justice-that I called a meeting of these public servants in Sydney. A Deakin Administration was then in power, and there was a little diffidence on the part of the employees in taking steps to register under the Act, because they imagined that that Government would set its face against such an action. I informed them, however, that if they were prepared to test die matter, I would act as president of their society, and in that capacity would submit their rules for registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and see the action through, so that they would not be brought into personal conflict with the Minister. My proposal was accepted. A General Division society was formed; I was elected honorary president, and framed a set of rules conforming to the schedules to the Act. An application for registration was submitted to the industrial registrar, but the then Attorney-General, Mr Groom, acting on behalf of the Deakin Government, lodged an objection against Federal employees being registered under the Act. I obtained advice from one of the leading constitutional authorities of Australia that the Government had not the slightest hope of preventing Federal public servants from registering, that we could safely go on with our application, and that registration would be secured; but, unfortunately, the action of the Deakin Government caused the employees to become a f r a i d ; they called a special meeting of the organization, and carried a resolution rescinding all that had been done. member say that we proposed to stop Federal public servants from registering? Mr J. H . CATTS -Not the Fusion Government, but the previous Deakin Administration. The Postal Commission may make recommendations that will improve the lot of these officers, but in a large sermen have had an increase in their wages vice of this description industrial troubles are constantly arising, and there must be some Board or tribunal to adjudicate between the contending parties. My strong advice to the postal employee's has been, and is, as one who has had considerable experience in arbitration matters, that they should form one General Division Society, have their organization registered, submit any dispute which may occur to an impartial tribunal, and thus have awards made for a specified time. At present, tlie requests of the employees are sent on , to their superior officers, who can treat them as they please. They complain to me that on many occasions grievances submitted to the Departments are treated with contempt. If their organization were registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, that would not occur. Heads of Departments would be compelled to take cognisance of their complaints, knowing that their organization would have a right to submit them to the Federal Arbitration Court, or some such tribunal, and would thus be able to obtain a definite adjustment of the difficulty. liament a better Court to which to appeal. Mr J. H . CATTS I emphatically disagree with the honourable member. Parliament is not competent to deal with the details of the industrial conditions of an army of employees.

226,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang),"properly should never have been introduced here. I rise now only for the purpose of correcting some misrepresentations by that honourable member, who quoted what purported to be my expressed convictions, when in a previous Parliament, I was addressing myself to the Financial Agreement made between the Premiers and the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. The honourable member gave a garbled extract from my speeches without reading the context, and thus imparted an entirely different complexion to my utterances. . The honourable member quoted from Hansard of the 4th November, 1909, page 5352, as followsThe Premiers would have been well advised had they agreed to a limitation of the duration of the arrangement to fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years. What the honourable member did not quote wasI am sorry the Premiers did not see their way to fal l in with the suggestion for a fixed period, because it would have meant absolute unanimity on this side. Then follows the important point he omitted j and I may say that the misrepresentation which I am now refuting was circulated in hundreds of thousands of leaflets by the Labour party during the recent elections in New South WalesBut while I hold that view, and would have preferred a more elastic basis of agreement, I shall not help the Labour Socialists to dishonour the compact made with' the States at the recent Premiers' Conference. Under existing conditions, I rather favour the limitation of the spending powers of the Commonwealth, for the next few years at any rate. If we have an overflowing Treasury, and, perhaps, a Labour Government in office, they will have a very strong temptation, with the means of gratifying it always at hand, to try to materialize some of their Socialistic nationalization proposals, all trending in the direction of unification and the curtailment of State Rights. I want the rights of the States, as well as those of the Commonwealth, to be preserved, under their separate Constitutions, as far as possible intact. Those words made my position absolutely clear. against my convictions, I showed that, at that time, 1 had no convictions on the question at all. It was merely a matter of opinion subject to further and fuller information. The honourable member for Adelaide interjectedI am distressed because the honourable member for Lang intends to vote against hu convictions. I then saidI shall not do so. Th'at interjection is merely intended to mislead and misrepresent my position. It will therefore be clearly seen that at that time. I made my position plain. In another portion of the speech I pointed out that, whilst I thought the arrangement I indicated would have suited the Premiers better, I recognised that their proposal was very much better from the Commonwealth point of view than would be a limitation of the period. I said it was a pity the Premiers had not accepted die limitation, but I made it plain that I spoke merely from the State point of view and from the point of view of the Premiers as parties to the agreement. I added that if they were prepared to accept the proposal before the House, I saw no reason to disagree with it, since the Commonwealth had the best of the deal. When an honourable member tries once more in this Chamber to fasten misrepresentation upon me, I take the earliest opportunity of counteracting the intended effect of his assertions by putting the truth alongside of what cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as in accordance with the facts. The honourable member also spoke about the attitude of myself and ether members of this party towards the Surplus Revenue Bill,and tried to twist it into opposition to the payment of old age pensions. He made some quotations which did not bear out the position he was taking up. member must admit that old-age pensions would not have been passed without that Bill. not even thought of at the time in that connection. The point is that all through the elections the members of the Labour party in New South Wales issued a leaflet in which the position of myself and other honourable members was absolutely misrepresented, and our opposition to the Surplus Revenue Bill twisted into opposition to the payment of VVhenI was twitted with voting old-age pensions, although the honourable member for Hume, who was in charge of the Bill, admitted, as did other honourable members on that side of the House, thai there was no opposition on the part of any party in the House to their payment. When the honourable member for Hume moved the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, and at cither stages, not a word was said about any portion of the money being proposed to be devoted to the payment of old-age pensions.

228,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"It wasfor a statement of the purposes to which it was proposed to devote the fund he told us that tlie object was to prevent the lapsing of votes for the construction of public works in regard chiefly to fortifications, and for other defence matters. He led us to believe that the purpose of the Bill was to enable the Government to carry out such undertakings as the Fremantle defence works. Not a word was said about old-age pensions until some weeks, or, I believe, months afterwards, when it was suggested, I think, in an article in the Age that the money might be used in that way. That was suddenly taken up, as a very good idea, to compel honourable members on this side to vote upon a misrepresentation of the intention behind the proposal to set rtside the surplus revenue. I rose mainly for the purpose of setting these matters right, but while on my feet I may as well deal briefly with the question of the direct telephone line fromCronulla to Kogarah. ances in connection with the Postal, Defence, and Customs Departments, but I shall not air them at this time in the House. This telephone line was referred to on the last grievance day. The Postmaster General will remember that I pointed out that a direct line had been promised, but apparently had not been erected. I have since had a letter from the Department reminding me that what they call a direct line has been constructed. Cronulla vid Port Hacking to Sutherland, and is about as direct as would be a line from Melbourne to Sydney vid Adelaide and Port Darwin. It is not a direct line but a circuitous one, leading in an opposite direction for some distance and through the Sutherland office, which was not desired by the local people. A telegram from the shire clerk, in reply to further inquiries, tells me that this line does not serve the requirements of the district, is not what they want, and does not relieve the congestion. I notice on reference to the departmental letter that mention was made of a suggestion to take the line round by way of Sutherland, but they spoke in the beginning of their letter of a direct line. which allegations were made of things that That is where the confusion has arisen. It is called a "" direct"" line, when, as a matter of fact, the line constructed is roundabout, and, I am informed, does not meet the requirements of the district. I therefore ask the Postmaster-General to have the matter further looked into with Mr W. Elliot Johnson. a view to giving relief by the construction of a direct line. -It has been known for a considerable time that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists in the Postal Department in New South Wales. I think it is the desire of the Postmaster-General to remove the causes of the trouble, and the proposal of the honourable member for Cook that matters of this kind should be remitted to an independent tribunal for investigation is worthy of the Minister's serious consideration. The same trouble used to exist in the State Departments in New South Wales, particularly in that of the railways. There was at that time a Board of Appeal in the Railway Department, but it was mainly controlled by the officers of the Department, and the question of determining wages and conditions of labour did not come within the scope of its inquiry. Since the Wages Board has been established there these matters have been referred to it, and it has I have quite a list of grievbeen effective in bringing about a considerable improvement in the conditions by removing many of the causes of * friction. I do not see why a similar independent tribunal should not be established in regard to the officers in our Postal Department, and I therefore recommend to the earnest attention of the Postmaster-General the suggestion of the honourable member for Cook as a means of solving the difficulty and doing away with the dissatisfaction It runs from which at present exists in his Department in New South Wales. [3.55] I wish to congratulate the Government on their excellent supporters, who evidently have no consideration for the time of the country and no regard for the kind of legislation which is before the House, when they waste an hour and a-half of public time in discussing matters that have nothing whatever to do with it. member set the example in this matter. attention to four matters published in the honourable member for Cook's paper in were taking place in public Departments, including an allegation of sweating in the Postal Department.

I fwas intended to burst up large estates, the 'High Court, should it be called on to pronounce concerning its constitutionality, would declare it to be an invasion of the rights of the States, and consequently ultra vires. If in Committee we amended the title to make it ""a Bill for the disintegration of large estates,"" or amended the preamble 'to make it read, ""Whereas it is desirable that Parliament should pass legislation for the disintegration of large estates, and the improvement of the land tenure of Australia,"" or effected any similar alteration, the High .Court, if invoked, would declare the measure to be ultra vires. tention of the measure declared in its title or preamble ? cause its framers are afraid to make such a declaration. bers who supported a measure imposing Customs duties did not insert in its preamble a statement to the effect that its intention was die encouragement of local production. been quite constitutional to put such a declaration into the Customs Tariff Bill, because this Parliament has absolute and exclusive right to legislate in regard to, all matters affecting Customs and Excise, and trade and commerce with other countries. We have the right to legislate regarding such matters for any purpose, direct or indirect. we have a general power of taxation, we have no power to impose taxation with the obvious purpose of interfering with land tenure, legislation with respect to which is exclusively the right of the State Parliaments. This is part and parcel of the Federal bargain, which was legalized by an Imperial Act. No one ever suggested that this Parliament should be given exclusive or partial right to legislate, either directly or indirectly, regarding the lands of the country. Honourable members who support the Bill would be only too glad to declare in it the intention of the Legislature, if they did not fear that by doing so they would make it ultra vires. The fact that they will not put such a declaration into the measure shows that they doubt our constitutional right to pass it. Let us consider what are the basic principles of the proposed law as they can be drawn, not from the declaration of politicians, but from its provisions. It is proposed, first, to impose a tax on the unimproved value of all land exceeding a certain amount. This is a tax, not on the annual value of land, but upon the corpus. The Commonwealth is not to take a percentage of the annual rents and profits, but to tax the capital value, irrespective of acreage or situation. Next, the tax is to be progressive, increasing with the increase in the capital value of the land. It is not to be a proportionate tax, which, as was shown by the honourable'member for Angas, would be the fairest tax to impose on capital values. Thirdly, there is to be an exemption respecting land whose value is less than £5,000, subject to the qualification that one owner can benefit by only one exemption. Fourthly, by a cunningly devised provision, there is to be a linking together of the several blocks of land belonging to any owner. ningly devised "" ? cunningly devised, not merely for the raising of revenue, but for the regulating of land tenure, and the limiting of the area whicli any one individual may hold. member's interjection bears out the contention that the main object of the measure is land reform, which, I say, this Parliament cannot constitutionally legislate for. If the object is land reform, why not set it out in the Bill? If , on the other hand, the intention is merely to raise revenue, then why these numerous differentiations and gradations? Why these numerous little clauses, apparently innocent in themselves, but bearing a tremendous significance, and all tending to modify and regulate the land policies and systems of the States? This Bill is intended 10 operate only on land held in fee-simple. I have carefully examined it, in company with some of my honourable and learned friends, and we can see in it nothing showing an intention to deal with land of any tenure, except that held in fee-simple. That also is another discrimination or differentiation relating to the kind of landed property to be dealt with. From these various provisions the deduction may be made that the object and policy of this legislation is to disintegrate, or break up, large or valuable freehold estates, above",44,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales

If we had power to deal with land policy generally there might be some wisdom in a proposition having for its object the disintegration or dissolving of large aggregations of property in a given neighbourhood, which monopolize, so to speak, the adjoining territory. this Bill,"" framed in the manner I have indicated, goes further than that'. It does not merely aim at breaking up large aggregations of property or large' estates clustered together in one part of the Commonwealth, but it goes on in its incidence and intention to limit the personal ownership of land in scattered blocks and allotments. It provides, for the purpose of enabling the Government to get as much as they can out of one owner, and of limiting the exemption of £5.000 to one owner, that his various blocks or allotments shall be consolidated.. A manmight have £5,600 worth of land in New South Wales, and areas of equal value in Queensland and other States. Under this scheme all those blocks are to be consolidated so as to form one estate to which only one exemption will apply. If under this Bill it is not deemed to be an act of land ownership, punishable by a tax, to possess land of the unimproved value of £5,000, which is not associated with other land held in the same neighbourhood, why is it made an offence for a man to hold blocks worth £5,000 each in different parts of the country, or in two different States? are intended by the promoters of the BiU, purposes. of these provisions evidently run together as part of one scheme to interfere with, regulate, and modify the ownership of land as it exists at the present time under State laws. There can be no reasonable doubt that that inference can be drawn from this proposition. Another deduction that can be made is that this is a Bill to discourage the holding of freehold property above the unimproved value of £5,000, and to encourage leasehold estates from the Crown. There is no provision for the taxation of leasehold estates. ber does not desire such a provision. porting any form of land taxation by this Parliament; T am supporting a proposition that land taxation should be left to the States, because they can more fairly nnd effectively deal with it. In other words, I think this may be described as a Bill to penalize the owners of freehold land above £5,000 in unimproved value. There may be other possible objections, but whilst I may claim, in common with other honourable members, to have a special knowledge of the But land system appropriate to Victoriathe State to which I belongI cannot be expected fairly to understand land conditions in New South Wales,.as well as do the representatives of that State in this or the State Parliament. It would be impossible for any honourable member to adequately predict what'might be the possible results of some of the provisions of this Bill-taxin g ostensibly in their form, but, it mav be, penalizing and confiscatory in their effects. This Bill, taxing in its form, but penalizing in its consequences, may tend to concentrate the pastoral industry amongst single owners of small freehold areas. It may tend to discourage the prosecution of the pastoral industry on large areas of poor land. I am not sufficiently familiar with the landed conditions of New South Wales, or those of the great State of Queensland, to know what may be the possible effects of the application of this Bill there; but I have seen, in various newspapers, references to specific estates where terrible hardships will be inflicted by the apparent unequal operation of this Federal land tax. Whether those effects I do not know; but some of the cases, paris for revenue ticulars of which have appeared in the press, go to show that if this land tax, as now formulated, becomes law, it will have the most injurious and even disastrous effects upon a. large number of estates in the rural districts of New South Wales, Queensland, and other parts of the Commonwealth. That leads me to a further consideration of the constitutionality of this form of legislation. The honourable member for Lang last night invited me to reply to a question which he put as to whether or not this legislation would involve a ""discrimination"" coming within the meaning of some of the provisions of the Constitution. Only one section of the Constitution-sectio n 51, subsection 11 -deal s with the question of discrimination in relation to the possible taxation of land. It provides that the Federal Parliament shall have the power of taxation generally, subject to the proviso that there shall be no discrimination "" between States or parts of States.""

253,Sir John Quick,"I am not supscheme of taxation will operate by way of discriminating between any of the States, or parts of the States. I understand that in the case of The King v. Barger, the High Court decided that the expression "" parts of States"" may mean different localities in different parts of the States. I do not suppose that many honourable members would undertake, without knowledge of its application, to say to what extent this tax, in its present form, may operate so as to discriminate between parts of the States, or between different localities in different States. I have, howtion of the Commonwealth, and against ever, seen it made the'subject of complaint that the tax, in its present form, will be more serious in its application to some of the pastoral back country of New South Wales than it will be in the case of the more thickly populated parts of Victoria. 1 have been furnished with an illustration showing the possibility of such discrimination arising between various localities. Take -an estate of 600 acres, in the Western District of Victoria, of an average value of £ 3 0 per acre, representing a capital value of £18,000, and contrast it with another estate of 6,000 acres, in the northern, or arid, district of Victoria, of an average value of £ 3 per acre, and with the same capital value of £18,000. The capital value is the same in each case, but the situations are different. From those two estates the same amount of land tax will be derived, no doubt, on account of the uniformity of the capital value. But, as has been pointed out to me, this tax will operate in a very unequal manner. The Western District of Victoria is a fertile region, accessible to railway communication, with a good rainfall, and greater productive possibilities and more numerous powers of utilization than the arid region in the north of Victoria. Honourable members representing Victoria and other parts of Australia may make use of their own knowledge of the difference in the surroundings and environment of the two estates I have cited to arrive at the conclusion that the earnings of a property or estate of 600 acres in the Western District will be very much greater than the larger estate in the arid regions. Its standard of stability of value will be more constant than that of an estate in the northern portion of the State, where the rainfall is less and the means of communication not so great. It may be that the principle of comparison which I have shadowed forth could he carried out on a Sir John Quick. larger scale. We might take an estate in Victoria and an estate in Riverina, both of the same capital value, but the earning value of the Victorian estate might be very much greater than that of an estate of similar capital value in New South Wales, or some portions of Queensland. Hence, arises a possibility of complaint, which may afterwards reach the High Court, that this system of taxation, apparently so fair, as based on equality of capital value, is, in reality and in actual practice, a discrimination in favour of land-owners in one porland-owners in another portion. I venture to say that, if it were shown ""this taxation operates in the way of giving an advantage or privilege to land situated in one part of the Commonwealth, and imposing a disability or disadvantage on land situated in another part, it would come within the meaning of, and be obnoxious to, that section of the Constitution which provides against discrimination in taxation. honourable member suggest as an alternative? suggest an alternative. WhatI say is that this question of land taxation is so complex that it ought to be dealt with in each separate State, where there is special knowledge of the various areas, to enable the formulation of a scheme of classification, by which a tax might be devised according to situation and earning capacity, rather than based on the dead level of uniform values. I admit that the scheme proposed is fair on the face of it, and to that extent it. is seductive; but in actual practice I believe it will result in the discovery of numerous inequalities, discriminations, and cases of unfairness, leading probably to forfeiture and confiscation-a n end which I am sure honourable members neither desire nor design. That is one point of view from which the constitutionality or legality of the scheme is open to attack. There is another point of view from which this tax is open to criticism on constitutional grounds, if not to successful assault on legal grounds in the High Court; and I should like honourable members to take a note of that proposition. In dealing with the legal points and possible legal objections, I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not now endeavouring to pose as a legal prophet of evil; I merely desire to point out possibilities of the future.

255,Sir John Quick,"I am not here tolawyers; because a number of these questions are honestly open to difference of opinion, and can only be finally decided by the High Court; so that any suggestion which I now make is not necessarily final and conclusive, even in my own opinion, but merely what I conceive may be the result in the future, when this Act is subjected to that searchlight of legal criticism to which other Commonwealth legislation has been subjected. There were, for instance, the Excise duties in the Harvester cases, which resulted in the Federal legislation being declared null and void, much to the surprise of many honourable members. There was also the legislation relating to the bringing of the State railway employees within the operation of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which was also held to be null and void on constitutional grounds. Those two cases are certainly worth perusal and investigation by honourable members. I now wish to present a point which has occurred to me as open to be taken in connection with this scheme of land taxation. Honourable members know that the scheme starts with an exemption of £5,000 worth of property held or occupied by any one individual, and that all property above £5,000 iu value is divided or graduated according to capital value. The first class of property, up to £15,000 in value, is liable to a tax of 2d. in the £ 1 ; from £15,000 to £30,000, the tax is 3d.; from £30,000 to £45,000, the tax is 4d.; from £45,000 to £6o,ooo,the tax is 5d.; and, finally, the tax on properties of the capital value of £75,000 and upwards is 6d. in the £ 1 . This form of graduated or progressive taxation is open to the objection that, whilst it may be, in form, and apparently designed to be, a tax, it is in reality and substance a penalty. The High Court has held that, in dealing with Federal legislation, it will be guided by the substance of the Act itself-it s actual results. Tariff? dealt with the Customs Tariff, and need not go over that ground again. between a Customs Tariff and this tax. of Australia and the High Court of the United States have held that, although we may call a thing a tax, if , in reality and in substance, it is not a tax', but a penalty, designed to cover an ulterior object, it may [88] defeat its purpose, and be in excess of the constitutional authority. say that of a Protectionist Tariffhave pointed out, the Federal Parliament has exclusive authority over Customs and Excise duties and foreign commerce, and, therefore, it could impose an import duty or an export duty for any purpose whatever. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It could prohibit any kind of importation. Federal Parliament could not only impose a tax having an indirect object, but it could pass a declaration actually prohibiting the importation of any boots,for instance, into Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that the argument of the honourable member for Newcastle does not apply in the present case. Our powers,' taxation of land, are limited to honest bond fide taxes for the raising of revenue; and under our Constitution we are not allowed to call a thing a tax and raise money in the name of a tax, when, in reality and in substance, it is a penalty intended to penalize people who hold land of a certain value or above a certain value. It may be that the tax is intended not merely to penalize them, but to penalize them out of existence by practically forcing them to sell their land, in order to bring themselves within the exemption. What is the obvious meaning of this schedule for the taxation of land extending by rates from 2d. to 6d. in the £ 1 , distributed over various grades of values above £5,000? The object, of course, is plain on the face of the measure; it is not to raise revenue, but to induce people, by the strength and force of the operation of this burden of taxation, to sell their land to their neighbours for the best price they can get, in order to come within the protection of the exemption. That is a reasoning capable of being deduced by the High Court, apart from any speeches or declarations in Parliament. The Bill itself, while it purports to be a measure to raise revenue by taxation, or to impose taxation for the purposes of revenue, will defeat' its object, if the people intended to be affected unburden themselves of the possession of land, l t has been said that there is a double object in this schemethe bursting up of large estates and revenue. Let me point out, however, that these two objects are conflicting, inconsistent, and self-destroying.

264,Sir John Quick,"The honorablescheme of this Bill, by which the owners of estates of a certain value are to be told that they are to be penalized and made to pay according to capital value unless they get rid of their estates over a certain amount of value. I forgot to say, when referring to this tax being based upon the capital value, that, whilst it sounds fair and plausible, when you come to analyze it at the bar ofreason and fairness it is found to be unjust. based upon the capital value and not on the annual value, or the produce, or receipts; not according to its fluctuating value from year to year, or what it i j earning, as it varies according to the climate or the industrial conditions for the time being.

After all, this tax on the capital value for a certain time, if persisted with, will, in the end, absorb the whole of the value of the corpus of the estate, and the owner will be deprived of his inheritance. Is that fair? you impose a tax of 6d. in the £ 1 on land worth, say, jQ\ an acre, it is a mere matter of calculation to find how many years the tax will have to continue before the whole of the capital value is absorbed. ing in value. the Government want merely to raise revenue, why not base the tax on the annual instead of the capital value? The proposal shows at once that there is an ulterior purpose. It is thought that a tax, based on the annual value, would not be rapid or drastic enough in its operation to force and constrain owners of land of these values to sell out at whatever price they could get. I was pointing out that it might be sound public policy, in order to promote a dense population, to resume large estates in certain localities, near cities or railways, or water works, according to accessibility, fertility or the possibilities of utilization for industrial purposes. On the other hand, a large estate, in a poor, locky, or mountainous country, may be fit only for grazing purposes, and in being so used may be serving the only purpose of which it is capable. .very small. [88]2 The capital value does not diminish or increase in every case, according to the purpose for which the land is being used. But why do the Government want to impose this confiscatory tax upon land which is not fit for disintegration, or not capable of being subdivided?

There are, in New South Wales and Queensland, at any rate, plenty of large estates of, in some cases, 50,000 or 100,000 acres, which are fit only for pastoral solitudes. Yet this tax is intended to come upon those grazing areas where there will never be farmers or orchardists or any form of intense culture. Why, then, do the Government want tp impose this tax in those localities ? As an example, let me cite a case which I sawreported in the papers recently.

278,Sir John Quick,"I have heard ofmortgagees because the mortgagors could not keep up their improvements. What is the use of putting a tax on land so poor as that? The Bill proposes to tax such land at the same rates as the rich land in the Western District of Victoria. the honourable member described it to be, what could we get by taxing it? Nothing. on a valuation of at least ios. or £ i per acre, although the holders are making little or nothing out of it. No consideration is to be shown to struggling pastoralists who own poor land. pastoralists do not buy the worse land on their runs. worse land will be taxed' alike. Why should we tax land which is so poor that it gives hardly any return? We shall not bring about closer settlement by doing so. In the Argus, of 16th August, it is stated that a block of land in Queensland was sold by the Crown at ios. an acre. A firm bought 200,000 acres at that price for grazing purposes, but had to raise £50,000 by way of loan to meet the payments to the Crown. The proposed land tax will mean a charge of £1,550 on the estate, which, at 5 per cent, on the capital value, will reduce the margin from £50,000 to £31,000. We cannot expect to convert that huge block in the wilds of Queensland, fit only for the grazing of cattle and sheep, into areas suitable for closer settlehappy. ment. owner who can afford to pay £100,000 for his land ! firm has bought 200,000 acres from the Crown, and paid £100,000 for the land, it has had to borrow £50,000 j but it will be taxed as though it owed nothing. The honourable member's interjection appeals to prejudice, and not to reason. He would tax men who possibly have as much to do as they can to make both ends meet. Many pastoralists would probably be glad to realize on what Mr Shiels once aptly called their damnosa hcereditas. I am not here to advocate the imposition of any land tax by the Commonwealth. £22,000,000 worth of wool out of Australia every year. vindictive interjection. While the freeholders are to be taxed, pastoralists who lease large areas in Queensland for from i d . to 3d. per acre are not to be taxed. is justifiable, why is discrimination made between the perpetual lessee and the freeholder? Why should the leaseholder', whose interests are practically equivalent to those of a freeholder, escape taxation? Honourable members exclaim about the big freeholder, but why do they not tax the big leaseholder? belongs to the people, that of the freeholder does not. has the use and occupation of the land, and gets the rents and profits obtained from it, on payment of merely an annual rent to the Crown. If we tax the leaseholder, we shall tax his interests, not those of the Crown. member like us to tax the leaseholder? the imposition of any land tax by the Commonwealth; I point out these anomalies so that they may be rectified. If the original intention was merely to tax freeholders, why were we told that the Government intended also to tax leaseholders? Is there a difference of opinion amongst the members of the Labour party, a ""-rift within the lute""? everything will end harmoniously. We are helping the Labour party to remove the angularities, excrescences, and anomalies from its legislation. That is the function of an Opposition. I wish now to make a few remarks 011 another phase of the subject. A great deal has been said on the platform, and in this chamber, about taxing the unearned increment, and when I was a young land reformer, I was spellbound by Mr John Stuart Mill's advocacy of that doctrine. The theory is all very well, but how can you apply it? The right of the State to the value given to its land by the expenditure of the community at large has been used as one of the strongest arguments in favour of land taxation. If Parliament could always get at the original purchaser from the Crown, there might be something more to be said in favour of the theory that the unearned increment should be taken by the State.",50,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales

294,Sir John Quick,"I hope thatBut in almost every' case the original purchaser has long since gone, and his land has passed through a number of hands, the present owners having probably paid its value to the last farthing. Changes in the ownership of land are very frequent, and land is constantly changing hands all over Australia, either as the result of auction sales in the way of that reform, then why do or of private negotiations. This makes it impossible for the State to fairly tax the unearned increment, and by attempting to do so it merely penalizes men who have paid full value for the land which they hold. against a land tax of any kind. is that it is for the State Parliaments to impose land taxation. They can discriminate better than this Parliament can.

If they surrendered to a central legislative authority, such as the Federal Parliament, the powers of lccal self-government and local land reform which they now possess, with any outside body having the right to intrude upon them, they would soon discover their mistake. There would soon be a reaction and a cry in favour of home rule, and for the restoration of those local rights and liberties which had been taken from them by a process of centralization.

310,Sir John Quick,"""Poo r Liberties !""speaks of the political pioneers of Australia as having obtained for the people poor liberties."" What would the people of England, Scotland, and Ireland say if 'they possessed such liberties as we enjoy ? There is only one other feature of this Bill 'to which I desire to draw attention, and that is in relation to self-assessment. Under it every land-owner has to send in a return showing the value of his estate, unimproved and improved. only fair that every owner of a taxable estate should be required to send in a return, it is quite another matter to say that that return shall be utilized for appeal purposes. There are in this Bill two provisions of an extraordinary and drastic character, relating to the manner in which land-owners sending in returns may be 'dealt with. One is that if an owner sends in a return of the unimproved value of his land, and that return, apart from any intention to mislead, proves to be an undervaluation, the Federal Government shall have the option of acquiring his land for iFederal purposes at that valuation. That provision also comes within the denunciation of the amendment; for if not an illegal use of Federal power, it would be an abuse of it. Eveni f we had the power, it would be an abuse of it to provide that because a man sends in a return which happens to be an undervaluation, the Government shall be allowed to say to him: "" Hand over your estate; we will take it at that valuation."" I believe that there was a similar provision in the New Zealand Act; but 1 have been told that under that Act the land-owner had the option of requesting the Government to take over his land at the yaluation which they placed upon it. was, so. some reciprocity of obligation or right in a matter of this kind. If the Government has the right to say to a land-owner: "" We will take your land at your own valuation,"" then the owner, if he disapproves of the Commonwealth valuation of his property, should be able to say: "" I cannot afford to pay this tax; you may take my land at your own valuation."" be unconstitutional. edged sword. unanswerable argument. tution, we have power to take over land only for public purposes. I should like to know how the Government would be able to take over, say, 100,000 acres in the Riverina, for public purposes, merely because the owner had undervalued it. Surely there must be an honest statement of public purposes. There should not be a sham. for public purposes, that power may be properly exercised; but otherwise it will not be exercised. pose for which land is taken over be an honest, bond fide one, such, for instance, as its use as a post-office site purposes. ground. Mr W. J. JOHNSON Or a horsebreeding station. cannot go on multiplying indefinitely tlie public purposes for which land may be acquired. I should be sorry to think that any Government could be suspected of suggesting a public purpose that was not required. There is another provision in this Bill relating to forfeiture, and I ask the Attorney-General, apart altogether from the question of its fairness, to consider its legality.

The provision with reference to self-assessment is a mistake. I believe that in New Zealand it has been found to operate in some cases adversely to the interests of the land-owners, and, in others, adversely to the interests of the Government. The Dominion Government, I understand, have decided to discontinue self-assessment valuations. They have arrived at the conclusion that if the Government desire to tax the people they should take the necessary steps to ascertain the value of property by a legal procedure, and that they should not unnecessarily penalize a man, or ask him to penalize himself, by taking too responsible a part in the work of valuation. a heavier tax to pay for the work of valuing the properties. Government must have in existence all the necessary machinery to test these selfassessments. The land-owner is sufficiently harassed, worried, and penalized by the tax itself, without having imposed upon him this self-condemnatory process of selfvaluation. ally applied in income and land taxation. in New Zealand and found wanting, and I am informed that it has been abolished. It is one of the conspicuous blots on thi.* Bill, and I hope that in Committee it will be removed. I say here, as I have informed my constituents at three successive Federal elections, that I do not, and cannot, believe in Federal land taxation. Land taxation ought to be reserved to the State Parliaments, for they are more competent to deal with it. honestly and fairly desires to raise revenue it should not fix upon a class tax such as this is. This Bill will operate as a tax on a class of free-holders. It will prove a class tax upon a limited section of property-holders. A tax on a special form of landed estates is not justifiable as a tax, apart from the desirability of land reform or land legislation. l f we require revenue for national purposes, we should resort to some form of direct taxation which will reach, not merely one form is the of property, but all forms of realized wealth, which is the true basis of taxation. The principle of our income taxation, under which we receive revenue on the produce or result of personal exertions, as well as of property differentiated, according to value, is one of the fairest of all revenue taxes-som e form of taxation based on realized wealth is the best and fairest. Why should the owner of freehold estates above the value of £5,000, be selected as the victim of Federal taxation, while other men in the community, much richer and better able to bear the burden, are allowed to go scot free? gentleman be satisfied to tax them, too? cating any particular form of taxation, but criticising the Bill, and showing that it is one-sided, based on a desire merely to "" get at"" a certain class of people-no t on a desire to tax wealth as a whole, but to tax a form of wealth as such. Such taxation is unfair and inequitable; and, in the words of the amendment, is "" an abuse of the Federal power."" I , therefore, hope that the amendment will be strongly supported. We are told that this taxation is intended to burst up large, estates; but, so far as South Australia is concerned, everything in reason in that direction has been done for many years past, and land settlement is there progressing very satisfactorily. I am sure other representatives of South' Australia will agree with me that the Government of that State have done every-: thing possible in the way of settling people on the land. member can speak for himself.

I may point out that neither land companies nor absentees enjoy any exemption from income tax under the land taxation of South Australia, but, that, on the contrary, absentees have to pay an additional 20 per cent. 1.5,296,688 acres have been alienated; there are 6,806,467 acres in process of alienation, and 282,878,758 acres leased. In the whole of the Commonwealth only 93,555,767 acres have been sold, while there are in course of alienation a little over much better to turn our attention to pro45,000,000 acres. Under the circumstances, it is not fair to say that there are no more public lands in the Commonwealth for the purposes of settlement. matter of fact, we have as yet only touched the country a few miles from the sea; and I suppose that Australia is the emptiest continent in the whole world, though we all know it is by no means the poorest. been a great change in the manner of estimating the value of Australian land. As the honourable member for Swan pointed out last night-and I do not suppose there is another who knows more about Australia generally-million s of acres, which a fewyears ago were regarded as valueless for settlement, are now occupied at great profit. example of the United States, railways are being pushed out in advance of the people, with excellent results. At present about 300 miles of railway are projected, which will open out about 3,000,000 acres of land for advantageous settlement, and the Government are offering the greatest inducements in the form of varying and convenient leases, and long terms of payment. There is also a system of advances to settlers after they have made certain improvements. In my opinion, a tax such as that proposed should not apply to a State like South Australia, where it will prove very severe on land-owners. My own opinion is that in the case of many of the lands it would be impossible to arrive at the unimproved value, considering that in the grassy fields now presented to view there is nothing to ing to about X5 a n acl ""e in some cases, spent in clearing away the dense bush, stones, and bracken. The honourable member for Angas the other day suggested that it would be fair to allow the original price . of the land to be deducted from the unimproved value; but I remind him that, many years ago, when the land was first thrown open, there was a favourite process of what was called "" killing the squatters."" This meant that the squatter had to go into the market and buy his land; and there were plenty of sharks about to run up the price, and in some cases In Queensland only it would not bring the price to-day.. It is very singular that to-day we should be reversing the process, and in our efforts to "" kill the squatters,"" we should force them to sell the very land which, forty years ago, we forced them to buy. It would be moting railway construction over the big tracts of fertile country, capable of carrying immense populations, instead of imAs a posing a burdensome tax on those who are doing their utmost to develop our land. It has been proved that from Port Augusta to Coolgardie there are very valuable tracts of agricultural and grazing land; and, with the improved methods of water-boring and During recent years there has conservation, areas in Western Australia and in the north of South Australia could be advantageously occupied. It is reported by one of the best authorities in South Australia that there are 16,000,000 acres on the tablelands of the Northern Territory capable of carrying 16,000,000 sheep and growing wheat; and, under such circumstances, the Bill we are now proposing In South Australia, following the seems really ridiculous.

In my own electorate people are spending large sums of money in draining and other improvements, and very shortly, as I have already pointed out, there will be nothing to show what the state of the land originally in quality in each. In South Australia, was. New Zealand is always held up to us as an example, but the land taxation there is a good deal fairer than the proposals in this Bill. The mortgagee there pays Jd. in land tax on his mortgage, and the balance paid by the land-holder is id. In New Zealand they have also no income tax on the produce of land. That seems a little more fair. A great deal is said about the prosperity of New Zealand, and, no doubt, that country has been very prosperous, but why? During the very dry time of 1902-3, New Zealand had a great market for her stock in Australia, and all over the world, and for the past ten years about £18,000,000 to £20,000,000 of borrowed money has been spent in improvements there for the benefit of the country generally. In Australia, we have not been doing anything of that kind, but have been living on our income. We have lost sight of the fact that new methods of farming are being introduced, and one of our senators ought to be thanked for going to the United States, at his own expense, to see what could be done with dry farming. Country in Australia with from 10 to 15 inches of rainfall, that we thought valueless, is now going to turn out first class country. Any number of young men who are starting out in life in Australia ought to try for one of the Government blocks of that land, and use the machinery that is now available to cultivate the soil. In twenty years' time they would have a very valuable property indeed. Therefore, I say a great avenue has been opened up in this country that no man ever expected to see. I do not think it was ever expected that this Bill would apply to municipalities and corporations, and their like. It is absolutely wrong. If it is a measure for bursting up large estates, why should it places in the towns will be very heavily taxed, but at one time they did not think they would be touched. How, under such cirnot, according to the Constitution, discriminate. to settle people on the land, how can the Government burst up the land on which big factories have been built? I know a good deal about the land of Australia, and about Australia generally, and I do not see how it is possible for the Federal Parliament to deal with the land question. No one ever expected it to do so. There are six different States, and the land differs for instance, you may start from Mount Gambier, and, as you go north, find almost every class of land to be discovered in the civilized world. When you get to the middle-north, conditions change; when you go further on to Oodnadatta, they change again; and the same thing applies as you reach the Macdonnell Ranges and the Northern Territory. We, therefore, have a very great area to deal with, under the most diverse conditions. To deal successfully with South Australia alone, it would be necessary to divide the country into six different districts, and I fail to see how all these are to be managed from one point. I think you would have a wholesale muddle, and the Federal Parliament would be very well advised to keep out of it altogether. In fact, I do not think we have any right to touch the question without specially asking the people for authority. I do not think they were ever asked to give this Parliament leave to deal with the land. I never heard of it in my State. No one there had any idea of this Parliament dealing with the lands of Australia. They thought the question should be left to the different States. I am sure if the people had thought that this Parliament would tax the land, they would never have given us the power of direct taxation. Section 114 of the Constitution shows that there is one lot of land which this Parliament cannot tax. I refer to leases which are Crown lands. Unfortunately, we are very badly situated in my State in that regard. We have rightof-purchase leases, covenant-to-purchase leases, and perpetual leases. They all belong to the Crown, especially the right-ofpurchase leases.

351,Mr Livingston,"If the object ishands of the Government at any time, and how can they be taxed? They are neither Crown lands nor freehold, and if we attempt to touch them we shall find ourselves in a very difficult position. We in South Australia have been doing everything in our power to deal with the land in the best interests of the people, and, therefore, we demand special consideration from this Parliament. I should like to hear from the representatives of some of the other States what they have been doing. I know that in some parts of New South Wales and Queensland there is very valuable country, and I am very glad that that is the case. We are told that we are at the beginning of a very big drought. I hope not, but I ' do not think that a drought will ever have the same effect on Australia that it had in the past. We have had too much experience, and our people have been carefully conserving wafer and making provision against times of drought and trouble. Therefore, if we ever see another drought like that of 1902, we shall find our people tery much better prepared to meet it. Instead of taking a lot of land from those who own it, and trying to get more land for the people, I think we shall have millions of acres that we shall want people to go on. I have heard it said that the farmers have not mortgages, but are very rich men. To my knowledge, the farmers are a speculative, enterprising people. 'Directly a man has his farm clear of debt he generally has a son or daughter to whom he wants to give a start, and he gives a mortgage on his farm to help them. place his children on the land. that he should be helped, but as I was saying, he is no sooner out of debt than he finds his little place mortgaged again. I do not think you will find any people in the world more enterprising than the Australian farmers, especially those in South Australia. For several years they faced a drought, but they were always hoping for better times. No one knows them better than the honourable member for Grey, who will tell the House later on about his district. He knows as much about the land in Central Australia as any man in the Commonwealth, and therefore I hope to hear from him an appeal to the Government not to further penalize these people who have been penalized for so many years. Reference was made yesterday to a man and wife being separated, but under this Bill if a man and wife hold separate blocks of land these blocks are to be put together, and the tax is to be imposed on them as one lot. That is not fair, because, in our State, and in others, married women can hold property. Up to the present this tax has not been specially wanted. If the Government were hard up for money I am sure that not a member of the House would say a word against it. I do not think any people in the world would respond more cheerfully to taxation than the people of Australia if it was absolutely necessary. The odier day the honourable member for Parkes pointed out that the way in which the Government were seeking to raise money was much dearer than the floating of a loan, and I have not yet heard hisfigurescontradicted. I hope the Treasurer will take them into consideration, and if he finds that the honourable member for Parkes is right, he should say so in the interests of Australia. If he is wrong, the Treasurer should point it out, because it should not go forth to the world that the Federal Parliament are raising money by a land tax when they could raise it much cheaper by a loan. I do not think any one can say that the Australian Parliaments have wasted the money that they have borrowed. They have raised millions of pounds, and spent it all on railways, roads, telegraphs, telephones, bridges, big water conservation schemes, and other reproductive works, of which we are very proud. Those .ire a splendid asset for this country, and if we had not had legislators game enough to borrow money in the early days we should not be in this House to-day. The blacks would still be in evidence. Do honourable members think that the people of to-day are not as good as the people of forty years ago? They ought to be more competent, because they have more appliances, and why should they be afraid to launch out, and build a railway to Western Australia, and another to the Northern Territory ? afraid. We are going to build it. We want to get a uniform gauge first. agree with the Minister of Home Affairs, that we should have a proper railway gauge throughout Australia, and have it very quickly. I endorse his recent statement, that you cannot handle troops effectively without a uniform gauge.

I should like to be shown what power he has to make adjustments also said the Government were going to bring people here in the proper way. Nobody would be more glad than myself to see that done, but it would not be treating the people themselves fairly to buy land for them, build houses on it, clear it, and provide water, as the honourable member suggested. That sort of thing would cost millions of pounds. I do not object to building houses for them, but why not let them clear the land themselves? _ That would give them work to do immediately, and they could gradually make homes tor themselves. condition in some parts of Australia. so in Western Australia, but we are not quite so liberal in our State. The States could manage the immigration business much better than the Commonwealth. They could do it according to local conditions, and deal with the people as they entered Australia on much better terms than we could through a central body like the Federal Parliament. To deal with those people, and look after them, we should require an army of inspectors. Instead of the people getting the benefit of the system, that would go entirely to those employed in administering the law, and the system would prove so costly that it would break down. I know a great deal about the conditions of those on the land. Every one seems to think that a man has_ only to take up land to make a good living, but one cannot do well on the land without a great deal of experience, pluck, and capital. The States have endeavoured to assist land settlement by providing for the time-payment of purchase money, and those who know South Australia are aware that land-holders there have never been turned off land on which they were residing with their families, even when they have been as much as six years in arrears with their payments. No doubt the State Government will be as lenient in the future as it ""has been in the past. I might mention, too, that the arrears of payments in respect of re-purchased land amount to only £400, which is creditable both to the Government and to the people. These facts show that it is reasonable to leave the management of the land to the Governments and Parliaments of the States. I was pleased to hear the Attorney General say that trustees and beneficiaries will not be affected by the Bill. The Attorney-General Mr W. H . IRVINE -That does not appear so from the measure itself. ment will make tlie intention perfectly, clear. It was pointed out the other day, that if two persons held shares in an estate, and one lived in England and the other in Australia, both would be treated as absentees. I am glad to know from the Attorney-General that that is not intended, and I am sure that he will see that the Bill is altered to prevent it. The honourable member stated, too, that he intended to tax all who had interests in land, which would have been very drastic.' But section 114 of the Constitution seems to prevent it, because it says that the Commonwealth shall not "" impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.'' It is clear that we cannot tax Crown lands, though we may be able to tax perpetually leased lands, or land leased subject to the right of purchase. I do not think the land-owners should be compelled to send in valuations of their land every year. We have had great trouble in South Australia' in getting people to make out income tax returns yearly, and I do not think that any Government should have the right to take land from an owner. The Bill, however, puts on every land-holder the onus of declaring its value, and gives the Commonwealth the right to take it at his valua-: tion. We do not believe in confiscation, and should not seem to provide for it in any measure that we may pass. Such a provision would make the people frightened, and I trust that the Government will amend the Bill to prevent this. The Attorney-General told us that the Commonwealth has power to take land for any purpose, but I think that it can resume land only for specific purposes connected with administration. We have made a lot of mistakes in Australia . regarding land matters. In the early days in South Australia there was a.great clamour for taking away land from the men who then occupied it.

358,Mr Livingston,"Then the Govern-:expressed the opinion that it was unfit for closer settlement. I am sorry to say that my report was justified. I travelled from Port Augusta to beyond Mount Eba.

I am sorry to hear that they could not live on it, and the Government came to the rescue. No one did more to bring that land into proper occupation again than the honourable member for Grey, who by dint of hard work, and years of effort, convinced the Parliament that the original occupiers had been harshly treated. Fair leases were therefore granted again, and the country was fenced to permit of the destruction of vermin. The honourable member, no doubt, is proud of what he did, and the people have been proud of him. Indeed, he has never yet had to contest his seat for this Parliament, and I hope that he never will have to do so. pleasure to hearing him speak on this measure. The buying of land is a very dangerous thing. Many of the early pioneers were absolutely ruined by it. My good old father happened to be one of the first. He bought at very high prices, thinking, as others did, that the value of the land would increase by leaps and bounds; but bad times came, and the old settlers were nearly all wiped out. It may be information for honourable members to know that from the Murray, following the coast line to Port Melbourne, you will not find a descendant of the old pioneers in possession of the land which they took up, with the exception of Mr Sutton, of the Dismal Swamp station. That fact disproves the assertion that the Australians have gone in for accumulating estates. It is not so. Like their forefathers they are wanderers. The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows well the district which I represent, and in the early days assisted me in getting a Bill passed through Parliament to drain part of it to make it more fertile. He also helped me to improve a block in the Glencoe district, and, with his assistance, we got the first piece of railway started that had been made there for twenty years. the same thing again. would do all he could to advance the interests of Australia. him on this Bill. him again, and he will talk some good, sound sense. He does not generally speak nonsense. The honourable member for Robertson says that we are not going to stop at the present tax; that it will go up said. In South Australia we already have a land tax, various local taxes, and an income tax, and we shall be in a bad position if we have a Federal land tax in addition. Australia has never been more prosperous than it is to-day, and I hope that its prosperity will continue. Although some have described it as a barren desert, it is a beautiful country, and, in my opinion, the finest in the world. Up to the present time it has been well governed, and I hope that nothing will be done to a fleet its reputation for good government. I am sure that if the Leader' of the House thought that the tax would injure the credit of Australia. I look forward with for good legislation, he would give way in regard to it. He is a good Scotchman, and admittedly one of the most straightforward men in the Commonwealth, and would not, in my opinion, put his position before the interests of the people. We, in Australia, understand tbe climate better now than we did years ago, ancl our experience enables us to make better use of our opportunities. We have in existence at the present time enough legislative machinery to provide, not only for our present population, but for all who may come here during the next fifty years. Whatever some honourable members may say as to our large landholders, I have no hesitation in declaring that we are very much indebted to them. They have spent large sums in the development of the country, and in many ways have been of great advantage to the Commonwealth. They have imported the very 'best strains of live stock, with the result that we have in Australia to-day the finest flocks and herds to be found in any part of the world. We should be very careful not to do anything that may damage the national credit. There can be no doubt that this Bill, if passed, will damage the credit of Australia, and I hope, therefore, that before attempting to penalize the landowners as a body by the imposition of this 'ax, the Parliament will decide to consult the people. Our land-owners have paid for their land, the States have been paid to the last shilling, and if they ha\e not spent the money so obtained to the best advantage in opening up and developing the",58,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales

Since it was decided to introduce this Bill, an estate in my district has been sold for £26,000 to a speculator, who has informed the tenants that he is going to subdivide it, and is willing to sell to them on terms. He had arranged a fortnight ago to sell a third of the property in this way for £13,000, and if he sells the balance to the same advantage, he will receive £39,000 for what he paid only £26,000, although probably the value of the land, when the tenants entered into possession of it, did not exceed £10,000. piobably have to wait twenty or thirty years for his money, and tenants do not always pay. member hold that such transactions are justifiable?

415,Mr Charlton,"I did advocate the Oppositionstage to pronounce a definite opinion, because, although I have studied it very carefully, there are considerable portions whose legal effect I have utterly failed to understand. BeforeI sit down, I shall draw the attention of the Attorney-General to a few of the difficulties which I have discovered. I admit, not only that we have the fullest power of taxation, but that there sion to which I have referred. Apart from is no authority-not even the High Courtwhich can inquire into our motives in imposing taxation. There is no authority which can say, "" You are going too far,"" no matter how cruel, unjust, or oppressive our tax may be. Even if it deprived men of their means of living, there is no authority which could say, "" You must not do that."" But the rule has been laid down by the High Court, following the traditions of generations of lawyers who have lived under the Constitution of the United States of America, which is similar to ours, that in order to determine whether a measure is an exercise of the taxing power you are not bound by the fact that Parliament has called it a taxation Act. The Attorney General stated the position very clearly. He pointed out that the Court is not bound by the declaration of Parliament. though an Act is called a taxation Act, the Court may go beyond it, and inquire into the substance, nature, and character of its provisions. But its intention is to be drawn, not from the declarations of members, as reported in the pages of Hansard, nor from the manifestoes of party leaders, but from the actual purposes of its provisions. If this examination proves it to be a taxing Act, it cannot be pronounced invalid, whatever effect it may have. That is the law as laid down in the case of The King versus Barger. Although in that case an Act purported to be an exercise of the taxing power in regard _to a matter exclusively within the right of this Parliament to legislate upon, the imposition of duties of Customs and Excise, and was stated to be an exercise of that power, the Court held, and, in my opinion, properly, that in view of the real purpose and object of the measure, the thing aimed at, and, in fact, achieved, showed it to be, not a taxing Act, but an Act to regulate the industrial conditions of a certain section of the people. I do not say that this measure will fall under that decision. Without pronouncing an absolute opinion, my opinion is rather the other way. But I would remind honourable members that, when they set out to do something not permitted to Parliament under the Constitution, under Mr W. H. Irvine. the guise of doing something which is permitted, they are treading on very dangerous ground, and have to consider very carefully the real or main effect and purpose of their legislation. They must frame their measure very carefully, and have regard to all its consequences, direct and indirect, if they wish to escape the effects of the decicertain provisions which I hope will receive a much fuller explanation from Ministers than has yet been given, I do not know that this measure falls within the decision given in the case of The King versus Barger. No doubt we shall hear a great deal more about certain of its provisions. Passing away from the constitutional point, I wish to say a few words regarding the merits of the proposal. I have always thought, and am still of opinion, that of all forms of direct taxation, the taxation of the unimproved value of land is one of the most just, provided that it be well within the limits of taxation in the ordinary sense, and be adopted as one of the modes of imposing upon the whole of the citizens a fair share of the burden of maintaining the public revenues. Even We are assured by honourable member after honourable member on the other side that not only have they a mandate from the country in favour of the principle of land taxation, but a mandate from the country to pass this Bill. Their claim that they are not only justified in proposing, but are compelled to carry forward a particular measure, because there is a mandate from the country for it, is in one sense absolutely true. But in what sense are they about to carry out that mandate from the country ? To admit that a mandate from the people is to compel the Parliament to pass a particular measure, even if that measure had been discussed before the country, is practically to subordinate this Legislature to the position of a mere registering machine. It is practically to subordinate it to the position of a machine for the registration of the generally loose expressions of promises and pledges made from the platforms of Australia. If honourable members say that that is the meaning of a mandate from the country in regard to any measure, they absolutely degrade Parliament from the position of a deliberative assembly, bound to listen to debate and to consider objections, to that of a mere penny-in-the-slot machine. on the principle.",66,Supply Formal Fusion Party Publi C Servants Griev Ances Cronull A And Kogarah Tele Phone Old Ag E Pensions Posta L Department New South Wales
416,Mr Archibald,"We can get a mandateMr W. H . IRVINE I agree with the honourable member, and it is only to that extent that either side of the House should consider itself, bound by any mandate. Otherwise they must degrade the whole functions of Parliament. the authority of Parliament as a deliberative assembly, in any constitutionally-governed community, we do nothing to strengthen Democracy. We may do something to hasten the immediate fulfilment of some of the desires of the more extreme people on the side of Democracy, but we do much to weaken the very functions of Democracy itself. of the initiative in the referendum? Mr W. H . IRVINE I have always been opposed to the initiative. There is a great deal to be said in favour of one kind of referendum, but that is a matter which I shall not be allowed to discuss at this stage. I have referred to this phase of the question because it has been said over and over again that there is a mandate from the people in favour of this Bill. If I might be permitted to express very humbly to Ihonorable members opposite-and no doubt they are now our masters, for they are in power on occasions does not express himself very humbly. Mr W. H . IRVINE I feel humble. He is a foolish man who will not give ear to the logic of facts. The facts in this case are apparent. The Government and their supporters, having a large majority, are entitled to claim that that majority represents opinions to which effect must be given by this Parliament. We are entitled to say that they come here with a mandate from the people. The only question is as to what is the proper interpretation of that mandate. as to that? Mr W. H . IRVINE -To a certain extent there cannot. Looking at the platform speeches and at the manifesto of the Labour party at the last general election, we must admit that they have a right to claim that they come here with a mandate from the people to impose a tax on unimproved -land values. Before we can arrive at any business-like understanding as to what is our position as an Opposition-befor e we can fairly claim consideration-w e have to admit the plain facts of the political situation. The proposal for a tax on the unimproved value of land was placed in the very forefront of the Labour party's programme, and we know that they were returned with a very large majority. That must be admitted, but it is not an unfair addendum to say to the Government, "" Your supI n weakening porters, who gave you that mandate, were mainly influenced by a desire, not so much to obtain revenue, as that land at present suitable for settlement should be made available for that purpose. Assuming that all those whom you represent did authorize you to impose a tax on the unimproved value of land, and did so mainly, if not entirely, with a view to the breaking up of large estates, we must admit that there were two different classes from whom, that mandate proceeded. A very large section of your supporters were not regular adherents of your party. You have a right to claim that they supported your platform, but they were not official members of your party or in. any way bound to it."" The only mandate that they gave with regard to land taxation was, I think, that a reasonable tax should be imposed on unimproved land values for the purpose, it may be, of breaking up large estates. effective in breaking up large estates. That is what we proposed. Mr W. H . IRVINE -T O that extent, I -think that the Government may claim that they have a mandate from the people. But there is another section which supported the Labour party to whom I must refer. I do not think that it includes anything like the regular supporters of the party. Honourable members opposite are better judges than I am in that regard, but I imagine that it includes only a small section of their direct supporters, and they supported this mandate for the reason that they viewed it as the first gun in the war of confiscation against all rights of property. tion "" ? Should not the honourable member rather speak of the ""nationalization"" of lands ? Mr w . H . IRVINE -But there are two ways of nationalizing anything. The one is to take a thing and pay for it honestly, and the other is to take it and not pay a penny for it. The word "" nationalization "" is rather too wide, because it includes the honest and the dishonest method.

IRVINE I venture to say that it is not the same measure. The present rate was not then suggested, though the rate then was an extremely high one. But even if it were the same measure, are the mouths of honourable members to be closed ? Are honourable members behind the Government not prepared to listen to arguments as to the effects of such a measure ? Mr VV. H . IRVINE -Just to test the , character of this measure, may I ask what honourable members opposite would do to gain the object they have in view, supposing we possessed the unlimited constitutional power? Would they not point to a large number of estates, which, though only a small portion of the country, are still considerable in themselves, and which are now being shepherded for future values, and say that the first step was to ascertain what lands capable of supporting families were not being put to their proper use ? It cannot be suggested that all the lands over £5,000 in value in one holding are in that condition. If our hands were free to deal with this problem, as thoroughly and drastically as we like, but justly and fairly, would honourable members opposite not adopt the suggestion of several speakers on this side, and appoint some official body to classify the land ? 1 may be permitted to point to the fact that I was the first to propose the policy of compulsory resumption in Victoria, a policy which has since been adopted. I recognised that even in Victoria there were numbers of land-owners who failed in their obvious duty to the State by holding back land which could be put to much better uses. member was first returned to Parliament, was he not returned as a land taxer? Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is so. The land tax then introduced was one of id. in the £ 1 on the unimproved value, coupled with an income tax. I thoroughly approved of the principle, provided there were no exemptions, although I represented a farming district, and said I would support the tax; but when the farmers insisted on exemptions I voted against the third reading of the measure. I believed then, as I do now, in a tax on unimproved land values, and should not object if it is the same as the were graduated considerably. However, this is a digression.. Suppose we had the power to do what admittedly the other side are really aiming ,at, namely, to exert pressure on those people who are holding back their lands unjustifiably, should not we, as reasonable men, regard it as a delicate operation that we had to perform? In that, as in the case of every operation, proper, instruments are necessary; and because we have not a lancet to cut out the particular portion diseased, are we to use a butcher's cleaver? If this Parliament possessed the real power, should we not, by a Commission of inquiry, or some other means, endeavour to ascertain what lands were being withheld near centres of population and railway communication, and sufficiently well watered for the purposes of closer settlement ? Should we not, under such circumstances, give the owner of the land time, no matter how short, to turn round and get rid of his land? If a man did not then do his duty to the State, I should not have the slightest objection to a penal tax. course be pursued constitutionally? Mr W. H . IRVINE -No; if the honourable member had followed me he would see that I am supposing we had the unlimited constitutional power. power. Mr VV. H . IRVINE -That is true; and, to some extent, it is an answer. Not having the constitutional power to do what is right, it is proposed, in order to do a little right, to do a great wrong, which happens to be within our constitutional power. Is there not a good deal in the argument that if we desire to have the power, we ought to go to the source of it, the people, and ask for it? now in this matter. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think the honourable member was not present when 1 dealt with that phase of the question; and I cannot now repeat my argument.

That which is unjust as applied to a poor man, is also unjust as applied to a rich man; the line of justice and injustice does not stop at £0,000. in the case of the income tax? Mr W. H .

We may have the power to do what is proposed; but I say again that the Government have no mandate for this extreme measure. A number of instances have been pointed out where this tax will operate with sledgehammer force on people, both rich and poor, whose interests are guaranteed by the laws of the country. I know of a case in which a number of people advanced money in small amounts to a Victorian company, and during the boom time lost three-fourths of their capital. It is true that most of those people, though not all, live in the Old Country. As to the remaining fourth of the money, a company was formed for the purpose of saving what they could out of the wreck.

Many of them are trustees representing children; many of them, as the share list shows, are widows.

440,Mr Hughes,"In what respect is thisMr W. H . IRVINE I shall deal with that directly, also. I am telling the honourable member facts which he cannot deny or disprove. I challenge him to do it. All he can do is to attempt a justification of them. If the Government bring forward a tax on land for the purpose of getting revenue and couple it, as they ought in all reason to do, with an income tax, or some other form of taxation that would draw moneys from other sections of the community-if it is revenue they want, no person could object to it, and I , for one, would welcome the particular incidence in that direction of a tax on the unimproved value of land. But they bring down this sledge hammer, smashing not only the small -evil that they want to deal with, but doing infinite damage to hundreds and thousands of other people. member call it a small evil? Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is small in comparison with the evil they are creating, and it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways. It would be a great thing if we could adopt just legislation that would compel those who are holding back lands suitable for closer settlement to throw them open to those who are willing to take them. I am not going to say a word against that, but honourable members must know that this country, like every other country of the same' kind, goes through one particular course of development. In the earlier times and in the outlying districts land is always taken up in large areas, and always put to inferior uses. Some holders succeed and some do not; some make large fortunes, others do not. Those who have the courage and energy to throw their money and lives into the enterprise often make large fortunes, if they are lucky, and leave them to their children. Usually the result is that, as roads and railways are made and larger markets opened, these lands gradually pass into other hands. Some of them do not. You cannot alter that genera] condition of development in Australia. You find outlying districts which are too remote for small farming settlement being developed first in large holdings which involve a large expenditure of capital and give large returns, but involve great risk. As population proceeds, towns develop, and new means of communication are opened up, these holdings become gradually absorbed, but sometimes, I admit, too slowly. That is the evil. Near certain centres it often happens that glaring cases are seen, and people are misled by seeing unutilized a large tract of land suitable for closer settlement at no great distance from railways and considerable population. They say, "" There is an evil. If we once had such land thrown open everybody would be happy."" But, although you may deal with those glaring cases in a just way, you cannot alter the general mode by which the development of a country like this progresses. It is really only in the cases which you find on the border-line between the pioneering work and the closer settlement already existing that there is any room for the bursting up of large estates. It is simply nonsense to talk about bursting up large estates, in many parts of the Riverina, in Queensland, or in Western Australia. You may achieve it in one sense. You may render it impossible or unprofitthe honourable able for the people to expend their energies or money there any longer. But you do not burst the estates up, because nobody will take the land. In order to get people there you must do a great deal more than impose a tax. You must bring railways-per haps water-and roads, and schools to them. You must bring all the means of ordinary habitation to them before you can render such areas available for settlement. The interjection of the honourable member for Gwydir led me into that digression. The state of things to which I have referred is in one sense a great evil, but it is not great in comparison. It is only to a small portion of the land that this great weapon ought to be applied. It ought to be applied to it in a way that would hit where the evil is, and not cause damage all round. There are provisions in this Bill which seem to me most extraordinary. There is the provision making mortgagors liable for the whole taxation. Just think of the ""position ! occupation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes j I am referring to the debtor. If the mortgagee goes into occupation he makes himself"" liable for the tax, and I do not object to that. In connection with companies with the management of which I happen to be connected, I know of many hundred's of cases of people whose interests-ofte n family interests divided between a number of people-ar e solely what is called the equity of redemption-interest s in property which is mortgaged up to 60, 70, or even a higher percentage.

442,Mr Archibald,"When they are inthose people, who are only receiving comparatively small returns after the payment of interest; who are receiving, in fact, a mere margin. That is another provision by which the Government will do wholesale injury unless they greatly modify it.

In country districts, too, the Government will, by this means, do widespread wrong and injury to.hundreds of families, and these not rich people, but people who are depending for their support upon what they get as mortgagors.

Clause 33 saysThe joint owners sliall be jointly assessed, and liable in respect of the land as if it were owned by a single peTson, without regard to their respective interests therein, and without taking into account any land owned by any one of them in severalty, or as joint owner with any other person.

Then comes this wonderful provision, to which we have the key in clause 39The joint owners in respect of their joint assessment shall be deemed to be the primarytaxpayer, and each joint owner in respect of his separate assessment to be a secondary taxpayer; and for the tax payable, in respect of his interest in the land, by each joint ownerthat would be each shareholderunder the last preceding sub-section, there shall be deducted such amount (if any) as is necessary to prevent double taxation.

Clause 37 says ber is going further than is permissible on the motion for a second reading. Mr W,. H . IRVINE I bow to your ruling, sir, and shall be very happy to mention my difficulties to the Attorney General in private. I thought that it would save time to discuss these matters before going into Committee. I shall conclude by saying that I sincerely hope that Ministers will not shut their ears, to the reof revenue. I could not conceive of a man presentations from this side of the Chamber; that -they .will ibe prepared, even though it should mean the modification of their rates, to make the measure less hurtful, cruel, and oppressive than it is. They cannot claim the mandate of the people for the rates, and we on this side are unable to do more than put before them what we deem to be the interests of those who are, ns we think, unjustly affected. shall have no opportunity in Committee to make my position in regard to the Bill clear, I must take this occasion to speak. I have advocated progressive land taxation during the whole course of my political life, so that in supporting the BillI am not inconsistent. The proposal may be spoken of as the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge, but, unless the people declare for it, the exemption of £5,000 cannot be reduced. The Bill must do a great deal for the settlement of the people on the land. I shall leave its constitutional aspects to the legal members of the House. Its practical effect must be to bring about the subdivision of large estates. The agencies for land settlement to-day are the Governments of the six States, but when the Bill has been passed every man possessing taxable land will become an instrument for settling people on it. He must do that in his own interests. As the result, thousands of persons will be settled in the country. Is it likely, if that result is brought about, that there will be any cry for a reduction of the exemption? History repeats itself, and the honourable member for Wakefield will remember the time when, in South Australia, we gave a number of small men-""blockers "" they were called-smal l leaseholds. Not long afterwards, these men, who had been placed on what were known as workmen's blocks, threw in their lot with those who desired the right of purchase, and they obtained that right. way. same experience under this Bill. With closer settlement we shall be prevented from reducing the exemption. I regard this measure as being inseparable from the questions of immigration and defence, and its introduction is justified if for no other reason than that of providing for the defence of Australia. We shall derive from it for a considerable time a large amount objecting to assist in the defence of his country, and those who have valuable possessions ought not to object to bear their fair share of the taxation necessary to provide for it. Under our present fiscal policy the whole of the cost of the defence of Australia is being provided for out of the revenue obtained from Customs and Excise duties, and the average family of the poor man has thus to contribute more than it ought to be expected to do. We have gone so far as to provide for compulsory service, and I do not think that we are asking too much when we call upon those who have great possessions to contribute something towards the cost of the system. I am, therefore, inagreement with the main principle of the Bill. At the same time, I do not approve of all its details. I regret very much that those who framed it should have got away from the beaten track by failing to recognise that only the registered owner of land should be responsible for the payment of the tax. The moment we provide, as we do under this Bill, that a lessee may be taxed under certain conditions, we step on to dangerous ground. We have had a Land Values Assessment Act in operation in South Australia for many years, and I have not heard of any serious difficulties arising under it. I certainly have not heard of attempts being made to evade it by undervaluations of property; and I believe, as I have told the Attorney-General, that the Government would have followed a simpler and an easier course had they determined that the recognised registered owner should be the person taxable under this Bill. That principle, however, has been departed from. I submitted certain cases, by way of illustration, to the Attorney-General, and I am not satisfied, from the answer I have received from him, that fair play is to be",74,Foster Th E Trustee Payable By The Secondary Taxpayer Is Increased

459,Mr Poynton,"We shall have themeted out to lessees. I would remind honourable members that in all our large cities, buildings-som e of them five and six stories high--ar e erected on land which is leased, in some cases, for only twenty-one or twenty-eight years. The ground rent paid does not represent the economic value of the land; but under this Bill, if the unimproved value of the property exceeds £5,000, then the lessee will have to pay a proportion of the tax. I inquired from the Attorney-General whether, in computing the lessee's interest, as compared with lhat of the lessor, the Department would take into consideration the buildings erected on land rented on such short leases. The class of building to be erected is always taken into consideration when the ground rent is being fixed. For instance, a man who proposed to erect a substantial fivestory building would pay less ground rent than would a man who proposed to erect one of only three stories; and we cannot honestly compute the proportion of tax payable as between the lessor and the lessee, unless the value of these buildings, when the leases fall in, are to be taken into consideration. Like the honourable member for Flinders, I take exception to that part of the Bill which relates to mortgagees and mortgagors. understand that the reason why the mortgagee is not held to be responsible for the payment of the tax is because it is contended that a man who subdivides an estate and sells it on easy terms should not be penalized by being charged on the accumulated mortgage. But will such an argument apply to a mortgage on city property ? Can there be in any city such a subdivision of an estate as would justify freeing mortgagees from the payment of the tax and placing the whole burden on the mortgagors? I come now to the question of penalties, and I fully recognise that provision must be made for drastic penalties for fraudulent evasions. We find in one part of this Bill a provision that the Governor General shall have power to take over land at the valuation placed upon it by the owner where it is considered that there has been an under-valuation. That is as severe a penalty as we ought to provide for. The New Zealand Act gave the Government power to take over a property at the valuation placed upon it by the owner, plus 10.per cent., but that is not to be done in this case. I take strong exception to clause 67, for which no justification can, in my opinion, be found. As it stands, it provides for the forfeiture of the land where there has been a fraudulent under-valuation. The Attorney-General, if I understand him aright, proposes to modify that provision by providing that no forfeiture shall take place except by direction of the High Court. Having regard to the other penalties that may be imposed in respect of the same offence, I think that that provision is too drastic. In the first place, a man may be fined £500, and called upon to pay treble taxation, where he is held to have under-valued his property, and, thereafter, absolute forfeiture may take place. Such a penalty is far too extreme. I think it would act as a sufficient deterrent against under-valuations to provide that the Crown may be at liberty to take over land at the valuation placed upon it by the owner, plus 10 per cent. I wish now to point out how these provisions may affect innocent beneficiaries under a will. Many estates are administered by trustees, some of whom, in their efforts to economize, might be guilty of an under-valuation, and, although the beneficiaries might be perfectly innocent, they would have no redress. I ber really believe that they would have no redress ? would be held responsible for the acts of their agents. opportunity of stating their case. member point to a similar provision in any Act of Parliament? While I believe that the imposition of such a tax as this is in the interests of Australia, I do not desire to see it accompanied by such penal provisions as we find in the Bill. It is set out very clearly in one of the clauses that trustees under wills are to be held responsible and taxable on the full value of the estates. We know, however, that there are some cases in which five or six members of a family each have an interest, ancl that, under' the will, the estate is not to be divided until the youngest comes of age. I contend that such an estate should not be taxable, but should really be regarded as representing separate estates. I am very glad that the Government have abandoned their proposals to tax Crown leases.

464,Mr Palmer (Echuca) [9.55],"Thissirion to it. In the course of his utterance, the honourable gentleman saidI t is hardly necessary to remind honourable members that ""practically ""the whole of the public for the State Governments to become land agents estate is in the hands, and under the control, of the State Parliaments and Governments. That fact cannot be gainsaid, and it leads us to question how much this Bill is likely to interfere with that state of affairs? The land is vested in the State Governments and but we come along with a tax, suitable to the view of the majority of the members of this House, of such a nature that it takes away from the States the land control which the Prime Minister says ""s vested in them, and which they otherwise would exercise. The Premier of Victoria had to tell a deputation yesterday that, iu consequence of the land taxation proposals of the Federal Government interfering with the State's possibilities of revenue from land, he was compelled to give them an unfavorable reply. The proposal contained in this Bill supersedes the right of the States to determine their own land policy, and it was clearly evidenced in the Prime Minister's speech that that would be so. The honourable member stated that every State in the Commonwealth, except Queensland, had its land tax. With regard to Victoria, he addedbut a Bill is under consideration for a graduated tax on unimproved values starting at ^d. in the ; f i from £500 to ,£2,500, gradually rising until if it were not effective there 'would be a it amounts to 3d. on estates valued at ^80,000 and upwards. The feeling in the minds of honourable members opposite seems to be "" Who is to get in first with the land tax ? "" The whole tenor of the Prime Minister's speech was t;> show that the States were absolutely dead so far as their land taxation proposals were concerned, ancl that because the States were failing in their duty in this respect, the Federal Government were justified in stepping in. policy of several of the States. l t is a definite policy, which, although not perfect, is securing a considerable amount of advantage to the public in the way of land settlement, but the Prime Minister questioned its wisdom. The State Premiers are in an infinitely better position to determine what is a wise land policy for their various States than is the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. Prime Minister's speech to show that they are not. They are by no means failing to do their duty. The Prime Minister saidI have grave doubts whether it is desirable for the re-purchase and re-sale of lands. He does not approve of their policy, and thinks he can do better. The policy of Victoria and New South Wales, and, I think, South Australia, is to purchase lands, cut them up into small holdings, settle Parliaments, people on them, and find the settlers money to go on with. With that policy the Prime Minister disagrees; but what does he propose to substitute for it? He says it will not be as effective as it should be in bursting up large estates, and therefore he resorts to a policy of taxing the value out of the land in order that the Government may practically confiscate it. I do not believe the people are behind the Government in a desire to confiscate the property of any member of the community. Excessive taxation, calculated to greatly reduce the capital value of a man's property, amounts to confiscation, call it what you like. One course is to re-purchase, and that is being pursued by the States -The other is to confiscate, and that is proposed by this Government. I am almost ashamed to be a. member of a House where a proposal is made to confiscate the rights of any man The Prime Minister asserts that the policy of purchase is not effective. I admit that strong argument for adopting another course, but I have only to refer to the Prime Minister's speech to show that it is effective. He saidIn South Australia the Government has repurchased lands with the greatest advantage to settlement. That does not show failure. It rather shows that what South Australia is doing is in the interests of the very thing which the Government say they favour. The He referred to the land Prime Minister went further, and saidThe same remark annlies to the State in which we are meeting (Victoria). Is that not eminently satisfactory?

478,Mr Palmer,"I venture to say thattime. If the large estates are being cut up, as these facts show, where is tlie necessity to resort to this drastic and dangerous proceeding? The number of holdings of 320 acres has, during the r-ame period, been increased by 2,637. That is largely the result of the policy which the Prime Minister condemns. The honourable gentleman challenges the wisdom of that policy; but I say that a policy which can secure such results is a satisfactory one. I venture to say, also, that, as a result of the important mission of the Victorian Minister of Lands to the Old Country, and the representations made there, we shall in' this State witness astonishing developments in the almost immediate future. I hope that we shall shortly find an important part of the district which I represent, the Goulburn valley, become a veritable Garden of Eden, occupied by men and women of the highest type. this tax has operated for a little while. the lands to which. I refer to any material extent. The large estates in that district are being cut up, because the irrigation policy of the State of Victoria makes it impossible for them to continue to be held, in large holdings There has been a total increase in the number of holdings in the last ten years of 6 per cent. Surely these facts prove that the settlement of Australia is proceeding at a fairly rapid pace, in view of the fact that immigration has for some time almost been stagnant. Every one, I am sure, is pleased to notice that there is now ah influx of people to Australia. I hope the volume of immigration will increase, and that I shall live to see the time when the population of Australia will be at least double what it is to-day. The arguments which .were used by the Prime Minister in support of this Bill are the arguments which I have used to-hight in opposing it. The honourable gentleman contended that the area of land under cultivation in Australia had decreased. He wished to show that the owners. of land had not been making tbe best use of it.' There is one reason why,, in some places, land has gone out' of cultivation. The export of lambs and the exceedingly good prices that have been ruling for wool have induced a considerable number of personsto go in for sheep breeding rather than the cultivation of the soil. If in some of the States there has-been a decrease'in the amount of cultivation, I [89] bave stated the rational explanation of it. I think that the Prime Minister was scarcely fair to the House in this matter. He stated a part of the truth, as though it were the whole truth. He gave the figures for three States in which there bad been a decrease in agricultural holdings. In New South Wales he said there had been a decrease to the extent of 123,000 acres; in Queensland 30,000 acres and in South Australia 47,000 acres-mak r ing a total of about 200,000 acres decrease. On the other hand, he was good enough to mention that in Western Australia there had been an increase of land in agricultural occupation of 383,000 acres. I amivery, glad to-know that Western Australia is making satisfactoryprogress in that direction, and' that she is inducing people to come out and settle her great territory. But why did not the Prime Minister give the figures regarding Victoria and Tasmania? In Tasmania there has been an increase of 40,000 acres in the same period, whilst in Victoria there has been an increase of 226,000 acres. Thus we have a total increase in three States of 654,000 acres, against a much smaller decrease in the other three States. In the aggregate there has been an increase in Australia of 454,000 acres. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, the total increase .during five years amounts to 527,000 acres. It would be an exceedingly strong argument in favour of this Billi f it could be shown that there was no land suitable and available for settlement. If that could be shown, I should whole-heartedly accord my .support to the measure, in spite of my preconception that the States ought to have land taxation committed to them.' But is it true that there is no land available? Mr J. H . CATTS -Why are Victorian fanners going to Queensland ? They have been accustomed to farming large holdings, and now that they see it is inevitable' that large holdings will be subdivided,' they are goingto Queensland, where they can obtain larger holdings. The Prime Minister Himself admitted that there is suitable land available for settlement in this country. He was good enough to sayI wish to indicate (hat not only have we a country containing good land and enjoying a fairrainfall, but that we have good land in latitudes that in other countries are practically uninhabited by white persons.

Although it is in that »one, from time to time public men who have travelled through Australia have declared that it is marvellously adapted for settlement.

I can name stations in western New South Wales where persons can go and take up land on resumed areas. The honourable members opposite can get information to that effect from the Lands Office in Sydney. The Prime Minister was not satisfied with making a general statement, but he supplied the House with details. He -quoted a table of figures containing this important information. In Australia we have lands alienated, 91,693,000 acres; lands in process of alienation, .38,199,000 acres; total, 129,892,000 acres. are lands under lease, which leases will fall due in time and be available for the public forty years. the resumed areas may be taken up to-day. 'wrong about that. lutely correct. Under lease we have 787,000,000 acres; unoccupied, 986,000,000 acres. There is an immense area of land still owned and controlled by the State Go'vernments. Some of it is leased, but the major portion of it is absolutely unoccupied. I venture to say that in fifty years or so the major portion of that land will be occupied and used for the good of mankind. I should like to continue my speech to-morrow.
