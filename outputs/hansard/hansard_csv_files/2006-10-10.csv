While many Indigenous people are assisted across all of the IEP programme elements, DEWR officially reports commencements for the following: Structured Training and Employment Projects, Wage Assistance, Community Development Employment Project Placement Incentive, Indigenous Employment Centres and National Indigenous Cadetship Project. We cannot quantify the assistance in the same way for the remaining IEP programme element, i.e. ‘Other” programmes. 3 Potentially all Indigenous Australians are eligible to be assisted through IEP – these figures only quantify those assisted. 4 Indigenous Employment Centres (IEC) services are contracted through a competitive purchasing process. A single organisation is contracted to deliver IEC services in the electorate of Chifley. For reasons of commercial sensitivity details of contracted funding for this individual provider of Australian Government Employment Services is not identified. 5 ‘Other’ programme elements of the IEP include the Indigenous Small Business Fund, the Emerging Indigenous Entrepreneurs Initiative, Indigenous Community Volunteers, the Indigenous Capital Assistance Scheme, Indigenous Youth Employment Consultants, Public Awareness initiatives and the Aboriginal Employment Strategy. 6 ‘Other’ programme elements of the IEP do not have information readily available at a Federal electorate level. 7 There is only one funded organisation in the electoral division of Chifley. Funding for each CDEP organisation is negotiated on an individual basis and cannot be identified for commercial-in-confidence reasons. 8 Includes all commencements in the TtW programme during 2005-06. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 9 The TtW Programme is open to all eligible job seekers, targeting parents, carers and those of mature age. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 10 Includes all commencements in Vocational Rehabilitation during 2004-05. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 11 Includes all commencements in JPET during 2004-05. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 12 PSP does not have a target number of people to be assisted each year. This table reflects the actual number of people assisted. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 13 Does not include expenditure for assessments undertaken post 30 June, related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006. Projected total expenditure is $24.4m. 14 Approximate cost based on contracted cost of face-to-face assessment for referrals from Centrelink’s Blacktown, Mt Druitt and St Mary’s Customer Services Centres. This does not include the cost of assessments to be undertaken post 30 June related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006. 15 Better Assessment is a demand driven programme. During 2005-06 approximately 111,353 people underwent a Better Assessment. This figure does not include assessments to be completed post 30 June, related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006. 16 Reflects the number of completed assessments following referral from Centrelink’s Blacktown, Mt Druitt and St Mary’s Customer Service Centres. This figure may increase following the completion of assessments in July and August 2006 for referrals made up to and including 30 June 2006. 17 Disability Employment Network (DEN) figures include jobseeker numbers only. Workers that are being supported by DEN members are not included. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous. 18 Expenditure in the electoral division of Chifley is not available because IBA data collection is aligned to the former ATSIC regional council areas, not electoral regions. Private Health Insurance Rebate (Question No. 3389) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 30 March 2006: (1) Can he confirm that the decision to increase the private health insurance rebate, for persons aged 65 years and above, was aimed at encouraging people with restricted income earning potential to retain their fund memberships while premiums rose. (2) Will the Government extend the increased private health insurance rebate to disability pensioners who also have restricted income earning potential; if not, why not. (1) The decision to increase the private health insurance rebate for people aged over 65 years was made to provide assistance to older Australians by reducing the costs of premiums and to help them retain their private health insurance at a time in their lives that they most need it. (2) The government does not plan to extend the increased private health insurance rebate to members under the age of 65. However, all Australians under the age of 65 will continue to receive the 30% rebate. Media Ownership (Question No. 3392) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 30 March 2006: (1) Will the Minister explain why the Government proposes to allow Australia’s two biggest companies to own newspapers, radio stations, a free-to-air television network, a monopoly pay television operator and numerous news and information sites on the internet, all in the one market. (2) What is the Government’s response to the Productivity Commission report into Broadcasting, published in April 2000, which suggested that regulatory barriers preventing entry by new players into the free-to-air television industry should be removed before the abolition of cross-media ownership rules. (3) Will the Minister explain why the Government will not allow a fourth free-to-air television licence in Australia.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 3462) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) Has he read the article in the Sun-Herald on 22 January 2006 concerning tenancy and other fees at Sydney Airport titled ‘Operations charging as much as they can get away with’. (2) Is there pricing surveillance of costs such as rents, parking fees, and other landside costs payable by tenants of Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL); if so, what was the annual rate of increase each year of rents, parking fees and related landside costs for tenants at Sydney Airport since SACL was privatised. (3) Has the rate of increase in rents, parking fees and related landside costs for tenants at Sydney airport been more or less than the rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index for each year since SACL was privatised. (4) Is he taking action to ensure that price increases for tenants at Sydney Airport remain within the CPI; if so, what; if not, why not. (1) I am aware of an article in the Sun-Herald on 22 January 2006 on revenue from SACL commercial trading. (2) Yes. Under Treasurer’s Direction No. 27 and pursuant to Part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is responsible for monitoring the prices, costs and profits of a range of aeronautical and aeronautical related services at the seven major airports. The ACCC’s 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 price monitoring reports provide details of each major airport’s car parking rates. Details of these reports can be obtained via ACCC’s website – www.accc.gov.au. (3) The ACCC’s 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 price monitoring reports do not provide the specific information to answer this question. However, analysis of the car parking prices obtained from SACL’s website (www.sydneyairport.com.au) available from 2003, indicates that car parking rates in total have increased by less than CPI since privatisation and in many cases have remained at the same rates or have been reduced.",126,Questions In Writing

272,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) No. Given ACCC’s responsibility for investigating pricing complaints under the Trade Practices Act 1974, any complaints about the level of charges would be a matter for the ACCC to consider in the first instance. Moreover, the Productivity Commission is currently considering a wide range of issues as part of its Inquiry into Price Regulation of Airport Services. In particular, the Productivity commission will examine whether airports including SACL have acted in a manner consistent with the Government’s Aeronautical Pricing Principles released in its response to the Productivity Commission’s 2002 Report on Airport Price Regulations. The Government will consider the Commission’s recommendations following receipt of the Commission’s final report.

Citizenship (Question No. 3603) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 1 June 2006: (1) Can the Minister confirm that New Zealand citizens must now apply for, and be granted, permanent residence in Australia in order to obtain Australian citizenship. (2) Can the Minister confirm that New Zealand citizens who have been long-term residents and taxpayers in Australia, and who have previously been entitled to Australian citizenship, must now apply for permanent residency; if not, what criteria must be met by New Zealand citizens resident in Australia prior to 26 February 2001 to retain their eligibility for Australian citizenship. (3) Will the Minister advise whether changes to the eligibility criteria for New Zealand citizens previously entitled to Australian citizenship were widely advertised in the media; if so, what are the details of the advertisements; if not why not. (4) Is the Minister aware of a statement contained in the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affair’s Annual Report for the period 2000-201 to the effect that changes in access to Australian citizenship for New Zealand citizens were introduced from 26 February 2001, and that these changes have operated smoothly; if not, why not. (5) How does the Minister reconcile the statement referred to in part (4) with claims made by New Zealand citizens, who are long-term residents and tax payers, to the effect that they were not made aware of the legislative changes that amended their citizenship eligibility. (6) Will the government restore to New Zealand citizens referred to in part (5) entitlement to Australian citizenship; if so, when; in not, why not. following answers to the honourable member’s question: (1) Prior to 26 February 2001 New Zealand citizens entering Australia under the Trans Tasman Travel Arrangements held temporary visas but were, for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act), treated as permanent residents under the auspices of an Instrument issued under the Act. In support of the new bilateral social security arrangements between Australia and New Zealand, a new Instrument was issued under the Act with the effect that New Zealand citizens entering Australia under those new arrangements are not treated as permanent residents for citizenship purposes. New Zealand citizens continue to be regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Act if they: (a) were present in Australia on 26 February 2001; or (b) had been in Australia for at least 12 months in the two years immediately before 26 February 2001 and returned to Australia after that day; or (c) were residing in Australia on 26 February 2001 but were temporarily absent; or (d) commenced or recommenced residing in Australia by 26 May 2001. Applications could be made to Centrelink to obtain a certificate stating that either (c) or (d) was applicable. The certificates for those New Zealand citizens in category (c) were issued until 26 February 2002 if the person was not a recipient of a Centrelink payment. If the person was a recipient of a Centrelink payment, the person was required to return to Australia by 26 August 2001. For those New Zealand citizens in category (d) certificates were issued until 26 February 2004. If New Zealand citizens do not come within the above categories they are not regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Act and must hold a permanent visa issued under the Migration Act 1958 to be eligible for Australian citizenship. (2) New Zealand citizens who had been long-term residents and taxpayers in Australia had no “entitlement” to Australian citizenship. However, as indicated in response to (1) above, they were treated as permanent residents for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act). As such they were able to apply for Australian citizenship and were subject to the same requirements as people who had migrated to Australia. The ability to apply does not equate to an entitlement to citizenship. As also indicated in response to (1) above, many New Zealand citizens in Australia are still treated as permanent residents for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. If they apply for Australian citizenship they are subject to the same requirements as people who have migrated to Australia. Between1 July 2000 and 30 June 2005 a total of 64 750 New Zealand citizens became Australian citizens. (3) The new bilateral social security arrangements and the citizenship arrangements were announced by the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand and publicised widely. Press Releases issued by both Prime Ministers included changes to citizenship arrangements for New Zealand citizens. Detailed information packs about the changes were produced by both Governments. Information could also be accessed by calling a toll free telephone helpline, both in Australia or New Zealand, or visiting www.nz-oz.gov.au. Information for New Zealand citizens has also been available since 2001 on the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affair’s citizenship website www.citizenship.gov.au. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the then Department of Family and Community Services placed advertisements in all major daily newspapers at the time the changes were announced and again in the lead up to the closing date for the issue of certificates.",131,Questions In Writing

(5) The 26 February 2001 changes did not affect the status of New Zealanders who: (a) were present in Australia on 26 February 2001; or (b) had been in Australia for at least 12 months in the two years immediately before 26 February 2001 and returned to Australia after that day; or (c) were residing in Australia on 26 February 2001 but were temporarily absent; or (d) commenced or recommenced residing in Australia by 26 May 2001. As indicated at (3) above, the changes were widely publicised. However it has become evident that there are a very small number of New Zealand citizens who were likely to be eligible for, but did not obtain a certificate from Centrelink. (6) As indicated in response to (2) above, New Zealand citizens had no entitlement to Australian citizenship, but prior to 26 February 2001 were regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. New Zealand citizens who did not obtain a certificate from Centrelink prior to 26 February 2004 must obtain an Australian permanent residence visa if they wish to be eligible for Australian citizenship. Visas (Question No. 3604) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 1 June 2006: (1) Can the Minister confirm that Special Category Visas are primarily issued to New Zealand citizens. (2) Can the Minister advise whether long-term Australian residents who were Special Category Visa holders prior to 26 February 2001 are considered to be ‘Australian residents’ under the Social Security Act 1991 and for the purposes of Australian citizenship. (3) Is the Minister aware of Special Category Visa holders who were long-term Australian residents and taxpayers prior to 26 February 2001, but who, being temporarily absent from Australia on that date, lost the benefits of Australian resident status, including eligibility for Australian citizenship. (4) Is it the case that ‘non-protected’ Special Category Visa holders, who were long-term residents and taxpayers in Australia, but who were temporarily absent from Australia on 26 February 2001, who are unable to obtain permanent residency, have no other recourse to obtaining Australian citizenship; if not, why not. (5) Can the Minister name any other class of ‘Australian resident’ under section 7 of the Social Security Act 1991 that has lost the benefits of that status, including Australian citizenship, upon return from a temporary absence from Australia. (6) Can the Minister confirm that Australia is a signatory to The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966. (7) Has the Minister read ‘General Recommendation 30’ from the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which states, inter alia, that differential treatment based on citizenship or immigration status will constitute discrimination if the criteria for such differentiation are not applied pursuant to a legitimate aim, and are not proportional to the achievement of this aim. (8) Did the Minister say on 26 February 2001 that new arrangements relating to New Zealand citizens, including citizenship eligibility, had been introduced with the express purpose of implementing a new social security agreement between Australia and New Zealand. (9) Can the Minister confirm that changes to Australian citizenship eligibility for New Zealand Special Category Visa holders who were long-term residents and taxpayers in Australia, but who were temporarily absent from Australia on 26 February 2001, were reasonably necessary to implement the bilateral social security agreement with New Zealand; if so, for what reason; if not, why not. (10) Can the Minister confirm that signatories to The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966 are obliged to report to the UN on legislation on non-citizens and its implementation; if not, why not. (11) Did the Combined Thirteenth and Fourteenth Periodic Report of the Government of Australia under Article9 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966, which was presented in 2005 and covered the reporting period 1998 to 2002, report on legislative changes made to Australian citizenship criteria in 2001, and which affect New Zealand citizens; if not, why not; if so, what are the details provided in the report. (12) Can the Minister assure the House that the legislative changes referred to in part (8) do not breach the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966; if so, how; if not, why not. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Special Category Visas (SCVs) are only granted to New Zealand citizens. (2) New Zealand citizens who were in Australia on 26 February 2001 and held a Special Category Visa (SCV) are classified as ‘eligible New Zealand citizens’ not ‘permanent residents’. An ‘eligible New Zealand citizen’ is able to apply for Australian citizenship, sponsor relatives for Australian permanent residence and access certain Social Security payments. The definition of ‘eligible New Zealand citizen’ came into effect on 27 February 2001 (further revised on 1 July 2001). (3) Not all New Zealand citizens who were absent from Australia on 26 February 2001 were affected by the changes announced by the Australian Government. New Zealand citizens who were outside Australia on 26 February 2001, but were in Australia and held a Special Category Visa for at least 1 year in the 2 years prior to that date; or had been issued with a Centrelink certificate prior to 26 February 2004 stating they were residing in Australia on a particular date were not affected. These Special Category Visa holders were, and still are, able to apply for Australian citizenship, sponsor relatives for Australian permanent residence and access certain Social Security payments. These transitional arrangements were intended such that New Zealand citizens who were temporarily outside of Australia were not disadvantaged and retained the benefits of the pre-February 2001 arrangements. The overall outcome of the changes announced by the Australian Government on 26 February 2001 was that most New Zealand citizens arriving in Australia after 27 February 2001 are required to obtain an Australian permanent residence visa if they wish to access certain social security payments, be eligible for Australian citizenship or sponsor people for Australian permanent residence. New Zealand citizens are still permitted to travel to, live and work indefinitely in Australia under terms of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangements while the holders of Special Category visas. (4) “Non-Protected” Special Category visa holders is not a term used under the Migration Act 1948 or Migration Regulations. New Zealand citizens who met the transitional provisions and therefore were not affected by the changes introduced on 26 February 2001 are classified as “Eligible New Zealand citizens”. As detailed in (3) above, transitional arrangements were put in place so people who had been recent long-term residents but were temporarily outside Australia on 26 February 2001 would not be disadvantaged.

In addition to the above, to be eligible for the grant of a five year RRV, the applicant must: have been lawfully present in Australia for a total of at least two years in the five years immediately before lodging the application for the visa, or have substantial and beneficial business, cultural, employment or personal ties to Australia and compelling reasons for having been absent from Australia for more than five years, or be a member of the family unit of a person who holds a valid RRV or who has applied for and met the criteria for an RRV. Persons who do not meet the above criteria, but are required to leave Australia for compassionate and compelling reasons, may be eligible for a three month RRV. Former permanent residents, who are unable to meet the criteria for an RRV, and wish to return and live in Australia are required to apply for and be granted, a migrant visa. (6) Yes. (7) I am aware of General Recommendation 30 of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. (8) A media release from the Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs dated 26 February 2001 stated in part: “The new arrangements have been introduced with the express purpose of implementing the new social security agreement and apply to all New Zealand citizens, regardless of place of birth. It provides a more equitable base for the free flow of people between each country.” (9) Yes. The new Instrument issued under the Act, which gave effect to the requirement that New Zealand citizens entering Australia under those new arrangements are not treated as permanent residents for citizenship purposes, was required to support the new bilateral social security arrangements (10) Yes. (11) The Combined Thirteenth and Fourteenth Periodic Report of the Government of Australia under Article9 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966, was presented to the Committee on 25 November 2003 and covered the reporting period 1998 to 2002. It was also tabled in Parliament on the same day. The report referred to some changes to the citizenship legislation but did not specifically refer to the changes affecting New Zealand citizens as these changes were not considered to come within the ambit of the Convention (as per the answer to question 12). (12) The Office of International Law in the Attorney-General’s Department has advised that the legislative changes which were introduced in 2001 to implement a social security agreement between New Zealand and Australia do not breach the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Further, the changes do not constitute racial discrimination for the purposes of CERD. Article 1(1) of CERD provides that: ‘the term ‘racial discrimination’ shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life’. The changes do not constitute racial discrimination against New Zealanders, because there is now no distinction applied in relation to social security access between New Zealanders and other nationalities that arrive in Australia as migrants. Previously New Zealanders received preferential treatment, and any withdrawing of that treatment is not discrimination, but merely places New Zealanders on an equal footing with people of other nationalities. Building and Construction Industry Contractors (Question No. 3614) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 13 June 2006: (1) Was the Building and Construction Industry Forum (BCIF) informed in 2005 that, in order to clamp down on abuse of the contractor system, Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) would not be issued to apprentices or unskilled labourers. (2) At its meeting of 30 May 2006, at the Mercure Hotel, Sydney Airport, was the BCIF told that the policy referred to in part (1) had not been, and would not be, implemented. (3) In respect of the policy referred to in part (1), (a) why did the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) not implement it when industry participants were promised that it would be implemented, (b) who in the ATO decided not to proceed with implementation, (c) why was the decision to proceed with implementation changed, (d) what role did he, or his office, play in the decision not to proceed with implementation, (e) why were the members of the BCIF not consulted on the decision not to proceed with implementation, (f) why were the members of the BCIF not advised in writing of the decision not to proceed with implementation, (g) what is the expected cost of the decision not to proceed with implementation, and (h) who calculated the cost of the decision not to proceed with implementation. (4) How can an apprentice qualify as a self-employed contractor. (5) How many apprentices currently claim to be working as self-employed contractors. (6) Will he supply a copy of the written advice under which the decision not to proceed with implementation of the policy referred to in part (1) was made. (1) No. The ATO has publicly explained its position that taxpayers working as apprentices are employees. Consequently, an apprentice cannot use an ABN to alter that arrangement. However as indicated to the BCIF, a taxpayer could be entitled to an ABN for a business activity not connected to his or her apprenticeship. (2) The BCIF was informed on 30 May 2006 that changes to the web-based ABN application process had not yet been introduced. The changes were not specifically relating to the issue of ABNs to apprentices. (3) (a) to (h) Industry participants were not promised implementation of a new policy.

Ansett Australia: Employee Entitlements (Question No. 3617) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 13 June 2006: (1) What sum has been collected under the Ansett Levy. (2) Of the sum referred to in part (1), (a) what sum has been paid to former Ansett employees as payment of, or compensation for, lost or suspended entitlements; (b) what sum is yet to be paid to former Ansett employees as payment of, or compensation for, lost or suspended entitlements, and (c) what percentage of the sum has been paid to former Ansett employees. (3) Of the sum of lost or suspended entitlements owing to former Ansett employees, what percentage has been paid. (1) $286,391,000. The levy commenced on 1 October 2001 and ceased on 30 June 2003. (2) Refer to the attached press release from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP. (3) Refer to the attached press release from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP. -------The Hon Kevin Andrews MP Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service Friday1 September 2006 KA222/06 The Australian Government welcomes the announcement by the Ansett Administrators, KordaMentha, of a further dividend payment to former Ansett employees. With this dividend, former Ansett employees will have received a total of $650.5 million in entitlement payments, of which $382.9 million was advanced by the Australian Government under its Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett group employees (SEESA). Under SEESA, all terminated Ansett employees have received 100% of their outstanding wages, annual leave, long service leave, pay in lieu of notice and up to eight weeks redundancy pay. Despite recent reports in the press to the contrary, the Government has not ‘profited’ from the Ansett collapse. If the Government had not stepped in to assist the ex-Ansett employees from the outset, they would have received no money until December 2003 when the Administrators made their first distribution. The Ansett ticket levy was set up to meet the costs of payments and not pay the entitlements directly as has been claimed. Any surplus from the ticket levy will be used for the benefit of aviation and the tourism sector, including a commitment to improve security for regional airports. The amount of surplus is yet to be determined but is nowhere near the $200 million that has been reported. Any distribution by the Administrators reflects the legal obligation of the Administrator to distribute funds in accordance with s556 of the Corporations Act. The Government will not be fully repaid by the",137,Questions In Writing

Parliamentarians’ Entitlements (Question No. 3618) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 13 June 2006: Has he reviewed (a) the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, (b) the Ministers of State Act 1952, (c) the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, (d) the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, (e) the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002, (f) the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004, and (g) any other relevant Act, to assess compliance with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005; if not, will he cause such a review to occur, and; if not, can he explain why politicians are not subject to the same law and rules as the majority of Australian employees. No. The power to pay parliamentarians is derived from s48 of the Constitution and administered through a number of other acts. These include the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Remuneration and Allowance Act 1990 which are administered by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. These acts are long standing and have served to administer a number of aspects of the remuneration of parliamentarians. In relation to the other acts detailed in the question, they are administered by the Minister for Finance and Administration.

The assessment panel’s reports, which identified applicants suitable for funding under the 2005-06 round of the IAHGPS Program, were then submitted for approval to the appropriate delegate, namely the Assistant Secretary, Primary Care Programs Branch, Primary Care Division, Department of Health and Ageing.

(2) How many complaints about unpaid superannuation have been received by the ATO from employees residing in the electoral division of (a) Cunningham; (b) Throsby and (c) Gilmore for the period January 2000 to June 2006. (1) Yes. Each year the ATO investigates approximately 13,000 complaints, either by phone or correspondence, from employees who believe their employer has not fulfilled their superannuation guarantee obligations. The ATO investigates all complaints. The length of time a complaint takes to finalise may be shorter or longer depending on a range of factors including the number of employees, the number of periods that are being investigated, the quality of information that is given by the complainant and the responsiveness of the employer to our inquiries. Many complaints are made after the employee has left the employer and debt recovery action can also be difficult. As part of the Federal Government’s 2006-07 Budget Measures, the ATO was funded an additional $19.2 million over four years to improve responsiveness to taxpayer inquiries. The aim of the measure is two-fold: to support greater disclosure to employees about the progress of investigations into their complaint and to reduce the backlog of inquiries and provide more timely completion of future investigations.

288,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Motor Neurone Disease (Question No. 3774) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 22 June 2006: (1) Is he aware that Motor Neurone Disease, which results in the death of nerve cells controlling the muscles that enable movement, speech and breath, affects approximately 1,300 Australians; if not, why not. (2) Can he confirm that in-home accommodation support for sufferers of Motor Neurone Disease currently receives Commonwealth-State/Territory Disability Agreement Funding. (3) Is he aware that applicants for in-home accommodation support, including Motor Neurone Disease sufferers, must be under the age of 65 years at the time of making an application. (4) Is he aware that the onset and diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease typically occurs amongst older Australians, including those over the age of 65 years; if not, why not. (5) Can he confirm that those who are diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease after the age of 65 are ineligible to receive services and support for disability created needs. (6) Will the Government provide additional funding to ensure all people living with Motor Neurone Disease are eligible for services that meet their specific needs, regardless of the patient’s age at diagnosis; if not, why not. (1) Yes. Motor Neurone Disease is an uncommon degenerative disorder that occurs at similar rates in most countries of the world. The Australian Motor Neurone Disease Association of Australia estimates that there are presently about 1,400 people in Australia with Motor Neurone Disease. (2) Sufferers of Motor Neurone Disease may be eligible for Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) funded services. (3) This is not the case. To be eligible for CSTDA services the disability must have manifested before the age of 65. However, there are various Commonwealth Government programs which offer in-home accommodation support to people over 65 suffering from chronic disease, such as Motor Neurone Disease, and their carers, such as the Home and Community Care Program (HACC) and Community Aged Packaged Care Programs. HACC provides for services that assist frail elderly Australians, those with a disability and their carers to remain living independently. Whilst people with Motor Neurone Disease may be eligible to receive HACC services, eligibility is not solely assessed on having such an illness. Eligibility for HACC services is based on the frailty of the individual related to their disability, and the individual’s need for assistance due to their moderate, severe or profound disability. Community Aged Packaged Care Programs are designed to meet the needs of frail older people, generally aged 70 years and older (or 50 years and older for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples), who have a preference to remain living in the community, and are able to do so with the assistance of a package of care. (4) Yes. The average age of onset of the disease is 50 years. (5) This is not correct. As outlined above, there are various Commonwealth Government programs which offer services and support to people diagnosed with Motor Neurone Desease after the age of 65, and their carers. (6) The Commonwealth Government already provides funding to ensure that all people with a disability, including those with Motor Neurone Disease receive services that meet their specific needs.",145,Questions In Writing
289,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:This is done through HACC and Community Aged Packaged Care Programs and by working with state and territory governments to meet the needs of people with disability, their families and carers. The Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) provides the national framework for the provision of government support to services for people with disability. The state and territory governments continue to be responsible for services for people with a disability. Over the five years of the current CSTDA, the Commonwealth Government will provide state and territory governments with more than $2.8 billion to assist them to meet their agreed responsibilities.

As a part of our continuous improvement approach, the Australian and State and Territory governments are considering arrangements for any future natural resource management programs. To ensure we build on the strengths of the partnership model, a Working Group of officials from State, Territory and Australian Governments, and the Australian Local Government Association, have developed the following set of principles and objectives to guide the development of future NRM. These principles and objectives are designed to establish broadly indicative but useful guidelines rather than to establish prescriptive ‘rules’ for future NRM arrangements. Principles Future NRM arrangements should be based on: (1) Maximising investment return, especially in relation to demonstrable, positive and strategic NRM outcomes; (2) Recognising that it is more cost-effective to prevent damage than repair it; (3) A program architecture that addresses strategic NRM concerns in an integrated manner and that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate regional variability; and (4) Identifying, protecting and rehabilitating high value NRM assets; and (5) Addressing areas of high and emerging demand for NRM action (such as climate change and urban and peri-urban issues); and (6) The establishment of decision-making processes and structures that are informed by the best available scientific and socio-economic information and advice, and that provide for the timely review of this information and advice. Objectives (1) The establishment of cost-sharing arrangements that take account of the interests of, and benefits flowing to, all parties; (2) Continued support for a regional investment element that effectively integrates regional, multiregional, State and national NRM objectives; (3) The establishment of mechanisms to address cross-regional issues, recognising that there are practical limits on the extent to which individual regions can contribute to extra-regional outcomes; (4) Encouraging integrated landscape management, including through removal of barriers to investment in strategic NRM priorities; (5) The development of arrangements that provide for the maximum practicable community engagement in NRM; (6) The development of arrangements that encourage industry, including primary industry, to be involved in private investment in NRM in partnership with all levels of government; (7) The development of arrangements to further engage and encourage participation of Indigenous communities in NRM programs; (8) The development of arrangements that draw on the operational experience of current and previous NRM models. Natural Heritage Ministerial Board (Question No. 3798) Mr Albanese asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 8 August 2006: Has the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board (the Board) considered, and reached final decisions on, the recommendations in the following eight national evaluations of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, which were commissioned by the Board in 2004 and 2005: (a) significant invasive species (weeds) outcomes of regional investment, (b) biodiversity outcomes of regional investment, (c) salinity outcomes of regional investment, (d) sustainable agriculture outcomes of regional investment, (e) current governance arrangements to support regional investment, (f) the effectiveness of bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth and State/Territory governments for the regional component of the extension of the Natural Heritage Trust, (g) the Australian Government Envirofund, and (h) the National Investment Stream of the Natural Heritage Trust; if so, will those decisions be made public; if not, when will the Board consider and make decisions on the recommendations, and make these decisions public. swer to the honourable member’s question: Yes, the Board has considered the recommendations of the evaluations. Final decisions will be made in the context of considering the design of any future programmes to follow the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Where relevant, a number of evaluation findings have been implemented under the current programmes.

(3) For each of the years referred to in part (1), what was the percentage of Commonwealth procurement expenditure on foreign-sourced products. (4) For each of the years referred to in part (2), what was the percentage of procurement expenditure, by industry sector, on foreign-sourced products. swer to the honourable member’s question: The Australian Government does not compile data on total Commonwealth expenditure on property and services procurement but does have in place a centralised reporting system for departments and agencies to report the value of awarded procurement contracts. Prior to 1 January 2005, all departments and agencies governed by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 were required to report procurement contracts and standing offers with a value of $2,000 or more on the Government’s Gazette Publishing System.

In addition, the reporting requirement was extended to cover certain contracts and standing offers of those agencies governed under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 that are also required to apply the CPGs in respect of certain procurements as set out in the Finance Minister’s (CAC Act Procurement) Directions. The Gazette Publishing System has now been incorporated into the Australian Government’s AusTender system.

However, it is possible, through the www.contracts.gov.au website for an enquirer to identify relevant suppliers for individual reported contracts. United States Military (Question No. 3812) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 8 August 2006: Within Australia’s territorial borders, (a) in what military activities do US armed forces engage, (b) what activities are anticipated and (c) do any current or anticipated activities involve the use of depleted uranium; if so, (i) what are the activities, (ii) for what purpose is the depleted uranium used, (iii) how is it used and (iv) what are its effects. (a) and (b) Training exercises, transit of aircraft and naval vessels, and replenishment of aircraft and naval vessels.

299,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is the Minister aware of claims that the presence of serrated tussock at the Broadcast Australia site in St Albans, Victoria, is directly threatening the continued existence of the Golden Sun Moth at that location. (3) Will the Minister take steps to compel Broadcast Australia to remove all serrated tussock from this property in St Albans; if not, why not. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) provides for the protection of matters of national environmental significance, including listed threatened species. The Golden Sun Moth (synemon plana) is listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act. New proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on any matter of national environmental significance must be referred for consideration under the EPBC Act, and cannot proceed without approval. As a nationally listed threatened species, the Golden Sun Moth is required to have a recovery plan in place under the EPBC Act. A recovery plan sets out the actions necessary to protect the species and reduce threats. While there is no national recovery plan currently in force for the Golden Sun Moth, a national plan is being prepared by the New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation. I am advised that a draft of the plan is at an advanced stage of development. (b) Serrated Tussock (Nasella trichotoma) is a Weed of National Significance in Australia. The responsibility for the management of Serrated Tussock ultimately rests with individual landowners and land managers, with state and territory governments having overall legislative and administrative responsibility. Weeds of National Significance such as Serrated Tussock, however, are considered of national importance and require national coordinated effort amongst all levels of government. For each of the Weeds of National Significance a national strategic plan has been developed that outlines strategies and actions required to control the weed, including identifying responsibilities for each action. The Australian Government contributes half the funding for a Serrated Tussock management coordinator who, in conjunction with a National Serrated Tussock Management Group, oversees the implementation of the goals and actions of the Serrated Tussock Strategic Plan, including the coordination of priority actions. The Australian Government has also funded the development of a Serrated Tussock Weed Management Guide to aid land managers in their efforts to control Serrated Tussock. (2) My Department was contacted by Broadcast Australia on 20 December 2005. Broadcast Australia sought advice about their property management obligations having regard to the recent discovery of a significant population of the Golden Sun Moth on their St Albans site and the need to undertake urgent fuel reduction measures. The Department agreed with measures proposed by Broadcast Australia to reduce the potential fire hazard of the site whilst ensuring that there would not be a significant impact on the Golden Sun Moth. Broadcast Australia, as the responsible land manager for the site, has since completed, and is implementing, a vegetation management plan to ensure protection of the Golden Sun Moth on the site, including control of Serrated Tussock.

(2) By whom will the mix of trained nurses and personal care attendants (untrained nursing staff) be regulated. (3) Who will decide whether a resident requires care from a trained nurse or from a personal care attendant. (4) Will trained nurses continue to be responsible for dispensing medication in nursing homes and/or residential care facilities. (5) Is the choice made by owners of residential care facilities when considering the mix of trained and untrained nursing staff dictated by financial considerations. (6) Why is compliance with the requirement that: “There are appropriately skilled and qualified staff sufficient to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with these standards and the residential care service’s philosophy and objectives.” currently based on outcome and not input. member’s question: (1) Mr Arnan Rouse, the Director of Aged Care Services Australia Group (ACSAG), to which Mirridong belongs, has advised the Department of Health and Ageing that he has introduced a new staffing structure which improves outcomes for residents, staff and relatives. He indicates that the new structure involves more Registered Nurse (Division 1) hours, with a Registered Nurse (Division 1) on duty for all shifts; decreased Registered Nurse (Division 2) hours and more hours for Personal Care Workers. In the case of Mirradong, this will increase the number of floor hours by 55 hours per fortnight. (2) The Government has legislated a set of standards for the provision of quality care and services by residential aged care homes the Accreditation Standards. These include the requirement that homes have appropriately skilled and qualified staff sufficient to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with the Accreditation Standards. Accreditation decisions are made by the independent Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. The appropriate number and required skill sets of staff are affected by factors such as the nature of the care and service needs of residents, the nature of the building or buildings, the way work is organised and the extent to which some services are conducted in house or are outsourced. Thus the number and skill sets of staff will vary from home to home and from time to time as changes in the mix of residents’ needs within a home occur. (3) The aged care provider has the responsibility for making this decision based on the requirements of state or territory law affecting the responsibilities of nurses. In addition, the Quality of Care Principles 1997 require an approved provider to provide ‘nursing services’ for residents ‘receiving a high level of residential care’. This includes a requirement that ‘initial and on-going assessment, planning and management of care for residents [is] carried out by a registered nurse’. (4) The issue of who may or may not administer medication is legislated by state and territory governments.",153,Questions In Writing
301,Mr Abbott,"The Minister for Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable(5) Approved providers are required to meet their responsibilities under the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act). The Accreditation Standards which have been developed under the Act cover a comprehensive range of care outcomes for residents that must be met by aged care service providers and cover much more than basic physical need. In order to meet these outcomes, the Act requires that approved providers maintain an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff and have in place a skills mix appropriate to the care needs of the residents. Providers must also have in place arrangements for the ongoing development of staff skills to ensure quality of care continues to be delivered. Providers must be able to demonstrate the achievements of these outcomes for residents, and this is done during the course of an accreditation audit directed by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. (6) The Accreditation Standards were developed in close consultation with service provider and consumer organisations. They were designed to ensure that residential aged care services have quality systems in place and strategies for continuous improvement that meet defined performance standards based on outcomes for residents. The current system of aged care provision recognises that changes in residents’ needs, and the mix of residents, varies over time. Specifying inputs for every scenario would make it difficult to operate an aged care facility and would be difficult to monitor. Neither are inputs alone necessarily a reflection of the provision of good care. Quality outcomes for residents is the goal of Government and they are measured against the Accreditation Standards. Media Ownership (Question No. 3842) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 8 August 2006: Since the Government announced its intention to change Australia’s crossmedia and foreign ownership media laws following Cabinet’s decision on 11 July 2006, (a) will Rupert Murdoch’s News Limited Corporation be permitted to hold all of their existing media assets and still be able to purchase an Australian free-to-air television network; if so, why, and (b) will James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting Limited media company be permitted to hold all of its existing media assets and still be able to purchase John Fairfax Holdings Limited; if so, why. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The honourable member’s attention is directed to the Minister’s answer to Question 3596.

(2) Given that the recent Cochrane Review concluded that: “There is no evidence that Nicobrevin aids long-term smoking cessation”, why does the product continue to be registered. (3) Is the claim that: “Nicobrevin is a clinically-proven therapeutic medicine which has helped millions to quit” a breach of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. (4) In view of the statement by the Australian Consumers’ Association that: “two NERVITE products (Ezi Slim and Hunger Buster) had been around for so long they were allowed to keep their Aust-R status when the regulations were changed in 1989”; (a) how many registered medicines have been similarly treated, and (b) how can consumers know which Aust-R medicines have been evaluated for efficacy. (1) The product was registered in June 2002 following a direction from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 11 February 2002 that the product “be approved pursuant to s.25 of the Therapeutic Goods Act in accordance with the terms of that application”. (2) The Cochrane review identified no trials meeting the full inclusion criteria however the review was looking specifically at smoking cessation criteria, assessed at follow up at least six months from the start of treatment, following the recommendations of the Russell Standard. The review identified two old studies that didn’t meet these criteria for inclusion. The fact that these studies did not meet the criteria does not mean that they are necessarily invalid. It doesn’t appear that the Cochrane review was looking at evidence criteria aimed specifically at assessing the indications for this product, that is the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms. (3) It is a requirement of therapeutic goods advertising that all advertising complies with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code and it is a requirement of the code that an advertisement for therapeutic goods must contain correct and balanced statements only and claims which the sponsor has already verified. These claims were brought to the attention of the TGA Advertising unit which has referred the complaint to the Complaints Resolution Panel set up in the Therapeutics Goods Legislation to deal with complaints about therapeutic goods advertising directed to consumers. (4) (a) The Therapeutic Goods Act came into effect on 15 February 1991. With the implementation of the Act, Section 66 provided for a six month period in which sponsors, who had medicines on the market prior to the commencement of the Act, were able to apply for registration or listing of these products onto the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. It is not possible to state the number of residual ‘grandfathered’ products. (b) Since February 1991, all new registered medicines have been fully evaluated. The Act also provided a number of post marketing powers such as auditing of products, sampling and testing, investigation of advertising concerns or adverse events. Of the products that were in existence prior to 1991 and entered onto the register as ‘grandfathered’ products, the registration details of most have subsequently been investigated by the TGA.",156,Questions In Writing

The information sought by the honourable member pertains to only two taxpayers which are identifiable as there are only two companies providing cruise voyages to Willis Island. Under these circumstances, releasing the information sought would enable each of the taxpayers concerned to deduce the taxation information of the other company. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Question No. 3865) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 9 August 2006: (1) Is the Minister aware of reports that ABC Radio Station 774 censored criticism of the appointment to the ABC Board of Mr Keith Windschuttle. (2) Is it correct that on the Sunday Arts program, Helen Razer interviewed film director Bob Weis about his documentary, Women of the Sun 25 Years Later, which charts the stories of Aboriginal women. (3) Is it correct that during this interview Mr Weis stated that: “While David Irving the Holocaust denier sits in prison, the Australian Government. . .”, but was cut off by Ms Razer before he could complete the sentence. (4) Is it the Government’s view that ABC program hosts should cut off interviewees who are about to criticise Australian Government actions. (5) Does Australia continue to enjoy freedom of speech and expression. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, the Minister is aware of newspaper reports about the interview. (2) Yes. (3) The comment by Mr Weis that went to air was “While David Irving, the Holocaust denier, sits in prison”. At this point, he began to make a comment that both Ms Razer and her producer thought was potentially defamatory. He was cut-off using the seven-second delay button. (4) Internal operational and programming decisions are the responsibility of the ABC Board and management. However, the ABC is obliged to operate within its Charter and legislative obligations. (5) The Government provides an overall level of funding for the ABC, but has no power to direct the ABC in relation to programming matters. Parliament has guaranteed this independence to ensure that what is broadcast is free of political interference. Internal ABC programming decisions are the responsibility of the ABC Board and Executive.",157,Questions In Writing

Contact Lenses (Question No. 3884) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: (1) How is the sale of contact lenses currently regulated. (2) What is the Government’s position on the sale of contact lenses (including coloured lenses and cats’ eyes) through markets and other unregulated commercial entities. (3) Will the Government consider requiring all contact lenses to be regarded as medical devices and to be included on the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. (1) The overarching legislation regulating the sale of all consumer products (including contact lenses) in Australia is the various state and territory trade practices legislation and the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974, which is administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Trade practices legislation ensure general consumer products are of high quality and fit for purpose. Specific regulatory controls on the sale of contact lenses, differ depending on whether the contact lenses are for cosmetic or therapeutic use, as follows: Novelty contact lenses for cosmetic use The responsibility for regulating the sale of novelty contact lenses such as coloured lenses and cats’ eyes for cosmetic purposes resides with the states and territories. New South Wales currently regulates novelty contact lenses under the Optical Dispensers Act 1963 which requires that cosmetic contact lenses can only be purchased through an optometrist or optical dispenser. Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are in the process of drafting similar legislation. Contact lenses for therapeutic use The sale of contact lenses for therapeutic use (eg vision correction) is also regulated under state and territory legislation. In NSW this is the Optometrists Act 2002 which ensures that the sale and dispensing can only occur with a prescription from an optometrist. Similar legislation exists in all states and territories. The role of the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is confined to regulating the quality, safety and performance of contact lenses for therapeutic use. These contact lenses are regulated as low-medium risk medical devices and must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be legally supplied for sale in Australia.",159,Questions In Writing
311,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) The TGA does not regulate coloured contact lenses or cats’ eyes lenses for cosmetic use. These are novelty consumer products that do not have a therapeutic purpose and hence are outside the scope of TGA’s mandate. Regulatory controls on the sale of these types of products through markets and unregulated commercial entities are most effectively administered at the point of sale. The states and territories have either implemented or are in the process of developing legislation to restrict the sale of these products. (3) TGA’s mandate applies only to products for therapeutic use. Novelty contact lenses are not therapeutic goods and hence cannot be regulated as medical devices under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 or included on the ARTG. Petrol Thefts (Question No. 3886) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, in writing, on 10 August 2006: (1) How many petrol thefts have occurred across Australia since January 2006.

(1) Yes. (2) Yes.",160,Questions In Writing
312,Mr Ruddock,The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to,161,Questions In Writing
313,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) There is no legislative requirement for domestic passengers to present identification at check-in at Australian airports. From a security perspective, the screening of passengers and their baggage is considered more effective than identity checking, in terms of deterring and preventing security incidents. This is particularly the case in domestic airports as passengers are able to mix freely with other people inside the airport terminal after being issued a boarding pass. The Australian Government requires a range of stringent measures to be applied to all persons travelling on domestic screened air services that operate from our major airports. These include screening of their person for weapons and prohibited items, screening of their personal carry-on baggage, the application of random and continuous explosive trace detection testing, as well as the screening of checked baggage. All persons entering a sterile area at an airport, whether they are travelling or not, must undergo the security screening process to gain entry to that sterile area. (4) The self check-in arrangements adopted by Qantas and Virgin Blue are a matter for the airlines. Temporary Residence Visas (Question No. 3889) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 10 August 2006: In respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation ) Bill (No.1) 2002 and the Explanatory Memorandum to that Bill which states: “There are approximately 275,000 individuals holding temporary residence visas (temporary residents) who are eligible to work in Australia at any given time. Treasury’s Retirement and Income Modelling Unit estimates that the superannuation accounts of past and present temporary residents currently contain approximately $1.19 billion. This amount is expected to increase by approximately $300 million per year if there is no policy change”, (a) can Treasury provide an update of the figures noted in this document, (b) can Treasury provide an indication of the number of persons who take the option of receiving their superannuation when leaving the country every year and (c) what amount of revenue is raised each year through this measure. (a) Treasury advises that no update of this estimate is available. (b) Comprehensive information on the numbers taking the option is not available. The ATO advises that in 2005-06 there were over 107,000 website hits on this topic and over 165,000 outgoing passenger notifications. (c) There is no separate head of revenue for this measure and thus no estimates of revenue raised are regularly made or published. Australian Technical Colleges (Question No. 3893) Ms George asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, in writing, on 10 August 2006: (1) In respect of his visit to the Illawarra on Thursday, 3 August 2006, to announce the funding agreement for the Australian Technical College, (a) when did he decide to visit Wollongong for the purpose of announcing the funding agreement, (b) why was no invitation to the function extended by him, his office or the department to me and the Member for Cunningham, (c) is he aware that the only notification of the function came from the local Australian Industry Group office on the afternoon of Wednesday, 2 August 2006; if not, why not and (d) were the apologies submitted by me and the Member for Cunningham, explaining our inability to attend due to the late notification, made known to the participants; if not, why not. (2) In view of the situation outlined in part (1), will he apologise for the comments he made in respect of my non-attendance (Hansard, 8 August 2006, page 94); if not, why not.",161,Questions In Writing

The drug will be listed from 1 October 2006. It will be subsidised for use following surgery, commenced concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy, and continued for a maximum period of 12 months. The duration and form of treatment was based on the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). PBAC is an independent, expert advisory body whose members include medical practitioners, health scientists, other health professionals and a consumer representative. In making its decision, PBAC considered all the evidence before it and determined that the proposed treatment regime was the most effective and cost effective.",162,Questions In Writing
