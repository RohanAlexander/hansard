CrVIL AVIATION. for Civil Aviation aware that race-horses are being flown from Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane by Trans-Australia Airlines? If so, how many gallons of ? etrol are being used for that purpose? s the Minister also aware that the New South Wales Government, early this week, instructed the State Emergency Transport Co-ordinator, Mr Winsor, to fix priorities for the transport of essential goods by rail, road, sea, and air, and to prepare a schedule of transport services? If so, will he state whether race-horses are regarded as essential goods? In view of the present grave state of emergency arising from the coal crisis, and in view of the Prime Minister's statement that available petrol supplies must bc restricted to ensure their equitable distribution, is the carriage of race-horses by Trans-Australia Airlines justified at the present juncture, and is the use of petrol for this purpose in accord with government policy? graphs that I have seen in the newspapers, I am aware that race-horses are carried by each air company when required. The honourable member knows quite well that what is carried in aircraft does not come within the purview of thc Minister for Civil Aviation. The air-_ craft of both the Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited carry race-horses, sheep and other animals from time to time as a part of their ordinary freight service, and they will probably continue to do so, unless forbidden in a specific instruction by the department. We have not taken the view that we should dictate what shall bc carried as freight, and I do not think that we should do so. The Government is not unaware of the need for emergency lSlfi. services in New South Wales. In fact, the State Emergency Transport Coordinator, Mr Winsor, has already asked me in my capacity as Minister for Air Force can give. Already the Royal Australian Air Force has assisted very substantially. Only yesterday an aircraft visited Evans Head to obtain army blankets and other goods necessary for the Royal Australian Air Force has given excellent service, as it always does in such unfortunate occurrences as thc recent flood. I hope that it will continue to do so. It receives little credit for what it does. However, the honourable gentleman's question was whether it was in accordance with government policy that petrol should be used for the transport of race-horses by air. That applies equally to sheep and other live-stock. What freight is carried by the airlines is a matter for themselves to determine. Their supplies of petrol are limited, and they are entitled to carry whatever they think fit within that limit. Wc are endeavouring to assist in the crisis in New South Wales. We are acting in completefco-ordinationwith the Government of New South Wales and we hope to provide substantial relief. for Air whether it is a fact that 21 lives Were lost in the Lodestar Lockheed air crash at Bilinga, near Coolangatta, in March last? Is the coroner's inquest into the cause of that crash at present proceeding at Southport? Did the.Department of Civil Aviation conduct a departmental inquiry into the disaster, and make a report? Has counsel for Queensland Airlines Proprietary Limited, the owners of the aircraft, applied at the coroner's court for a copy of, or access to, that report, and has the request been refused? If the departmental report referred to can be made available to the coroner and the police official assisting the court, what reasons exist for smothering it when it is sought by those most vitally interested, the operators of the aircraft that crashed? My reason for asking the question is that I received",7,Stevedoring Industry Act 1949 Act No 39 Of 1949

This morning L received an urgent telegram which reads The lionorable member will not be in order in reading the telegram. states that the request for the report was refused in the court this morning. press cutting which the honourable member was good enough to supply to me last night, Queensland Airlines Proprietary Limited asked, not for the report, but for the finding of the investigating panel. A summary of the findings of t i e panel was sent to the company some time ago. wants to obtain a copy of the report. at present being held in Queensland into the cause of the deaths of the 21 persons who were killed in the crash. A copy of the report of the investigating panel has been made available for the information of the coroner and is in the possession of the police inspector who is assisting him. One of the anembers of the investigating panel is in attendance at the inquest and is available for examination nnd cross-examination iby the interested parties. A summary of thefindingswas supplied to Queensland Airlines Proprietary Limited, the operators of the aircraft that crashed and to others on request. asked for a copy of the report, but its request has 'been refused. ties of the Department of Civil Aviation are at present conferring with officers of the Crown Law Department on the matter of legal proceedings which may involve prosecutions, it is not proposed to make the report available or to table it. for Immigration how many migrants Austhe screening of certain migrants was a tralia received in the last twelve months? What was the number>of British immigrants compared with displaced persons and other aliens? How does the percentage compare with the percentage in other parts of the British Commonwealth, such as South Africa, Canada and New Zealand? information that the honourable member requires and let him have it next week. telegram I saw a statement in yesterday evening's press which quoted figures given by the British Board of Trade. They show that Australia got more British migrants last year than did either Canada or South Africa. impression that irresponsible broadcasts from Moscow radio may have given in other countries, and even in Australia, regarding conditions in displaced persons' camps in this country, will the Minister for Information arrange for the film unit of his department to make a motion picture of life in displaced persons camps for distribution overseas and in Australia ? If the Minister has already done this, will he inform the House of the nature of such factual publicity? moving pictures of the camps in Australia, where displaced persons are now residing. We propose to make other short films of the places to which those persons go and where they work. I also propose to send two officers of the department to Naples to make some pictures in that big centre from which practically all the displaced persons coming to Australia now depart. I have done this company has because I feel that the movement of displaced persons to Australia is a matter of great historic interest, and I think that a permanent record should be made of it. AlthoughI have anticipated the honourable gentleman somewhat in this matter, I thank him for his question. for Immigration adhere to his statement of last week that a Melbourne Argus reporter's story of an interview with an officer of the International Refugee Or-",10,Bilikga Flood Relief I N Other Ways Also

A statement was made in the Argus alleging that a representative of the International Refugee Organization -on a certain vessel had made certain statements and that one of the passengers had made certain other statements. I said that I had consulted Major-General Lloyd, who is the representative of the International Refugee Organization in Australia, and that he had told me that he had investigated the matter and believed that the Argus story was a complete fabrication. pardon. I thought that it was his statement that it was a complete fabrication. that Major-General Lloyd had said that he was recommending to the International Refugee Organization in Geneva that instructions be issued to all International Refugee Organization escort officers travelling in future vessels under the aegis of the organization not to give any press interviews. He also said that, as far as he could effect it, the man Clancy would not be permitted on board an International Refugee Organization vessel again. Well, another reporter went down recently and was refused a pass for Clancy to go on the vessel. Now that an honourable member of this House has suggested that 'Clancy should be prosecuted for perjury, in view of the fact that he has made a certain statutory declaration, I shall give the matter consideration. I remind the House that statutory declarations have been made by the persons Clancy allegedly interviewed that there was absolutely no truth in Clancy's statement. A Sydney newspaper made a suggestion similar to that of the honourable member, but, of course, I treated it with absolute contempt. I shall be pleased, however, to see if I can oblige the honourable member for Swan. representing the Minister for Health a question relating to the report of the Select Committee on the Northern Territory Medical Services that has been made available to honourable members. I preface my question by quoting paragraph 38 of the report, which statesThe above report was substantially completed prior to the departure of our chairman, Mr Hopkins, on 10th December, 1948. Since that date certain important changes have been made in the Northern Territory Medical Services which liave made the final drafting of tliis report a matter of some difficulty. After careful"" consideration, we have decided to submit our original report, based as it was on the evidence planed before the committee. In view of the excellent work that this committee did, I ask the Minister, first, what were those important changes referred to by the committee that made the drafting of its report difficult, and what changes to comply with the committee's most comprehensive report exposing maladministration and neglect have since been and are now being made by the Chief Medical Officer appointed in December and by the hospital superintendent, to rectify the legacy handed down to them? Secondly, has the Minister any evidence of a vendetta against those two newly appointed officers by a hostile local press for certain purposes, which is resulting in lack of co-operation ? Thirdly, will the Minister have local hospital committees established either by election or appointment so that local people may be able to assist the new staff to clean up the mess of the legacy left to them by the previous administration? the report or even seen it.

As single women are permitted to contribute to the fund and are entitled to have their contributions refunded to them on marriage, will the right honourable gentleman reconsider his decision on this matter and give to married women of the class to which I have referred a similar privilege with a right to the refund of their contributions in the event of their retirement from the Public Service upon the re-establishment of the marriage on a normal basis? already been -considered and a decision has been made in regard to it.

The vicious insinuation in the story is that displaced persons are smuggling into Australia art treasures homes in Europe. This story is utterly fantastic, as a little common sense would reveal.

34,Mr Calwell,"This is anotherpersonal trifles that they have saved from their own looted homes-and how they could possibly smuggle large collections of silver plate, paintings and antiques through the Customs is more than I can understand. It is true that displaced person migrants are allowed a packet of American cigarettes a day on thc voyage to Australia. These are provided by the International Refugee Organization. It is quite possible that by the time the displaced persons reach Australia some of them may have accumulated a few packets but on their arrival here they are subjected to the same Customs examination as are any other arrivals from overseas. They receive uo concessions, and have to pay duty on excess holdings of cigarettes or other dutiable articles in the same way as do other persons. In any event, Major Kershaw, the Director of Bonegilla Centre, denied only recently that there was any illegal trafficking of ex-servicemen, reviewed the Ausing in American cigarettes in the Bonegilla district. The Melbourne Sun-News Pictorial report is another instance of the smear campaign that is being directed at Australia's immigration plan, and is quite in tone with the lies that were broadmendation to the Government about it cast by Moscow radio this week about alleged slave labour in Australia. to the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister for External Affairs. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether any action is to be taken by the Australian Government to establish diplomatic relations with the State of Israel? If it is, when is the appointment of the Australian diplomatic representative likely to be made? conversations regarding the possibility of Australian diplomatic representation in Israel, but no representative has yet been appointed. No decision has been arrived at either as to the person who will be appointed or when the appointment will be made. Mr ""WHITE -Under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, the wives of soldiers of World WarI . , who were married after 1938, and the children of such marriages who were born after that date, are not eligible for repatriation benefits. I have received many letters on this subject, including correspondence from totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, whose children are denied the educational and other benefits that are provided under the act. Will the Minister for Repatriation ensure that that anomaly is rectified by a proper appropriation when the budget is being considered? the honourable member has asked in relation to the wives of men who served in World WarI . , and who were married after 1938, and the children of such marriages has received a good deal of consideration since I have been the Minister for Repatriation. The position is well known. When the all party Parliamentary Committee, consisttralian Soldiers' Repatriation Act a few years ago, the matter to which the honourable gentleman has referred was not raised by ex-servicemen's organizations, and the committee did not make a recomin its report. The existing act was drafted on the basis of the recommendations of that committee. No action has since been taken to give effect to representations that have been made by organizations on this subject. when that Parliamentary Committee made its report. honourable gentleman himself was serving with the Royal Australian A i r Eorce overseas at that time, but the fact remains that consideration has been given to this matter on a number of occasions, and I hold out no hope whatever of the Government's policy being altered in that respect.

I ask the Prime Minister whether it will be possible for His Excellency to visit this House while it is in session in order that honourable members may have an opportunity to meet him. . Possibly, the Empire Parliamentary Association could arrange for His Excellency to address honourable members, who have not been to the United Kingdom, on his views of the conditions there.

NEW GUINEA. asked questions of the Minister for Repatriation about the widows of public servants who were killed in New Guinea during the-Japanese invasion. Last year, I asked if they would get full repatriation benefits, and he gave a definite assurance that they would do so. I now learn from these unfortunate people that they are not getting the benefits in full, but only in part and that the benefits that they are not receiving that others receive are a furniture grant and medical benefits. The Minister has said that the Department of External Territories is partly at fault. Will he now give an assurance that those benefits will be given to these widows and their children? when the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill was before the House last year that those people were being taken care of. I find that that is not exactly the position and that there are some difficulties in determining the joint responsibility, if I may put it that way, of the Department of External Territories and the Repatriation Commission.

If there is anything that I left unsaid, and the honourable member specifies what he wants to know, I am still the Minister for Information. OF PROPERTY IN MELBOURNE-TH E MENT OF EX-SERVIOEMEN-POLITICA L Question proposedThat Mr Deputy Speaker do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself ment of those tenants. It is common into a Committee of Supply. to place before the House a matter concerning certain evictions that are taking qjlace in the metropolitan area of Sydney. I am particularly interested in this matter because of the fact that the evictions are in process of being made within the boundaries of the newly constituted Grayndler electorate which I hope ultimately to represent in this Parliament. My particular complaint regards certain ejectment notices that have been served by Labor Motor Funerals Limited on tenants in the Newtown district of Sydney. I shall explain to the House the background of this organization and the tragic circumstances .in which it will place a number of people, including ex-servicemen, if effect is given to these ejectment notices. Some of the persons who have received those notices have handed' copies of them to me and I shall quote from one of them which statesTake notice that you are hereby required to' quit and deliver up to Labor Motor Funerals1 Limited possession of all that land and pre-' mises known as . . . The notice then indicates the premises' concerned and continuesThe premises are required for rcconstructio:i in order to convert them into funeral parlours, mortuary acommodation and living accommodation for tbe Branch Manager ol Labnr Motor Funerals Limited.

The question by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) is very (""Grievance Day."") appropriate. The notice is given under Limited and was signed on behalf of the company by Mr J. P. O'Neill and Mr Alfred' C. Paddison-the latter is a name well known to us-in the presence of MrH . R. McCauley, the secretary of the company. For the benefit of honourable members, I. shall outline the background of the complaint that I wish to lay before this Parliament in relation to the ejectknowledge in Labour party circles in New South Wales that Labor Motor Funerals Limited has no connection with the Australian Lahour movement. The company is entirely owned and controlled by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) through the directors that I have mentioned. Mr Paddison is well known through the organs of the Lang party in that he is editor of the party's newspaper, Century, which is owned by the honourable, member for Reid. He is also a director of the honourable member's broadcasting station. He also writes most of the speeches made in this House by the honourable member for Reid and he received on behalf of the Lang party money that the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) mentioned some time ago, which was paid",16,Batma N Automatic Telephone Exchange Melbourne

Notices have been issued by Labor Motor Funerals Limited to five people in the Newtown district who have been established there for upwards of twenty years in some cases. There are ex-servicemen amongst those tenants, and if they are evicted from their premises their businesses will face almost complete financial ruin.

64,Mr Daly,"Having listened to thethem. The New South Wales Government's emergency accommodation is already filled, so there is nowhere for these people to go. Generally speaking, therefore, they are placed in the invidious position of facing eviction without having anywhere to go, so that a funeral parlour may be established in the area. I believe that it. woulcl be a tragedy if those people were evicted for that purpose, no matter how desirable or necessary it may be considered to be to establish a funeral parlour there. Surely our predominant objective at the moment should be to house these people. That is the objective of the New South Wales Government. I appeal, therefore, to the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr in which it is stated that one leading Lemmon) to raise this matter with the Minister for Housing in New South Wales to see wihether he can take the necessary legislative action so as to prevent these evictions. I ask also that in the event of the New South Wales Government not having the legislative power to prevent these evictions, the Minister should consider appealing to the better instincts of the honourable member for Beid to see whether he would be willing to instruct his nominees on the board of the company, Mr Paddison and from this very live problem. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [3.20]. A few days ago, I asked a question of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) concerning instructions issued by the Commonwealth Bank to the trading banks about the issue of credits. My question was couched in these terms:I direct a question to tlie Treasurer concerning tlie recently announced policy of the Commonwealth Bank towards advances hy the Australian trading banks. Can the Treasurer say whether the cautious tone of the direction issued to trading banks in connection with advances for enterprise represents an instruction to tighten up policy, in relation to the granting of financial assistance to persons wishing to establish new industries?. In view of the restraining effect that such a policy might have, particularly upon small business men wishing to open new businesses or establish new industries, does not the action of the Commonwealth Bank follow the lines of tbe action allegedly taken by the banks at the time of the 1929 depression, which has so often been criticized by supporters of the present Government? What encouragement can the Treasurer give to the small man who wishes to operate a new business that hc w ill not be debarred from developing it by his own initiative and enterprise as the result of the lack of bank support caused by Government policy? The Prime Minister replied, in part, as follows:I never know what honourable members mean when tbey refer to "" the small trader "". The fact is that a trading bank is not required to refer to the Commonwealth Bank any loan or advance up to an amount of f1,000. Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a "" small "" person from obtaining an advance, except the policy of the trading bank itself. I suggested at the time that the Government's policy might have a restrictive effect upon enterprise, and since then I have received evidence that it has already had that effect. I have received a letter bank, as a result of the instruction received from the Commonwealth Bank, has issued instructions to its own branches that there shall be no more lending on mortgage until further notice. I have also found that people are becoming fearful, and are refraining from starting new businesses. Several instances have come to my notice of retailers sending out notices, even to their regular customers, asking for prompt settlement of. accounts because of the financial position. In other words, the traders are unable to get from the banks the financial accommodation that was forthcoming earlier. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that the Commonwealth Bank has no control over advances of less than £1,000. That may be true, but the restriction of credit in respect of advances over £1,000 has caused a general tightening up. There is another consideration at which I hinted in my question. There exists throughout the world to-day a set of circumstances very closely resembling those which, in the 1920's, culminated in the depression which, in Australia, began in 1929. Already, there has been a decline of 8 per cent, on the New York stock exchange, apart altogether from day to clay fluctuations. On the London stock exchange, the decline is about 15 per cent. Overseas prices for our primary products are declining. This afternoon, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) cited figures which are very disquieting. It was only to be expected that the number of persons registering for unemployment benefit would increase as a result of the",18,Motor Funerals Limited The Common Seal Of Labor Motor Funerals
65,"Mr Mccauley, To L I F T Their Dead Hands","threatened coal strike, and we learned from the Minister that, whereas at the beginning of this month the number of registered unemployed persons was only 9S2 for the whole of Australia, there are now more than 20,000. persons registered in New South Wales alone. Even apart from the effects of the threatened strike, there appears to be a tendency for unemployment figures to increase. Whatever difficulties may be looming ahead, it behoves the Government to be careful in its public announcements, lest it precipito gain political kudos out of cases tate the very crisis which it wishes to avoid. -The honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly) has had the audacity to complain because certain persons were being evicted from premises in Sidney by a firm of funeral directors, when the Government which he supports is itself a worse offender. It proposes to evict from premises in Melbourne many hundreds of persons, some of whom are engaged in the production of commodities needed by primary producers. I have spoken on this matter before. The Government proposes to acquire in the City of Melbourne a block of land 9£ acres in area bounded by Spring-street, Latrobe-street, Exhibitionauthorities throughout Australia should street, and Lonsdale-street. On this block, be apprehensive about the problem of there are 175 buildings, and it is proposed to displace 2,000 persons, 375 of whom are ex-servicemen. The honourable member for Martin spoke of the dead hand of a firm of funeral directors in Sydney, but it is the dead hand of this Government that is about to descend on that great city block in Melbourne. I suppose a funeral parlour mostly affects persons who are dead; but in Melbourne it is proposed to displace living, active and useful people in order to make room for Australian Government deputies which, from a productive point of view, may be said to be partly dead, at any rate. member think that three ex-servicemen which was held last Saturday.

The honourable democratic principles. member for Wimmera must address the Chair. Acting Deputy Speaker, is that honourable members opposite be consistent. If they make a great uproar about three ex-servicemen, they should also make a great uproar about the proposal of tliis Government to evict 375 ex-servicemen from premises in one area of the City of Melbourne. Honourable members opposite are constantly seeking of this kind. This practice, to which I so strongly object, is being followed, not only in Melbourne, but also in cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth. People will be evicted from their premises in order to provide accommodation for the dead hand of Commonwealth departments which are being increased by the Australian Government. Municipal and local governing authorities, despite all the handicaps from which they suffer as the result of the rising spiral of prices, are unable to collect rates from these tenants whose premises are to be acquired. It is not surprising that the local governing financing their undertakings. to be evicted now or in ten years time? -Order! This is not question time.

73,Mr Tuenbull,"I welcome theAnother matter to which I wish to direct attention is the inordinate length of time taken by Ministers in answering questions in this House. The honourable member for Eeid( Mr Lang) has referred to the system under which certain selected nieinbers of the Parliament are permitted to speak between S and 10 p.m.. a time which might be regarded as the "" prima donna "" period. I would like Mr .Deputy Speaker to furnish a statement showing the total time taken by the Ministerf or Informatio n ( Mr Calwell) and the Ministerf or Post-war Eeoonstruction ( Mr Dedman) in answering questions in this House. The most reasonable questions asked by Opposition members are made the basis of long propagandist replies which are calculated to show the Governnient in a good light. -The best way to avoid that is to refrain from asking questions. to silencing honourable members of the Opposition that such answers are given and the longer a Minister takes to reply to a question, the shorter is the remaining time available for the asking of questions. That is a practical example of the socialist steamroller in operation. The steamroller was put into operation again this afternoon. The driver on this occasion was seated in the Chair. If members of the Opposition ask questions for propaganda purposes I do not object if , in reply, a Minister indulges in propaganda; but those who ask straight questions expect to get straight answers. Eecently, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), in his broadcast N a t i o n "" , referred to the millions of pounds that are being expended on the land settlement of ex-servicemen. In the House the Ministerf o r Post-war Reconstruction was able to recite for the information of the honourable memher for Hume( Mr Fuller) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) the exact number of acres provided and to supply f u l l details of many properties acquired for that purpose. The questions asked by the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Wilmot were, of course, aeked solely for propaganda purposes. Eecently, I asked whether the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction .could tell me how many ex-servicemen in. Australia had applied for land under the scheme and how many had actually been placed on the land. The Minister rose to reply, but looked quite bamboozled and said he was not able toanswer the question. If he had f u r nished the information it would have revealed the fact that many thousands of ex-servicemen throughout Australia were still waiting to be settled on the land, and that only a very small number had been allotted properties. The Minister was reluctant to furnish the information I had sought also because it would reveal that a very large percentage of the millions of pounds which the Prime Minister had said had been made available for settling ex-servicemen on the land had been eaten up in administrative expenses. Last year. I questioned the Prime Minister about, an advertisement which appeared in the SwanH ill Guardian seeking donations It is with a view from the people for the election fun d of the Australian Labour party. The advertisement contained some references to the estimated national income and the real income of Australia and included a quotation from the Monthly Summary of Australian Conditions issued by the National Bank of Australasia Limited which, taken from its context, conveyed a very different impression from that intended by the bank. I asked the Prime Minister to investigate the matter. In reply, the right honourable gentleman stated that he had not heard anything about the advertisement, but that he would investigate it and furnish me with a reply at a session ""Eeport to the later date. Whether or not he has investigated the advertisement, I do not know. All I know is that the advertisement was withdrawn and that no answer has been made to my question. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who has been constantly interjecting in an effort, to interrupt my speech, said some time ago that the Government had a plan to bring about greater production. On the following day I asked the Prime Minister whether he would furnish me with details of the plan. The right honourable gentleman replied that there was such a plan and that he would be pleased to give me details",20,Motor Funerals Limited The Common Seal Of Labor Motor Funerals
74,Mr Actingdeputyspeakee .,,21,Motor Funerals Limited The Common Seal Of Labor Motor Funerals
75,Mr Tuenbull,"of the plan. He has not furnished them. The failure of Ministers to answer reasonable questions in a reasonable manner constitutes a very genuine grievance. Too much time is taken uip by Ministers in answering "" DorothyD i x "" questions which are designed solely as propaganda for their departments. This practice interferes unduly w i th the normal activities of the Parliament. I do not believe that those who were responsible for the institution of question time in the House ever dreamed that that period would be used in the way it has been used by Ministers of this Government. Ministers who have at heart the interests of the people should listen with attention and reply in a reasonable manner questions asked by members of H is Majesty's Opposition.

77,Mr Lemmon (Forrest,"Minister f o rmatter is entirely untrue. I am sure that the States will play an extremely important part in theimplementation of the scheme. I hope that their public works departments and roads authorities will he able to assist in carrying out much of the work that will be required to be done. The necessary finance will, of course, be made available to the States hy the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. all the water that will be made available for irrigation purposes will be the responsibility of the States. I hope that they will undertake the construction of power lines for the transmission of electricity that is not required by the Commonwealth. Although the States have indicated that they are prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth along tliose lines, the Leader of the Opposition has stated that they have been completely ignored. The right honourable gentleman quoted from a letter written to the Manchester Guardian in an endeavour to belittle the great work of the Tennessee Valley Authority and said that the return on the capital invested in that project is approximately one-quarter of 1 per cent.' We estimate that the capital expenditure on the Snowy Mountains scheme will yield a return of 3£ per cent., and we have decided that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority shall hc subject to general taxation. The Snowy Mountains scheme will enable power to be produced, at the base, at, only 50 per cent, of the cost at which thermal stations can produce electricity. Despite those important considerations, the Leader of the Opposition waxed humorous about the estimates of cost. Frankly, I was amazed. The right honourable gentleman mentioned that I had made some estimates about the cost of producing hydro-electric power, and he described them as "" sufficiently optimistic "". He remarked that he had observed, with some pleasure, while reading the report of an address which had been delivered at the University of Western Australia, that in it Dr. Loder had made the same estimates in almost identical language. At that stage of his speech, the Leader of the Opposition looked around to receive applause from the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) before he addedI begun to wonder for the first time whose second-reading speech the Minister liad made. As such authorities as the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the State Electricity Commission of New South Wales, the New South Wales Public Works Department and the Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing The reticulation of had investigated the' Snowy Mountains scheme and made those estimates, it would have been strange if I , as Minister, had ignored that expert opinion and given other estimates. The Leader of the Opposition, in seeking applause, has revealed how low he can sink in an effort to indulge in a little cheap humour at the expense of the greatest national project that Australia has known. The Leader of the Opposition also derided the action of the Government in relying upon the Commonwealth's defence power as the constitutional basis of this legislation. The right honourable gentleman appears to be living in the horse-and1 buggy days, and is oblivious of the fact that we are now living in the atomic age. The Australian Government has entered into commitments with the United Kingdom Government in order that we may play our part in Empire defence. In accordance with those obligations, we shall require at least 400,000 kilowatts of electricity in and around Canberra during the next ten or twelve years. The power will be required for defence research, but the Leader of the Opposition sought to extract some humour from the proposal. To-day, we are living in the atomic age. The great Tennessee Valley Authority, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred, had to withstand a legal challenge before the United States Supreme Court prior to World War II . and before the atomic age came upon us. On that occasion, the Supreme Court ruled that the .federal authorities had the power to proceed with schemes for the generation of electric power for the purposes of war. The court considered that the only time such works could be effectively put in hand was in a period of peace. Mr E. J. Higgins, M.L.C, who has recently returned from the United States of America, is reported as having made the following statement:The Tennessee Valley Authority played a big part in the winning of the war by allowing ment, the work would never be coma big bloc of power to be taken inland away from the great cities for the development of atomic weapons. The great Tennessee Valley Authority derives its jurisdiction from the defence power that the United States Government possesses under the Constitution, and its power was confirmed before the outbreak of World War II . Now that the Australian Government desires to proceed with the great Snowy Mountains scheme, in an endeavour to ensure that Australia shall not lag in the race to develop atomic power, the Leader of the Opposition treats the subject in a humorous vein. I deeply regret that the right honourable gentleman's speech was not broadcast yesterday. The listening public would have been astonished at the way in which he dealt with this most important subject. The Leader of the Opposition described clause 25, which relates to thefinancesof the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, as unique. He said that he could not recall an occasion when a similar clause had been incorporated in a bill. He then proceeded to ridicule that provision. I inform the right honourable gentleman that identical provisions were included in the Coal Industry Bill and the Shipping Bill, and he did not criticize them when those measures were before the House. But he has assumed the responsibility of endeavouring to ridicule an identical clause in this bill. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who also endeavoured to deride the bill, doubted whether the Government would be able to obtain the thousands of technicians, who, he considered, would be needed for the construction job. The fact is that thousands of technicians will not be required for the job. As I have said on a previous occasion, the total labour force of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour for the job will be between 3,500 and 4,000 men. I believe that I gave that information to the House when replying to a question by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Fraser). If the Governor. Lemmon. ment were to take the attitude that it should not begin the Snowy Mountains scheme during a period of full employmenced. Work on the guided weapons testing range in Central Australia was begun two years ago, and the honourable member for Richmond could have applied to that project the same objection as that which he has advanced against the Snowy Mountains scheme. Approximately 3,500 men are working on the guided weapons testing range in Central Australia, and the work is ahead of schedule. Are we less capable of undertaking the Snowy Mountains scheme? As university students qualify as engineers and surveyors, and technical college students qualify as artisans, the Snowy Mountains authority will employ them. The honourable member for Richmond may rest assured that the Government will make progress with the construction job. About 90 per cent, of the speech by the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) was a valuable contribution to the debate, but in the remaining 10 per cent., the honourable gentleman could not resist the temptation to criticize the bill. He expressed the hope that the Government was serious when it announced its intention to proceed with the work. The honourable gentleman recalled that no progress had been made with the Government's proposal to standardize railway gauges in Australia. The reason for lack of progress in the standardization of railway gauges is that enabling legislation has to be passed by the State parliaments. It has not been passed by all of them. That sort of legislation will not be necessary for the develojDment of this project. As an earnest of our seriousness, work has already begun on the project. It was begun before the bill was submitted. When I reported to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), I said, ""We have agreement from the States about the major part of the scheme, and we want to place orders for equipment in order that we may go ahead "". The Prime Minister replied, "" As far as I am concerned, finance shall not stand in the way of this great national undertaking "". tary authority!",22,Deput Y Speaker Mr J J An Opportunity To Listen To The Right Honor
78,Mr Mcbbide,"Without parliamenmentary authority! That also proves our sincerity. The amount of £100,000 was allocated to the project by way of treasury advance. The job is under way and the tempo will increase as time passes. I hope that in the lifetime of every honourable member we shall see the streams of the Snowy Mountains area harnessed for the generation of electricity and irrigation. The honourable member for Indi joined with the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) in advocating for this project an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on the lines of the River Murray Agreement. If we had to go through the tortuous process of trying to bring about such an agreement, I do not think my grandchildren would live long enough to see the project begun, to say nothing of its being completed. The States negotiated for 70 or SO years about the use of the Murray waters. I have in my oflice the history of the River Murray Agreement. It was written by a former member of the Rivpv Murray Commission, a Mr Eaton. He sets out in detail the tortuous course that the negotiations followed. Strangely enough, it was Lord Forrest, then Sir John Forrest, whose name my electorate bears, who, in 1902, as Treasurer, brought the States concerned together and got the first agreement about the use of the Murray waters. Buti t was 1915, when the River Murray Waters Act was passed, before anything worthwhile was achieved. Is it seriously suggested that we should risk a like delay in the development of this project by endeavouring to bring the States into line with the Commonwealth on a footing similar to that of the River Murray Waters Act under which the River Murray Commission was established ? Surely not! As a further indication of how difncult it is for the States to agree about matters like this, I refer to the five years of delay that took place before agreetnent was reached on the proposal to increase the height of the wall of the Hume Weir in order to increase its capacity. There was no argument about the allocation of water, riparian rights or administration, because those aspects were already covered in the River Murray Agreement and had existed since 1915, when the commission was established. The only point at issue was the heightening of the wall and the protection of the catchment area. Yet, five years were occupied to negotiate a matter that ought to have been decided in a few weeks. The people of Australia cannot afford further delay in connection with the Snowy Mountains scheme and delay will not be countenanced. The right honourable member for Cowper made a worthwhile contribution to the debate, and I desire to reply to only a few points that were made by him. He said that the work might take 40 years to complete. Perhaps it will. I shall not argue with him on that point, because no one knows exactly how long the work Avill take, but, in my opinion, which is based on the advice of experts, we ought to be able to absolutely complete the job within 25 years. But people will not have to wait that long for power or water for irrigation. Within eight or ten years, the first block of power and water for irrigation will be available. Within that period, we expect to be able to generate 400,000 kilowatts of power and reticulate about 600,000 acre-feet of water. The Murrumbidgee irrigation area in New South Wales now uses 500,000 gallons of water a year, and it required 25 or 30 years for that stage to be reached. I admit that with modern appliances engineers ancl their gangs are able to work faster to-dav than they were able to work in those days. So, within eight or ten years, we should be able to supply sufficient water to enable the size of the Murrumbidgee irrigation area to be doubled. Within another four years, we shall provide 300,000 more acrefeet of water to, the area and we shall make a total addition of 900.000 acre-feet in twelve or fourteen years. The right honourable gentleman also advocated that plant and equipment ordered for this project should also be used for similar projects. That is a good suggestion. I assure the right honourable gentleman that all such equipment as earthmoving machinery and the machines to construct the race lines and bore the tunnels will be made available, as opportunity permits, to State authorities requiring such services for similar undertakings.

It is quite plain that there w ill be many attempts to f a l s if y the attitude of the Opposition to this matter and I therefore restate it in short terms. The Opposition regards the carrying out of this scheme as of first-rate importance and urgency. There need be no ambiguity about that. But the Opposition says, and the statement can stand a lot of repetition, that it believes in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Anstralia. It believes that the Constitution should be observed. It believet that where the Commonwealth has certain functions and powers it ought to perform those functions and wield those powers, and where the States have powers and functions, they should dolikewise.

85,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofthrough it by the sheer financial power of the Commonwealth, but by a vote of the people deliberately arrived at. I seem to remember the Minister saying once, although I shall not say when, that the Opposition was trying to drive a wedge between the Commonwealth States. Government is driving the States out of the business altogether. It is all very well to say that one State government or another is quite agreeable to this scheme. I say quite frankly that I am not concerned for a moment with whether one State government is agreeable or not. If every State government happened to be in such a state of mind or of politics that it agreed with the violation of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. I should still say, ""I am for the Constitution "", and so would other honourable members on this side of the committee. that the Commonwealth, defence provide electric light and power for the Australian justified in taking as its sole responsibility the creation of a hydro-electric scheme that is primarily designed to satisfy the industrial needs of New South Wales and. Victoria? Does anybody seriously pretend that that is an exercise of the Commonwealth's power? A babe in arms could not pretend that it was so. But what the Government has done is to say to itself, "" This is a popular project. Everybody will want it to go on and therefore we shall be'able to use that positive, affirmative and approving public opinion to induce people to say that it does not matter if we are violating the Constitution because it is all in a good cause."" I say to the committee and to the people of Australia that if this scheme can be put forward as purely and simply a Commonwealth project, with no legislative co-operation on the part of the States to bring their powers into the pool pf power, there is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from establishing steel works to-moTrow. If anybody on the Government side of the committee really wants to address himself to this problem; he might well do so, because if this is sound, as a' proposition of and the Constitution, after all, is the Mr Menzies. basic law of this country-the n the Commonwealth could establish vast steel works even to the limit of monopoly, using 95 per cent, of the product of the works for ordinary commercial purposes' and justify.the whole thing as a Commonand ' the wealth project by saying, "" We shall I should say rather that the require the other 5 per cent, for munitions factories and certain Commonwealth and war purposes "". If this is to be the new Constitution of Australia, the people, might as well be told about it in plain terms. It is, I think, rather unfortunate that the Minister should have become so taken up with the obvious benefits of this scheme that he appears to resent any criticism of it. Ours is a basic criticism, not of the scheme as a scheme, because the scheme itself is of the first order and commends itself to everybody, but of the way in which the Government has gone about this whole matter. We would do well to remind ourselves that Is it really pretended there are two schools of thought in Ausunder its tralia to-day. One school says, "" Aggrepower and its power to gate every stick of power that you can in the central government until ultimately Capital Territory, is you have the lot"". If I were a socialist, that would be my policy. socialist policy. school of thought strongly growing in this country, I am happy to say, that says, "" Unless you maintain a limit of power on the Commonwealth, unless you divide authority and respect the limit's of authority, the ordinary freedom of the ordinary man will suffer "". What earthly reason is there Avhy the Commonwealth should not have gone to the States in connection with this project as it went to New South Wales in connection with the coal industry? connection with the aluminium industry. coal problem arose what did the Commonwealth do ? It did not say, "" We shall take charge of all this because coal is vital for defence and for the production of electrical power for Commonwealth projects"".

That is how the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal were established and began to function. But when it comes to this great scheme, the constitutionality of which ought to be placed beyond the slightest shadow of doubt, the States are merely brought in for conferences and are not asked to do anything about it otherwise. The Commonwealth, with its disregard for the Constitution, says, "" We have the money, we shall put the scheme in hand and who will there be to challenge or criti cize it ? "" I remind this Government that in the last year or two, whether it was due to .the fault of some of its Ministers or not I do not know, it has had a rather unhappy experience in grabbing at power. I rise to make only one observation.

The TEMPORARY ( Mr Sheehan) -That is correct. the Opposition spoke recently on this matter he said that it was absurd to base this scheme on the defence power because, at the most, 5 per cent, of the power generated fro m the Snowy Mountains scheme would be used directly for defence purposes.

The Leader of the Opposition admitted, I think, that even he could not support the amendment of th© right honourable member for Oowper( Sir Earle Page), but he pointed out that it would give him an opportunity to discuss certain matters and, in particular, the form in which the' bill had been prepared' for presentation to the House. The Minister for ""Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) dealt quite adequately with the proposition of the right honourable member for Cowper. It is obvious that if certain associate members are added to the commission as representatives of the States they would, in fact, take a State outlook, when what we require is a national outlook. Moreover, if they were to have any value as State representatives they would have to receive instructions from their State governments, while all the time being, in fact, servants of the Commonwealth. I remind the right honourable member for Cowper that a much wiser Person than I said, "" No man can serve two masters "". The point at issue could have been more appropriately discussed on the pre1 amble to the bill, but, since it has been raised at this stage by the Leader of the Opposition, I propose to make a few observations on it. The right honourable gentleman said that the bill was a violation of the Constitution. He said that if the defence power could be invoked to justify the generation by the Commonwealth of hydro-electric power, then it could also be invoked to justify the Commonwealth in embarking on the production of steel. There is no comparison between the two things. scheme is related to defence, it is because share of the cost of defending the British tlie National Governnient has a duty to ensure that the war potential of Australia is expanded as much as possible. The quantity of electric power now available and in sight is totally inadequate to meet the demands that would be made upon it if Australia were again engaged in war. On the other hand, the present and planned production of steel is enough to meet all our requirements, either in peace or war, for many years. Mr Dedman. steel is being imported from Japan at a cost of £42 a ton. Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) is referring to a temporary shortage of steel. I know a good deal about the plans of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited to expand the production of steel in this country, but some of the information was given to me in confidence, and I do not propose to divulge it here. T. am satisfied that Australia's requirements in steel will be adequately met from the present production and future development of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. The Leader of the Opposition said that the bill was a violation of the Constitution. He knows perfectly Avell that in time of war the entire industrial resources of a country are required to back up the war effort. Any government which neglects to develop to the full the country's industrial potential in time of peace will find itself in a dangerous position in time of war. increasing the strength of the Army! member for Henty( Mr Gullett) can think of as a preparation for Avar is to introduce compulsory military training. I say emphatically that the proposal now before us will, Avhen implemented, be a thousand times more valuable as a preparation for a future Avar than the training of all the available men in Australia to-day. The Government has given much attention to this matter during the last tAvo years. In statements on defence policy I have said that AusInsofar as this tralia has undertaken to bear a greater Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite are always talking about what Australia ought to do to help in the defence of the British Commonwealth, but Avhen we put forward concrete proposals they say that the proposals have nothing to do with defence preparations. I propose to read some extracts from memoranda prepared by the Defence Department, and submitted to this Parliament from time to time.",29,Chairman Direct Defence Purposes Under Agreement

102,Mr Gullett,Then what about,30,Chairman Direct Defence Purposes Under Agreement
103,Mr Dedman,"Al l the honorablebave not been submitted. bave explained why. Speaking on defence on a former occasion, I saidSubject to the authority of Cabinet and the Council of Defence, the Minister and Department of Defence are responsible forThe formulation and general application of a unified Defence Policy relating to the Defence Forces and tlieir requirements, including(a) Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence and the Defence aspect of the Charter of the United Nations. (6) The supply aspect of Defence Policy, including the review of production programmes and capacity. (c) The scientific aspect of Defence Policy. It is evident, therefore, that the measure before us is related to our defence policy in two ways. It is related to the scientific aspect, and also to the country's industrial potential. Honourable members have been informed that the Government has set aside £250,000,000 for defence purposes to be expended over five years, of which £33,500,000 is to be devoted to defence scientific research. A large proportion of the money w ill be expended on the guided weapons testing range in South Australia, but there are other projects which we are considering in conjunction with the Government of the United Kingdom. Some are comparatively small, but there are one or two big projects which would require very large quantities of electric power. I do not say that any decision has been made on these matters up to date; they are under consideration. been considering them for three years, and has done nothing. ber must know that in these matters we are co-operating with the UnitedK in g dom, and it is not for us, but for the Government of the United Kingdom, to say whether a particular problem shall be tackled. We are not free to say that we will go ahead with such and such a scheme to-morrow. The time depends upon the decision of the predominant partner. There w ill be no delay in this country once a decision has been taken. The only point I am making now is that are under consideration, which, if underT b a t is so, and I taken, would entail the use of very large quantities of electric power to carry them through. Therefore, under that heading alone the Government is justified in linkin g this measure with the defence power in the Constitution. We have also to consider the country's industrial potential. Honourable members will recall that, not long ago, there was set up in the Defence Department an organization known as the Joint War Production Committee, with Mr John Storey, a very capable industrialist, as chairman. The committee is exactly similar to one set up in the UnitedK in gdom, so that what we are doing in Australia in the way of developing our industrial potential for defence purposes is not unrelated to what is being done in the United Kingdom. Every effort is being made to co-ordinate our efforts with those of the defence authorities in Britain. One of the functions of the production committee is to examine the country's industrial potential, including present production capacity and available resources. The war potential, from the defence aspect, is related to strategic considerations, and the priorities which should be applied. Planningf o r the defence of the British Commonwealth entails an examination of strategic plans. On an earlier occasion, I intimated that, after consultation with the UnitedK in gdom Government and in co-operation with that government, a decision had been made that plans should be prepared for the development of Australia as a main support area. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The Minister's time has expired. It has been rather interesting to hear the conflicting views expressed by two members of the Government on this subject.

The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) has just intimated that it would be a terrible thing for the States to interfere in the work. He endeavoured to darken the counsel in this place by making a long dissertation about what constitutes a defence project.

If we deal with it properly, it will stand on its own feet. After seven or eight years of cent, of the total output. The Minister ministerial office, the Minister should know better. When the Commonwealth operated the Cockatoo Dock and undertook work for the private shipping companies it was told that it had no authority to do so and, as a result, the dock was leased to private enterprise. The Minister has charged us with parochialism. There is no more suggestion of parochialism in our attitude towards this proposal than there was in our stand on the project for the standardization of railway gauges between Sydney and Brisbane. Have the men who are working on the river Murray waters scheme ever quarrelled about the inclusion of the States in that scheme? That sclieme has been in progress since 1915-for as long as an ordinary marriage lasts-and the work has proceeded in a most satisfactory way. Now, however, it has been suggested that we should ignore the States. It has been said that if the States are brought into this scheme, we shall not be able to get on with the job. If it was considered to be necessary to secure the consent and co-operation of the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria in relation to the river Murray waters scheme during the war period, when the Commonwealth's defence power was unquestioned, surely it is a thousand times Sir Earle Page. more necessary to seek the co-operation of the States in relation to the Snowy Mountains scheme at a time when there is considerable doubt about the legality of the continued use of the defence power. I deprecate the suggestion that anythingthat I say, or that the Leader of the Opposition may have said, indicates that we are not wholeheartedly behind this scheme. We want the people of Australia to understand that we believe that the right way to achieve our objectives is by co-operation with and not by domination The Minister's sole of the States. What the Minister has said about the defence power therefore goes by Perhaps the board. The honourable gentleman said that the Australian Capital Territory and I said that he endeavoured defence projects will utilize approximately 400,000 kilowatts of the power to Degenerated by the Snowy Mountains project. The honourable member for EdenThis Leader of the Opposition for assuming that the Australian Capital Territory and defence projects would use 20 per for Works and Housing has estimated that the total output of power from theproject is expected to be 1,700,000 kilowatts. Thus, the estimated usage of the Australian Capital Territory and defence projects is 23 per cent. The poorold Leader of the Opposition has been "" whacked "" by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro because he was a mere 3: per cent, out in his calculation! The great bulk of the electric current to be generated will be used for other than defence purposes and the requirementsof the Australian Capital Territory. The diverted waters of the Snowy will alsobe used solely for rural developmental purposes. I am anxious to see the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority established on a proper basis from the commencement of this scheme. I do not want this authority to be associated in some mythical way with the Seat of Government AcceptanceAct. I want this great public work to become the pattern on which every great jmblic work of a like character which weundertake in the future will be based. I appeal to the Government to reconsider its decision on this matter. Defence and Minister for Post-war",31,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

If we are to develop Australia as a main support area in this zone, it is inevitable that the Commonwealth must pay some attention to our industrial potential, because it is only fro m Australia that a war effort by the British Commonwealth of Nations in this area could be sustained. The Defence Committee has devoted very f u l l attention to this matter.

Finally, in a series of observations on its recommendations the Defence Committee statedAnother important feature of the functions of the Joint War Production Committee relates to tlie Defence aspect of the war potential. This does not impinge in any way on the responsibility of the Department of Supply and Development to establish and maintain government factories and to organize the industrial war potential. . . The approved basis of provisioning for the stocks and reserves to be carried in peace is bound up with the production potential, and the defence view on both is governed by strategic considerations. his second-reading speech, that the power I have endeavoured to make it clear succeeded in doing so. to understand anything. I have endeavoured to make it clear that it is the duty of the Government to endeavour to expand the industrial capacity of this country so that we shall have a war potential sufficient to back up any war effort which this country, in conjunction with the Tjnited Kingdom, may have to make in the event of another war. Plans to expand our industrial potential and, therefore, our war potential form an integral part of the strategic planning between ourselves and the United Kingdom. From that angle and also from the angle of defence scientific research, there is every justification for the Government's action in proposing to embark upon this great undertaking under the authority of the defence power in the Constitution.

I say that it will be nothing of the kind. Every reasonable person welcomes a scheme for thc provision of more water for irrigation and the generation of more electricity. scheme from that point of view. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has been maligned and misrepresented by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Fraser) and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who said that he did not want this scheme to be proceeded with. What the right honourable gentleman said was that the Government is dragging in the old story of the defence power, as it did in regard to shipping and aluminium, in order to get greater authority for itself. The electrical generating plant in Victoria is largely concentrated in one area, Yallourn, where Sir John Monash harnessed the brown coal resources of Victoria would no longer be the industrial vassal of New South Wales. Tlie output of that project is being doubled by extensions at Morwell. In addition, Victoria has the Eildon and Kiewa hydro-electric schemes. One would think to hear the speeches of honourable members opposite that this Government has suddenly discovered this source of power in Australia. The defence aspect of the scheme is being used as an excuse for the usurpation of power by the Commonwealth. Grandiose words are used in the bill. The preamble contains the following recital:And whereas it is desirable that the generagentleman believes that that is so, he tion of electricity . . . should be undershould in the interests of his country, taken in such an area aud in such a manner as to be least likely to suffer interruption in time of war.

He should not seek to fall back on a kind of Maginot Line. .Schemes of this character, which have a commercial value and some defenc value because they increase our industrial potential, should not be used to "" put something over "" the States and the people. -The Opposition has raised two bogies in relation to this scheme. First, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has said that, in his opinion, it is strategically unsound, and therefore, from the point of view of defence, it would not be desirable to expend £200,000,000 upon it. If the honourable",34,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

122,Mr White,This socialist Govern,35,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects
123,Mr Thompson (Hindmarsh) [5.7].,"oppose this measure. The other bogy that has been raised is that the States should have a bigger say' in the scheme. In my experience, when the States and the Commonwealth combine to put a big scheme into operation, each of the parties to the agreement pays a percentage of the cost. I do not think that at the present time any of the States would be willing to assume the responsibility of paying a proportion of the huge sum of money that will be expended on the Snowy Mountains scheme. If they were willing to do so, doubtless the State governments would have told the 'Commonwealth that this legislation is an interference with their rights and that it should not be proceeded with. The only opposition to the present proposals has come from honourable gentlemen opposite, who have queried the right of the Commonwealfch to do what is proposed and have suggested that the States should have a say in the scheme. very clearly by the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) that the States will play a part in the scheme. They will be responsible for the use of the water that will be made available. Almost the whole of the Snowy River area in which the work will be done is in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government will have the task of reticulating the water that will be made available to New South Wales. The Minister -quoted ngures to show that in the Murrumbidgee irrigation area The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! -The honourable gentleman is not entitled to refer in committee to the Minister's second-reading speech. of water that will be made available to New South Wales under the scheme will enable the size of the Murrumbidgee irrigation area to be doubled within -eight or ten years. While the Commonwealth is proceeding with the work that is envisaged, at a huge expenditure, the New South Wales Government will have the task of preparing an irrigation scheme in the Murrumbidgee area. I do not think that Victoria is concerned with the Snowy waters except insofar as the operation of the scheme will affect the volume of water that now flows down the Murray and is used in Victoria. TJnder these proposals, however, the volume of water which will flow down the Murray will be increased. The Victorian -Government will have its work cut out to make provision for the proper utilization of that extra water. Honourable gentlemen opposite who contend that the States should have some say in this matter have overlooked the fact that four parties are involved in this business. The first is the Commonwealth, which must undertake the constructional work. The second party is New South Wales, because huge areas of that State will benefit from the scheme. The third party is Victoria, which also will benefit from the extra supplies of water and electricity that will be made available to it. The fourth party is South Australia, which will benent from the water that will be diverted into the Murray and which can be used for irrigation projects in that State. If ""We have been told it is argued that the States should have a say in this scheme, is it not logical to argue also that the Commonwealth should have a say in the use to which the extra supplies of water are put in the States? Should the Commonwealth be represented in the Departments of the State governments that will deal with the use of that water ? This scheme has a defence value. For that reason alone, the validity of the bill should not be in doubt. Let us consider the proposition that industries for defence purposes will not be linked with this work. For many years, non-Labour parties have advocated the use of the waters from the Snowy River catchment area for irrigation purposes in Victoria and New South Wales. The failure of New South Wales to develop that valuable source of water supply indicates that the magnitude of the project has been beyond the financial resources of that State. Victoria and South Australia, which would derive considerable advantage from increased supplies of water for irrigation purposes, have not attempted to co-operate with New South Wales in developing the resources of the Snowy River catchment area. The Commonwealth has now resolved to undertake the work. Let us be "" b i g "" Australians, and admit that the Snowy",35,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects
124,Mr Thompson,"The extra amountMountains sclieme is a national undertaking that will enable an enormous expansion of production in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The Australian Government is responsible for thc finances of the country, because, under the uniform income tax legislation, it is the sole taxing authority, and it reimburses the States for the loss of their power to impose taxes. The cost of the Snowy Mountains scheme will be between £175,000,000 and £200,000,000, and, therefore, finance will be a most important factor in the project. Only the Australian Government, which has the backing of the nation, can provide the necessary money. Let us forget, for a few moments, the attitude that some of the States may adopt toward the proposal. If the States had considered that they should undertake the scheme, they would have taken the preliminary steps years ago. But the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr wealth in this scheme. I venture to suggest Lemmon) has explained that two Victorian Ministers have expressed their agreement with the bill. I assume that the Government of New South Wales is also agreeable to the Commonwealth undertaking the work. tion, it ill-becomes honourable members opposite to claim that New South Wales and Victoria should be partners in the scheme. It is an old maxim in business that before a person argues ahout who his partner will be, he should ascertain whether the other person is willing to be his partner. I am not aware that the Government of New South Wales and the Government of Victoria are anxious to be partners with the Commonwealth in carrying out the Snowy Mountains scheme. I believe that those States are satisfied to allow the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility for it, and to undertake the work. All honourable members are in agreement with the principle underlying this bill, and admit that the utilization of the waters of the Snowy Mountains catchment area will enable production to be expanded in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The Snowy Mountains scheme is of nation-wide interest. In South Australia, which is hundreds of miles from the Snowy Eiver catchment area, Labour party committees have debated the merits of that proposal, and the Bradfield plan for providing water for central Australia. People in other States consider that work on the project should be begun, but they are not keen for their State governments to have a finger in the pie. Some authority must accept the financial responsibility for the work, and carry out the job. Although schemes for utilizing the waters of the Snowy River have been discussed for many years, the Commonwealth is the first authority to taken even the preliminary steps to launch a definite project. The Commonwealth now says tp the States, in effect, "" In the interests of the future of this country, we shall go on with the work. The job will not be delayed through differences of opinion as other projects have been delayed"". Let us suppose that New South Wales and Victoria were partners with the Commonthat the same difficulty would arise as has arisen in the plans to standardize railway gauges. An understanding was reached by the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States that that imI f that is the posiportant national work should be undertaken. When the States were informed of their commitments, New South Wales said, in effect, ""We shall not derive any benefit from the standardization of railway gauges, and, therefore, we are not prepared to commit ourselves to this expenditure "". Some States would almost certainly adopt a similar attitude if they were invited to be partners with the Commonwealth in the Snowy Mountains scheme. If the States had to carry any responsibility for financing the Snowy Mountains scheme, endless delay would result. South Wales signed the agreement for the standardization of railway gauges. Labour government, and not a Liberal government, signed that agreement, but it is now refusing to introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to it. However, the chamber is not considering that subject at the present time. I have been merely drawing an analogy between the delay that has occurred in respect of the",36,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

126,Mr Thompson,"I admit that a proposal for the standardization of railway gauges, and the delays that would occur over the Snowy Mountains scheme if the States became partners with the Commonwealth in that project. TJnder the present bill, the Commonwealth will do the work in the best interests of the nation. remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) are a pleasant contrast to those of most Government supporters, who have concentrated on abusing the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and misrepresenting his views on this proposal. I welcome the speech by the honourable member for Hindmarsh because he had the fairness to admit that every honourable member supports this bill whole-heartedly and congratulates the Government upon its aims. Naturally, we support the Snowy Mountains scheme, because it is, in essence, one of the greatest developmental schemes that have ever been submitted to this Parliament. The point at issue now is that the Snowy Mountains scheme is not called a developmental work. Members of the Opposition object to the attempt to describe the work as a defence project. Why is it being called a defence project ? As the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) have pointed out, it is being called a defence project, and is treated as such, so that the Commonwealth may control it, and, in turn, control the States. Honourable members opposite do not hesitate to express, from time to time, their views about the reduction of the sovereign powers of the States. Supporting this project as we do, I cannot see, at this stage, any reasons for becoming excited, as the honourable meniber for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) has become. After all, we do not imagine that the Commonwealth is about to proceed with the work. The necessary labour, machinery and materials including steel and coal, have not yet been provided for the job. This bill will merely establish the. Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority. As far as honourable memibers can judge at present, this bill will place the Commonwealth in the same position as it occupies in respect of legisthe bill. I do not believe that the United lation dealing witli the standardization of railway gauges and the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia. In many respects, this bill is a piece of window-dressing for the forthcoming general election. I am prepared to take a wager now that before we go to the polls, an honourable member opposite will be photographed in the act of turning the first sod in the Snowy Mountains area, and the photograph will be published in the press and otherwise circulated throughout the Commonwealth. But that will be the extent of the work. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member must relate his remarks to the clause under consideration. Opposition has queried the statement by the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) that the Snowy Mountains scheme is primarily a defence project. I support the views that the Leader of the Opposition has expressed on that aspect. This Government has notoriously been most tardy and "" gutless "" in defence matters. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! This clause does not deal with defence matters. It relates to the appointment of a commissioner and two associate commissioners. your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, I shall not pursue that aspect, and I shall turn to some of the arguments which the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) have used in support of this clause. Both Ministers have declared that the Snowy Mountains scheme is a defence project, because the United Kingdom Government has asked the Australian Government to undertake certain work in connection with Empire defence. I merely comment that had the United Kingdom Government asked the Australian Government to undertake a work of such magnitude in the interests of Empire defenoe, Ave Avould have heard a great deal about it before a passing reference A\as made to the subject this r afternoon in order to justify a point Avhich had arisen in a minor clause of Kingdom Government bas asked the Australian GoA'ernment to undertake this",37,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

129,Mr Gullett,"In accordance withwork. TLat statement was thought up and thrown into the debate at the last minute in an attempt to justify the basis of the whole project. The Minister for Defence used an expression to the effect that Australia was becoming a main support area in an integrated scheme for Empire defence. ""What on earth does that mean! I am most anxious to know the answer to that question. How can Australia he a main support area when all that we have is a scheme for the provision of a great hydro-electric power plant. The bill deals almost exclusively with the Snowy Authority. Australia has not the necessary ships, man-power or weapons to be a main support area in an integrated scheme for Empire defence. However, I shall not elaborate that point. It is too ridiculous to warrant further comment. The Minister for Defence has also stated that we must pay great attention to the war industrial potential of the country. There are certain matters in relation to the industrial potential of this country that should occupy the attention of the Government at the present time. Our coal-fields are a great source of power, but through the inaction of the Government, our power resources are at a lower point than they have ever been in the past. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. Order!

Gullett), whom I almost invariably have It was challenged in the Supreme Court T48] the unhappy experience of following in debate, has made one good statement. He said, in effect, that he would rather see this scheme go ahead in its present form than not to go ahead at all. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) will agree with that statement, which represents advanced thinking compared with the views of other members of the Opposition about the Snowy Mountains project. I believe that this scheme would never have come to pass on its present scale if the Commonwealth had not taken the initiative. If it had been left to the States to decide Mountains Hydro-electric it would have been like so many other things that we have left to them. We should never have got unanimity of thought and action. Nothing would have been done. Honourable members opposite are not decrying the need for defence as such, but they are decrying defence of this type, which has to do with the generation of electric power. What would electric power be used for in a defence programme, of which this hydro-electric scheme is a part ? It would be used to provide power for atomic research. Honourable members opposite talk about defence in the terms of soldiers, guns and bayonets which, in this atomic age, shows that they have a Maginot-line complex. Hearing them talk about defence, one would never think that the atomic age has arrived. Mr BE AUS -Why has Russia maintained an army of 13,000,000 men?

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member may not refer in committee to speeches made in the second-reading debate. . Minister's remarks on this clause. If we cannot prepare for war on a State basis with any likelihood of success, or win a 1 war on a State basis, but are able to do BO only on a Commonwealth basis, we could certainly never carry through a scheme of this magnitude on a State basis. That is the answer, I think, to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) of the defence aspect of the bill. The right honorable gentleman, with his legal mind at work, tried to make out that we are trampling down State sovereignty. Only two States, New South Wales and Victoria, are directly involved in the scheme. That is the sort of tripe that we hear so often from the Opposition. If the Constitution, does not permit us to plan for atomic defence by the creation of hydro-electric power, there is something wrong with the Constitution. It ia fantastic to think that we could ever get agreement among the States on all details of such a project as this. We have been discussing it in Australia for 80 years. Now, when the Commonwealth comes forward with a plan, cut and dried after tremendous thought and planning and a great number of conferences between Ministers, the Opposition does not want the plan to go ahead in its present form. But it has not given us an alternative plan. The amendment is not an alternative. only designed to delay the scheme. Time is of the essence of the contract. So much is involved in the completion of the plan, particularly the first phase of it, that time is a vital consideration. I was glad to hear the Minister for Works and Housing tell honourable members that work on the scheme has 'already begun. In spite of what the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) has said, the first work has been done. When I was in Tumut recently, I saw the first gang go out on to the job. I shall not believe that the Opposition is I was referring to the sincere in its desire that Australia should be adequately defended if it continues to ridicule the defence aspect of this project, for there is no doubt that the resources that will be available when the job has been completed, or even half completed, will make a tremendous contribution to our defence potential. Defence has more to do with what electricity can produce than it has with armies. SoI hope that we shall agree to this clause in such a way as wili show to the people of Australia that we want to go on with the project on a Commonwealth basis and that we do not want to resort to the humbug of having half a dozen different authorities all disagreeing about it. think the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) has said precisely, accurately and truthfully that some of the statements of the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) about this scheme were in the nature of windowdressing for the general election. An expensive booklet about the scheme has been prepared and distributed to us. I point out to those who have not taken the trouble to look through it that it contains little about Commonwealth and State the Snowy Mountains scheme.

141,Mr Beale,"There is a picture ofwhat it is. There is a public works -committee of this Parliament whose function is to inquire into great puhlic works that are submitted to it. The committee has to report the result of its inquiries to the Parliament. Significantly, this, the greatest of all public works to be proposed in Australia has not been submitted to the committee for inquiry, and it prohably will never be; but, if the scheme were a living scheme and something that was about to be put into operation, or, as the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr by way of a warning. I direct the attenDuthie) has said, is actually in operation, one would have expected that the Public Works Committee, which is the watchdog for the publie and is required to investigate the desirability and costs of public works projects, would have been asked to investigate the project and report the result of its investigations to the Parliament. I venture to suggest, therefore, that this measure is a foreshadowing of something that the Government hopes to do. In that respect, it haa my blessing; but it has been brought down now as a piece of window-dressing for the general election so that honourable members opposite may be able to go before the people and say, "" What a wonderful Government you have. We are about to give you millions of kilowatts of power "". could say that? There is not a member on this side of the committee who does not hope that it will come true, but at present we are having served up to us a great deal of propaganda, but not a really eut-anddried scheme. The primary reason for my rising to speak is to support the remarks of the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), who was described by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) as ""the poor old Leader of the Opposition "". I think that description is apt, in view of some of the arguments that he has had to listen to to-day. old dog yet. this way. First, we all want to see the Snowy Mountains scheme completed. Secondly, we all want it to be constitutional because, if we do not get it in a constitutional way, we are not likely to get it at all. That was the whole burden of the right honourable gentleman's remarks, as I understood them, on this clause, and in the relevant part of his second-reading speech. It is useless to embark on something that is likely to be blown out of court later, as this scheme may be. All that we offer to the cominittee ie something tion of honorahle memhers and the country to the fact that we did not vote against the second-reading of the hill. Therefore, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) was correct and fair when he said that all parties gave the scheme their blessing. Any attempt by the Australian Labour party, on the hustings or elsewhere, to suggest that we are against the idea will be false and paltry. We favour it. Because we want it, we want it to he constitutional. If this bill concerned a proposal for the generation of hydro-electric ipower at the Cotter Biver for use in the lighting of Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory and for the operation of factories and plants established in the Australian Capital Territory for the manufacture of war materials, the measure would be clearly within the defence power of the Commonwealth and its powers under the Seat of Government Acceptance Act. Further, if surplus power were sold to consumers outside the territory, the whole project might reasonably be held to be within the defence power. At any rate, if the project were challenged, the only part that could fall to the ground would be trifling and the rest would stand. The .position facing us is just the opposite. On the Government's own admission, about 20 per cent, of the power generated in the Snowy Mountains area will be used for defence purposes and the rest, under section 39 of the bill, will be sold to outside customers. The validity of that part of the scheme is very likely to be subject to challenge. It might be the challenged by some one who considered that his rights were infringed, and the case would go to the High Court.",40,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

145,Mr Beale,"I support my leader inTlxen, the High Court might be forced to say that however desirable and meritorious the project was, it did not fall within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, because it did not come within the defence placitum, and that if it did not come within the defence placitum, it did not come under any placitum of the Constitution and that it miust therefore fall to the ground. It is for that reason that we say, "" Why not tackle t.iis thing in a different way? Why not go to the States? Why not go along to the States and get their co-operation ?"" The Government says the States are in agreement with it about the scheme. Then why not make an agreement with Victoria and New South Wales and get them to pass complementary legislation so that, as in the case of the Joint Coal Board, there would be New South Wales and Victorian acts covering the field of power held by those Governments and a Commonwealth act covering the field of Commonwealth power. Together those acts would cover the whole field. By doing that the Government could obtain exactly the same result as it will obtain by what it intends to do by this bill, but its authority to go ahead with the work would be on a firm basis, instead of a basis of doubtful legality as at present. The Opposition's proposal that the Government should enlist the aid of the States is one that is designed to support and not to destroy the scheme. cau see no danger in the present proposals. I understand that Victoria and New South Wales are in agreement with the Commonwealth regarding this scheme, and, in my opinion, it is essential that it should be begun immediately. The water that it will produce is very badly required-, both in the Murrumbidgee and Murray areas, and the 'power that it will produce is required not only for industry but also for people throughout the whole of the country areas that the scheme will serve. The people in those areas are crying out for electricity. The only thing that I find lacking in the bill is some relation of the cost of the electricity to be sold to the States to the cost of providing it, so as to prevent the Commonwealth from using this scheme as a taxingmachine, as it has done with the Postal Department and some"" other public utilities. That is the only fear I have in regard to the bill, and I hope that the Minister will devote some attention to that aspect and give us some assurance that the scheme will not be allowed to be used either by this Government or some future goA'ernment as a .taxing machine. The scheme should be gone on with immediately, as I have said, and I am sure the States will welcome its results. Victoria has gone further with regard to irrigation than any other State. That State has a great number of engineers and staff capable of carrying out huge works of this kind, and I hope that they will co-operate with the Commonwealth in building this great undertaking. I have no objection to the bill. [5.54] I have become accustomed over the years to hearing honourable gentlemen on the Government side, when they are trying to give legislative effect to something that is hopelessly unconstitutional, plead with us to take a broad national outlook on the matter. As soon as I hear the words ""broad national outlook"" I begin to look around to try to find just why a broad national outlook is necessary. It is evident that if a measure can be justified by constitutional means there is no necessity for an appeal to pathos and for a broad national outlook. I have listened with interest to some of the contradictory statements that have been made during the committee's consideration of this measure. We had the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) assuring us that the closest consultations had taken place with the States and that he had had State Cabinet Ministers as advisers in relation to the scheme. There is nothing about that in the bill. Then we had private memhers on the Government side asserting, both before and after the Minister made that statement, that it Avas impossible to get co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth, and so it was hopeless to talk of conferences or having representatives of the States acting with Commonwealtb representatives in relation to this matter. On the one hand we have been assured that co-operation has taken place, although there is no evidence of it in the bill, and on the other hand we haA'e heen told that no co-operation is possible. Then",41,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

147,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"we had the interesting spectacle of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) taking charge of the show. He delivered two speeches in which he was good enough to tell us about something that had happened at the last conference of Empire Prime Ministers, and he quoted from a blue book which, he said, contained matters in relation to our defence position that were very confidential. I felt during his two speeches that what he was trying to do was to get around the Constitution. He did not say anything about having a broad national outlook. I suppose as he is Scottish that he decided also to be somewhat practical, and that what he is trying to do is to use a national work as a means of attaining a party objective even if to do so he has to dodge the provisions of the Constitution. He is not concerned about getting the Snowy Mountains scheme started. The real motives behind the bill in its present form are first, to get around the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, and secondly, to empower the present Government, which no doubt hopes to be in office for three years after the next election, to do things connected with private property that it could not do otherwise. Let us examine what is meant by a policy of nationalization. The Minister for Defence was good enough to say that the Australian Government had undertaken certain obligations in regard to the development of secondary industries and power resources so that they could be used as the strategic basis of any future military operations that it might become necessary for this country to undertake. That is not the only matter of strategic importance in connection with which this Parliament has legislated. I remind the committee of the fact that in 1946 this Parliament passed an act dealing with the control of atomic energy. F shall be very delighted to hear from the Government what it has done under that act. If there was anything that was supposed to be of transcendent importance in 1946, it was the proposition that the Commonwealth should have the greatest possible control over all minerals and materials that might be used to produce nuclear fission. In South Australia there are very well-known deposits of such material. I was a member of a committee, as was the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy), that made a visit to these deposits. Yet the development of nuclear resources in Australia has been left entirely to the Government of South Australia, notwithstanding the law that is on the Commonwealth statute-book giving the Australian Government power to control and develop nuclear energy. So that there shall not be any mistake about this particular matter, I shall put a series of questions about it on the notice-paper in order to discover what the iGovernment has done with the powers that it took so unctuously in 1946. I have a strong suspicion that the answer, which I do not expect to receive for two or three months, will be ""Nothing"". Leader of the Opposition's comment on the extent to which the nationalization policy of the Government could be carried was seriously misrepresented or misunderstood by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser). What the Leader of the Opposition said was that if the present scheme can be justified constitutionally there is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth taking over the steel industry on a 100 per cent, basis notwithstanding that only 5 per cent, of the product of the industry was needed for defence purposes. What the Leader of the Opposition said regarding the Snowy Mountains scheme was that he doubted whether more than 20 per cent, of the power produced by it would be needed for defence purposes. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro either misquoted the Leader of the Opposition, did not hear correctly what he said, or relied on second-hand information. I hope that he did not deliberately misquote the right honourable gentleman. If the Government is. able, under the Constitution as it now stands, to take charge of the Snowy Mountains scheme and carry it out regardless of the rights of the States or of private individuals who own property in the area which will be affected, then there is no limit to the powers capable of being exercised by the Government so long as it states that such powers",42,Camebon An D Some Certain Defence Scientific Research Projects

149,Mr Abchie Camebon,"Th eare being exercised in the interests of the country's defence. I point out that operations of a military character, or such strategical operations as those to which the Minister for Defence has alluded, cannot possibly be carried out unless we have food and clothing. So it would be competent for the Minister for Defence or his successor or a colleague in the Cabinet to bring down a hill the preamble of which could read""""Whereas in the interests of the defence of the Commonwealth and in given at an Imperial conference, it is necessary to provide food and clothing for Australia and other British communities, therefore, be it enacted that the wheat industry and the wool industry, shall come under national control"". justified in the view of the Government because we had entered into certain commitments to supply strategic materials to our British friends and perhaps to some allies. There is no difference in principle between that proposition and the proposition contained in this bill. If the Government can do what it proposes to do under this bill, there is no reason why it should not do the same thing in regard to every metal mined in Australia, because practically every metal is necessary for some purpose in wartime. I remind the committee that some parts of Australia are particularly rich in certain very scarce strategic materials. One of these is tantalite, which is found in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Another strategic material is beryllium which is one of the components used in the manufacture of atom bombs. I have seen single pieces of it so big that they could not be put into a sugar bag, so it is obviously not very scarce. Then there are also zircons and rutile. I mention also osmiridium, which is found in Tasmania. The Australian Government would be entitled to bring down a bill which declared that in the interests of defence it was ^""""cessary to take over the mining of every one of those metals and to expropriate areas from which they were obtainable. The( Mr Sheehy) -Order! member is going into too much detail Mr Archie Cameron. about this matter. He may make a passing reference to it only. sidered that I was dealing with some very important principles, and I beg to differ from the Chair, because I cannot see where a detail would come into a matter that a passing reference could adequately deal with such a high principle as that with which I am dealing. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Chair rules that the honourable mempursuance of an undertaking ber may make a passing reference only. not quarrel with the Chair. This is a matter of outstanding importance from the Opposition's point of view and also from the point of view of the State of South Australia. I am also of the That would be opinion that if the Government intends to put on the statute-book a measure of the magnitude and importance of this one, it should base it on solid foundations. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. point which has emerged clearly from the discussion is that the Government has already spent some money on this project. This was admitted by the Minister, and when he was challenged in regard to it, by interjection, he gloried in the fact that money had been expended without parliamentary approval. One of the cardinal principles of parliamentary government in British countries is that the elected representatives of the people shall control the public purse. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN That would be a good point to make in a budget debate, but it is not relevant to the clause under discussion. Parliament must retain control of certain things. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Well, leave it at that. another clause in the bill which provides for the voting of money, and I may raise the matter again when that clause is under consideration.

The edifice which the Governnient is now trying to erect will suffer the same fate when this legislation is challenged in the l ight place. I am very grateful to the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr by tliree Associate Commissioners, who shall Menzies) ought to be, for finally having succeeded in getting into my understanding the meaning which the Leader of the Opposition intended to convey earlier this afternoon. I could see at the time that the Leader of the Opposition was trying to make some, point which, due to my own fault I have no doubt, was not clear to me. Then the honourable member for Barker, with that admirable lucidity which I admire so much, and which I am sure the Leader of the Opposition must envy, explained the matter clearly. I now realize that when the Leader of the Opposition spoke of 5 per cent., he referred to the proportion of power from the Snowy Mountains scheme which would be used in the steel industry, aud that when he was referring to Commonwealth projects generally he said that the amount of power which would be used in connection with them might be as much as 20 per cent. I now hasten to make this explanation, and to correct my former reference to the right honourable gentleman's remarks. The Leader of the Opposition said that if I quoted him at all, I should quote him correctly, and as I intend to quote extensively from his speech on this subject between now and the date of the general election, I shall take care to quote from the official report. In the meantime, I make the comment on the remarks of the right honourable gentleman, which, thanks ber understand, that the amount of power directly used for defence purposes in the Australian Capital Territory alone will be practically 25 per cent, of the total amount generated, and the proportion directly used for defence purposes throughout the whole of the Commonwealth will be even greater. The committee is considering an amendment moved by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) to clause 8. The clause itself reads(1.) The Commissioner shall be assisted by two Associate Commissioners, each of whom shall be appointed by the Governor General. As amended, the clause would read as follows:(1.) The Commissioner shall be assisted be appointed by the Governors of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, respectively. I am anxious that the water and power which the scheme will make available shall be provided as soon as possible, so I support the bill, but that does not prevent me from supporting the amendment which, I believe, would enable the country to obtain all the advantages that the scheme can provide, while.preventing the concentration of power in Canberra. TJnder the amendment the States, whose people will provide the cash, and receive most of the benefits, will have a say in the direction of the work, and in the disposal of the power and water. has been much discussion on the question whether the Commonwealth has authority under the defence power of the Constitution to embark upon this enterprise, and it has been suggested that the Commonwealth should enter into further agreements with the States concerned. It is admitted that the Snowy Mountains scheme will produce power for industry, and I , as a humble layman, cannot understand why such an enterprise cannot be linked with the defence needs of the country. In this age, the effectiveness of the armed forces is very greatly dependent on the industrial capacity of the nation. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) argued that if the Commonto the honourable memwealth, under the defence power, could for Barker, I now fully embark upon the generation of electric current, it would be equally justified in taking control of the steel industry. The honourable member for' Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), in making the same point, drew a comparison with the clothing industry. In this atomic age, if we are to be ready for war, it is necessary to prepare in time of peace, and it is certainly necessary to decentralize our industries.

157,Mr Sheehy (Boothby) [8.7],"Ther eone time the Commonwealth established a clothing factory in Victoria for the purpose of making naval and military uniforms for defence purposes, for postal -employees, for other Commonwealth -departments, for certain State omcers, and for employees in various public utilities, and operators in factories necessary for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth. The power of the Commonwealth to do so was challenged, but the High Court, in a majority decision, held that the Commonwealth had authority to manufacture clothing for the defence forces. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I think the honourable member is going beyond the limits of the clause. opinion, the Commonwealth's defence power under the Constitution can be regarded as covering this project. We have been told that the undertaking is of paramount importance, and is intimately bound up with defence preparations. I believe that the High Court would now take a broader view than it has sometimes taken in the past. I have listened patiently to statements by various Government supporters. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr clause. Sheehy) said that the armed forces now depended on the industrial potential of the nation for their effectiveness. Surely he must know that that was proved during the last war and the one before that. Another honourable member opposite said that we on this side of the committee could think only in terms of rifles, bayonets and tanks, and failed to realize the importance of scientific research. Let me remind him that we on this side of the chamber are, perhaps, better acquainted with such subjects than he is. I , in comBeazley, K . E. mon with other members of the Opposition, heartily support this proposition. It has been discussed for a long time, and Calwell, A. A. at last there appears to be some hope that it will be put into effect. This clause, however, merely deals with the setting up of an authority, not with the actual doing of the job. The scheme is still in the planning stage. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) said that already some roads were being constructed, but that is a minor and preliminary undertaking. I understand that it will be many years before the scheme is actually brought to fruition. The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) made great play on the fact that the scheme is part of an Empire defence plan in which Australia is to become one of the main supporting bases. Surely the honourable gentleman must be aware that, as a fardistant nation acting as a supply base, we must take appropriate steps to ensure that we shall be capable, not only of producing certain requirements, but also of supplying them to the British Empire or to other countries that may be allied with us. This Government is concentrating too much on the establishment of a supply organization and too little on taking appropriate steps to ensure that such supplies as we can produce can be delivered to the armed forces for whom they are intended.

Final payment of compensation for land resumed during the war for defence purposes was, in many instances, not made until the expiration of from' six to eight years from the date of resumption. A provision should be inserted in this measure requiring the authority to make quick decisions in relation to compensation payments. All of those who are dispossessed of their properties must secure holdings elsewhere or make a fresh start in life. They should not be forced to accept an out-of-date valuation.

I ask the Government either toaccept the amendment now or to givean undertaking that it will consider the proposal sympathetically with a view to' the insertion of an appropriate amendment in some other part of the bill. The total amount of compensation for the land to be resumed in a project of this magnitude will probably represent only a very small percentage of the cost of the scheme. An indication of what may be involved may be gained from the experience of the New South Wales Government in connection with the Clarence River dam. It has been estimated that compensation for land' resumption in connection with that scheme which is expected to cost £5,000,000 will amount to approximately £200,000. I do not think that anybody would like a great project of this kind to be viewed with disfavour by very many people because it will result in an injustice being done to them by the Government. The amendment proposed by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) is, I think, unnecessary because of the compensation provisions of clause 33 of the bill, and also because of theprovisions of section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution. Section 51 provides that where the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate and acquireproperty in pursuit of that power, it must pay compensation upon just terms-..",46,Earle Page S Amendment Stand Part Of Tiie

162,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [8.27],"-The determination of what are just terms is a matter for the High Court. The right honourable member for Cowper has suggested that compensation for owners who are dispossessed of their land under this scheme should be based on current valuation plus 20 per cent. The proposition that the Commonwealth should so tie itself in advance is one which 1 think no business man could seriously regard as fair. It would constitute a prior invitation to people to fleece the Government. Much of the 'land to be acquired is in mountainous areas and is undeveloped. It is true that certain villages will be flooded and that the residents will have to be transferred elsewill receive fair compensation. where and given equivalent housing. The Commonwealth is constitutionally bound to award compensation on just terms, and in cases where the question of just terms has been in dispute the High Court has never been favourably disposed towards the Commonwealth obtaining land cheaply. Compensation based on current valuation, plus 20 per cent., would impose an exorbitant charge upon the Commonwealth. If persons who held land in the mountain areas without developing it knew beforehand that the Commonwealth would pay compensation for its resumption based on current valuaif this amendment were accepted the Austion plus 20 per cent., all sorts of measures would be taken to fleece the Commonwealth.

Land-holders might decide to make improvements in areas where a dam is about to be built or a hydro-electric station erected and after a short period get a rake-off of an additional 20 per cent. It is unreasonable for any honourable member of the Parliament to advocate that the Commonwealth should go into this field as a hamstrung purchaser, with its terms of purchase imposed upon it by the Parliament and known in advance by the sellers. I hope that the committee will not accept the amendment. Works and Housing) [8.31] -The Gofull compensation for her land. vernment cannot accept the amendment. Clause 33 (4.) provides that the Lands Acquisition Act 1906-1936 shall be applicable in relation to claims for compensation against the authority. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) is aware that, because of the present prices of wool and dairy products, the cost of land that can be used for grazing sheep and dairy cattle is extremely high. It is mainly land of that kind that will be acquired for the purposes of this scheme. It would be entirely wrong to bind the Government to pay present-day values plus 20 per cent. The people who are dispossessed -The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has moved this amendment partly in order to direct attention to the fact that persons whose land has been acquired by the Government have had to wait for a long time before compensation has been paid to them. The right bonorable gentleman was not optimistic enough to think that the amendment would be accepted. It cannot now be said that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) is devoid of a sense of humour. He has stated that tralian Government would be fleeced. That is a good joke. It would be a great change if the Government were being fleeced and was not itself fleecing During the war a great deal of land was acquired by the Government under its emergency powers. It acquired land at, among other places in Victoria, Laverton, Puckapunyal and Essendon. Witb regard to the acquisition of the land at Essendon, the High Court decided against the Government and it had to reconsider the amount of compensation that was paid to the owner. At Laverton, the persons whose land was acquired were left lamenting. A long time ago I directed the attention of the.

It is nonsense to say that if the amendment is accepted people will rush to the Snowy Mountains, to buy land there and erect buildings and tanks on it so that they may sell to the Government at a profit. They could not obtain the labour and materials to do what the honourable member has suggested they might do. I think that we should do something to show that we have a conscience iu this regard. satisfied if the Government would promise that the authority will act in the same way as the Public ""Works Department in New South Wales acts. The lionorable member for Fremantle is frightened by shadows that he himself makes. The Public Works Department in New South Wales is not frightened of shadows. It approaches people who will be affected by inundations, asks them to say what tliey consider to be fair compensation for the loss of their property, and then treats them very generously. The department also goes to a great deal of trouble, if a half of one property and one-.third of the adjoining property are inundated, to see whether it is possible to combine the remnants of the properties so that one of th© two families may .be able to remain in the place in whicli, perhaps, it has lived for many years. Dams such as those that are envisaged in this scheme cannot be built high up in the mountains. They must be constructed near fairly good flat lands.

It will cost approximately £200,000,000. It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Minister and honourable gentlemen opposite that it is a defence undertaking. We have been told that it is part of a development due to the arrival of the atomic age, although I suspect that there is a bit of eye-wash about that statement. We have been told also that it is part of a great scheme to assist in the defence of the British Commonwealth. Although honourable members on this side of the chamber take that statement with --a grain of salt, I shall assume for the -moment that it is true. If the scheme is justified at all, it is, at least in part, a -defence undertaking, but in sub-clause 4. it is provided that the authority, which is the body that is to be established to manage this vast undertaking, may, with 5the approval of the Minister, appoint a person who is not a British subject and has not made and subscribed the oath OT affirmation of allegiance. I agree that circumstances may exist in which it would be desirable to appoint as an oflicer of the authority a person who is not a British subject. I am not bigoted enough to think that we should not try to secure the best brains in the world. We know that the world is, and is likely to continue to be, divided into two camps. We know that our way of life is threatened. Therefore, I suggest to the Government that the provisions of subclause 4 should be subject to a proviso. I move, as an amendmentThat the following proviso he added to vide for such screening. The Minister sub-clause (4.):"" Provided that the Minister is satisfied would use the same eyes as the Public that the person proposed to be appointed is Service Board uses because that is the not any way inimical to the interests of the mines whether a person is trustworthy. Commonwealth."". I do not think that in his heart any tion is harmless as an expression of honourable member opposite could object opinion, it is unnecessary, because the seriously to that proviso. Is it sugposition is already covered by clause 22. gested that members of the Labour The provision to which the honourable party want Communists to be appointed gentleman desires to add a proviso reads to high positions in this key defence as follows:undertaking? man on this side of the chamber Minister, appoint a person who is not a British has interjected and said, "" Of course subject and has not made and subscribed the they do."". Honourable members oppooath or affirmation of allegiance. Mr Beale. site will have an opportunity later to repudiate that allegation by voting for this amendment. Is it suggested that they want as an officer of the authority somebody who, even though he may not be labelled "" Communist"" would be prepared to betray Australia? There are some people in this country who are traitors but who do not bear the label "" Communist"". Is it suggested that the members of this Government, who are supposed to be patriots and most of whom. I believe, are patriots, want the key positions in this great undertaking to be occupied by persons who will ultimately betray our secrets? This amendment, which is pitched on a low note, is the least that we can ask the Government to accept. The point that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has raised is already covered in clause 22 (2), which reads as follows:The selection of persons for appointment as officers under this section shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Public Service Board determines. For a long time, the Public Service Board has been charged with the duty of screening, with the very best information available, and, incidentally, the same information that would be available to the Minister, all applicants for selection to key government positions. If the Minister were dissatisfied with any individual, he would be dissatisfied on the basis of information that had been supplied to him by the inquiry organizations of the Public Service Board. The Public Service regulations already proCommunist or a person likely to act in means whereby the Government deter Whilst the honourable member's suggesOne honourable gentleThe Authority may, witb the approval of the",49,Paibs
170,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [8.45],"It is probable that American engineers will be employed on the Snowy Mountains scheme, because it bears a resemblance to the Tennessee Valley scheme, and in siich planning, American engineers have the most experience. is also necessary that no American citizen should be asked to make and subscribe the oath or affirmation of allegiance to the British King. If he were to do so, he would forfeit his United States citizenship. That is a requirement of American law, and it would undoubtedly be an inhibition on obtaining the services of a highly qualined American engineer if, as a condition of accepting the appointment, he had to lose his American citizenship. He probably would not desire to do so. I do not consider that the amendment is necessary, although I admit that it really puts into words what would be the duty of the Public Service Board. In my opinion, sub-clause 4, aa it stands, is sufficiently strong. It is not necessary to specify in all possible ways how the Minister shall conduct his administration. I do not think that the honourable member for Parramatta would contend that the Parliament should include in every clause of every bill a stipulation governing every contingency that the Parliament could imagine. It may be left to the common sense of a Minister, using the Public Service Board to screen applicants, not to appoint a person who, in the words of the honourable member, would sabotage the Snowy Mountains scheme. [8.48] I disagree with .the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), who believes that the screening that is undertaken by the Public Service Board of applicants for important government positions is most efficient, and I support the views that have been expressed by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr tains Hydro-Electric Authority should Beale). Obviously, the honourable member for Fremantle is a babe in the wood, and does not know that the Government has been remiss in failing to screen Communists who are employed by the Department of Works and Housing. AlthoughI have referred to this matter on other occasions, I have not done so with the vigour that I feel impelled to use now in making my protest. I refer to the townplanner of Darwin who, no doubt, will be assigned to plan the villages in the Snowy Mountains area. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's references to the Northern Territory arc not appropriate at this stage. ment of Works and Housing will be required to plan the villages that will be required for this mighty work in the Snowy Mountains area. Those villages must be designed by an experienced townplanner in accordance with modern principles. The Government has employed an avowed Communist named Jack Walker, from Ballarat, on work at Darwin and he has ruined the whole plan. He was then ordered to proceed to Alice Springs to plan that town. He has not been screened. It is the duty of the Government to declare its bona fides now, and screen Walker immediately, so that he will not be permitted to participate in the Snowy Mountains job. Works and Housing) [8.50] -The Government cannot accept the amendment. As the honovable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) has stated, applicants for key government positions are screened by the Public Service Board. The clause has been so drafted as to r "" i ' l e the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to employ, if necessary, highly-qualified technicians from the United States of America. well covered, I ask the honourable jnember not to press his amendment. I thought that I had made it perfectly clear that I agreed that the Snowy Mounemploy the be3t technicians available, regardless of their nationality.

I remind the committee that not long ago, a man who had been convicted of seven or ten charges of forgery was exercising considerable authority in the land sales control office, and was removed from that position only after considerable fuss and bother. How did that person obtain employment in the Commonwealth Public Service? through the ordinary channels, and was appointed to a responsible position which, because of his record, he should never have occupied. Is it not likely that in the difficult future that may face Australia, an undesirable person may be accepted by the Public Service Board, even after he has been screened? Because of that possibility, I have sought to superimpose upon the ordinary screening that is carried out by the board a provision to compel the Minister to make certain investigations in order to prevent dangerous persons from being appointed to high official positions. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 23 and 24 agreed to. Clause 25The Authority shall have power to borrow money on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia upon the guarantee of the Treasurer. I move That the following words be added to submentary practice. That principle is clause (1.) :-""au d with the sanction of an appropriation by the Parliament"". I have carefully examined Part V. of the bill, which deals with the finances of the Snowy Authority, and have studied later clauses, including clause 40, which provide the manner!^ in which the authority shall present*ts accounts, but I have not discovered any provision under which the Parliament will control all the funds that will be at the disposal of the authority. The clause now before the committee reads(1.) The Authority shall have power to borrow money on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia upon the guarantee of the Treasurer. (2.) The Treasurer may, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of this Act, make advances to the Authority of such amounts and upon such terms as he thinks fit. In other words, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) may make certain advances out of the Treasurer's Advance, but those sums of money will be comparatively insignificant. The Treasurer's Advance, which is set out in the budget He made an application each year, represents only 3 per cent, or 4 per cent, of the total budget. If the Snowy Mountains project is to be of the magnitude that the Government has led us to expect it to be it will require many millions of pounds each year. Sub-clause 3 readsExcept with the consent of the Treasurer, tiie Authority shall not have power to borrow nioney otherwise than in accordance with this section. The position is that the major expenditure by the authority will not he covered by a parliamentary appropriation. In accordance with treasury practice, substantial sums of money are provided each year for, say, defence and invalid and age pensions. The money is appropriated hy the Parliament, which in that way, has an opportunity to control the expenditure. However, under the clause we are now considering, the Snowy Mountains undertaking may be financed independently of the Parliament. That principle is wrong, and is a departure from the custom, under which the Parliament controls the puhlic purse. Such control is a basic principle of British parliarecognized in the Supply debate which takes place regularly, and which affords honorahle members an opportunity to ventilate the grievances of their conMountains Hydro-Electrio stituents. If -this clause is not amended, the Parliament will not exercise any control over the expenditure of money by the authority. History has shown that great inflationary movements have begun when a government has been able to control and use a hank for the purpose of providing huge sums of money that have been spent without parliamentary authority. My purpose in moving the amendment is to place the matter on a proper /basis. Works and Housing) [8.57] -The Government cannot accept the amendment.",51,Paibs

180,"Mr Lemmon"" (Forrest","Minister forThe right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has stated that under this clause, the Parliament will not have an opportunity to control expenditure by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, but the facts are that the money required for the permanent structure will be appropriated by the Parliament each' year. In other words, a programme of works will be set out for five or ten years, and each year, the Parliament will he asked to appropriate money for the purposes of that work. Subclause 1 is required to permit the authority to carry out incidental work when the appropriation has not been sumcient. It is common practice to allow a constructing authority of the magnitude of the proposed Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to have power to borrow money on overdraft. make appropriations in addition to that form of borrowing? tion will be made each year. A farmer uses a bank overdraft as a matter of convenience. The principle is the same in respect of this authority. The total amount of the proposed expenditure on capital works will be appropriated each1 year, but the authority will have power, subject to the approval of the Treasurer, to borrow money on overdraft for certain purposes. that the Parliament shall make an appropriation each year for the work? sub-clause 2 of this clause, which reads as follows:The Treasurer may, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of dentally, as soon as the Committee of this Act, make advances to the Authority of such amounts and upon such terms a* he thinks fit. That is how the Government proposes to handle the expenditure. [8.59] -The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has raised one of the most important issues in this bill. This clause describes three methods under which the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority may be financed. The first of those three methods, and the one to which the right honourable gentleman has taken the strongest possible exception, provides that the authority shall have power to borrow money on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank upon the guarantee of the Treasurer. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, the Commonwealth Bank is completely subject to the will of the Treasurer, and, actually, will have no voice in financing the authority. The Treasurer is the virtual head of the Commonwealth Bank as well as the head of this Government. He will simply make a one-man decision about the amount of money to which the Australian taxpayers shall be committed in respect of expenditure on the Snowy Mountains project. The Parliament will not be consulted. As the right honourable member for Cowper has pointed out, the basis of the British parliamentary system is that Treasurer there shall be no expenditure by the Executive without the consent of the lower house of the Parliament, the members of which are the elected representatives of the taxpayers. That basic principle has been departed from in this bill. The Australian Constitution provides that no money shall be disbursed from the Treasury until the proposed expenditure has been considered by a committee of supply of this House. That committee meets whenever a message is received from the Governor General under section 56 of the Constitution. We know the section backwards. There is no appropriation clause in this bill. The Minister said earlier, in committee, that money had already been spent without parliamentary authority. It all goes to show how deeply the Government disregards the right of the Parliament to represent the taxpayers of the country. InciSupply has agreed upon the expenditure being made, another committee is appointed, by very long practice, to draw up a bill. That committee generally consists of two Ministers. Judging by this provision I think thc next time the Qovernment introduces a hill requiring, an appropriation, the committee appointed to draft, the hill will consist of Henry VIII . , CharlesI . , and Oliver Cromwell, each of whom was notorious for his complete disregard of the House of Commons of this day.",52,Paibs

185,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"The second of the three methods of finance is indicated in sub-clause 2 of the clause, which readsThe Treasurer may, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of this Act, make advances to the Authority of such amounts and upon such terms as he tliink fit. The next point that we arrive at therefore is: that, after the Parliament has decided that this authority is to have a certain amount of money to spend, it w ill still depend on the Treasurer, notwithstanding what the Parliament thinks, whether it w ill get the money or not. If the Treasurer chooses to go into reverse gear, the whole work w ill be held up. The third method of finance is indicated in. sub-clause 3, which reads'' Except with the consent of the Treasurer, thc Authority shall not have power to borrow money otherwise than in accordance with this section. Againi t a l l depends upon the Treasurer He could say, in his wisdom, or otherwise, "" The Parliament has not voted you any money and, even if it had, I am not going to give it to you "", or, as head of the Government, and, particularly, as dictator of the financial institutions of Australia, through the Commonwealth Bank, he could say, "" Y o u will not get the money from the private banks, but there is another way to get it ; try to get it that w a y "" . The Treasurer has three strings to his bow. is that there is no appropriation clause. That makes me particularly suspicious, because I have a grave doubt whether this project is to be got going in a hurry. I expect that money w ill be spent to lay a foundation stone like that laid by K in g O'Malley years ago in the scrub half-a-mile behind the back of Parliament House, where it is c'overed over with heavy slabs, nailed down, and fenced with barbed wire as if the Yankee gold reserve were beneath it instead of in the vault at Fort Knox.

The TEMPORARY Order! address himself to the clause. Mr Archie Cameron. dealing w i th the provision of money for the authority. I have a strong suspicion that no Minister w ill lay a foundation stone unless money is attached to the ceremony. I have never known a foundation stone to be laid free of cost, noi even under Douglas credit. I content myself with directing the attention of the committee to the financial provisions of this measure, which are about as .real as the spirits of the spiritualists. The three sub-clauses of this clause ought to be read together. Sub-clause 1 readsThe Authority shall have power to borrow money on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia upon the guarantee of the Treasurer. No one who borrows from the Commonwealth Bank has to get the authority of the Parliament to do so. The Treasurer must guarantee the loan to the authority if it borrows from the bank. Obviously, if the Treasurer had to honour that guarantee he would have to have the authority of the Parliament. guarantee without the consent of the Parliament. have to honour the guarantee if he were called upon to do so, and he could not do that without the consent of the ParliaThe first thing that strikes me ment. Sub-clause 2 readsThe Treasurer may, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of this Act, make advances to the Authority of such amounts and upon such terms as he thinks fit. Clearly, that envisages the contingency that the Treasurer w ill be required to honour a guarantee. The sub-clause provides that the ordinary appropriation by the Parliament shall be made to honour the guarantee. The honourable member for Barker made certain points about subclause 3, which readsExcept with the consent of the Treasurer, the Authority shall not have power to borrow money otherwise than in accordance with this section. That provides strictly that the money I ask the honourable member to Bank.",53,Paibs

I am rather sorry to see that provision, because I am certain that a government made np of the Opposition parties would probably use a public loan rather than the means set out in sub-clause 1 as a means of financing the project. I think the three sub-clauses, read together, show that there is no weakening of the ordinary authority of the Parliament; but, quite clearly, when the Commonwealth Bank is asked to advance money to a public authority, the guarantee of the Treasurer must be given, and, if the Treasurer is required under sub-clause 2 to honour the guarantee, the money with which to honour the guarantee must be appropriated by the Parliament. the Opposition) [9.8] I had no intention of rising but for the interesting and devastating introduction to public finance that we have just been given by the bonorable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). He expressed an amazing view of publie finance. I recite it so tliat I shall not do him any injustice. He said that sub-clause 1 of this clause provides the method by which this project should be financed, when the actual expenditure, according to what we have been told, may run to something of the order of £200^000,000. He said that the money should be borrowed on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank, and he expressed the fear that, if the Opposition had anything to do with the scheme, as it All revenues or moneys raised or received unquestionably will, it might decide to by the Executive Government of the Commonget money by borrowing from the public. wealth So we are told that when £200,000,000 is wanted for the largest public works Australia, the right way to borrow it is not by going to the public and raising money on loan, but by borrowing it from the Commonwealth Bank on overdraft. That means that when you are spending money long you ought to borrow short. AllI can say is that if my honourable friend ever finds himself in charge of the Treasury, any dyslogistic expression ever used about the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) will be a mere circumstance compared with what will be said about him. compliment to the right honourable member for Cowper. honourable friends opposite on their own ground.

The whole point about this is that once more the Government is evading the Constitution. After all, there is a Constitution. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) reminded us that, from time to time, Mr Speaker or his deputy rises in his place and presents a message from ' His Excellency the Governor General, under section 56 of the Constitution, recommending an appropriation, and, if honourable gentlemen care to look at the interesting sections that appear in the Constitution, under the heading of ""Finance and Trade "", they will discover that there is a complete scheme for giving to the Parliament the control of the public moneys.

Section 82 providesThe costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; Section 83 providesNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury of thc Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law. That is what is stated in the supreme document of the country, which is so much neglected by members on the Government side of the committee. that money may be drawn from the Treasury without parliamentary approval ? cisely the point that I was about to make. Money cannot be drawn from the Treasury without an appropriation measure being passed by the Parliament. So, whatever the clause says, the Constitution is superior to the bill . But what does the bill seek to do? Wheni t becomes an act, the Government w ill be able to say, "" We w ill not bother about appropriating money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. On the contrary, we w ill get r id of all the difficulties of appropriation by using the moneys of the Commonwealth Bank, not of the Commonwealth "". The moneys of the Commonwealth Bank are not the moneys of the Commonwealth for this purpose. Instead of coming to the Parliament and seeking the appropriation of millions of pounds for this purpose, the Government will escape all its constitutional liabilities by going to the Commonwealth Bank and getting money from it on overdraft. The only time the Parliament w ill ever come into the picture w ill be when the Treasurer is called upon by the Commonwealth Bank to honour the guarantee given by him in the terms of the statute. I remind honourable members that the Treasurer need not be unduly embarrassed by that either, because, under the Banking Act 1945, he is in the position to tell the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank where he ""gets of f "" .

It appears that what the Commonwealth intended to do in relation to the banking legislation was not to pay compensation to the shareholders of the trading banks out of Consolidated Revenue or from loans, but to do so by increasing the credit base of the Commonwealth. That is exactly what can be done under this measure. I mean that it can be done theoretically, because we do not know what may take place. Theoretically the whole of the money required for this vast scheme could be raised by way of overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank. country's central bank, that means that the currency of the country could be debased to support this scheme. I do not contend, nor do I believe that that will occur, but I am pointing out that there is no guarantee in this clause that the control of finances under this measure is to be exercised by the Parliament. On more than one occasion I have drawn attention to the steady decline of the prestige of this Parliament because of its loss of control over the puhlic purse. If the Government is too obstinate to accept this amendment an amendment could be perhaps inserted in the bill, when it is before the Senate, to the effect that the authority shall, within such limits as the Parliament lays down, from time to time borrow money on overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. should hand over to the executive Minister, who is in this instance the Treasurer, complete control of the methods of financing so vast a venture as this will be. If the Minister is correct in saying that it is intended to follow the normal course of appropriation, one may ask why an appropriation message has not been brought down in connection with this measure. It is true that perhaps not very much will be done regarding the scheme during the.next twelve months, but will the Minister give an undertaking that next week, or at least before the end of this sessional period, he will cause an if r . Spender. appropriation message to be introduced? I have a shrewd suspicion that, magnificent as is this scheme, which has the support of all parties, the introduction of the present measure has been accelerated merely because of the forthcoming general election. of the Australian Country party) [9.25]. I rise to make some observations in connection with the very important aspect that was raised by the Minister( Mr Lemmon) when he explained the methods of finance to be followed under the measure. He said that sub-clause 1 of this clause was designed to meet a contingency or an emergency by way of overdraft or temporary accommodation inasmuch as the authority is to be Since that is the empowered to borrow money on overdraft from' the Commonwealth Bank upon the guarantee of the Treasurer. It is all very well for the Minister to make such a statement, but the Parliament must be guided by what has already happened, as the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has pointed out, in connection with the Banking Bill and the compensation claims that might arise from it. He drew attention to the fact, as I also did when that bill was being debated, that the power of appropriation that is requisite under the Constitution was not provided in that measure, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it was the intention of the Government to finance whatever ascertained compensation arose as a result of the measure, out of the credit base of the country, and to use the Commonwealth Bank for that I do not believe that we purpose. I have a shrewd suspicion that that is the intention with regard to the basic method of finance to be followed in connection with this gigantic scheme which, we are told, will cost in the vicinity of £200,000,000. I do not believe that sub-clause 1 of this clause is the innocent sub-clause that the Minister would like us to believe it to be when we consider it in relation to the practice of the present Government, and the requirements of the Constitution. The main sub-clause of the clause, to which I draw the attention of the committee, is sub-clause 2, which statesThe Treasurer may, out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes",57,Chairman Must Be Advanced By The Commonwealth

This clause reads as follows:The price at which electricity is supplied or sort of thing is the action of the Governsold by the authority shall be such as the Treasurer, after receipt of a recommendation by thc Minister, determines. Evidently, this is to he one of those cases in which a statutory authority shall, in fact, have no authority whatever when it comes to the fixing of prices. Had an earlier amendment moved by the Opposition been accepted, provision could have been made for Commonwealth and State representatives to confer when the price of electricity was to be fixed. The people by their votes showed clearly in a recent referendum that they did not want the Commonwealth to have the power to control prices. Government has shown that if it is prevented by the people from getting the power it wants, it will try to get that power in some other way. TJnder this clause, the Treasurer is to have sole authority to fix prices, and we may be sure that the present Treasurer ( Mr treated in that way. Such action is conChifley), or any other Treasurer of the same political colour, would not hesitate to use the provision as an instrument of taxation. This is to be a tremendous project, and electricity will be sold to industry in two States, so that the Treasurer will actually be in a position to control industry, including dairying and other rural occupations. I very, much object to the provision. The Government is determined to put the clause through, but it is acting against the expressed will of the people.

South Australia has had to fall into line under constant pressure from the Commonwealth. Another example of the same ment in increasing postal and telephonic charges, but, of course, I cannot discuss that matter under this bill. The Government proposes to set up an authority which has been compared to the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States of America. However, the American authority is, I believe, comletely autonomous, and it can fix the price of the power which it supplies. In this bill there is a pretence of giving authority to the commissioners, but this clause strips them of the power to fix the price of elecHowever, the tricity. That is contradictory, but it is in keeping with the policy of the Government to keep a string on every statutory body which is, ostensibly, authorized to conduct some specific undertaking. The Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Dairy Produce Board have been sistent with the policy of the Government to keep power in the hands of the Treasurer. In this clause, the Treasurer is authorized to fix the price of electricity, and under another clause the authority may borrow money only with the approval of the Treasurer. In other legislation, such as in the Banking Act, final authority is also vested in the Minister. It is all in line with the consistent attempts of the Government to concentrate power in the hands of one man, and that man the Treasurer of the day. a policy may be tragic so far as the sole and finances of the country are concerned.

I object to the whole of that paragraph as 'being redundant and as being quite plainly a piece of unnecessary propaganda and humbug. I have spent all my working l if e of 25 years in dealing with legal documents and acts of Parliament, but until I came to Canberra and heard this Labour Government in action, and read some of the statutes of which it has been responsible. I had never come across legislation of this kind. I had never come across legislation, either in the Commonwealth or State spheres, which did more than attempt to put into plain language legal prohibitions, obligations or commissions; but there has entered into this Government's procedure b practice of putting into legislation words which have no legal effect and which are used only for the purpose of persuading ignorant people that they have some effect when, in fact, they have no effect a t all. The words. . . The Authority shall cause w little detriment and inconvenience and as little damage as possible. do not mean anything, because, as a matter of law the authority is already bound to do things in that This clause way. The succeeding provisions of the clause make that perfectly plain that a person whose property is damaged will have a right of compensation. Why, therefore, were these highly unnecessary words inserted in subclause 1? They were inserted solely for propaganda purposes. Legislation should not contain unnecessary words. It is not the purpose of legislation to t r y to perI suade people about anything. The purpose of a clause in an act of Parliament is to lay down rights and liabilities and obligations. B y inserting the words to whicli I have taken exception the Government has pursued a disgraceful course. A similar course was pursued in 1942 when, following the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Canberra, the Attorney-General introduced a classic piece of legislation in an attempt to persuade the State Premiers to agree to an alteration of the Constitution. All honourable memSub-clause 1 of the clause bers and other people who took any notice of politics then will remember the propaganda and the humbug that was contained in that b ill. Again, in 1944, in a similar measure there was a recital of words that had no legal effect but which were included for propaganda purposes only. It is time that the attention of the people was directed towards this practice. The light s of a citizen are no more 'and no less for the words contained in sub-clau3e 1 of this clause.

The rate of a wife'9 allowance is affected by income and proinvalid pension, but a child's allowance is a flat-rate payment. Wives' allowances and children's allowances were introduced in 1943, the maximum weekly rates then being 15s. for a wife and 5s. for one child. The wife's allowance was increased in 1947 to £1 a week. The new rate of 24s. will bring the wife's allowance into line with the maximum rate of pension payable to the wife of a service Repatriation Act and with the maximum rate of war pension payable under that act to the wife of an ex-member receiving war pension at 100 per cent, general rate or at the special rate for total and permanent incapacity.

The number of wives' allowances at present in force is 12,700 and the number of children's allowances is 7,400. The -cost of the increase of 4s. a week in these allowances is £209,000 for a full year, comprising £132,000 in respect of wives' allowances and £77,000 in respect of children's alloAvances. The bill also provides for the repeal of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions (Reciprocity with New Zealand) Act 1943 as from the lst July, 1949. On that date the new reciprocal agreement between Australia and New Zealand which was signed by the Prime Ministers of the two countries on the loth April last will come into operation. The existing scheme of reciprocity covers only age and invalid pensions. The new agreement covers these benefits and, in addition, widows' pensions, child endowment and unemployment and sickness benefits. TJnder the existing sclieme the rate of a reciprocal pension cannot exceed the lower of the maximum rates in force in the two countries, and entitlement is subject to the more restrictive conditions of the laws of the two countries. TJnder the new agreement New Zealand citizens who come to Australia for permanent residence will receive Australian social service benefits on the same basis as Australian citizens, and for this purpose their residence in New Zealand will count as residence in Australia. New Zealand will give the same concession to Australian citizens who take up permanent residence in New Zealand, with the exception that an Australian man will not be granted an age benefit until he reaches the Australian qualifying age of 65 years. The normal qualifying age for New Zealand citizens is 60 years. Under the new agreement, persons going from Australia to New Zealand, and vice versa, for temporary residence will continue to receive, during their temporary absence, any benefits which they were receiving in their own -country. The home country will continue to provide these benefits but the actual payments will be made, on an agency basis, by the country in which the person is temporarily resident, and periodical nnancial adjustments will be made between the two countries. The increases in the rates of wives' and children's allowances provided for in the bill will be paid on the first fortnightly pension pay-day after the legislation has been passed and receives the Royal Assent. It is hoped that the increased payments will be made on the 30th June. For that reason I seek the co-operation of the Opposition in securing the passage of the bill to-night. I commend the bill to honourable members. Opposition has no objection to the debate proceeding. This bill is designed to increase the allowances that are payable to the wives and children of invalid pensioners and of age pensioners who are permanently incapacitated' or permanently blind. It also provides for the repeal of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions (Reciprocity with New Zealand) Act as from the 1st July, 1949, when a new reciprocal agreement between Australia and New Zealand will begin to operate. The Opposition approves of the bill. Rising costs necessitate that these allowances should be reviewed and increased from time to time. I hope that similar sentiments will sway the Government when consideration is being given to the amount of the pensions that are payable to ex-servicemen, and particularly to totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. Those pensions should undoubtedly be increased, and I hope that a nieasure to increase them will be introduced shortly. The Minister has explained that a New Zealander who comes to Australia for permanent residence will, for pension purposes, be treated on the same basis as an Australian, and will receive the age pension at the age of 65 years, or, in the case of a woman, at the age of 60 years. If that provision is to apply to persona who come here from New Zealand, why cannot it apply also to persons who come here from Great Britain? This is a subject that I have raised on many occasions. The lack of such a provision militates against emigration from the United Kingdom to Australia. We do not want great numbers of old people to come here from the United Kingdom,",62,Second Reading
232,Mr White (Balaclava) [10.0],"Thebut I am concerned with the parents of the young British migrants. If the parents of those young people accompany them to Australia, they will be forced', unless they have private means, to continue to go to work in their 70's and 80's It should be pointed out that this bill The age pension is not paid as an act of charity, but of right. In my opinion, the extension of this provision to persons who come from the United Kingdom to take up permanent residence here is long overdue. When I raised the.matter recently, the Minister made some scathing remarks. Apparently he thought that I was wasting his time, but I was not. It is a human problem and some attempt should be made to solve it. The Minister has said that the rate of a. wife's allowance is affected by income 1 and property in the same way as the husband's invalid pension, but that the child allowance is a flat rate payment. That statement is only partly true. If a young person under 21 years of age contracts tuberculosis and has to leave his employment and live at home until accommodation is available for him in a sanatorium, a pension is not paid to him if the parents can afford to keep him. In other words, a means test is applied to the parents. When I raised' this matter on another bill, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), said he did not' think that was so. It is so. I have received a letter to-day from the Department of Social Services concerning a case of that kind. The application of the means test may cause great hardship. The young person concerned may have been earning £5' a week, or perhaps more. Having become a victim of the scourge of tuberculosis, he is forced to live at home until he can enter a public institution. It may be that he cannot do so for six or twelve months. During that time the money that he earned formerly is no longer coming into the home, but he has to have expensive foods and care and treatment. It would not be asking much of the Government to request that the pension should be paid automatically to such young persons. It is paid if they are in an institution, hut it is not paid if they are living at home and if the parents have suflicient means to keep them. I ask the Minister to take note of the Mr White. suggestions that I have made. If amending legislation is introduced to give effect to them, a great need will be met. is designed not to alter the amount of a pension but the amount of the allowancethat is paid in respect of the wife ar dependent child of an invalid pensioner. pension or an allowance, it is the same in effect. asked the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) whether this bill could be brought down in time to allow the increased allowances to be paid next week. I appreciate the fact that it has been brought down promptly, and also that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has raised no objection to the debates proceeding. Many people have been looking forward to these increases to help them and their children. .1 agree with the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Balaclava regarding migrants from the United Kingdom.

Persons who go from Australia to New Zealand or vice versa for temporary residence will receive the benefits that they were receiving in their own country. The desirability of a reciprocal pension agreement 'between Australia and the Tjnited Kingdom, has been raised previously by the honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson). I stated two or three weeks ago that the Australian Government had tried very hard, and in fact, is still trying, to secure between the ages of 16 and 21 years a reciprocal agreement covering all members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. matter, the Minister was rather hostile. He said that we did not want old people here. said that. that the new reciprocal agreement with New Zealand covers all social services benefits, whilst the existing agreement covers only age and invalid pensions. I said further that we had sent delegates to Great Britain to discuss with representatives of Great Britain, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand an Empire-wide reciprocal agreement in relation to social service benefits. We have not yet succeeded 'in working out a satisfactory formula, but negotiations are continuing. Therefore, it is not right to blame the Australian Government for not doing anything in that direction. The other question that was raised by the honourable member was not in order, because it had no relation to the subject of this bill. The bill deals with allowances for children up to the age of sixteen years. The honourable member for Balaclava, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, said that he wanted invalid pensioners between the ages of 16 and 21 years to be able to stand on their own feet financially, and not be a burden on their parents. The honourable gentleman has raised this subject previously. The Government has altered the provision for this class of pensioner from time to time until, although they are not paid a 100 per cent, pension, the application of the means test is so liberal that very few parents in Australia in anything like straitened circumstances would be obliged to contribute towards the maintenance of a child in that category. The basis of the means test in this instance is an allowance of 60s. a week for every adult member of the family and 30s. a week for every member under 21 years of age. A family man with an average family would haw to earn between £8 and £9 a week before payment of the invalid pension to a child would be subject to the means test. I agree with the honourable member that it. would be much more satisfactory if such pensioners could be entirely independent, and probably that situation will be brought about by the Government in the near future. I thank the Opposition for allowing the bill to pass through this House to-night so that the wish of the honorable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) and others will be gratified and the increased rates will become payable on the 30th June.

For the benefit of the House, I repeat the following statement by the Minister on this subject in his second-reading speech:Let me make it perfectly clear that oui policy is not, and ncver has been, directed at thc total exclusion of non-Europeans; noi is it based on any assumption of racial superiority. The ideal which underlies our policy is the preservation of the homogeneous character of our population and the avoidance of the friction which inevitably follows an influx of peoples having different standards of living, traditions, culture and national characteristics. That policy has become known over the years as the White Australia policy, and it has been supported since its earliest days by all prominent political leaders and the people of Australia. As an indication of the support that has been given to it , I quote a statement that was made by SirW ill i a m McMillan, the deputy leader of the then Free Trade party, during the second-reading debate in this House of the original Immigration Restriction B ill on the 6th September, 1901. He saidNo matter what measures are necessary, Australia must.be kept pure for the British race. There had been talk of infiltration by our northern neighbours. He also saidThe only way to meet this danger is not by compromise but absolutely and boldly to say that these people shall not come at all. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) has, over the years, been a great advocate of our present policy, and I trust that we shall hear his views in this debate.

248,Mr Daly ( M A R T I N ) [10.15],"Recentin 1929, he has made certain outspoken remarks on the White Australia policy. The following passage appears at page 357:The"" WhiteA u s t r a l i a"" policy-as it is ' Opposition say, "" We are wholeheartedly generally called-is an integral part of the national life of the Australian people, and although the subject of much hostile criticism, the geographical, racial, and economic circumstances of the Commonwealth amply justify it . Australia, a western nation seated at the gateway to the East, has a population of little more than 6.000,000, scattered over a great continent. The people are remarkably homogeneous: the overwhelming majority are of British stock and have ideals, traditions nnd standards of living vastly different from those of the teeming millions ""of Asia. For a people so situated the only alternative to national and racial extinction is a policy of rigid exclusion . . . We could not assimilate Asiatics without radically changing our racial, social and economic character. Those words indicate that this policy is in presenting the case for the Opposideep-rooted in the minds, not only of tion. The honourable member for Indi the general public. I mention those few twisted and evaded the real issue.

Others again have said, "" We in Australia are only doing what the Asians are doing in their countries"". Consequently, there is a substantial difference of opinion among members of the Opposition on this important policy. All honourable members will agree that the Leader of the Opposition is a brilliant speaker, who is always capable of delivering a fine oration on practically any subject.

However, other members of the Liberal party have also caused doubts in the minds of the Australian people about its attitude to the White Australia policy. Henty( Mr Gullett), who, for once, is not here to interject as he constantly does on other issues, made the following interesting statement:Every Australian citizen sbould have the right of choice in marriage, be it black, white mis-statement. or brindle. They should have the right to bring the foreign bride or bridegroom to this country for assimilation into its domestic economy. Mr Richmond( Mr Anthony) wishes to make Calwell's recent deportation of Malays-goo d citizens and people of excellent character married to Australians-wa s not the kind of thing to promote good neighbourliness with Australia's nearest neighbours. I had hoped that the honourable member would be present to hear that repetition of his statements. Sir William Angliss, the cattle king, who is a Liberal member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, has expressed himself in favour of the temporary importation of Asiatics in order to aid in what he calls the "" development of tropical areas "". He said, when defending his plan, that the idea was not a new one, but had been used successfully to help to develop Queensland. He considered that it could be used again to help to develop the Northern Territory without endangering the White Australia policy. Angliss make that statement? dictions, we should like members of the Opposition to declare their attitude to the White Australia policy. During the parliamentary recess, honourable gentlemen opposite have been outspoken and noisy in criticizing the Minister for Immigration. Thev have told the people, through the press, what they would do when the Parliament re-assembled. The challenge has been issued to them. If honourable members opposite desire to relax the White Australia policy and introduce a system of quotas, they now have an opportunity to express their views.

Members of the public and sections of the press that are not kindly disposed politically to the Australian Labour party, placed the same interpretation on that vote.

Political prejudice was never carried so blindly to Buch absurd lengths. That refers to the vote recorded on the O'Keefe matter, which was such a vital issue in connection with the White Australia policy. The honourable member for Eichmond was one of the 22 honourable members mentioned in that article. As honourable members know, I am the second speaker in succession on this measure on the Government side of the House. Honourable members opposite will have an opportunity later to clarify their position and say whether they desire an amendmeut of the bill. That newspaper statement is an indictment of honourable members opposite. Over the years the right honourable member for North Sydney has constantly advocated adherence to the White Australia policy. As he is not present in the HouseI wonder whether lie has been silenced by honourable members opposite. I hope that the right honourable gentleman's enthusiasm has not waned and that later in this debate he will give the House the benent of his experience in connection with this great policy, which is part of our national life. I also trust that he will support this nieasure. It is to be hoped, too, that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr over the past twelve months. If White AusSpender) will speak on this measure, because the people of Australia will be interested to hear his views about it. know my views. policy is a matter on which the representatives of all political parties in the Parliament should clarify their views. An opportunity is being presented to honourable members opposite to dispel the uneasiness and unrest in the community about whether the Liberal and Australian Country party members of the Parliament actually believe in the White Australia policy. Criticisms were levelled at the Minisministering the immigration policy ter for Immigration in the Daily Teleof this country to the best of his graph over the Ambonese woman. That ability in the national interest. Other newspaper demanded that she should be cases, also, could be cited of Ministers allowed to stay here, no matter what the in this fair land. The following day the same newspaper criticized the Government because a Japanese, who had been a citizen of Australia for some time, had evicted an Australian in Sydney in order to get possession of a home. Evidently the proprietors of that newspaper did not realize that the admittance of Mrs. O'Keefe and others in a similar category would make further events of that nature possible, and that that was not in line with the general thought of all sections of the community. It is because of such happenings that the Minister has seen fit to introduce this bill, with a view to Australia being kept a purely British country. It has been stated that the Minister has been harsh and unjust. According to honourable members opposite he should have opened the doors of Australia and allowed people to come here from other countries and take up residence here. However, it is interesting to note that the Minister's attitude has been strongly supported by practically all organizations worth mentioning in this country. In the Melbourne Sun recently, Mr J. C. Neagle, federal secretary of the Returned Servicemen's League, was reported as sayingWe are in accord with immigration policy tralia is to be enforced, we must be consistent. These people were apparently allowed to remain in Australia on compassionate grounds. N'ow their time is expired and they must go. Mr Neagle's support is backed by State branches of the league throughout Australia. Furthermore, Sir Frederic Eggleston has supported the Minister's policy in his comparison of Australia's attitude with the attitude, adopted by the United States of America and other countries to-day. Not so very long ago a Liberal or United Australia party government excluded a British woman from this country on moral grounds. The colour ban was not raised in that connection.

259,Mr Daly,"The White Australiarestricting the entry of certain persons to country Asiatics for educational, business this country under the provisions of the Immigration Act. It may be said that all the Ministers charged with the administration of the Immigration Act have been sympathetic when sympathy has been demanded, but they have all borne in mind the principle that the act must always be administered in accordance with the traditional policy of the nation. The restrictive measures associated with the immigration been criticized, and it has been said that the present Minister administers them too harshly. This country, like every other country surely has the right to say who shall be its citizens. Many other countries restrict immigration. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics excludes every one. Malaya, Siam, the Philippines, and Indonesia have policies of exclusion, with only small quotas of immigrants in relation to certain countries. In the United States of America, only the quota system operates. Our policy accords with that of many other countries, but it is more elastic. It has been suggested that we might adopt the quota system under which we should admit to permanent citizenship a certain number of people from different countries. The Minister dealt effectively with the quota system when he said that if it were applied in line with what the Opposition probably has in mind, the quota system would have to apply to Europeans as well as non-Europeans. Minister said, with such a policy, in some years only five or ten nationals from each of various countries would be admitted. ""We are trying to attract migrants from Europe. should have to restrict their entry to a quota if we adopted a quota system. What a contrast there would be between our present policy and the policy that would have to be applied if a quota system were instituted. A quota system would be most discriminatory against Asiatics and other non-Europeans, unless it applied equally to Europeans and non-Europeans. The situation would be much worse than any situation that the immigration laws, as proposed to be amended by this bill, could ever create. We admit to this Mr Daly. and other reasons. The numbers of Asiatics already here, under permits, is greatly in excess of the number that we would allow to come here imder a quota system. I am not convinced that the Australian people want any alteration of the law as we understood it to be before the High Court decision rendered this bill necessary to restore what we regarded as the position. For almost 50 years, policy have our immigration laws have been administered honestly with the best intentions and sympathetically, and, in that respect, the present Minister is no exception. Generally the policy has been accepted and administered by all political parties The of Australia. The people of Australia want it to continue as it was thought to be and as it will be when this measure has been placed on the statute-book. Honourable gentlemen opposite who have criticized the present Minister's administration as harsh and unjust have the opportunity to move amendments if they regard the Immigration Act as faulty. It has ibeen said that the Minister should put the telescope at the blind eye in certain cases, but we should respect him for his fearless administration of the policy. That fearlessness has earned him unpopularity in certain quarters because he will not be swept from what he regards as his path of duty in administering this great national policy. I hope that the noisy member for Balaclava ( Mr As the White) will have the opportunity, in a division, to show whether or not he supports the policy. I hope, too, that the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Warringah and the We honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), who constantly call for divisions on various issues, will not claim, if they vote against the Government on this bill, that they have been misunderstood by the general public, as they claimed to have been misrepresented in relation to a previous vote to which I have referred. I do not want to hear them making personal explanations to the effect that their votes have been misinterpreted. I commend the bill and hope that it will receive the overwhelming endorsement of honorahle members. Deputy Speaker, to make a personal explanation.

No debate has taken place in this Housei n the last 40 years that called for a decision for or against the White Australia policy. The policy has been unanimously supported by all the political parties in the House. The honourable member said that he based his statement on the vote recorded by me at the end of the debate on the O'Keefe case. That debate had nothing to do with the White Australia policy. -Order! The honourable member may not debate the O'Keefe case. If he wants to explain a vote that he cast he may do so. only if I explain what the vote was on. A motion for the adjournment of the House had been moved by the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) about a Mrs. O'Keefe, who was about to be deported hy the Ministerf o r Immigration under the Immigration Act because she had overstayed her permission to stay here. She had been a refugee from the Japanese invasion of Java.

When will the obligation of the International Befugee Organization for these migrants cease, and when will they, be placed nn the National Welfare Fund? honourable member's questions are as follows:' 1. I presume that the question of the honourable member for Reid refers to migrants who are being selected at Samar, Philippines, for settlement here. These people are stateless displaced persons who were previously resident in Shanghai but have been evacuated to temS urary refuge provided by the Philippines overnment. The first group of 341 persons, wbich arrived by the vessel Haven on the 12th June, comprised former nationals of Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Czechoslovakia and Roumania. 2. None of these persons was iii possession of Russian passports. 3. The previous occupations followed by these people cover the normal field of employment. As an example, the following employment classifications are quoted of some who arrived by the vessel Baven:-Mechanic, cheese and butter maker, tanner, electrician, farmer, carpenter, crane operator, irrigation engineer, diesel mechanic, plumber, welder, furrier, typist, stenographer, nurse, clerk. Irrespective of previous occupational status, however, the migrants selected at Samar are admitted on the same basis as those from Europe, and are required to follow the employment to which they arc allocated for a period of two years. 4. The obligation of the International Refugee Organization for the maintenance of these people ceases on their arrival in Anstralia. In common with other displaced persons, they become entitled to a special benefit payment from the National Welfare Fund on the eighth day after their arrival. This benefit is continued until tbe breadwinner is placed in employment which is usually within a period of three to four weeks after his arrival. the Interior, upon notice1.

Are any payments made to local authorities as or in lieu of rates in respect of any of the above lands; if so, what IB the amount so paid in each State, for the latest available year? right honourable gentleman's questions are as follows:1 and 2. At tlie time of federation the Commonwealth took over from the States properties-defence , postal, customs, &c -value d at over £9,000,000. Subsequently other propertics-nava l establishments, quarantine, lightanswers to the houses-were taken over and dealt with as "" transferred properties "". From the time of federation until 1928-tim e of financial agreements-ther e were many retransfers of lands to the States necessitating alterations in areas, &.C. Since 1901 the Commonwealth has acquired for various purposes of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, a considerable number of properties each financial year. Brief particulars of all acquisitions arc recorded in acquisition registers. In some instances areas have been recorded, whilst in others measurements only have heen given. There has been a very heavy programme of acquisitions since 1940. To supply the information asked for by the honourable member would require the employment of a large staff for a lengthy period at considerable expense. The current work of the .Property and Survey Branch of my department is considerably in arrears due to tlie serious staff shortages. It is not possible therefore in existing circumstances to supply the detailed information sought by the honourable member. 3. In Uie acquisition of lands for Commonwealth purposes the compensation to be paid (or the various interests acquired is the matter of prime concern. Particulars of the unimproved value may have been indicated at the time of acquisition, but that figure would not have been a prune factor when the'compensation to be .paid under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act was decided. It has not been necessary for departmental purposes to keep over the yeaTS particulars of the current unimproved and improved values of Commonwealtli properties in each State or territory. 4. Seotion 114 of the Constitution provides that thc Commonwealth shall be exempt from the. payment of rates. The Commonwealth has however recently decided that where a property belonging to or occupied by the Commonwealth is leased for a .period of one year or more, the lease shall provide-(i ) that the lessee shall pay the equivalent of rates which would ordinarily be levied, direct to the rating authority; and (ii) that failing such payment by the lessee, the lessee shall pay to the Commonwealth an additional rent equivalent to such rates. Where the lessee pays eucn additional rent the Commonwealth may make an appropriate ex gratia payment to the rating authority. the Army, upon notice1.
