Thursday, 8 May, 1958. MB. SPEAKER (Hon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. Minister) -by leave-My attention has been drawn to the fact that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Sydney Morning Herald, and told me Ward) in the course of debate yesterday made a suggestion, or allegation, that there had been some leakage of information from the Government in respect of import licensing controls and he implied, quite directly, that the leakage had come from me and that it had proceeded to David Jones Limited, the head of that company, Sir Charles IJoyd Jones, as' is well known, being a personal friend of mine. Normally, charges made from the source to which I have referred would warrant little attention in this House, although they get some publicity elsewhere; but I believe that it is very neceshimself with this charge. sary when such a charge is made against the head of the Government that I should take the first opportunity to say-indeed , I would not need to Bay it to any other member of this Honse-that the statement is entirely untrue. Like many other honourable members, I have the pleasure of the friendship of Sir Charles Lloyd Jones, and I have great respect for him. He is a fine man. I do not think that I have had any conversation, or communication, with him directly, or indirectly, for some months. I certainly had no communication with him on this subject except, ironically enough, one. It was on Thursday, the 6th March, on which day Cabinet after protracted sessions decided upon the import restriction controls aiid gave instructions there and then to the Commonwealth Bank that it should place an embargo upon the issuo of any further letters of credit so that the new arrangement might be put into force at once without undue gossip or warning. Immediately after that took place I left with the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Brown), as that honourable membeiwill recall, on a long journey from Melbourne which, involved considerable travelling in the country. I subsequently received from Sir Charles LloydJ ones a letter which I have before me and which, apparently arrived in my office on the afternoon of the 6th March after the Cabinet's decision had been taken. That letter, far from seeking information, set out to give me some because Sir Charles quite tersely offered a variety of reasons why it would be a great blunder to impose further import restrictions. He referred to a leading article in the that he agreed heartily with it, and disagreed just as heartily with the introduction of import licensing. That is curious conduct for a man who, as has heen suggested by the honourable member for East Sydney, had already been given warning by me that he had better ""whip in "" and arrange tis letters of credit. I have stated that this charge is completely false; but I am becoming weary of these charges. Therefore, I find it necessary ask the Leader of the Opposit o tion (Dr. Evatt) whether he associates Let the honourable member for East Sydney stand up to it. the Leader of the Opposition associates himself with this charge-no t that I believe that be does, but I am asking him because . if be does, tben I shall appoint a Royal Commission on one condition, which I think, is not an unreasonable one. It is that if there is to be a Royal Commission into tbe charge made against me, as there was once a Royal Commission appointed by a former Prime Minister, tbe late Mr Curtinto investigate allegations coming from tbe same source, then on this occasion we are not to bave tbe spectacle of the-man wbo makes the cbarges and smears tbe dirt under cover of privilege, going befonthe Royal Commission and, in a cowardly fashion, pleading privilege for what he said bere, and therefore getting himself let out of tbe obligation of going on oath and being cross-examined. I will have no sucb farcical proceedings before a",6,Setup

If there is to he one-and there will be one if the Leader of the Opposition asks for one-the n it will be on the strict condition that there will be a waiver of privilege by the man -who has made this foul charge, and tha! he, like myself, will go into the box, take the oath, and submit himself to the judgment of the Court. Opposition) -by leave I believe that I should say at once that I did not know, and I do not think that any other honourable member of the Opposition knew, what was to be said by the honourable memher for East Sydney( Mr Ward). Any of his statements or criticisms were made entirely on his own responsibility. I accept the Prime Minister's own assurances to the House, and what he said, as the completely correct version of the fact3. I would not question it for one moment. I do that without any reservation at all. The only point which occurred to me was that the remarks and the criticisms of the lionorable member for East Sydney really have nothing to do with the Prime Minister, and possibly and probably, nothing to do with Cabinet. I refer to the suggestion that there was a pre-knowledge of what was to be done in connection with the import cuts. I do not ask for the appointment of a Royal Commission into that matter, but I consider that it is proper that the Government's investigators should make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether there is any sub stratum or basis for it. been ful l of rumours about the introduction of import cuts. for six weeks before the actual day, statements were published in newspapers about the imposition of import restrictions. 1 knew nothing about the matters under discussion until I heard of them yesterday. Summing up my views, I believe, first, that the honourable member for East Sydney is entitled to make his criticism on any aspect of government administration. That is his responsibility. Secondly, he made his statement last night on his own responsibility. Thirdly, I accept, without qualification, the Prime Minister's own statements of the position so far as he has outlined it, but I ask the Government to examine the circumstancesa letter was mentioned in the course of the speech-to ascertain whether there is any basis for inquiry by Commonwealth investigators or anything of that kind. I think that I should make those statements, and I do not think that I should be called upon to say any more. I was not here when the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) commenced his statement, but evidently,' he has not read what I did say in the House. I made no specific charge against the Prime .Minister at all in regard to this matter and the right honourable gentleman has avoided the real subject-matter of my speech. The important thing for the Australian public to know is whether such a letter was written on behalf of David Jones Limited to the Department of Trade and Customs in Sydney, and whether the information that was given to me and which I related to the House is accurate or otherwise. My information is that a letter was received in the Department of Trade and Customs in Sydney, signed by the Manager of the Bank of Australia and IsTew Zealand, addressed from the Martin Place office of the bank, advising that letters of credit-irrevocabl e letters of credit-ha d been arranged on behalf of David Jones Limited, to the extent of £200,000 a month, and amounting in all to £2,400,000, expiring on the 5th of March, 1953. I think that honourable members will recognize that it is not a usual practice for letters of credit to be arranged so far ahead by a company such as David Jones Limited, and that if this was a departure from normal practice, it does lead to the suspicion that there was some pre-knowledge of what the Government intended to do. I merely say that some investigation should be made to determine whether the letter was written, whether it still exists, and whether the circumstances by which David Jones Limited got this information warrant examination. If import restrictions are to be imposed, they should be imposed equitably and all firms should be treated on the same basis. I do not care what form of investigation the Prime Minister suggests should be",9,Import Restrictions

8,Mr Wakd (East Sydney),"by leavemade. That is immaterial to me, but I do -know -that, in this country to-day, there is a grave suspicion that, in the advancement of credit, certain interests .are toeing favoured to the detriment of others, "" That matter .should not be allowed to rest where it is, and I invite the Prime Minister to make the closest and conipletest examination of the points thai I hav,e raised. If he will read stateJJnited Nations prisoners in Communist ment ibst X made last night, he will find that all that 1 suggested was that lfbe right the United Nations. After earefal «hecfcbouprabis gentleman waa a particularly close friend of Sir Charles Lloyd Jones, that he imade a practice, on his visits to §ydney, of visiting Sir Charles Lloyd Jongs, that be accommodates Sir Charles Lloyd Jongs at the lodge in Canberra when official functions are being held, that he recommended Sir Charles Lloyd Jones for a title, and that Sir Charles Lloyd Jones reciprocated by giving the right honourable gentleman a nice party following the 1949 elections. Tbat is all that I said about the right bonorable gentleman, and in big statement this morning hg has admitted tbe accuracy of everything that I said, I invite bim tp make a close examination, of tbe statements that I bave made. External Affairs give any information to the House about the stage that has been reached in the Korean armistice negotiations ? has been reached in the negotiations for a cease fire and armistice in Korea. For some time, three main issues have been discussed in the armistice negotiations. The first question is whether there should he any reference in tbe. armistice provisions to tbe reconstruction and rehabilitation of air-fields, the second relates to the membership of the neutral commission for the supervision of tbe armistice, and the third is the question of repatriation of prisoners of war. As efforts to resolve tbose issues separately bad not been successful despite the most prolonged negotiations, the United States negotiator recently proposed an overall ""package settlement of tha three issues. He indicated that tbe United Nations command would agree that there should be no reference in the armistice terms to -tbe reconstruction and rehabilitation of airfields and' that tbe neutral commission should consist of Poland and Czechoslovakia as nominees of the Communists, and of Sweden and Switzerland as nominees of tbe United Nations. Finally,, he proposed that the United .Nations command should exchange for tbe 12,00f) bawds 70,000 Communist prisoners of ing and screening, it has been found by tbe United Nations that, of tbe l'32,f}Q© prisoners of war in their hands, 62,000 are so fearful of tbe consequences of it. return to North Korea or to China that tbey would forcibly resist repatriation. Normally, as the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, all prisoners of war are repatriated by botb sides under tbe terms of an armistice settlement. However, in the present circumstances, I believe that tbe right honourable gentleman will agree that the overall proposal that has been submitted is reasonable and fair and represents the limit to which the United Nations should go. I believe that tbe proposal for voluntary repatriation is a humane nlan that will appeal to everybody. Large numbers of these men have said, after they have been given a f u l l explanation of all the facts, that they would resist by force of arms, if they could obtain arms, any attempt to repatriate tbem to Communist territory. In other words, they would fear for their lives if they were forcibly repatriated. For that reason, statements in the same sense as tbe reply that I am now making to the Leader of the Opposition are to be made to-day on behalf of the United States of America and Great Britain. T believe that honourable members will agree that, in tbe peculiar circumstances that I have described, humane considerations must prevail.

14,Mr Ttjkmbtjll,"Eesiderrts ofber bas said, Mildura camp is a very fine one. It was witb very great regret that we decided that we were not able to use it completely for tbe purposes for whicb it was originally intended. Tbe decision was made following a revision of the Government's immigration programme. Under tbe revised programme, in order to relieve cbarges upon tbe Australian economy, we brougbt into this country single men or men without dependants rather than family groups. Consequently, it bas not been practicable to make full use of tbe camp at Mildura as a holding centre for family groups. A portion of tbe camp is being retained in order to provide accommodation for approximately 200 immigrant workers, wbo will be available witbin tbe Mildura district. I bave had some discussions upon this matter witb tbe Minister for the Army, who is interested in acquiring a portion of the camp for service purposes. It is not proposed to dispose of the camp in any permanent sense, because we hope that at some future time it will be possible to resume the immigration of family groups. Immigration aware, first, that there is much discontent among British immigrants at tbe Williamstown hostel in for Supply say whether the Government Victoria; secondly, that tbe average bas taken any steps to stimulate mica tariff paid by a married man with a wife production in Australia, having regard and two children is £10 14s. 6d. a week; to tbe importance of mica in our defence thirdly, that tbe necessity to expend, industries, especially tbose associated say, an additional £3 a week upon fares with electricity and radar?

As honourable years to come? prised if some discontent bas been caused cause we consider that we have a longby an increase of charges at this hostel. standing obligation to, and a close relaThat is a very natural reaction.

Several of as large as that. Many of the wives of Britisb immigrants are engaged in full-time employment at good wages, as are tbeir husbands. As far as tbe opportunity to save and move to quarters elsewhere is concerned, ail I can tell the bonorable member is that a check that I made recently showed that tbe percentage rate of turnover was about 3 per cent, a fortnight for European immigrants and only about 1$ per cent, a fortnight for Britisb immigrants. Tbose figures show either that European immigrants are proving to ibe more enterprising in finding alternative accommodation for themselves than are British immigrants, or that tbe quarters provided for the British immigrants have been so much superior to those provided for other immigrants that British immigrants have not been disposed to seek other accommodation. I assure tbe bonorable gentleman that we are trying to provide fair and reasonable conditions for immigrants. Unbiased observers from other parts of the world are emphatic and unanimous in the view that Australia is doing more to assist new settlers than is any other country.

It is produced mostly in the Harts Ranges in the Northern Territory but, as I think the honourable member is aware, some is also produced at Yinniethaara near the honourable member's electorate. Almost all the mica produced in Australia is produced in these places and is marketed through a section of my department that is known as the "" mica pool "". I am not completely satisfied that the present arrangements are the best way to achieve maximum production of tbe mineral, and so the whole matter of ing legislation placed no restriction on mica production is now under examination. Supply in a position to give to tbe House an indication of the arrangements that have been made witb the United Kingdom and the United States of America for tbe exploitation of uranium deposits in Australia, and tbe extent to wbich our future national requirements of that material are safe-guarded to give detailed information about that matter. All that I can say at this stage is that following a visit by tbe representatives of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, arrangements were made by the Australian Government, the South Australian Government, and the commission for tbe development of uranium resources in Australia and tbe sale of certain uranium products. Tbe arrangements wbich were made were highly beneficial to Australia. In making those arrangements the utmost care was taken to ensure that there would be no unwise depletion of Australian uranium resourcesbecause this most valuable product may ultimately be of great assistance to Australia industrially. tion of a question which I desire to ask Wales Government asked tbe Loan Counthe Minister for HealthI sbould like to cil for the sum of £22,000,000 for tbe purstate that in tbe Melbourne metropolitan pose of the Electricity Commission of area some hospital committees have New South Wales. Is the Treasurer threatened to make a charge to patients who enter their hospitals for treatment It has been contended that sucb a charge would not be valid and could not be enforced in view of existing Commonwealtb legislation. Will tbe Minister offer an opinion as to the merits of tbe action that bas been proposed and tbe contention that I have mentioned? Is the Minister in favour of increasing tbe amount of government contribution on behalf of patients in order that Victorian hospitals may not be further embarrassed ? this Parliament passed an act repealing the Hospital Benefits Act, and tbe amendthe Victorian or any other government. It provided that, by executive action, agreements could be made between the Australian Government and tbe State governments. Two States bave already signed such agreements. The Victorian Government was anxious to make an agreement early in the year because it found that if single men, for example, insuredat a cost of a halfpenny a day they benefited to the amount of six guineas a week. During tbe last two years every one in Australia from the oldest man to the newest born babe has been saved 17s. 6d. a year by the provision of free life-saving drugs. Thus it would actually cost 4s. 6d. a year less than that amount to provide single men witb hospital benefits amounting to six guineas a week wbicb is less than the cost of providing the patient's bed and board. At present patients are not charged for hospital treatment in public wards, and unless the present position is remedied tbere will be a complete collapse of hospital services tbroughout Australia. Tbe Commonwealth bas made an increased amount of 4s. a bed a day available to those State governments wbicb desire to take action to help themselves by providing for this extra insurance benefit for patients.",13,Kjorea

Casting ourmindscompile a history of those misdeeds and if their imagination is inadequate I suggest that they co-opt the assistance of the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ) . Honourable members have beard much about inflation. That is not peculiar to this country. It is happening all over the world. I am not going to suggest that the Labour party is wholly and solely to blame for it , but I think that at this point stand in relation to taxation -Some of bonorable members might be reminded of a statement by the late Mr Chifley on this subject. October, 1950, in practically bis last reference to inflation, Mr Chifley, as reported in the press, saidI am really perturbed at thc growing spiral of inflation in this country and, for that matter, in other countries. Neither this Menzies-Fadden Government nor any other government can be blamed for the inflationary elements. Every man in public life who has n sense of responsibility must give serious consideration to the country's honour, economy, prestige and standing abroad and to the heritage of its future citizens. T hope the Governnomic and financial policy. ment w ill do something to correct the present uot .been afraid to go out into my disturbed state of our economy whether such actions be popular or unpopular. I commend tbose words to bonorable members opposite. Lithgow on 8th March, 1948, Mr Chifley admitted tbe inflationary danger of the 40-hour week and saidIf the industrial production of Australia is economic policy that has been pronot maintained and greatly improved one must expect economic disaster. Costs have necessarily risen following the 40-hour week and they will continue to rise. How can bonorable members opposite reconcile tbose statements by Mr Chifley witb tbe statements that have been made here in the past few days? Tbe Opposition bas submitted its amendment solely because of what happened at tbe recent meeting of tbe Loan -Council. The State governments are solely responsible for tbe recent failure of Government loans. Responsibility for such failure cannot be sheeted bome to this Government. The people are unwilling to lend money for State purposes because too often tbe Statesf r it t e r Members of the Opposition sbould away loan money on works that are unnecessary. If the States restricted the expenditure of loan moneys to essential works public loans would undoubtedly -be filled without difliculty. Honourable made great play on tbe plight of Mr Brimblecombe. tbey describe as poor pensioners and other recipients of social services benefits. Yesterday we listened with amazement wben tbe honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) made a poor mouth about the difficulties of a taxpayer wbo bad an income of £14,600 a year. Honourable members opposite cannot make up tbeir minds where tbey tbem, by inference, bave suggested that the rates of tax sbould be increased in In this Parliament in order to provide funds for tbe payment of higher pensions and social services benefits; others, by inference, have suggested that the rates of taxes should be reduced in order to benefit wealthy people about whose interests tbe bonorable member for Melbourne is solicitous solely for political purposes. The Opposition appears to be divided on this matter. I am satisfied that tbe Government is pursuing a sound ecoI have electorate and put to the people tbe case as presented by tbe Government. I represent a rura l electorate, wbicb is In a speech at predominantly a wool growing area. A t successive meetings confidence bas been expressed by my electors in this Government and in the financial and pounded by tbe Treasurer. There is only one solution of the problem that confronts us to-day. Onlyi f we all do a little more work w ill be able to extricate ourselves from our difficulties. That is a matter about whicb members of tbe Opposition probably know very little. general statement. be so, but its t r u th is borne out by the remarks of the late Mr Chifley which I have just quoted. Each person in tbe community must pull a little more weight. bave the courage to tell tbe people what the real problems are and the solutions of tbose problems of which they are, in fact, aware.

33,Mr Brimblecombe,"T h a t mayThe honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Brimblecombe) asked me what reply I would make to the people of North Queensland in respect of the losses they have suffered as a result of the drought. I hope that he does not hold me responsible for the drought. However, I shall enlighten him on that subject. The following report appeared in a recent issue of a Melbourne newspaper:SAVE TERRITORY CATTLE. A gigantic military operation to save the Northern Territory from drought calamity may be urged on the Prime Minister( Mr Let us look at the cold, hard facts Menzies) next Thursday by a deputation of cattle breeders. The idea proposed by the managing director -if the Gulf Cattle Company, owners of the four million acre Brunette Downs station, Mr Queensland, many others who have not J. S. White, envisages: (1) An organized army trucking operation to move starvation threatened cattle from the territory; and (2) A major army engineering operation to drive bores to save breeding stock which cannot be moved. The fact that such a huge area of land was granted to a wealthy company which is linked with big meat exporters must excite comment. However, the point that I make is that that area was granted to that company on the understanding that, as it possessed great resources, it would be able to put down all the bores necessary to water the property and to. develop the area. That company has entirely failed to carry out its obligations and it now proposes to ask this Government to do the job. I suggest to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) that when he receives its request he should say to the company, "" Yes, we will do the job. We will also pay you for the improvements that you have put on the station, and we will cut it up and hand it over to persons who will look after the land and ensure that it will be properly developed."" Already over 100,000 cattle have been lost and further losses are expected, mainly because that wealthy company, which had been given control of 4,000,000 acres of land, has failed to carry out its obligations. would be hard to imagine any other instance in which such a great blow has been struck at primary production in this country. As all of U3 realize tbe important part that primary production plays in our economy, the problem that confronts us to-day is to devise tbe best methods of increasing production. Tbe Government bas embarked upon frantic and foolish financial measures whereas tbe solution will be found in the exercise of everyday common sense. Common sense is a characteristic of most Scotsmen and is mainly responsible for tbeir success in tbeir world. I suggest that if tbe Treasurer bad more Scotch blood in his veins Australia to-day would be enjoying a greater measure of prosperity. of this matter. Whilst electricity services bave been made available to a. great number of dairy farmers in North. such services are still working under slave conditions that existed twenty years ago. The Queensland Labour Government advanced the sum of £110,000 to aid the tobacco growers and passed legislation to enable tbose growers to market tbeir leaf on a co-operative basis. Thanks to such action on tbe part of that Government, that industry is now ahle to stand on its own feet and it is estimated that tobacco leaf production next year will be valued at £1,500,000. However, I recall that tbe industry was practically ruined in tbe past by a tory government in this Parliament. The sugar industry is in difficulties because of the heavy cost that it must incur in order to obtain requisite machinery for its mills. Tbat is the reason for the discrepancy that now exists between the cost of production and the price that tbe grower is obtaining for bis product. However, I shall not deal with that matter at length because the circumstances of the industry are now being investigated by a royal commission wbicb is expected to present its report in tbe near future. I trust that that report will be favorable to the industry. On numerous occasions I bave placed It before the Treasurer proposals designed to increase tbe output of tin.

"" I snaSll mow deal with Callide 'csaal. J",18,Suggests Military Operation To
35,Mr Ibeuce,"On -the .contrary, At isis due. About a month, ago, the Government did a fine and intelligent thing. Last year, the little sugar boats were used for the transportation of Callide coal to southern ports. That was probably the reason why I had to direct attention to the shortage of shipping to l if t sugar from the ports of northern QueenslandHowever, a few weeks ago our sugar boats, which carry 700 or 800 tons of coal, were replaced by the "" River"" class boats which carry approximately 8,000 tons of coal. Mr Theiss, who is in charge at Callide, has vvith the use of the larger vessels, Callide can supply Victoria with all the coal that it requires. The jjhips now go from Gladstone harbour to Victorian ports. For only one-half the subsidy that is paid on Indian coal, Victoria would get from Queensland at a reasonable cost all the coal that it requires, and everybody would be happy. Incidentally, I point out that coal from India is being brougbt to Australia in Japanese ships, which, after tbey have discharged tbeir cargo, proceed to Newcastle, where tbey bunker for the return voyage to India. If the Government does not adopt my suggestion, the stage will be reached at which Victoria will import coal from India and Queensland will export coal to the East. Large quantities of coal are available in Queensland and that State, if it cannot get a market in one quarter, must seek one in another quarter. Victoria should have Queensland coal in preference to Indian coal. As the result of sucb a trading poliey, production would he increased in Australia, employment would be provided for Australians, and huge sums of money would not bave to be paid for imported coal. Tbe Burdekin scbeme warrants the the attention of tbe Government, because it can be extended considerably. Tbe Minister for Commerce and Agriculture of the assets of Australia. I agree witb that statement, but I point out that the Treasurer bas refused to make money available for an irrigation scbeme in tbe Mareeba-Dimbulab area, whereby hundreds of thousands of acres would -be made suitable for the growing of tobacco and other crops. Tobacco requires, not rain, but only irrigation, and the Queeiisland Government, when it re-established the tobacco-growing industry, built a. number of surface dams in. tbe area to which I have referred. But the Treasurer has refused to make money available for the necessary irrigation schemeFor some reason that is not known to me, be is antagonistic to it. Such projects were financed from loan moneys in tbe past, and sinking funds were established to repay tbe indebtedness over a period of years. The Treasurer has guaranteed that, also refused to finance fully a hydroelectric scheme that wguld, provide -power for the dairies. Yet milk production and tobacco growing are important primary industriesIrrigation and the establishment of the electrolytic smelter would give the Burdekin district a population of between 30,000 and 40,000, able member's time has expired. --About a year ago, this Government secured a majority in both bouses of tbe Parliament. Therefore, its achievements must be measured frorq that date. During th© previous ten years the .Laboursocialists either governed this country or influenced its government by means of a Senate majority. Jfot until April, J9&1, was the Menzies Government free <jf Labour interferenceWhat condition was tbe country in after ten years of Labour rule or influence? PerhapsI can best illustrate that by relating what was told to me by a workman on a big undertaking in New South Wales. He said to me "" Mr Bate, I am drawing £15 a week, but I am only earning £3 a week. Tbis worries me a good deal, and it cannot go on. I am drawing tbe money, but I am not doing the work. There is no productivity in what I am doing. That is not my fault. I assure you that, like other Australian workmen, I want to produce more, but I cannot get the necessary materials "". Tbe atmosphere in industry in those days was such that it was.not possible for any man to do tbe job that be wanted to. About the same time, union representations were being made to Mr Galvin, a conciliation commissioner, for higher wages to meet increased living costs, but evidence was brought tp show",19,Shotm Ibave R Equir Ed J A I L Services

38,"Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) (11,45).","that idling and go-slow tactics were rife in industry, and worse still, that pride of achievement was disappearing as a trait of the character of Australian workwere offering more and more to tbeir men. Honourable members on both sides of tbe House know quite well that that was not the fault of tbe workmen themselves for the men simply did not have tbe machinery, equipment and material that tbey required to do a full day's work. I think that Mr Galvin said that if proment, to tbe stock market. Consequently, duction was not being increased, tbe men had no case for higher wages. Increasing production costs were rebounding on working men because tbey were being forced to pay more for tbe necessaries of life. Production was decreasing instead of increasing. For instance, tbe cost of repairing ships rose out of all proportion, witb the result that all commodities carried by sea became dearer to,the consuming public. Let me illustrate my point in another way. A few weeks ago I was privileged to inspect tbe Kiewa hydro-electric scbeme in Victoria. In September of last year that undertaking was employing about 3,500 men, but, because cement supplies were inadequate the big cement mixing and laying machines engaged on the water races were idle. In fact, in an endeavour to keep the men busy, the management issued shovels and wheelbarrows and let the huge machines remain idle. ""When i'l-an money dried up, tbe diversion of ubour from Kiewa to other projects began, and a month or so later the number of employees bad fallen to 750. By (bat time, tbere was enough cement for tbe machines, and tbey were again put to work. A new atmosphere became evident throughout tbe valley, and men began to take an interest in their work. To-day, although the project is not yet back to full-scale operation, tbere is a different spirit abroad. The men are trying. Tbe electricity and water that will make so much difference to a large part of Victoria will soon be available. By July of last year horrifying trends in our economy bad become apparent. Industry was slowing up and was on tbe . erge of collapse. Personal incomes were T high, but their purchasing power was low. Demands for labour and materials were mounting and tbe turn-over of labour in most industries was so rapid that few Ur. Jeff Bate. men could settle down in tbeir jobs. They were constantly being attracted away by wage-bargaining. Employers employees, but production was becoming less and less. The investment boom was at its height. Prices of stocks and shares were at record levels. Farmers were being induced to divert their capital from farm machinery, and equipprimary production was falling, while tbe flow of money to wasteful and non-essential industries continued unabated. People were attracted by tbe opportunity to make money on the stock exchange, and soaring share prices was the result. Inflation is tbe ally of socialism. In fact, it is part and parcel of socialism. The results of this alliance are most evident in. New Soutb Wales wliere the intrusion of socialism into domestic affairs has continued for ten years under Labour administrations. We have seen the spectacle of the Premier of that State coming to Canberra to seek substantial allocations of loan funds, yet at least £13,000,000 of tbe revenue that the Government of New South Wales hopes to raise by way of loans will do nothing at all to increase tbe output of electricity. It is to be used to purchase tbe Balmain Electric Light Company's undertaking and certain railway electricity establishments. Probably we shall never see tbe accounts of tbese transactions between government departments because railways accounts are always rather inaccessible. That is one instance of socialism's alliance witb inflation. Returning to conditions that prevailed in this country in July of last year, I remind the House of the state of the building industry. The number of buildings under construction bad increased from 39,000 to 63,000 in four years and building costs had soared enormously. I know of one house at Roseville wbicb was bought for £1,200 in 1938. Last year, tbe owner was offered £7,000 for it. The building boom was tben at its height. Public works bad been greatly expanded. Because of this and because of private capital investment, tbe demand for labour and materials was excessive. Tbe full effects -of the 40-hour week which had been prematurely thrust upon the people by the McGirr Government in New South course, probably as the result of the worries of that period, relinquished office as Premier recently and, like certain other of his colleagues, has been appointed to a public office at a substantial salary. The full effects of the f l increase of the basic wage were also being felt in July of last year. Workmen were saying, "" We do not want the basic wage to rise because the extra money is no good to us"". The immigration programme was placing pressure upon our economy. The population of this country was increasing at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum. Two-thirds of that was the natural increase which was a reflection of prosperity and confidence, and the remaining one-third was due to immigration. The lag in our productive effort was obvious to everybody. Our industrial concerns compared very unfavorably with those of the Americans, who are brilliant at getting the best from their men and their machines. ' The Communists had deliberately sabotaged our industries by pursuing their dangerous work in the key unions wherever they could. Defence preparations had to go ahead because we could not afford to be caught naked in the face of the advance of communism in Asia ancl other parts of the world. Export incomes had increased in a period of four years from £309,000,000 to £908,000,000. The cost, of imports had increased enormously. Over a period of fourteen years, the annual cost, of imports had multiplied three and a half times. Tbe rate has increased slightly since then. The Government first had a chance to tackle tbese problems on the 1st July, 1951. Tbe Prime Minister organized a conference at Sydney, at which tbe situation was discussed witb the Premiers and various other leaders. The task called for tremendous courage. Some critics say that politicians are merely eager to ingratiate themselves with the electors. But this Government declared that it had an important nob to do and that it would go ahead and do it regardless of criticism. Then it framed its anti-inflationary programme. I shall discuss in detail later in my speech the improvements that bave heen effected as a result of that programme. But first I am proud to acknowledge the courage of the Prime Minister, tbe Treasurer, and their colleagues in the Government who have pressed on with tbeir work notwithstanding its unpopularity witb Australians who previously had been enjoying high incomes and the benefits of hoom conditions. Tbe programme called for hard work, and many people resented it on that account. Those wbo are weak and craven and wbo lack faith in the future of Australia are the most critical of the Government to-day. But we are proud of what the Government has achieved in the last year. The most important inflationary pres sure that developed during tbe period of Labour's administration was caused by the reduction of primary production. That reduction was a direct result of other inflationary pressures, sucb as the 40-hour week and tbe building boom. Houses were built in the wrong places. They were erected, not adjacent to the coalfields and the steel-works, but in suburbs where values were high. Whenever a house was built in one of our cities, some young man on a farm was forced by circumstances to leave the country to live in that bouse and to seek a job at £15 or £20 for a 40-hour week. He could not be expected to live with bis wife in a lean-to or in some other sub-standard accommodation wben be could enjoy all "" mod. cons."" in a Housing Commission bouse. Primary production has been too unprofitable over tbe years, although the situation is now improving under this Government. Farmers bave not been able to save much money, and therefore tbey bave not been able to retire in their old age but have been obliged to stay on their properties. For this reason, young men have been obliged to leave the farms, and this drift has been accelerated by the inflationary pressure developed under socialistic rule. Splendid young Australians who could and would increase primary production have been driven to the cities, where they now belong to the trade unions which, by tbeir militant activities, have succeeded in establishing conditions in industry that are attractive to hard-working poorly-paid farmers.

Two or three matters are causing the members of the Government parties great concern. We appreciate that this Government, by its strength and courage, bas produced a situation of whicb we are proud. We are aware also that our economy is most delicately balanced. able gentleman's time has expired. was very refreshing to listen to tbe attempt by tbe bonorable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) to place tbe responsibility for the present conditions in this country, not upon tbe Government, but upon tbe Opposition. One or two of the statements that be made require to be corrected. He spoke of Laboursocialist inflationary action during the last ten years. I remind him that Labour was in office from 1941 to 1949a period of eight years only-and that at the end of World War II . Australia had the lowest price level in tbe world and was suffering from inflation to a lesser degree than was any of tbe other countries that bad been associated witb the democratcics in that war. Tbe existence of that state of affairs was due solely to thc operation of controls. Those controls were, in part, instituted by a. government similar to this Government, hut they were substantially improved and made mors efficient, by Labour governments under the leadership of the late Mr Curtin and tbe late Mr Chifley. Between 1945 and 1949 there was an inflationary tendency throughout tbe world but, as a result of tbe continuance of the operation of controls in Australia, prices in this country increased to a lesser degree than in any other country. It is well to remember that controls are not necessary wben the economy of a country is on an even keel and when conditions are normal, but immediately economic conditions in a country become abnormal, tbe safety of the ecoaiomic life of the nation depends upon wise controls being instituted for the purpose of overcoming the difficulties caused' by tbe presence of irregular conditions? in tbe economic system. I support the amendment, because I believe that it expresses clearly and succinctly tbe present public feeling in this country. Honourable gentlemen opposite have complained in the course of tbe 1 debate that the Opposition has not advanced constructive suggestions. It is not the function of tbe Opposition, wben it bas moved an amendment in wbicb it expresses its lack of confidence in tbe Government, to advance constructive suggestions. In tbose circumstances, the function of the Opposition is to attempt to prove that the amendment is fully justified. Incidentally, I remind honourable gentlemen opposite that during th<* time that I have been a member of the Parliament tbe Opposition bas, on many occasions, advanced constructive suggestions in respect both of Government policy and of legislation that ias been introduced, but on every occasion our constructive suggestions have been rejected, frequently by the use of the gag. It is most peculiar that, when the Government has got itself into difficulties, it should expect the Opposition to suggest constructive means by which it can extricate itself from tbe difficulties that it bas created. Tbis Government has been in office now for two years and four months. It assumed office under the best possible circumstances. It was returned witb a workable majority, at a time when the national revenue was increasing, the Commonwealtb Treasury was full , and good prices were being secured for our exports. There was a rising tide of immigration, wbicb was alleviating our man-power difficulties. Financial and economic security was evident throughout tbe country. In addition, tbe rate of production was increasing. No other government has ever come into office in this country witb greater opportunities. No other government bas ever assumed office at a. time of greater promise, or as the result of making more promises.. But, after 28 months, we find that tbe healthy conditions that were evident in December, 1949, bave been replaced by general instability and a complete lack of confidence. I can. summarize tbe position by stating that loans floated by theCommonwealtb bave failed, that in a period of 24 months prices have increased by 45 per cent., that developmental work bas been slowed down, that overseas balances are dwindling rapidly, that productive forces are being thrown into confusion, that rural production is decreasing, that drastic credit restrictions bave",22,Shotm Ibave R Equir Ed J A I L Services

41,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [12.5],"I tbeen imposed, that tbere has been a reduction of living standards and that tbe country bas been financed by the issue of approximately £200,000,000 of additional treasury-bills. In those circumstances, the natural question to ask is: In what way bas Government policy been responsible for the conditions that now obtain? It can be said that tbose conditions have been caused .by hesitant, anaemic and weak action by tbe Government. When bonorable gentlemen opposite took ofiice, tbey bad several slogans. One was, "" Put value back into the £1anotber "" No controls duce taxation "". Last, but not least, was their cry that they were going to use the resources of the community to increase production. I, like every other bonorable member, believe that a policy of increasing production is a good one. But wben we analyse the Government's activities, we find that one of the great difficulties that besets it is a total inability to assess tbe reaction of tbe national economy to the steps that it takes from time to time in implementing its policy. One of the first tasks that faced this Government, and whicb had to he performed if the greatest advantage were to be derived from tbe conditions that tben obtained in Australia, was to ensure that sufficient developmental work was done to enable the needs of an increasing population to be met. Tbe honourable member for Macarthur bas pointed out that, as a result of immigration and of natural increases, the population of Australia is increasing at a. rate of 3 per cent, per annum. As our population is increasing at that astonishing rate, certain developmental work must be done. Otherwise, tbe best results cannot be secured from immigration. As our population increases, we need, for instance, greater supplies of electricity and water, more transport facilities and additional Our requirements in relation to hospitals, schools and roads bave increased considerably. mental work is not done, we shall be unable to make full and effective use of the nation's increased man-power. Tbe Government bas failed in every direction to provide increased facilities for an Mr Clare]/. increased production. Tbe Government's actions in relation to tbe raising of loan moneys have completely destroyed confidence and made it almost impossible for money to be borrowed. Eirst of all, tbe Government took tbe totally unjustifiable action of issuing loan securities at a discount. Then it increased its interest rate with the result that there was general instability in the money market. Tbe small investor who found it necessary to cash his Government securities became unable to get back all that be had invested. Tbere are indications that if tbe Governwas ment had the confidence of tbe people it and anotber was "" Recould now borrow more money than it borrowed during the last twelve months. But the Government's policy bas brought about sucb a lack of confidence in it that its financial policy has been disrupted. On the 3rd October, 1951, the Prime Minister made a statement wbicb clearly indicates that Government action and Government policy have been frequently in contradiction. He saidWe have deliberately, aa a counter-inflationary measure, encouraged the increased procurement of goods. Wo must, if we are to meet inflation and if we are to have a supply of goods equal to the supply of money, have a large inflow of goods coming into this country. Then be endeavoured to demonstrate tbe soundness of bis Government's policy by stating that imports during the financial year 1948-49 amounted to £414,000,000, during 1949-50 to £536,000,000, and during. 1950-51 to £742,000,000. He concluded by saying that if imports continued to flow into tbe country at the then existing rate their value would reach £900,000,000 during the financial year. Tbe obvious inference from the Prime Minister's statement was that tbe shortage of goods was to be corrected by imports from other countries. At the same time, tine Government put into operation a policy wbich inevitably had to production. have the effect of reducing production and increasing the quantity of ; raooi'f*. TnTeased production will If the necessary developonly be possible if greater productive forces are made available to industry. In other words, tbere must be more buildings, more technological equipment and new machinery. Those productive forces cannot be acquired without capital resources. Credit restrictions and capital issues control make it more difficult for people to increase production. A policy of credit restriction together with an increase in imports must inevitably restrict industrial activity in Australia. The increasing quantity of imports from other countries must tben steadily reduce Australia's overseas balances. Tbat is what has happened during the last twelve montbs. The Government made tbe great mistake, wben it instituted credit restrictions of assets and disaster for tbe people of and capital issues control, of failing to take steps gradually to diminish tbe quantity of imports. After several months it found that bankruptcy was facing this country because of the depletion of overseas balances. Hurried action vvas taken and, consequently, the whole economic life of Australia has been thrown into confusion. The Government's action is likely to have the gravest results. A substantial proportion of Australian production depends on tbe importation of basic raw material from overseas. The manufacture of tyres, for example, is impossible without tbe importation of large quantities of rubber. Tbe manufacture of cotton goods depends upon substantial importations of cotton. One industry in my electorate bas been making 95 per cent, of the high-speed tools that are used in engineering in Australia. That industry must close down unless it can secure high-speed steel from Canada or elsewhere. The linseed oil industry is in a similar position. If imports are to be reduced by hundreds of millions of pounds during tbe next twelve montbs many industries will be unable to continue to produce goods. They will have to restrict tbeir activities and tbere will be wholesale unemployment. Australia is approaching a grave crisis gained office. If the Leader of tbe Oppoin industry. Rural production has been sition (Dr. Evatt) becomes Prime falling during tbe last two years and there Minister is a lack of confidence and a feeling of insecurity in the community wbicb is disastrous from an economic and a psychological point of view.

Tbe people are entitled to protest. Tbey are entitled to Government assistance in ' order to continue production and maintain tbe standard of living whicb is essential to tbe Australian way of life. I submit that conditions wbich nowoperate are reducing our standard of living. They will lead to wholesale unemployment and a general depreciation Australia. master-General and Minister for Civil Aviation) [12.25],-If ever a person bas a "" b it both ways"" it is the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey).

How could anybody discover either what tbe bonorable gentleman means or what be wants? He wants to be the friend of everybody. In other words, he wants to get everybody's vote by saying the exact opposite to opposing interests.

But he opposes tbe abolition .of tbe averaging system of taxation which . applies only to primary producers who bave incomes of more than £4,000 a year and wbicb bas given tbose primary producers a tax advantage over ordinary taxpayers that has amounted to years. While opposing that proposal he member' on the 'Opposition side fhe contends that we have to increase governcourage at this stage tb say that, be mental revenues so that we can provide increased social services. He cannot bave it both ways. Tbe truth is, of course, that tbe Opposition has no policy. In fact, it is impossible for it to have a policy at tbe moment because its policy is formulated, not by tbe members of the Labour party wbo have been elected to At tbe same time, however, tbe Parliament, but by tbe federal executive of tbe Australian Labour party outside Parliament. Unfortunately, that federal executive exists only in part to-day, because its former president, Mr J. A. Ferguson, has been removed from the political scene. He bas been compelled to accept appointment as chairman of tbe Milk Board of New South Wales at a salary of £2,300 a year. He has, of course, made a great sacrifice in stepping down from the position of federal president of the Australian Labour party, whicb is now without a federal president. Until that body gives tbe Opposition its instructions tbe Opposition cannot say & darned thing about what it would do if it were in .office. ; We have, however, some enlightenment on tbe matter.

I remind honourable members that tbe points I am stating are part of tbe allegedly constructermed, in a well-known phrase, ""milk tive programme that tbe official voice of Labour, tbe Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, bas submitted -as an alternative to the Government's policy. Tbe next point of the plan is, "" Transfer prices powers from tbe States t« tbe Commonwealtb, or bold a -referendum to amend tbe Constitution for that purpose"". time of crisis that just about takes tbe bun, because two referendums have already been held on that specific matter and the proposals to alter the Constitution were in both instances overwhelmingly rejected by the electors. b j a simple majority. whelmingly rejected. It is therefore obvious that a feature of Labour's policy is to do something that tbe Labour party as a government would not have tbe constitutional power to do, and wbicb the people has denied it the power to do. Tbe next point in tbe plan is, "" Control capital issues"". That is exactly what we are doing and what we bave been criticized for doing. But this official voice of tlie Labour party goes a little hit further. It says, "" Control capital issues and direct investments to give production of necessities and consumer goods priority"". Will tbe honourable member for Melbourne, wbo, I understand., is a member of tbe Victorian Executive of tbe Australian Labour party member of it, tben he is very lucky. Wbat does "" control of investment"" mrean? Doesi t mean taking out of the bands of tbe private individual money that he may have in banks OT on fixed deposits and using it as a socialistic government thought fit? If it does mean thsut, then how can sucb a policy be reconciled witb the -contentions of honourable members opposite about tbe need to remove controls? We believe that tbe control of capital issues sbould be maintained, because we consider that people who wish to engage in tbe production of frivolous products, or what might be bar"" products, sbould not be given priority in the supply of cement, steel and other building materials over industries that can aid our national productivity. Consequently we shall retain capital issues control. The Leader of thc Opposition bas said that that was an iniquitous thing. Indeed tbe whole For a policy in a tenor of his argument was to the effect that tbe Government's actions were iniquitous. The Opposition says that tbe Government should co-ordinate its plans and tliose of State governments to obtain tlie best results from available labour, and to speed-up developmental projects for power, fuel and water services. bers opposite say ""bear, hear"", and so do we. Therefore, about that important matter we are on common ground.

Time will not permit me to deal with the actions of all of them, but I shall deal witb what has been done by tbe Labour Government in New South Wales. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition maintains that this Government bas imposed too heavy a burden on primary producers. He says that taxation is too high, and he has tried to cash in on our enactments in relation to provisional tax, tbe abolition of tbe averaging system and so on. However, let us consider what bis colleague in New South Wales has done for primary producers. Recently the New South Wales Labour Government increased rail freights in New South Wales by no less than 166 per cent. Surely that is a heavy burden upon the primary producer. All produce that now comes into Sydney is burdened with enormously increased freights. In 1945 a bushel of wbeat could future Prime be transported from Parkes to Sydney for 7d. Now it costs 2s. What has tbe New South Wales Labour Government done for tbe residents of Sydney? It has increased tram fares from about 2d. a section to about 4d. a section. In fact it costs about 6d. to travel almost anywhere in a train in Sydney to-day. Tbat has been done by a Labour government, the supporters of wbich in this House say that no burdens sbould be placed on tbe primary producers or tbe people of AusWhat did the Australian Labour party do wben it held ofiice in tbe Commonwealtb sphere? I suggest that the people of Australia bave good reason to remember what it did. During the regime of the last Labour government bonorable members opposite used tbeir authority in sucb an arbitrary and dictatorial way in respect of finance and most other matters that in 1949, wben the people had an opportunity to pass judgment, tbey threw party in the weakest condition that it bad been in since 1931. Tbe bonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and others came back to this Parliament after The Austhe 1949 general election and said that it was all a ghastly mistake, and that tbeir reverse was due to malicious propaganda because the people did not really underwhen tbere was a double dissolution of the Parliament fifteen months later, tbe people had another opportunity of exercising their judgment. Again tbey refused to have a Labour government. Therefore, their action in 1949 was not a mistake at all, but was a matter of considered judgment. Honourable members opposite are again trying to tell us that the people made anotber mistake. Surely tbey do not believe that the people have forgotten that Labour tried to nationalize tbe banking system. Do bonorable members opposite believe that the people no longer remember that tbe Labour party wanted to supervise everybody's banking account, and to abolish every bank except tbe one whicb it could completely control and, by that means, control the private affairs of every person in the country?

Tbey will want to know whether, prior to the general election, every Labour candidate will have to sign a pledge to tbe effect that torate, where there had been a daily mail he will put that policy into operation at the first opportunity upon bis return to power.

This time it was directed at tbe Labour Government of New South Wales, wbicb be attacked because it has increased rail fares and freights. The honourable gentleman did not tell the House and the people of Australia why tbose increases became necessary. He knows perfectly well that tbey were necessary because, this Government has starved the States of tbe Commonwealth of money witb which to carry on vital public works. All bonorable members are aware of the battering which our railways received during tbe war years. I suggest that the New South Wales Government had no other course than to increase fares and freights in order to keep its railways operating. Tbe Postmaster-General also failed to state that his department has increased postal £17,000,000 since this Government came to office. Wireless licences now cost £2 instead of £1; telephone rentals are much higher; letter-boxes cost 30s. a year whereas formerly they cost £1, and telegrams and registration fees have also increased. Almost every service rendered by his department has increased in price. He made no mention of tbe drastic curtailment of mail services in country districts. In one instance in my elecservice for the past 50 years there is now a service only' three times a week. In anotber instance, a service wbich previously operated three times a week now operates only twice a week. The honourable gentleman did not tell us why thousands of Australians, and particularly primary producers, are unable to obtain telephones. People of my acquaintance who paid a deposit more, than two years ago still have not been supp'Ied with a telephone service. During the debate in tbe House this morning, honourable members opposite made great play witb tbe administration of tbe. Australian Labour party during the eight years it was in office. I suggest that during that time Australia was an oasis and the envy of tbe entire world. Nobody squealed wben tbe Labour Government was in office. Let me give bonorable members a precis of the political events wbicb bave occurred since the present coalition Government took office in 1949. Tbe press and all thinking Australians are disturbed at tbe drift in Australia's economy. Honourable members will recollect that in 1949 the Menzies Government inherited a balanced budget from the Chifley Government. Even the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has stated that the economy of the country was sound when be took office. There were buoyant overseas trade balances. There was a defence organization which planned to expend £50,000,000 a year for five years. A rocket range project had been established in conjunction with tbe TJnited Kingdom Government. Trans-Australia Airlines was an efficient and profitable organization. We controlled Qantas Empire Airways. We had a Commonwealtb shipping line.

There was an international wheat agreement and there were long-term contract? witb tbe United Kingdom for the sale of our primary products.

An important feature of Labour administration was its staunch and effective co-operation with the United Nations organization. We had a sound foreign policy wbicb worked in co-operation with that of other countries of the British Comfull-page advertisement that was pubmonwealth of Nations.. During tbose eight years three referendums were held at which the Government sought power to ensure peace-time stability and security. As all honourable members are aware, that power was denied to tbe Government, largely on advice given to tbe people by the supporters of tbe Liberal and Australian Country parties. The evil results of such advice are evident to all Australians to-day. Labour's eight years of office that in 1.949 office 1 vernment's turn is coming. So effective were Labour's eight years of office that during tbe 1949 general election campaign the Australian Labour party found it unnecessary to make any definite election promises. Instead, the members of tbe Government merely said to the electors, "" We shall continue our good work and do whatever is necessary to promote tbe happiness and welfare of the people and to maintain our economy on a sound basis "". Sixteen montbs later, wben the 1951 general elections were inzmhvent, iit was neeessary for the Australian Labour party to promise tbe people that it would do certain things if returned to office, because in that brief period the present Government bad already severely dsintaged the sound economy that it had inherited from its; predecessor.. Despitetbe signs of deterioration which were even tben apparent, tbe people of Australia re-elected this Government. How tbey regret it to-day! Our economic ills are so obvious that id a general election were beid to-morrow party would sweep the Government fron* ofiice. Of course, the Government hopes that the economic position wiU right itself. Tbat is a vain hope when it is considered in the light of the results attained during two years of. unfettered control of tbe Parliament by a government wbich is already notorious for its broken promises. Limitation of time permits me to deal with only a few of thesepromises. First, the Government said' Stoat it wonld put value back into the £L Honourable members may remember the lished in tbe Sydney Morning Herald under tbe beading, "" This is Our Policy' . r It bore a glamorous photo of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Government's promises were printed underneath. All those promises bave been repudiated'. As bonorable members are aware, the basic wage is adjusted quarterly in accordance witb the variation in the So effective were price of basic commodities. When tbe Chifley Government went out of ofhw in 1949 the basic wage was £6 12s. a week. In March, 1950, it increased by 3s. to £6 15s.; in June, 1950, by 3s. to £6 18s.; in September, 1950, by 4s. to £7 2s. ;in December, 1950, by 23s. to£8 5s.; iu March, 1951, by 8s. to £8 13s.; in June-, 1951, by 7s. to'£9; in September, 1961, by 13s. to £9 13s.; in December, 1951, bj' 14s. to £10 7s.; and in March, 1952, by 9s. to £10 16s.

The last budget that was presented to the Parliament by this Government was a suicide budget which is gradually converting a prosperous Australia into a nation of bankrupts, dole queues and soup kitchens as it was wben tbe Liberal Country party bunglers condemned Australia to the depression blizzard in 1930.

[2.35] -Listening to the speeeh of the honourable member for Hume( Mr of the Labour party noticed it. Let me Fuller) I was reminded of that oftquoted line, "" F u l l of sound and fury, signifying nothing "". The Opposition's attack on the .Government's economic policy, insofar as that policy has been attacked by honourable members opposite, has taken two forms. In the first place, the Opposition charged the Government witb inconsistency. Honourable members opposite bave accused us of following one course on one day and a totally opposite course on another. In its second form the attack has been directed to single acts efficient. War must be paid for in cash of the Government. If we institute capital issues control the Opposition attacks us for so doing; if we institute import licensing, that policy is attacked; if at anotber time we decide to encourage imports, the Opposition again attacks us. Whatever we do, bonorable members opposite attack us in an attempt to sustain their charge that tbe Government has acted inconsistently. An argument based upon tbose premises starts from the supposition that when a government assumes office ancl is faced, as every government must be faced, with many and varied circumstances, it should immediately evolve a master plan and thenceforth all its actions should proceed in orderly sequence, step by step, in accordance with that plan. Human experience tells us that events do not follow such an orderly course and that governments are called upon to deal, not with an orderly flow of events, but for the greater part of their terms of ofiice with tbe contingent and the unforeseen. had adopted an inflexible policy, and did not modify its actions from time to time to meet such circumstances, there would have been some reason for criticism of its economic policy. What has been the world position during the last ten or fifteen years? First, there was the world war, with all tbe destruction of material assets consequent upon such a conflict. Yesterday the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr. Ward) implied that limitless financial resources were available to the Government. He asked Avhether, during tbe war,, any one thought tbe war would stop simply because the supply of money bad run out. His argument was greeted witb laughter by bis supporters. Apparently this argument was so stupid that even members remind tbe House that that almost happened and would bave happened but for the institution of lend-lease. Had it not been for this, Britain's war effort would in fact bave come to an end for lack of cash. War is paid for, not only in human suffering and material destruction, but also in hard cashAs a part of the aftermath, of war, we are short of materials, our railway systems are run down and transport, shipping, ports and harbour installations are in and to tbe uttermost farthing. It is completely unreal to suggest that limitless financial resources can be made availableto the Government to remedy theae ills. No government is responsible for the deficiencies that exist to-day; they resulted frorn tbe war. It is as foolish to charge any government, irrespective of its political colour, with responsibility for their existence as it is to lay upon tbe shoulders of any hody of persons responsibility for catastrophes such as tbe great depression. Tbe paramount need of the world to-day is for goods of all kinds to repair the losses that were suffered by the nations that participated in the war. Since this Government took office its first great need bas been the speedy supply of tbese goods. Tbe Government, through its economic policy, obtained those goods quickly, by the only way in wbicb they could be obtained, namely, by importation. It encouraged, and rightly so, the importaI f the Government tion of goods. The encouragement of imports presupposes capacity on tbe part of tbe nation to pay for tbem. When, because of circumstances beyond tbe control of this Government or any other Government, our export income suddenly diminished, principally as a result of tbe tremendous fall in tbe price of wool, the Government took strong, positive, decisive and necessary action to meet tbe situation by restricting tbe issue of import licences.",32,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
72,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,33,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
73,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"Every government must take action of a positive and decisive kind when confronted by events of the kind that confronted us in recent months. I remind the House that our predecessors in office, who charge us with having taken sudden action, took equally precipitous action when the Britishf l was devalued. I do not intend to discuss the rights or wrongs of devaluation or revaluation of the Australian £1. I merely recall to the minds of that party. That alternative is socializa-honourable members that when the British £1 was devalued the Chifley Government took immediate action to devalue tbe Australian £1, a decision"" whicb was far-reaching and drastic in its consequences. When I say that the Government's economic policy must be altered to meet varying circumstances arising from world events, I do not want it to be thought that I do not believe that tbere is a central principle to whicb the Government should adhere. The central principle of the Government's economic policy must be increased production. It is no accident that the production of coal in Australia during the last three montbs exceeded by 1,000,000 tons tbe amount of coal produced during tbe comparable period last year. It is no accident that in tbe six months ended June, 1951, tbe labour force of tbe coal industry of New Soutb Wales was increased by 656 men compared with a net annual intake of 46:1 during tbe preceding five years. It is no accident that during tbe twelve montbs ended March last Australian steel production was increased by 1,200,000 tons; or that during tbe two and a half years that the Government bas been in office it bas provided 40 per cent, of tbe total number of war service homes that have been provided since the War Service Homes Act was introduced 33 years ago; or that in one year this Government, thanks to its economic policy,. bas been responsible for the construction of tbe record number of 70,000 houses. Those are facts. Under the Government's economic policy attention is now being directed to the rehabilitation of tbe rural industries of Australia wbich previous administrations allowed to decline to tbeir lowest ebb. Supporters of the Government who bave Having regard to present economic cirspoken in this debate bave pointed out cumstances throughout tbe world, it is that honourable members opposite, whilst obvious that we shall require to use tbese they bave criticized the Government's policy, bave not offered any alternative to it. Whilst it is true that no member of the Opposition bas presented any concrete alternative to that policy in this House, nevertheless, the fact remains that the Labour party bas an alternative. That alternative is to be found in tbe Australian Labour party's platform and is seared into tbe soul of every member of tion and nationalization. Under Labour's policy no industry, profession, business, bank, or any walk of life would be free from the pink of nationalization, if ever this country again bad tbe misfortune of being governed by Labour. That fact was made clear by tbe bonorable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) in tbe course of bis remarks yesterday. He did not. envisage any expansion of national wealth or any fresh fields of human endeavour. On the contrary, he looked back to the days wben food, petrol, clothing and other essentials were rationed; and, in doing so. he summed up Labour's economic policy, which is to reduce tbe community to the soul-destroying level of mediocrity inherent in socialism. That is tbe alternative that Labour bas to offer to this Government's economic policy, and it is well that the people sbould remind themselves of that. fact. Australia is now faced with great difficulties. I bave no doubt that, in meeting them, the Government will make some mistakes. It would be contrary to all human experience to expect otherwise. We must realize that import licensing controls, and other weapons that the.Government is using, or may have to tise in the future, to meet tbese difficulties are double-edged and will bring other difficulties in their train. We have no alternative but to rely upon such weapons. However, under the flexible policy of the Government they will be used witb wisdom. But, whilst the Government Js determined to resort to them only as temporary and expedient measures, and I use these words advisedly, no one need assume that the period for wbich it must employ tbem will be necessarily short. weapons for a considerable time to come before onr economy generally will be restored to normal. Nevertheless, tbe Government regards tbem as being only temporary and expedient. I again remind tbe House that tbe only alternative that presents itself to a free and liberal government is to place such weapons in tbe bands of a socialist adminparty, in spite of the propagandists of istration whicb would use tbem to fasten restrictions forever round tbe necks of Australian citizens. In order to solve our present problems we require a national outlook, « united purpose and I do not indict nny particular industry-harde r work. We must recognize our present difficulties apologizing; I am simply stating the and realize that we must get out of them. We need free and abundant opportunity ro create new wealth. We must shun tbe restrictions that the bonorable memher for Fremantle propounded-rationin g and thc darg-that are inherent in socialism. We need to give freedom of opportunity to initiative and enterprise, f have no doubt that under this Government's policy every Australian will be given that opportunity and also that of enjoying tbe reward of initiative and witcrprise. I am certain that the Australian people agree witb me when I say that our difficulties cannot be overcome if .we merely have recourse to tbe dull, levelling, soul-destroying doctrine of socialism. 12.52] -We bave beard nothing new from tbe bonorable membeifor Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron), who bas just resumed his seat. He told tbe House once again that the Labour party believes in socialism and. that if Labour were returned to office tbe Australian people would get anotber dose of socialism. If that is what the Australian Labour party's policy really involves, the majority of Australians, nevertheless, are waiting anxiously for a change from liberalism to socialism. But I remind the House that whilst the Australian Labour party bas always made it clear that it believes that monopolies which exploit the people should be socialized and placed under the control and ownership of the people to be operated by tbe people for the benefit of the people as a whole and not for tbe benefit of a privileged few, Labour bas, at tbe same time, made it equally clear that its policy witb respect to socialism does not, and never wiHl, envisage a form of socialism that aims at complete public ownership and control of all private property; nor bas it ever done so. The Australian Labour tbe Liberal party, will never socialize forms of private ownership, sucb as that of homes, motor cars, small businesses, &c. facts. I challenge any supporter ot tbe Government to produce any evident* that any authorized spokesman of tlie Australian Labour party has ever said that Labour intends to socialize every form of private property. Wbat Labour's policy means is that it will socialise all monopolies that are being used by the few to exploit the manyOne of t!-e most important monopolies in Australia, as it is in any other country, is that of finance^ wbicb the private banks bave operated fo tbeir own advantage on previous occasions. If the Labour party has the opportunity, those nnancial institutions w i ! never again have the right to do as tbey did during tbe financial depression of 1929-31. No one can gainsay the fact that the private trading banks, wbicb are only one of many monopolies in this country that should be controlled by tbe people for tbe benefit of tbe people rather than for the benefit of a few privileged individuals, played a major role during tbe depression. Tbey acted, in & large measure, as a means of preventing the alleviation of tbe effects of the depres>sion. Had the government of tbe day been in tbe position to control that financial monopoly in tbe interests of tbe people rather than for the benefit of tbe shareholders of tbe banks, the unemployment problem would have been-solved ; 1 and today tbe Snowy Mountains hj$m clectric scheme, instead of being in the initial stages, would bave been almost complete and Australia would tben have had no less than 3,000,000 kilowatts of power equivalent to 4,000,000 tons of' the best black coal, which is in sucb short",33,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

Everybody knows that that government was prevented from giving effect to its policy. The present Government is now under attack for its disastrous financial and economic policy, which has brougbt the country to its present straits. The Government can no longer blame tbe Senate for preventing it from giving effect to its policy, because it has a majority of supporters in that chamber as well as in the House of Eepresentatives. Tbe misdeeds of the Government can no longer be attributed to the Senate. Ministers must take full responsibility for all their misdeeds, and stand or fall in tbe opinion of the people on tbe results of tbeir policy. tt is important for us to examine the policy of the Government, as expressed in its promises during the general election campaign in 1949. In order to obtain an idea of the policy that tbe Government promised to implement, I shall read some passages from an advertisement that was published on behalf of the Liberal party in the Australian Woman's Weekly on the 3rd December, 1949, only seven days before the election. I mention, in passing, that at that election tbe people rejected the best Prime Minister-the late Mr J. B. Chifley-that has ever graced this House. I shall read three of the pre-election protbat the Government bas not increased mises on tbe basis of wbicb tbe Liberal party received from the people a mandate to govern. The advertisement, which occupies a full page of the magazine and cost the private trading banks approximately £265, because most of the Liberal party's propaganda in that election was paid by that source to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that tbe subject of this debate is the financial statement presented by tbe Treasurer, and tbe amendment submitted by tbe bonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). coming to tbem. to warn other bonorable members not to digress. It is time tbe bonorable gentleman addressed himself to tbe subject before tbe Chair. speaking to tbe financial statement, and the amendment submitted by tbe honourable member for Melbourne. tleman sbould discuss tbe amendment. well! Tbe amendment directs attention to tbe economic condition of Australia. Had the Government implemented its pre-election promises to the people in 1949, tbe economic position of the nation would be entirely different from tbe present situation. Had the Government been true to its pre-election pledges, the plight of Australia would be as forecast in tbo advertisement in the Australian Woman's Weekly. The first question that was asked in that advertisement wasWill you be able to reduce the cost of living? That question was pertinent to the economic position of tbe country, and tbe promise of tbe Liberal party was as follows:We regard that as one of our first responsibilities-to increase the purchasing value of the Australian pound; to increase production and tlms bring prices down. Eeferring to the amendment, as I notice that you, Mr Speaker, are doing, I find the purchasing value of the £1.

I do not feel disposed to suffer tbose consequences at this stage, and shall develop nry argument by answering some of the submissions that bave been advanced on behalf of the Government. Tbe Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), whose speech was delivered without interruption of any kind, directed attention to tbe fact that the Victorian branch of tbe Australian Labour party carried a resolution last June advocating tbe re-introduction of prices control by tbe Commonwealth. If I may reply to tbe arguments that the Postmaster-General considered to be germane to tbe amendment, I point out that one of the main reasons why this Government has failed to improve tbe economic position of tbe country is that it bas not supported a proper system of prices control. Had the Liberal party supported, the referendum conducted by the Chifley Labour Government in 1948 with a view to giving to tbe Commonwealth proper and effective control of prices, the people would not now be experiencing the disastrous effects of tbe present Government's financial policy, and tbe value of a £100 Commonwealtb bond would not be less than £90, as it is at tbe present time. We would have seen a. form of stability that disappeared immediately tbe Liberal party succeeded in persuading the people to reject the Labour Government's proposal for Commonwealth prices control. The Postmaster-General ridiculed the Labour party in Victoria for having included in its eight-point programme the retention of capital issues control.

It was the lifting of capital issues control by this Government that led to tbe over capitalizing of certain industries in the metropolitan areas and tbe consequent denudation of rural lands of labour essential for the production of foodstuffs. Unless something is done to increase food production, by the end of 1960 we shall be either importing food or starving. One of tbe most important answers to the Treasurer's statement is that, instead of placing a blanket embargo on imports, some of which are badly needed in this country, the Government would bave been better advised to do something effective to increase exports. markets overseas only for our primary products; but primary production will not be increased as long as this Government adheres to its present policy. It bas done nothing to break up large estates, most of wbicb to-day are not producing to anything like their fullcapacity. Tbe lag in primary production is not the fault of the small farmers. I know well that you, Mr Speaker, go home from this Parliament wben its meetings end and work day and night on your property in an endeavour to increase production. Tbe fault therefore cloes not lie with you or witb other small farmers, but witb the owners of large holdings who do not work tbem to their full capacity. Instead of assisting the small land-holder, this Government is doing everything possible to help tbo big man who is keeping land ont of production. He is being given rebates of land tax whereas, in my opinion, tbe Government, should be increasing land taxes. Thousands of land hungry ex-servicemen who are prepared to enter primary production and wish to be tbeir own bosses are unable to obtain properties because of tbe attitude of land monopolists. If tbe Government really wants to increase primary production, it should not concern itself with the interests of property owners whose incomes are £30,000 or £40,000 a year. If tax rebates are to be made, let them be made to tbe men who actually work those large properties. I realize that tbe Minister for Defence am sure be will agree that encouragement is needed most by tbe men wbo work for bim. Until tbe Government recognizes that the remedy for our present economic ills lies not in tbe restriction of imports, but in tbe expansion of exports, we shall continue to sink deeper and deeper into the mire. I shall now make anotber attempt to quote from the Liberal party's advertisement to wbich I bave already referred, and I am sure you will let me proceed on this occasion, Mr Speaker. The advertisement wa3 published on tbe 3rd November. 1949. It purports to show the questions that were being asked of tbe Liberal party in that election campaign. One question wasWill you make further reductions in We have assured, taxation ? The answer given in the advertisement is as follows:Yes, the rates of tax will be steadily reduced, including the indirect taxes affecting the cost of living,' housing and home fittings and furniture. There will be tax allowances for education costs. What has the Government done towards fulfilling that promise? I remind honourable members that it was largely upon tbe undertaking to reduce taxes that the Government was elected in 1949. Far from indirect taxes being reduced, tbose impositions wbicb include, of course, sales tax and customs duties have been substantially increased. In fact, receipts from the sales tax have increased by approximately £100,000,000 a yoar. How can the electors have any confidence in a party that makes such rash promises and does absolutely nothing to carry tbem out? Is it not about time that this Parliament carried out a motion of want of confidence and so forced the Government to face the electors? I am sure that you, Mr8 pen ker, would bave little difficulty in retaining your seat at an early election, but many honourable members opposite ?ould no longer be in tbe Parliament. 1 f the Gawier by-election in Soutb Australia is any indication of what is in the minds of tbe electorsMr Playford says that it is and that the people of Gawier voted not against bim but against tbe Menzies and Fadden Administration -tbi s Government will go out neck and crop at tbe next election. able member's time bas expired.",37,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

96,Mr Speaker,"Order! Tbe honorhave been pleased to hear some Government supporters refer to the Labour party's policy. I disagree witb tbose of my colleagues wbo say that Labour bas no policy. It is true that Labour supporters do not like talking about their policy in this Parliament or elsewhere, but every one knows that Labour's objective is the socialization of industry, prohe blamed for the damage it does. duction, distribution and exchange. like to know whether the remarks of tbe bonorable member for Mallee have any relationship to the -financial statement made by the Treasurer or by the amendment moved by tbe bonorable member for Melbourne. If no such relationship exists, I ask you, Mr Speaker, to rule tbe bonorable member's remarks out of order. member for Mallee must come very soon to the subject-matter before the Chair. In tbe course of this debate several references have been made by honourable members on both sides of the House to the policies of tbe various parties. Tbose policies are not tbe subject-matter of tbe motion or of tbe amendment, and it would be well for all honourable members to confine their attention to one or the other. As an old, experienced debater, I have no hesitation in saying that, in those matters, tbere is ample scope for any speaker. appreciate that opinion. I was only making a passing reference which, I felt sure, administration wben, perhaps, tbeir potenwould draw interjections or points of order. able member should not be seeking interjections. that this Government was elected on a policy of banning communism, fighting inflation and reducing taxes. I heartily agree with that. We should examine those three points. First, let us consider the proposal to ban communism. ject of. communism was not dealt with in the Treasurer's financial statement. sider tbe plan to fight inflation. Inflation does not develop by degrees. It spreads like wildfire, and its general characteristics are very much like'tbose of a bush fire. Like a fire, it can be fought most effectively at tbe source. When a bush fire breaks out, the people wbo fight it as it spreads are not to Tbe fault is witb tbose who allowed it to start. Similarly, the blame for inflation must be placed upon those wbo allowed it to start. I realize that perhaps, the greatest factor that contributed to inflation was tbe vast expenditure of money during World War II . and that the situation was aggravated by the lack of production of civil goods during the war. We bad plenty of money in the community but there were very few goods to be purchased witb that money. 1 return to my analogy. As a bush fire sweeps across tbe land, tbe flames are fed by undergrowth and dead wood. The Labour party during its eight years of office allowed undergrowth and dead wood to accumulate in tbe economic field. This Government had to sweep away the debris before it could proceed witb the rest of its programme to check inflation. Yet already it bas reduced its dangerous progress. Wben the Labour Government was defeated, inflation was cantering and on tbe verge of breaking into a gallop. Tbe forces that have spurred it since that date, notwithstanding tbe efforts of this Government, were released during tbe years of Labour tial power was not apparent. Unfortunately, those forces were given momentum as a result of tbe political folly of the Labour party. We bave evidence that this Government bas succeeded in restraining the pace of inflation. For example, members of the Opposition expected that the recent basic wage rise would amount to 10s. or 15s. a week. In fact, tbe rise was as low as 3s. a week in one State. Whenever the basic wage rises tbere is a tremendous outcry from tbe Labour party and the trade unions. Wbat will happen when this Government baits the spiral and the cost of living begins to fall and brings tbe basic wage down with it in steps of",38,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

The Opposition has also attacked the Government's taxation policy. There can be not the slightest doubt that the Government's programme provides for the -eventual reduction of taxation. Does any honourable member who supports a football team expect that team to win each match in the first half of the game. Of course, not! The Government is paving the way for tax reductions. Nothing would give it greater pleasure than to be able to reduce taxation immediately if that were possible. It is a well-known fact ment's defence programme sbould go bome that Labour can sometimes legislate with apparent good results, but its record proves beyond doubt that it cannot successfully legislate on a permanent basis. Its acts are mere expedients. explanation of that weakness ds that socialism breaks down the economic structure of the country. Thus, the Labour party, after it has held office briefly, is invariably compelled to hand the country back to the parties that are represented on this side of the chamber to be resuscitated like a half-drowned swimmer. This Government is now using every means at its disposal in order to restore vigour to our economy and, as soon as it has done so, it will reduce taxamarine fleet is merely an adjunct to the tion. I have frequently spoken to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) about the possibility of reducing taxation because I believe that tax reductions will help to increase production. The Treasurer has always asked me to point out any means by which expenditure can be reduced in order to make a tax reduction possible. He has asked me, for instance, ""Do you believe that defence expenditure should be curtailed ?"", and I have been obliged to answer in the negative. I have often heard the honourable memher for East Sydney( Mr Ward), a spokesman of the Labour party, express the opinion that expenditure on defence represents a great loss. All members of the Opposition may not subscribe to that view, but, as they have not said so, we must assume that they agree with the honourable member. ffi] ber for East Sydney has not made any sucb statement. numerous occasions. He has protested time after time against tbe amount that tbe Government bas set aside for expenditure on defence. sucb a large amount? bear that interjection from the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). Defence expenditure is our best insurance for freedom. Any honourable member wbo objects to tbe Governand cancel all insurance policies on bis life, his bouse, bis motor car and any other possessions that he may bave insured. Australia, as a nation that loves The freedom, cannot afford to do that. Tbe lionorable membei' for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) complained that we were not building enough ships in Australia. He said that Russia bad more submarines to-day than Germany bad in commission -before. World War IL , and that, if war broke out, Russia could destroy our merchant navy. Tbe honourable member sbould be able to make a fairly good estimate of Russia's armed strength because be must be aware that its subrest of its forces. Another speaker who followed on the Opposition side of the House said that tbe Government sbould reduce its expenditure on defence. I am tired of bearing the bonorable member for Fremantle and the bonorable member for East Sydney talking about criminal negligence and dishonesty. Practical men become suspicious of those wbo continually utter sucb wild cbarges as tbey bave made. tbe next speaker on this side of the House after the honourable member for Fremantle had spoken and I did not mention the subject of defence. is not apparent to ine.

Members of the Opposition, wbo have spoken so often of dishonesty and criminal negligence, are not prepared to support the United Nations forces in Korea by appearing on public platforms to help tbe recruiting campaign. But tbey are quite happy to participate in peaceful negotiations, when tbey are in progress, as champions of tbe United Nations. A report in to-day's Melbourne Age of the speech that was delivered by tbe honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr but Labour speakers have tried to make Calwell) yesterday contains tbe following passage:A grazier who had to pay £14,500 in tax on quired to pay £5,800 income tax on an an inoome of £1.4,000 was mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr tion at all. That amount of tax is paid C'alweil). That is absolutely impossible. The income tax payable on an income of £14,600 is £9.0-71 13s. 4d. The problem that is harassing primary producers to-day is tbe payment of provisional tax. Some relief has been given, but a permanent solution is necessary. I believe it will be found. The provisional taxation system was introduced by tbe Labour party in 1944. Let me explain tbe manner in which it operates. If , in 1949-50, a man bad a taxable income of £2,000, bis provisional tax for 1950-51 was assessed on the basis of that income. If , in 1950-51, his taxable income due to rises in wool prices deduction legislation was misrepresented was £6,000, be was required to pay only was responsible for the return to £468 7s. provisionally notwithstanding this Parliament of the honourable that tbe tax payable upon an income of member for Hume( Mr Fuller). £6,000 was £2,755, or £2,286 13s. more The honourable gentleman, in his than be was called upon to pay. If , in speech in this debate, did not refer to 1951-52, due to wool values falling, the deposits in the savings banks, although man bas an income of £3,000, bis prosome years ago, whenever he made a visional tax for that year will be based speech in this House, be directed attenupon the income of £6,000 that be derived tion to tbose deposits and suggested that during the previous year. He will be tbey were tbe yardstick witb whicb to required to pay £3,030 10s, plus £2,286 measure tbe financial stability of the 13s. in respect of tbe previous year, makcountry. Every honourable member knows ing a total of £5,317 3s. The tax that that deposits in tbe savings bank have he really owes will be £2,286 13s. in increased. During tbe last general elecrespect of the previous year and tbe protion, tbe Labour party endeavoured to visional tax of £1,021 4s. upon bis income give the impression that the money for 195.1-52, making a total of £3,307 17s. If that sum be deducted from the £5,317 collected from the wool-growers under 3s. that be will be required to pay, the remainder is £2,009 6s. Therefore, if be bas an income of £3,000, in 1952-53 he will, after paying bis tax for that year, receive a refund of £98S 2s. These figures do not take into account the effect of the averaging system. Wben assessments bave been adjusted aud wben refunds of tax are being made, tbe position will be very different from now. If this Government introduces the Canadian, system of self-assessment, anomalies to wbich the provisional taxation system gives rise will be rectified. As I have said, the provisional taxation system was imposed upon tbe people of this country by tbe Australian Labour party, political capital out of tbe present situation. Tbey have said that men are reincome of £6,000. That is not the posiin respect of an amount of £12,000. Tbe anomalies to which the system gives rise are now appearing for tbe first time, owing to the high prices that were received for wool last year, hut the Labour party is trying to add fuel to the fire by misrepresenting tbe position. I prophesy that next year we shall hear no more protests about taxation than we bave heard this year about tbe wool sales deduction legislation except, of course, the contention that taxation must be reduced as soon as tbe economy permits. The manner in wbich the wool sales the wool sales deduction scheme would",40,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

That establishes beyond doubt that tbe ideas that were then expressed by Labour speakers, both inside and outside the Parliament, were misleading in tbe highest degree. But for the misrepresentation of the wool sales deduction scbeme, there would have been fewer Labour members on the benches opposite at tbe present time. Whentaxation anomalies are rectified, when the Government reduces taxation and wben truth gets a bearing, tbe misleading statements of the Opposition will be shown in their true light and the policy of tbe parties wbich stand for the freedom, protection and financial stability bard financial road that tbe people of of this country will be justified. listened to the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), my thoughts went back to an occasion not very long ago in this Parliament when the honourable gentleman was making a speech somewhat similar to that which be delivered a few moments ago, and when, in the course of it, one of tbe members of tbe Government parties moved, "" Tbat the question be now put"". Tbe honourable member for Mallee apparently thought so little of his comments that he voted for tbe gagging of tbe speech that he was in the course of making. The substance of the comments that the honourable gentleman made to-day is very much in keeping witb the substance of those that he made on the occasion to which I have just referred. He supports blindly policies that he does not understand. In the course of this debate, I could not help thinking bow tbe views, policies, pronouncements and speeches of honourable members opposite, from the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) down to the back benchers, had changed in recent times. I thought, for instance, of the numerous promises that were made by the Government upon all aspects of economic and financial policy, controls, production and a dozen and one other things. I recalled the great number of pledges that tbe members of tbe Government parties made to tbe people. TbenI compared the changed policies of this Government with tbe changed attitude of the Treasurer. Gone is that happy smiling fellow, the automatic adding machine of Ibis Parliament, who spoke of Chifley Government surpluses and of how tbe Labour governments of those days should abolish controls, reduce taxation and give to tbe people of this country an incentive to produce by permitting them to retain more of the money that they earned. The picture now is very different. The right honourable gentleman comes into this chamber, having thrown overboard the cheery and optimistic approach to the future that he adopted when in opposition, and paints a gloomy picture of tbe Australia must travel. His supporters claim that tbe policy that the Government is now enunciating is tbe same as that wbicb was followed by tbe Chifley Government and other Labour governments in times gone by. But bonorable gentlemen opposite significantly omit to mention that they went on to the hustings throughout the length and breadth of this country and condemned every part of tbe policy of the Chifley Government as being socialistic ancl designed to undermine the freedom of Australia. for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), wbo says ""Hear, hear!"", now stands for controls, totalitarian methods and tbe implementation of a banking policy, in comparison with whicb the Chifley Government's action appears to be insignificant. The point that I wish to make is that tbe economic policy enunciated by this Government was not the economic policy of the Chifley Government. That Government stood for full employment, but honourable gentlemen opposite who support this Government stand for a pool of unemployed. Unmistakably and without apology tbey make this policy known to the people at large. The Chifley financial policy, which brougbt economic stability to this nation, incorporating as it did capital issues control, certain essential controls on banking, and other",41,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

116,Mr Daly,"The bonorable memhermeasures, was undermined by honourable members opposite when tbey persuaded the people in 1948 to defeat the prices referendum. Since the defeat of that referendum, for wbich honorablo members opposite are responsible, prices bave skyrocketed. That defeat was. the first chink in the armour of the Chifley policy, because with tbe destruction of prices control oii a federal basis the policy, which had been of such benefit to this nation in maintaining economic stability, Was Undermined owing to the fact that it could not successfully be implemented without this power. As proof of iny contention let ine remind honourable members that at that time the basic wage was £0 2s. a week. We have seen it spiral since then Until to-day it is over £ l l a Week, almost double that figure. And now the Government comes before the people witb a dilapidated and makeshift policy which shows that it does not know where it is going. Its policy cannot be compared witb that of the Chifley Government. Labour policy as' implemented by the Chifley Government, was the real basic reason why our prestige at home and abroad was at such a high standard in recent years. The Government to-day is asking people to subsoribe to government bonds, yet such bonds are being written down on the market to as low as £91 for a £100 bond. The Government is, in fact, asking people to subscribe £100 for something that is now worth only £91 or less because of the lack of confidence that tbe people have in the present Administration. After two and a half years of this Government's rule, we have the inglorious spectacle of the Prime Minister( Mr issues control, and other controls Menzies) and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) going cap in hand to the smaller nations of the world asking, like beggars, for financial assistance for this country'in Is he not the man wbo in bis first, which money should not be an obstacle to development. That state of affairs bas existed for a limited time. What is the Government's excuse for its existence? When the Government was first elected to office two and a half years ago its members blamed the Senate, for frustrating its plans to implereally essential industries in my elecment a policy which, it was claimed, would be beneficial to the nation. Tbe people succumbed to the Government's Mr Daly. false arguments and tbe Labour party lost control of tbe Senate. Wbat was the Government's next excuse? According to it, the Communists were destroying the Liberal policy for producing economic security and bringing prices down. Evidently the Communists bave disappeared, because the Treasurer did not mention them in his financial statement. Having been left to your own resources you are revealed starkly and unashamedlyable gentleman will address me. vernment are revealed as being without a policy, without plans, and with no prospect of assuring economic stability in Australia. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are trying to pass on to the States the responsibility for our economic difficulties, but the people of Australia will not long continue to be misled in that direction. If any indication of tbe opinion that the people have of the Government is required by the small number of honourable members wbo represent tlie remnants of the Australian Country party, then tbey should take note that in a blue-ribbon electorate, the bonorable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), who made bis maiden speech last nigbt, was lucky to be elected. His failure to secure a larger majority was due to the fact that the people in that constituency know that this Government is snatching at straws, is panic-stricken, and is without any stable policy for either the country or the city. I was amazed last night to hear Government supporters sponsoring capital in the interests of tbe economy. Is not the Treasurer the man wbo abolished capital issues control when be took office? eighteen montbs of office allowed all kinds of industries in Australia to start operations with capital that. sbould not have been expended for such purposes?

121,Mr Turnbull,"I rise to make a peramendment that is under discussion refers to the causing of "" unnecessary hardship "" and "" avoidable suffering"". I should have thought that honourable members of the Opposition who supported the amendment would endeavour to prove that, if hardship had been caused, it was unnecessary, and that if suffering, would be the Leader of the Opposition had resulted it was avoidable. During the debate it has frequently been suggested by honourable members on this side of the House that the Opposition has failed to suggest any alternative to the Government's policy. WhilstI do not desire to labour that point, having very carefully considered the words of the amendment, I think that the honourable inember wbo moved it, and those wbo liave supported it, should have suggested some alternative to the Government's policy. It was not until the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) bad nearly finished bis speecb that I realized what was in tbe minds of Opposition members. He stated that tbe alternative was to reject the present Government, and return a Labour government. One may infer from that statement, that hardship and suffering will be avoidable if the Labour government is returned in the place of tbe present Government. If we accept that view we are entitled and indeed compelled, to consider tbe qualities, capacity and intention of the prospective leaders. Since tbere has not been any suggestion by tbe Opposition of a definite economic plan or policy, we must accept what we know of their past actions and beliefs when considering tbe probable policy of a possible future Labour government under tbe leadership of those wbo now lead the Opposition. certain future government. honourable member who interjected is repeating the words of the bonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), wbo has been wrong in his predictions so frequently in past years, that his accuracy as a prophet is not held iu high esteem in this country. It is not for me to discuss tbe capacity of the present Cabinet, because I think that tbe actions of that Cabinet speak for themselves, and indeed, the members of the Government are capable of speaking for themselves. I shall draw the attention of the House to the present leaders of tbe Opposition, and I shall try to show what they would do in tbe event of tbe Australian Labour party forming another government. It is admitted that the Prime Minister under those regrettable circumstances (Dr. Evatt), and a number of people in this country would accept that position, some witb pleasure. The next position of importance would be that of Teasurer. It has been suggested that tbe bonorable member foi' Melbourne would bold that position. I do not agree witb that suggestion, because a certain trend in events within the Australian Labour party during recent months can be traced. First, former Premier of New Soutb Wales, to a position in the Public Service of New South Wales. Mr Ferguson was appointed Mr 0LYSIS CAMERON I rise to a point of order. The bonorable member is now attempting to choose the next Labour cabinet. Surely that bas nothing to do with the motion and amendment before the House. made the attempt to do that, but like tbe weather prophets and economists, they have generally been wrong. I think that tbe honourable member's remarks sbould be directed more closely to the subject under discussion. honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) confined bis remarks to a description of certain activities outside this House. However, I shall not labour the point. It is sufficient to say that Mr Ferguson has followed Mr McGirr into an appointment within tbe Public Service of New Soutb Wales. All this indicates a strong movement in tbe Australian Labour party from the right to the left. Therefore, I suggest that it is unlikely, in tbe event of Labour forming a government, that tbe bonorable member for Melbourne would be Treasurer. It is rather more likely that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) would be given that important position. There are few people in the",45,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

To that end I quote with respect various comments that were made hy prominent -members *£ the Opposition during the last budget debate.

There is a .difference -of about £250,000,000 between the estimates * f the Leader of tbe Opposition and of the honourable member for Melbourne. Tbe honourable member for Peirth (Ma-.

139,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [4.9],"I fto endeavour to rectify the economic anomalies which to-day affect severely -most Australians. Agreeable though the pursuit may be, honourable members do not want to be diverted by a discussion of who may or may not be the members of the Labour cabinet which is sure to function after the next general election. The members of the Opposition wish to hear, if possible, some justification of the -actions of the Government. To the present, no cogent justification of the work of the Government has been forthcoming. On tbe contrary, we bave listened to a scries of platitudes and confused thoughts wbicb, far from shedding light upon tbe position, bave merely obscured it. To elaborate that statement, let me refer to a statement made by tbe Minister for the of the debate last evening. The honourable gentleman asked who, other than Opposition members, is complaining about the Government's action. He stated that representatives of manufacturers throughout Australia have lauded the Government's economic policy from the housetops, bave described it as an act of genius, .and have said that if. is inspired. Those words were used by an allegedly responsible Minister of tbe Government. My only thought concerning that contribution to tbe debate is that no doubt manufacturers bave lauded from tbe housetops tbe economic policy of tbe Government because tbe waters of financial ruin bave lapped so high on tbe foundations of our economy that tbe housetops are tbe last refuge. Tbe honourable gentleman knows, as we know, that every chamber of commerce and every chamber of manufactures bas, at one time or another, recorded a strong and emphatic protest against the lopsided, uneven and even ridiculous economic policy that this Government is pleased to call one of genius. I wish to refer to a statement which was made recently by tbe ford, wbo, as bonorable members know, is not a member of the Australian Labour party. Mr ""WHEEX.BR -We have heard all of this before. member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) may have heard about it before, but I point out to bim that repetition is sometimes neeessary for the benefit of a stunted intellect. Mr Playford statedI. believe the present interpretation oi' the Luan Council's functions will not stand legal examination, and f intend to explore this avenue. If the present interpretation is correct we have ceased to be a federation. He went on to say that the defiance displayed by the State Premiers indicated that probably an all-time low in Commonwealth and State financial relationships bad been reached. This Government contends that its economic programme bas had certain beneficial results. I contend, as do other members of the Opposition, that if its economic policy is proving beneficial in the light of its pre-election promises, the signs sbould be fourfold in character. Its policy should have resulted in increased purchasing power of the £1. Taxation, both direct and indirect, sbould bave been reduced. It sbould have restored the confidence that tbe Labour Government has been alleged to have destroyed. Have any of tbose results been achieved by this Government'3 economic policy? Has value been restored to tbe £1 ? The barometer to measure tbe value of tbe currency is the extent to whicb it can be applied to the basic wage. As tbe honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has said, tbere has been a constant increase of tbe basic wage during the life of this Government because of the inflationary spiral, whicb tbe Government has proved incapable of controlling. In 1944, the basic wage was £4 17s.; in 1945 it was £6 5s.; in 1949, £7 13s., and to-day it is £11 17s. While the workers of Australia are concerned vitally witb their hopeless chase after prices, inflation bas had an equally deleterious effect on tbose wbo receive fixed incomes, including pensioners and others who have no ardent advocates in this Parliament except honourable members of the Opposition. The Government promised to reduce taxation. What has happened? During. tbe regime of the Labour Government the average annual value of sales tax collections was £20,000,000. Tbat was £3 a head of population. This Government, whicb was pledged to reduce taxation, is tbe benevolent recipient of",48,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

That is how it has kept its promise to the people of Australia who were gulled in 1949 and again in 1951. In the field of taxation in one year alone, this Government has received increased revenue to the tune of £472,000,000. Backbenchers on tbe Government side must have a sense of shame when tbey raise their voices on behalf of a government which has failed so miserably to carry out tbose two promises in its election programme. Wben the Government parties sought the votes of the people in 1949 and 1951, they claimed that tbere was a lack of confidence in the Chifley and Curtin Labour administrations. Tbat alleged lack of confidence was never expressed in tbe failure of the people to subscribe ftftly to the war and peace time loans that were floated by any of the Labour administrations. Tbis Government, which was going to restore confidence in Australia's future, has been confronted with the gloomy spectacle of failure to get its last three security loans fully subscribed. If that is not a barometer showing lack of public confidence, I invite any member on the Government side to produce a better indicator. Apart from that failure to fill tbe last three loans that bave been floated by this Government, the people who invested their spare capital in war and peace time loans have seen the value of tbeir assets diminish considerably because of this Government's incompetence. Only yesterday, the Melbourne Herald reported in its stock exchange news under the beading "" Bond prices down ""Ten movements were recorded on the exchange to-day in Commonwealth bonds. Nine were falls and one was a rise. That is how this Government has justified the confidence of tbe people! Tbe Government knows that when tbe people get an opportunity to make tbeir feelings known in a practical way, a government of a different political colour will occupy the treasury bench. By-elections in both the Federal and State arenas bave shown that to be so. That bas nothing to do with the subject before the Chair. throughout this debate, but I shall not continue in that vein. The honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) referred to unemployment in. tbe textile industry. He is qualified to speak with authority on the subject because there are more textile mills in bis electorate than there are in the electorate of any other member. He is in a position to know that tbere is a depression in tbe textile and clothing industries of Victoria and New Soutb Wales. Tbe unions that are associated witb tbose industries bave 7,000 men registered as unemployed. Tbey include skilled workers wbo bave devoted a life-time to those industries. somewhere else. Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said that an indication of the unemployment position could be gained from the numbers of tbose wbo are registered with the Department of Labour and National Service. In statements which the Minister issued recently to the press, tbe phrases that he used includedThe number now receiving unemployment benefits has increased. Further lay-offs of workers occurred during March. Sackings in the clothing and textile industry were mostly in New South Wales and Victoria. Seasonal unemployment in Queensland had swollen by 3,653. Manufacturing firms cut employment in March by not replacing staff wastages. The extent of tbe present slump in employment may be gathered from the fact that whereas, when tbe Labour Government went out of office, tbere were 257,000 vacant positions in Australia, to-day the number has been reduced to 82,000. Honourable members might ask whether tbose who have lost tbeir employment in the textile trades cannot fill tbose vacancies. As bas been pointed out by other honourable members in tbe course of this debate, many of tbose vacancies call not for unskilled labour but for men witb special skill, and there are few men available in Australia wbo possess tbe requisite skill to fill tbem.

148,Mr Cremean,"If the Minister .canTreasurer take their places at the table After preliminary business has been disposed of Mr Speaker announces the receipt of messages from the Governor General transmitting estimates of revenue and expenditure for the ensuing nnancial .year and recommending appropriations accordingly. The Estimates are ordered by the House to be printed and are referred to the Committee of Supply forthwith. In the Committee of Supply the Treasurer then delivers his budget speech. Not until he has done so are the Government's budgetary proposals made known. Despite that fact an impression has been deliberately fostered by members of tbe Opposition that Government supporters are given an opportunity to discuss tbe Government's budgetary proposals in advance of its introduction into the Parliament and to indicate what should be included in or excluded from the budget We know perfectly well that no private member has knowledge in advance of the contents of any budget that airy government may present. If that were not so, procedure in relation to the budget would lend itself to .excesses, abuses and .corruptions of a kind that could easily destroy our democracy. budget expresses not merely the views of one man; it presents tbe policy .of tbe Government as a whole. The budget expresses the intentions of the Government in relation to the nation's financial and .economic situation. It is competent for any supporter of tbe Government in this House to oppose tbe budget either wholly or in part or to criticize it in any respect. This Government bad a twofold task, namely, to prepare and repair our defences ih a way consistent with what is being done in every other free and reputable country and, at tbe same time, to stem tbe rising tide of inflation. Therefore, only criticism that Delates to defence expenditure or the Government's attempt to cheek inflation is relevant to this debate. that expenditure that has been allocated However, members of tbe Opposition have ignored that fact. No bonorable member has suggested that our defence expenditure, whicb is estimated to amount to £181,200,00,0, is too high a price to pay for .the privilege of living in this rich, blessed country which is so dearly loved by all truly democratic Australians. No honourable member bas contended with any degree of sincerity that the Government sbould repudiate tbe sacred obligations that were entered into by its predecessors in respect of war services and repatriation. Expenditure on such commitments will cost £107,-100,000 this year. No bonorable member has said that the Government sbould reduce its payments into the National Welfare Fund wbicb is used to finance social services benefits of all kinds. Our expenditure under that beading now amounts to £184,800,000 and constitutes the largest single item of expenditure in the budget. I could conceive of an honourable member, after he had carefully examined the Government's financial and economic position, arriving a.t tbe conclusion that that expenditure imposes an intolerable burden upon the community. But no honourable member bas voiced that opinion. The next largest item of expenditure in the budget is ;in amount of £166,200,000. wbicb represents tax reimbursements to the States under the uniform tax system. Last year, that item amounted to The £128,000,000. However, tbe Government has recognized that this year tbe States ar,e shouldering greater .responsibilities than previously, and it bas of its own volition increased that amount, which incidentally was ,a record, to £161,200,000. Yet it is said on .every band, both in tbe Parliament and ..outside, that tbe Government has reduced its payments to the States. Tbe figures that I have given cannot be disputed. Would any honourable member contend that payment,, of tax reimbursements to tbe States should be reduced? However, an honourable member wbo considered that be was justified in urging that such, a reduction should be made would a.t least have presented legitimate .criticism of the Government in r,espect of its financial policy. No honourable member has said for publie works .should be substantially reduced .or that current expenditure on works of isucb national importance and magnitude as the 'Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scbeme should be reduced. The Government is providing a total sum of £101,700,00.0 for capital works. TJnder the heading of subsidies, it is providing tbe sum of £32,900,000, whilst expenditure under other headings totals £S4,800,000. Tbese items involve ihe Government in a total expenditure df £927,000,000, which is a gigantic commitment for a country with our small population. 1 deplore the machinations in recent years of the majority of representatives on the Loan Council. After the council was established in 1924 it operated to serve the parliaments and tbe people of this country until two years ago wben less scrupulous representatives of tbe States saw an opportunity to use tbe council as a medium of heaping blame and odium upon the Australian Government. Previously, sucb a temptation had been resisted. Therefore, it is significant that since the present assumed ofiice the majority of members of the Loan Council have used it as a vehicle to attack tbe Commonwealtb. Last year, while the was in the process of preparing its budget £1,041,000,000. Tbis Government came for tbe next financial year, tbe Loan Council met and the States' representatives made a demand for no less a sum than £300,000,000 of loan money for their public works programmes. The States made that demand upon themselves because the council is composed of representatives of the six States each of wbich has one vote, and representatives of tbe Commonwealtb which bas two votes and a casting vote. Tbe representatives of the Commonwealtb on tbe council knew that in existing circumstances it would be impossible to raise that amount on the loan market. Tbey realized that if that amount had to be provided, the Commonwealth would have to resort to central bank credit as every government must do in order to meet a grave national emergencv such as war. But this Government said clearly that the use of central reserve bank credit in a time of peace constitutes inflation, naked and unashamed, and for that reason it refused to resort to that method of raising finance in order to meet tbe demands of the States. The Premiers did not suggest at that time, or, indeed, at any other time, that this Government should use central reserve bank credit. Mr Roberton. could see tbe absurdity of tbe fabulous nature of their demands, and reduced tbeir original programme from £300,000,000 to £225,000,000. Every person wbo bas even an elementary knowledge of tbe potentialities and capacity of the Australian loan market knows that it is impossible for it to yield £225,000,000 in any one year. At that point, this Government suffered for its own honesty, integrity ancl innocence by coming to tbe assistance of tbe States in tbe way that it did. Tbe representatives of tbe Commonwealtb said to tbe Premiers, in effect, ""Since tbe loan market cannot yield £225,000,000, we shall take the unprecedented action of underwriting loans for the States, surrender our own claim to loan money; we shall finance our public works and defence expenditure out of revenue; and Government we will make adequate provision for the States by budgeting for a surplus of approximately £114,000,000 "". Wben that amount of £1.14,000,000 was added to the Government budget of £927,000,000 the total became to tbe assistance of tbe States with tbe full knowledge that, by so doing, it would incur odium, and that the budget surplus would be unpopular. Yet it made those arrangements in order to serve the purposes of the States. Some persons criticized tbe budget without understanding the true purpose of. it even in tbe first place or the last place. AlthoughI bare described it as a tough budget, it is wrong to suppose that income tax rates have been increased in any appreciable way. Yet sucb a suggestion bas been made by Opposition speakers. Indeed, it is a delusion, particularly of those engaged in primary industries, that income tax rates have risen to fantastic levels. The rates are described as vicious and vindictive by the uninformed. It requires only a cursory examination of income tax rates, measured against tbe rates that bave applied in tbe past, to demonstrate that this Government, faithful to its pre-election promises to tbe people, reduced income tax rates last year to the lowest level for eleven years.

The Treasurer has pleaded guilty to the destruction of the Australian economy. This Government has done more damage in twelve months than any other administration has caused in the long history of federation. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton), not unlike most Government supporters, including the federal president of the Liberal party, officers of the federated chambers of commerce and chambers of manufactures, graziers' associations and other bodies which, in the ordinary course, support, the Government, has disowned tbe Treasurer. He does not accept any responsibility for the tough budget. He bas said that the budget is tough, and bas disowned tbe man Avho introduced it. He considers that the budget is the private responsibility of the Treasurer and is not the responsibility of the Government.

Tbey want the odium to be borne by the Treasurer, who has failed this country so badly. But sucb an attitude is wrong. Members of the Government, and their supporters stand jointly and severally guilty, because they have aided and abetted tbe Treasurer by their votes in this chamber for tbe adoption of the budget proposals. It is not the responsibility of the House or of the Government to accept a pig in a. poke, and it is to tbe credit of tbe Labour party that its members vigorously opposed the budget. We pointed out its .shortcomings, and warned tbe people of tbe repercussions. The honourable member for Riverina is eager to save bis political skin, but I am sure that' bis .apologia this afternoon will not save him from, the wrath of his electors. I recall an extraordinary and scandalous statement, which he made at a certain confer-ence in Sydney, when he saidAustralia, once described as one of the such a check. As I have said, the Goworld's most self-reliant and resourceful vernment bas no friends. Probably this -nations, is crawling around the world's markets begging for goods and services that we are lou darned lazy or too socially stupid to provide for ourselves. statement ? member for Riverina hopes to retain the support of a majority of his electors, although he has said that the Australian people "" are too darned lazy or too socially stupid "" to do anything for themselves and that Australia ""is crawling around the world's markets"". His outburst was prompted by the fact that the preceding Labour Government, whicb fought for thu interests of country people, declared that our primary products, wben they wero sold overseas, should be disposed of at world prices. If tbe farmer is to pay world parity for his machinery and various imported goods, it is proper that, his exports should be sold at world parity. Because the Labour Government adopted that, policy, the bonorable member declared that, Australia was crawling around the markets of the world. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) has described this Government as a two-phase government. A more appropriate description is a twofaced government. On tbe one hand, we have tbe government, that pours fortb its story from tbe hustings to country people in the hope of securing votes, and, on tbe other, we have tbe government which adopts an entirely different attitude in this chamber. Its nominal leader is the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), but the deciding voice in questions affecting our future prosperity is that of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). He stands at tbe bead of a group of narrow people who, if they ever did represent country interests, have long since deserted them for the sake of portfolios.

153,Mr Luchetti,"Tb e honorableHouse is the only place in Australia where it can obtain a vote of confidence. Certainly it cannot obtain such a vote, in the party rooms, or even in other select quarters to which an anti-Labour administration can usually look for support. According to to-day's press, the federal president of tbe Liberal party believes that semi-socialism has infiltrated into tbe Liberal party and he is very much concerned about it. The Chamber of Commerce, too, is concerned. We on this side of the chamber sbould like to know whether Government supporters are prepared to stand up to tlieir pledges to the people or whether they are prepared to admit, as the Treasurer himself bas ad-' mitted in bis doleful financial statement, tlie incapacity of the present Government to administer this country. The right lionorable gentleman saidDuring tlie latter months of last year, the <.!i>veniment brought down a series of important measures, culminating in the budget, to deal with the serious situation that had developed during 1D50-D1 -A number of major economic changes have occurred since then. It was quite unnecessary for tbe Treasurer to tell us that a number of economic changes have occurred. Tbe whole nation, to its sorrow, knows that that is true. One of tbe greatest tragedies in the present day economic situation is that of all tbe people wbo have lost confidence in the Govei'nment, members of the investing public stand out as a classical example. How can any government hope to proceed witb any policy unless it bas tbe support of the investing public? SinceI bave been a member of this chamber, tbe Government has floated three loans. One small loan succeeded, but twobig loans failed. Is it any wonder that tbe people of Australia will not lend their money to this Administration ? How can the State Premiers have any hope of obtaining even portion of tbe money that they require se urgently for essential developmental works so long as this Government pursues its present policy? Those works include water conservation and electricity production and reticulation. They are of national importance, yet apparently the Prime Minister and the Treasurer expected the Premiers humbly to accept tbe crumbs that were offered to them at 'the Loan Council meeting. protested, they were accused of disropMr Luchetti. tion and disloyalty, and have been subjected to criticism from tbe Government benches. I throw tbe gauntlet down to the Government. Have tbe days of federalism passed? Has our federation ceased to exist? To Government members and supporters wbo come from Western Ausfrom Soutb Australia, where Mr Playford bas been Premier for so long, is Premier, I say, ""Do you stand for federalism or do you stand for financial tyranny from Canberra? "" Honourable members opposite never failed during tbe rule of Labour governments to criticize Labour's alleged unification plans. We were frequently reminded of tbe sacred rights of the sovereign States. But now, wben tbe States wish to undertake works that will be of benefit not only to the States themselves, but also to Australia as a nation, the Premiers are accused of attempting to do something that is very wrong. My only criticism of the attitude of tbe Premiers is perhaps that tbey are rather unrealistic in expecting the public to invest large sums of money while this Government remains in office. What is the object of those wbo condemn the idea that tbe Commonwealth should bolster the loan market so that investors will be able to receive 20s. in tbe £1 in return for their investment? I have bad some experience of tbe plight of certain organizations that have invested money in war loans. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, for instance, invested £10,000 in government bonds. Members of that organization fought and bled for Australia. Upon their return to this country, they responded patriotically to war loan appeals. The leaguealso invested its funds. It was confident that the nation would not let it down. To-day it needs that money toestablish a club-room, but is unable to obtain the full sum simply because there is in office in the Commonwealth sphere a government which has so depressed theloan market and so lost the confidence of all sections of the people, that theBecause they public will not invest in loans.

If thc Government were courageous enough, it would say straight out, "" This money was invested for a special purpose. We shall see that these ex-servicemen receive 20s. in the £ 1 "" . Just imagine Australia letting those boys down! That is what this Government has done. I know of a ehureh body that invested money from an orga n fund and I know of various sporting bodies, social clubs and business organizations that are suffering in a similar way. The Government should revise its policy on this issue, if on no other, and be fair to tbe investors. But it has a warped idea of finance and is not likely to take the honest course of action. Unfortunately, unless money can be attracted to government loans, we have very little chance of developing the country. Water conservation, irrigation and other public works are vital to Australia. If a war occurred to-morrow, national credit would be required in order that such works could be undertaken immediately. Tbe nation would have to bestir itself. Tbis Government, which boasts that it is doing a mighty job for Australia, is, in fact, leaving us weak and unprepared. It is doing nothing to develop water conservation and irrigation projects. Roads in our country areas are in a bad state of repair and new roads are needed, but the Government is doing nothing about that situation. Houses should be built in rural districts, but the Government is neglecting that need also. The Northern Territory has vast resources of untapped wealth. Uranium is there for anybody who cares to go and take it. What is to stop anybody from doing so? The Gorci-nment has no policv in relation, to that wealth, and while it, continues along the road of nnancial folly sueh rich prizes will he dangled temptingly before the eyes of world adventurers. I ask the House to compare the actions of this Government with those of tbe former Labour Government. Under Labour's resrirne during World War II . , no less than £2,000,000.000 was raised in loans because the people bad confidence in their government. They will not regain that lost confidence until tbey are given tbe opportunity to record tbeir votes at another general election. When tbey are given that opportunity tbey will throw this Government out of ofiice. We invite the Government to provide that opportunity and to do so speedily. It bas failed tbe people dismally and I suggest that it seek the advice of tbe Governor General and resign so that tbe people may elect a stable government which will restore confidence and a high level of prosperity, such as was maintained by the Labour Administration throughout tbe years of World War II . In addition to tbe £2,000,000,000 that was raised in loans during Labour's term of office, an amount of £114,000,000 was provided to redeem loans that bad matured. Labour also made tgenerous outright gifts to tbe United Kingdom. Credit is urgently needed in Australia. We must increase food production, but we are not likely to be able to do so while this Government, dominated by tbe so called Australian Country party, remains in office. able member's time has expired.

161,Mr Casey,"Not in so many words,required to build up military, naval and air strength. Every country is making au effort to achieve higher living standards for its people. The under-developed countries in particular are making efforts to improve their means of production and their living standards. Therefore, there is in the world to-day, without excepthe trouble will be there all the time. tion of any country, more money than goods. That has created an inflationary situation. In all the countries that I have mentioned the cost of living is extremely high, and, in nearly all of them, it is still rising steeply. Australia is remote from other countries. In the ordinary course of events, we do not meet a great many people from other countries, unless they take particular trouble to travel here. Generally speaking, people do not travel through Australia to another conntry. Therefore, we do not normally, as a people, have much contact with people from other countries and do not learn from them the situation in their countries. I venture to tell the House that the conditions that exist in Australia to-day exist also, to a greater or lesser degree, in every other country. The variation is only a matter of degree. Reference has been made by honourable gentlemen opposite to the situation in the early 1930's. In those days there was a superfluity of goods and of the means of producing them, but there was hot enough purchasing power in the hands of the people to enable them to buy those goods and use. them. The present position is precisely the reverse of that. We are faced with the problem of having too much money and too few goods. There is only one sound method of solving that problem. It is to reduce the volume of purchasing power and at the same time increase the volume of goods. We must, in other words, close the gap between supply and demand. I suppose that in the minds of all human beings there is a desire to find an easy way out of any difficulty. The world has had a good deal of experience of inflation over the years. Inflationary conditions have hy no means been confined to the last five years. There is a temptation to believe that there is some quick, easy and painless way out of our difficulties. There is a temptation to pin our faith to devices that mask the real cause of our troubles. Devices such as prioes control, profit freezing and subsidies in various forms do not get to the root of our troubles, although they may hide them for a little while. If a new overcoat is worn over a dirty suit the wearer will look clean, but I believe that, within-reason, it is quite legitimate to borrow ^rom overseas to meet a period of emergency, such as that in. whicb we are at tbe present time. There is a temptation to create more money, but one of the causes of our present troubles is that tbere is too much money in comparison with the goods available and tbe rate of production. One of tbe. quick and easy ways out of our difficulties that has been suggested is tbe creation of more money. We might be able to alleviate a dreadful position such as that which existed in the early 1930's if we bought our way out by creating credit, witbin safe limits, but we certainly could not buy our way out of the present situation. To pour more money, derived from central bank credit, into the Australian economy in its present condition would bave precisely the same effect as pouring petrol upon a fire. It would give us a relief for a very short time, but it would encourage tbe continued and progressive growth of tbe fire that we are trying to extinguish. I believe that the sound, solid and honest way in wbich the Government is tackling the problem is the proper way to tackle it. Tbe Opposition has not produced an alternative plan. I do not suggest that normally one looks to any opposition to produce a constructive plan of which a government might avail itself. Unfortunately, in modern-day politics, that is not considered to be playing tbe political game. But I remind bonorable gentlemen opposite that they have not advanced a single constructive idea, either in contravention of what the Government is doing in respect to something that Labour believes should be done. We have got to do all we can-and , Heaven knows, we are trying to do it to decrease the volume of purchasing power through taxation, properly adjusted to meet tbe needs of the various sections of the community. So far as it is humanly possible to avoid tbe creation of more central bank credit we must avoid it. We must prevent tbe people from believing that there is a quick, easy and dramatic way out of our difficulties. Tbis country is still in tbe developmental stage. National development involves tbe transfer of resources from certain avenues o!Dcurrent production to tbe establishment of long-term productive facilities. economic difficulties, we must, to a considerable degree, deny ourselves certain current production in order to create productive facilities in the years that lie ahead. If we do not do so now, we shall suffer for our neglect in a few years time. EecentlyI attended an industrial fair in Karachi at which a number of countries, including Communist countries, were very well represented. In tbe Czechoslovakian exhibit there was a large placard, 10 feet square, wbicb contained what purported to be figures relating to public finance in that country. It was alleged that Czechoslovakia was putting back into constructive developmental facilities for the future, about 50 per cent, of its current income. I am not certain of tbe exact figure, but I am correct to witbin 1 or 2 per cent. Now if that even begins to be true it shows the importance that tbose Communist countries put on developing their productive capacity to meet future needs. I sbould like to know whether that percentage were true or not, because I do not think that the comparable percentage in other countries of the world would approach it. It is unfortunately true that relatively few people realize the policy of this Government and the Oppogreat changes that bave taken place, .and are taking place, in the world. Too many of us in Australia are inclined to believe that we can live to ourselves in this country andlet the rest of tbe world go by. We itend to believe that our economy is a 'dosed economy which we can control by ourselves no matter what is happening to tbe economy of tbe great ""world outside our shores. 'Of course, nothing could possibly be furtber from the truth. Tbe simple fact is that most othei countries are (striving .a great deal harder than we are in Australia. I do not know how the lesson of tbe disparity between the efforts Mr Casey. that Australians make and tbe efforts that the people of other countries make can be brought bome to the mind of tbe average Australian, but I believe that it should be one of tbe bounden duties of all political parties to bring it home to the. people, because the solution of our national problems is not a party political matter. It is easy to dodge the issue by asking why people sliould work harder for the boss. But it is not a case of Even in our present working harder for the boss, it is a case of working harder for tbe nation. An opposition which can put sucb an argument to the people is merely playing politics, and of course tbe Opposition is ready to play politics at the drop of a hat. No amount of political abuse or double-talk sucb as we bave heard in the last few days from honourable members opposite is of any use to the Australian people. Tbe country in these times is looking to all political parties to help the Government and not hinder it in its stupendous efforts to get us out, of our current economic difficulties. | 5.27] -We might have expected the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) to endeavour to dispel some of the misapprehensions from which be alleges tbe Opposition suffers. All I can say is that he. has not afforded us any enlightenment whatever on the subject. He 'has told us of what be has learned from visits to other countries, and apparently what he has learned tbere has made bim regard Australia as a backward country compared with other countries. If we are not, already a backward country we shall certainly become one as a result of the sition is not prepared to allow that policy to stand unchallenged. As far as I icari see, honourable members opposite have .so far done nothing but apologize for the Government's failures. Tliat is a difficult task to perform and some of tbe Government's supporters must be. completely stumped by the fact that the promises by which tbey, as well as tbe electors, wen 1 deluded prior to tbe last two general elections, have not been fulfilled and, as is evident from the record of two and a half years of offioe of this Government, -will never be fulfilled.

162,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"-can be expected of a hybrid governinent in which two different parties with two different sets of ideas are working against eaeh other. All such .a government could produce is a hybrid policy based 'on gimcrack ideas to deal witb a problem that ought to be tackled -on the basis of long-term planning. I -can assure honourable gentlemen opposite that the Labour party is not playing polities. T'he Labour party realizes that the real interests of Australia are to be served only by sound economic government. An ever-increa3iug number of people, who are both able and intelligent, now say that they consider that tbe -country is-on the down grade Tbe Government has spent a great deal of its time explaining tbe difficulties that face it, instead of tackling them. In fact, the 'Treasurer's statement which we are now -debating is really nothing but explanation. All that Government members have been doing is to explain why they are not able to fulfil tbeir promise to put value back into tbe £1. I .know that that is a hackneyed phrase, but the people have been waiting for value to -be put back into tbe £1 and have been disappointed. The honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Roberton) began his speech by saying that be was disappointed witb the views that bad been expressed by members of tbe Opposition. Every time a matter of this kind has been before us he has expressed similar sentiments. It is .understandable that a conservative gentleman like he is would feel like that, because be is quite unacquainted witb democratic ideas. Tbe Minister for tbe chamber immediately .after tbe debate was resumed yesterday by the. honourable member for Melbourne .( Mr Calwell) and said, "" We do not believe in controls "". Honourable members opposite certainly made <such a statement to the electors when tbey worked to defeat the prices referendum. Australia is in its present position because tbe Menzies-Eadden .combination, wbicb was not tben in office, was determined to defeat that referendum. From tbe moment the referendum was defeated we lost control, largely because it was said that tbe States, witb their sovereign powers, could control prices just as well as the Commonwealth could. Tbe fact is ithat the States bave not controlled prices just as well as the Commonwealtb did, because prices cannot be -controlled by the States with differing ideas as efficiently as they can be controlled by tbe Commonwealtli. Yet we need effective controls in order to give us an economy that will enable us to prepare soundly to meet tbe future. Our proposals were defeated at tbe referendum, and we accepted tbe people's verdict. I know that many of my colleague^ watched witb interest the result of the taking over of prices control by the States. The resultant state of affairs bas been shocking and has been alluded to in terms of derision by newspapers that normally support tbe Government parties. Those newspapers advert rightly to tbe continuing rise in prices that bas gone on ever since tbe Government took office. But tbe Government does not appear to be even tackling tbe problem. Any one can excuse a government wbich does its hest and fails, but wben a government does not even tackle a critical problem tben it is failing the people in general. I think that most people wbo have had experience of politics over a period of years will admit that it is not contended that all governments are bad in every respect; but it is contended that when a government has done nothing, as this Government has done after two and a half years of opportunity, and bas failed to effect even a semblance of cure of our economic ills, such a government should be charged witb dismal failure. As tbe bonorable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) has said, tbe Government has failed dismally in practically almost every respect. I now refer to a matter that was mentioned earlier in tbe debate and I shall cite some figures in relation to tbe increase of the basic wage level that bas occurred after prices control powers ceased to be exercised by .the Chifley Government as a result of pressures that were exerted very largely by manufacturers and other producers, and even by people in rural areas and the trade unions themselves.

The parties now in office opposed the Chifley Government's Their members went on the hustings and said, "" It is time controls disappeared altogether"". appear. Hume( Mr Puller) referred to the level of the basic wage wben the Chifley Government took office, although I do not think he used figures for tbe same years as those I propose to cite. In 1946, wben controls were being exercised, tbe basic wage rose by 2s. in tbe first three quarters of the year. In tbe December quarter an interim increase of 7s. was granted by the court. whicb tlie present wage are as follows:In January, 1950, the basic wage rose by an average of 4s. to £6 14s. a week. In April, 1950, it rose to £6 17s. a week, in July, to £7 a week, and in October to £7 3s. a week. In October an additional amount of 19s. a week was also added to the basic wage by tbe Commonwealth Arbitration Court in recognition of the fact that the workers were not receiving a reasonable basic wage. In January, 1951, tbere was an increase of 8s. There was an increase of 7s. in March, 1951; of 12s. in July; of 10s. in October; and of lis. in January, 1952. Tbe last average increase in tbe basic wage was 7s. Yet tbe Government bas bad the audacity to claim that its deflationary policy bas begun to take effect. Tbe basic wage increase in Victoria was 3s. on tbe last occasion and tbere was a good deal of dissatisfaction with it, particularly on tbe part of housewives. The basic wage in New South Wales is now over £11 a week. In Victoria it is also very substantial. It is tbe duty of tbe Government to try to keep down the prices which cause the basic wage to rise. Honourable members opposite frequently state that wages go up and prices follow. No economist in Australia would be prepared to agree witb that conMr Drakeford. ten tion. All economists say that wages rise as a consequence of price increases. The Minister for the Navy( Mr McMahon) said yesterday that tbe Government did not want controls. Tbe Labour party does not believe in the control of every phase of activity but it referendum proposals. does believe in enabling tbe economy of a country to function properly instead of permitting a continual state of anxiety Of course, they did disto exist in tbe community. During tbe Tbe bonorable member for last two years the basic wage has risen by £3 19s. a week, yet tbe Government bas claimed that its policy will put tbe economy of tbe country on an even keel. That claim bas been proved to be false. During tbe course of his speech the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) simply went over the ground that be has been covering since be became Treasurer. He put. forward nothing but excuses and The relevant figures, apologies wbicb have been echoed by give a comparison witb bonorable members opposite. Of course each honourable member bas only bad twenty minutes at his disposal and it is useless to try to make apologies for this Government in less than three or four hours. There bas been a breakaway in tbe economic field and the horse is still bolting. It is futile to suggest that the recent increase of 7s. a week in the basic wage is a sign that the Government's policy is having a deflationary effect. The people of Australia are not likely to believe that. The Labour party is devoted to tbe interests of the great mass of tbe people. It is not concerned about tbe interests wbich provide the funds for bonorable members opposite to win elections. Tbe Government has to please those interests. The people will remember the glamorous promises that were made by the Government during tbe election of 1949, no one of which bas been fulfilled. Micawberlike, bonorable members opposite bave been waiting for something to turn up and tbey are still waiting. What bas the Government produced as a remedy for tbe existing state of affairs? Nothing! Tbis Government cannot produce anything of value. The forces which support it will not permit it to do so. It is like all coalition governments. Like the Government which preceded tbe first Curtin Government it is falling to pieces ancl tlie only encouraging signs are Menzies Government, and tbe actions those which indicate that it has nearly reached the end of its tether. Of course, it will hang on as long as it -can. In canvassing for opinions I have -not been able to find anybody who will admit having voted for the Menzies Government. People to whom I have spoken on this subject have all said to me, "" Will we be able to have an -election? We did not vote for the Government "". The Government came to office under false pretences which are now like chickens coming home to roost and Ministers do not know which way to turn in order to meet the situation. One Opposition memher who is a wellqualified economist-the honourable memdevoted the whole of bis speech to explainsome of its supporters are ashamed to ing alternatives that could be used by the Government. Not one reference has heen made to tliose alternatives by Government supporters. I know of a widow wbo invested .£1,500 in Commonwealth loans. When she sold them she lost £8 on each £100 that she had invested. That was a cruel experience. Is it any wonder that people leave their money in the savings banks? Some honourable members opposite had the audacity to suggest that the fact that the Commonwealth Savings Bank held greater deposits than it bad ever held before was an indication of tbe confidence of tbe people in the Government. If tbe people bad confidence in the 'Government they would draw their money out of the savings banks and invest it in government loans. But tbey will not buy government bonds despite the fact that bonds carry a higher rate of interest than do saving bank deposits.

We all want to cure our economic troubles, and if there is any way in which tbe Opposition can assist the Government it will assist it There is no desire on our part to use this amendment for political purposes, but we must say that the Government is not even attempting to remedy the distress that exists to-day and which could be alleviated if sane politics were applied to the problem.

167,Mr Drakepord,"I was not referfor Defence) [8.0] -The House and the country are being treated to one of the noisy attacks, barren of any constructive thought, that are launched by the Opposition against the Government from rime to time. It is interesting to note that tbe ideas of honourable members opposite have not changed very much during the time that such attacks have been made. I have listened with a good deal of interest to the points that have been made by the members of tbe Opposition. We find the same old catchcries and canards being resurrected from time to time and used by tbem in their futile efforts to discredit tbe Government. On every occasion that the Government comes in for criticism, honourable members opposite commence on tbe basis of rlie 1949 policy speech, wbicb in my opinion was one of the grandest policy speeches ever delivered by a member of this Parliament. So satisfying was it to the public of tbe day that tbey returned the Government with an overwhelming majority. Unfortunately, owing to tbe wangling ancl gerrymandering that bad taken place, although tbe Government enjoyed a substantial majority in this House, the same position did not apply in the Senate. Finding that it was impossible to govern and to carry out oui policy under those conditions, we did what no Labour government bas ever done in this country. We appealed to the people for a mandate before our term of office bad expired. Over the years I bave beard a great deal about the inability of a Labour government to govern tbe country between 1929 and 1931, but on no occasion before the expiration of its term of office did that government show any inclination to appear before its masters. Eventually it was forced to go to the country by dissident elements in its own ranks. On tbe other hand, we were so satisfied with our record that as soon as an opporconditions demand it we are not slow to tunity occurred-and I suggest that tbe most surprised people in this House were the members of tbe Opposition wben tbe opportunity did occur-w e went to the country and appealed to the people on exactly the same premises as we bad appealed to them in 1949, with our record to that date clear for every member of the suitability. public to see and to judge. On that occasion we came back to ofiice witb a majority in both Houses of the Parliament. Tbe Government is very proud indeed of tbe degree to which its policy has been already implemented, not under conditions that existed or were envisaged in 1949, but under conditions entirely different from tbose. Honourable members opposite should appreciate that conditions have substantially changed sincethen. Tbey should be fair enough toacknowledge that tbe whole atmosphere,, tbe whole economy and, indeed, tbe activities of the world have changed since that time. Because of tbeir failure to recognize it or to acknowledge it, I imagine that bonorable members opposite do not appreciate that we are again fighting for tbe freedom of democracy, an ideal that we cherish. Tbey do not realize that wben we voluntarily met obligations that were undertaken ov the previous Government, and which I do not cavil at in any way, a tremendous burden was thrown on the economy of the country. It accentuated tbe difficulties of tbe government in office at that time. I wish to relate briefly the sequence of events because it is as well that we sbould get the picture clear and appreciate the matters that are impeding tbe recovery and progress of the country. In time of war few men demur if they are obliged to forgo a great many of their advantages and freedoms. I remind honourable members opposite that a Liberal-Australian Country party Government was in power when the last war broke out. I also remind them that the government of the day did not hesitate to do certain things which normally such a government would never undertake. Price fixing and other controls necessary in time of war were imposed. It will therefore be understood that wben change our general attitude. We aeknowledge that under certain conditions unusual action may have to be taken. Tbe measures which we tben instituted were carried on practically unaltered by succeeding governments. I suggest that that, at any rate, demonstrates their",62,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
168,Mr Mcbeide (Wakefield,"Ministe rI t is a fact that during that period a great backlog of demand was created in this country. For instance, people had to do without houses and many commodities that are deemed necessary in times of peace. There was also a great backlog of maintenance, replacement of capital -equipment, and other facilities which are usual and necessary in a modern community. It was expected that with the -cessation of hostilities and the removal -of restrictions Australia would again move forward in the way that it had been -developing prior to the outbreak of war. Unfortunately, however, tbe progress made after tbe war, while a Labour .govei'nment was in office, waB unutterably slow. Australia showed up badly in comparison with other countries of tbe British community. Every other Britisb -country, when freed from tbe obligations of war, immediately and energetically undertook comprehensive rehabilitation programmes. When the Labour Government went out of office in 1949, in most .avenues of activity we had not recovered to the 1939 level of production. Tbat was tbe inheritance of the. Menzies Government wben it came to office. It is perfectly clear that tbe inflationary pressures created and intensified in tbe post-war period gave rise to a problem that had to be energetically tackled. Tliis Government undertook to -do so. As I haA'e already said, even greater progress would bave been made in the application of its policy bad not another intrusion been made into OUT activities. I refer to tbe outbreak of war in Korea. The real cure for an inflationary pressure is not prices control or wage pegging but increased production. That is the positive approach. Honourable members opposite speak glibly of prices control put forward one constructive suggestion .and riianj' other controls that are the very antithesis of .progress. In themselves they never do anything but prevent progress being achieved. 'Consequently, we undertook a dynamic and .active policy to tencoiirage production in this country. We not -only created good relations with tbe unions and .officials of the unions, but also supplemented tbeir -efforts by 'tlie importation of goods that normally we would never attempt ito import. The Government bad no hesitation in encouraging tbe inward flow of vital materials and commodities. Baring that period, no criticism came from the Opposition about tbe flow of imports. A cry went up for houses. Tbe Government subsidized tbe importation of bouses and I beard no criticism at that time, although on tbe other band it was frequently said that insufficient bouses were being built. More houses have been erected since this Government bas been in power than during the years that a Labour government was in office. Much criticism has been levelled at the Minister wbo has bad charge of the war service homes programme. Tbe record of the Government in that respect is impeccable. Since war service homes construction was started about 27 years ago, 85,000 homes have been built' Of that number, 35,000 have been built since this Government was returned to the treasury bench. Honourable members can study one item, after another and find the same result. Tbe trend of production in coal, steel and all the things tliat are needed to reduce inflationary pressure has been upward. In the meantime, not one word of commendation, nor one offer of real assistance, has come from tbe Opposition. I admit that, much to my surprise, I heard tlie honourable member for Mnribyraoag ( Mr Drakeford) make the extraordinary statement towards tbe .close of his speech in this debate that thc Opposition was not entirely critical and that it really wanted to help the Government get on with tbe job of rehabilitation. Perhaps tbe honourable member wanted to £11 in time, but I am pleased to know that tliere is at least one honourable member on tbe Opposition side who bas some realization of the needs of tbe countiy. Apart from that -utterance, be did not. and I am still waiting to bear one from any member of tbe Opposition. Tbe .great need of this country is production. During a difficult period wben all eoiiaaatries have been confronted, in some degr.ee, with the same problem the Government has been able to arrange the .affairs of Australia in such a way that full empl-oyiment bas been maintained. In sncb conditions any intrusion on -ordinarv nationa-1 activities means a call for extra effort. I remind tbe country that because of the threat of war, which has been adnutted and assessed by all democratic countries, part of tbe Australian effort bad expiration of its term to go before the-: to be transferred from reconstruction and productive effort to defence preparation. While this has thrown a strain on tbe economy and bas caused the diversion of resources and equipment from civil needs to defence production, tbe call upon tbe people, even for such an important part of tbe Government's policy, has been relatively small. It bas represented about 10 per cent, of tbe economy. I suggest confidently to honourable members that it is not beyond the capacity of the Australian people to give that 10 per cent, extra effort without denying themselves any of the things that tbey are now enjoying. The only alternative is to impinge on civil activity. To that degree, our civil progress, including catching up with the lag in housing and other amenities, will be retarded. It is of no usefor the Opposition to howl calamity, to talk about unemployment, or to dilate on individual cases in which inconvenience and perhaps hard-hip are being experienced and for them then to suggest that that is indicative of the general condition country. On the contrary, tbe people generally have never been better off than tbey are now, and it is not too much to ask the people to give of their best .to enable tbe Government not only to encompass tbe civil programme, but also the defence programme that tbe Government has in hand. I assure bonorable members t.hat this Government and a great number of tbe people of Australia are entirely satisfied witb tbe policy that bas been followed by it. have heard tbe old canard about putting value back into the £1 shouted from the house-tops by honourable members opposite, but as sure as anything is done to achieve that end, they go into reverse and charge the Government with causing a depression and bringing about unemployment and suffering. They cannot have it both ways. Tbey must make up their minds what they want. I assure the people of Australia that price fixing and other palliatives will not meet either the inflationary pressure or the defence needs of Australia. There is only one solution nnd that is production. The Government declares, therefore, that its policy is tbe correct one and it will be happy at the electors. ter's time bas expired. personal explanation. member claim to bave been misrepresented ? sented me when he said that I bad claimed to be tbe only person who bad made any effort to help to rehabilitate the country.. WbatI said was that the Opposition was willing to assist the Government in giving effect to any sane economic policy that was designed to rehabilitate the country, but that it is making no honest attempt to formulate sucb a policy. contribution to this debate by the Minister been of a similar pattern to that made by other members of the Government of the during the last two days. It was a complete evasion of tbe cbarges that have been made in what amounts to a motion of censure wbicb has been couched in tbe form of an amendment to the motion for tbe printing of the financial statement presented by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). In all cases tbere bas been a. whining invitation from tbe Government benches for the Opposition to co-operate witb tbe Government wbich admits, by inference at least, that it is completely I know that we defeated, that it has failed to implement some sort of botch potcb economic policy, and that it fears tbe honest anger of tbe people outside. Tbe Government is unwilling to measure up to tbe challenges that have been made by tbe Opposition. It is nauseating to bave to repeat again and again tbe charges made in the amendment, but we bave no alternative.

176,For Defence ( Mr Mcbride) Has,"impossible to perform as was the task assigned to St. Augustine. However, I shall essay it to the best of my ability in the time allowed to me. Opposition has launched its attack on definite counts that are well known to the people of this country, and it supports that attack by a series of charges that the Government has made mistakes that are dangerous to the nation and to its economy, and to the peace of mind of its people. We demand in this House that those mistakes be rectified. If they are incapable of correction, the Government should get out. The Government's first mistake was in connection with the Commonwealth Bank Board when it appointed business men to the board to replace the so-called bureaucrats who had at least a scientific knowledge of money and economics. It put in their place men who were subservient to tbe Treasurer's decisions and, as a result, credit restrictions were imposed upon tbe community. That was the first mistake. The second mistake was in relation to capital issues. It was a most grevious mistake in which the Treasurer applied the technique of Finnigan, tbe guard-of f again, on again. Factories wbich were manufacturing anything from dolls' eyes to diapers were given unlimited credit facilities while tbose engaged in essentia] industries were denied them. Classic instances of that are recorded in to-day's Sydney Daily Telegraph, wbicb reports that Taubmans Limited, a concern which operates in my electorate and employs many of my electors, asked the Capital Issues Board for approval to raise an additional £:"">00,000 capital and was fobbed off, possibly with £150,000, and that a. general store organization with many branches in the city and country centres bad asked for approval to raise £750,000 and' bad got nothing ancl was told that it may get nothing. During the clays when capital issues were freely allowed and the Government harboured tbe hallucination that it was really governing tbe country, although, in fact, it bad lost the thread of government, it failed to take appropriate measures and by its subsequent actions it brought the country face to face with a depression. At least tbe people were on short commons. The next mistake was to regard taxation as an answer to inflation. Despite tbe airy fairy nonsense of tbe Treasurer The about bow much be was creaming from the community, be admits in this statement that bis wonderful surplus budget will be not a surplus budget but a deficit, budget. How much surplus money has the right honourable gentleman creamed from tbe community? None at all, because it is not tbere to be taken, and so he has had to present this supplementary statement to the House as his apology for the failure of his plan. The next mistake made hy the Government was the disgraceful way in wbich it allowed public confidence in tbe loan market to be so worsened that it was impossible to fill a loan. Wben tbe Chifley Government occupied the treasury bench over-subscription of public loans was tbe order of the .day. To-day, there is the sad and bumble admission by the Government that its loan of £70,000,000 bas been under-subscribed by approximately £15,000,000. The Government fears that tbe position in relation to the next loan will be even worse. Yet honourable members prate from the other side of tbe. House that everything is all right and everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. I warn tbe Treasurer and his colleagues to take this matter seriously because tbe people outside are taking it very seriously indeed. Another mistake, and, perhaps, tbe most dangerous of. tbose of whicb tbe Government bas been guilty, was the atrocious way in whicb. it allowed our balance of payments to be squandered. Perhaps for tbe first time in our history we have no financial resources in London because they have been dissipated by the Government on worthless commodities. The next mistake was tbe persistent statement by Government spokesmen that, we were not getting full production because as tbe result of full employment the workers are not working as well they sbould do. As tbe result of tbe Government's employment policy we hear the technological terms ""stability of employment "", "" disemployment "" and "" employment changes"". Tbe cold fact is that in. the building, light engineering and textile industries there is sharp and grievous unemployment or disemployment if honourable want to give it a euphonic or semantic name. Behind the plans of this Government is an intention to get back co the Hytten plan. A pool of unemployed outside the factory gates is an integral part of its plan for disciplining tlie workers so that we shall get tbe increased production about wbicb we bear so much. The group of experts on tbe Commonwealtb Bank Board was dispersed aud a group of amateurs came in to pass judgment on tbe credit of this country. Capita] issues then became free for all; later tbey became free for none. On the loan market tbere is ""complete public distrust of the Government. Despite tbe fact that the savings banks are bulging with the savings of the people no one is -so silly as to trust this Government. Thc gift-edged security is only gilt-edged at the time of maturity and not at any intermediate stage. The balance of payments debacle, the tragic and awful mistake of tinkering witb tbe plan of full employment, tbe nonsense about the budget surplus, the imposition of import cuts wbicb were too great and too sudden, tbe mistakes of tbe Government at tbe meeting of tbe Loan Council when the courtesies of ordinary debate were'thrown overboard by Commonwealth representatives in their wrangle with' tbe * States when all that tbe States were asking, for was that tbey might keep men in work and keep their public works going-al l tbese mistakes can be laid at the door of tbe Government. At tbe meeting, of the Loan Council tbe Prime Minister and tbe Treasurer made tbe representatives of tbe States appear as if So mueh of tbe Government's legislation they were children asking for something that tbey could not be given, wben, in fact, they were asking only fbr sufficient funds to provide employment for their citizens and to prevent tbe onset of anotber depression or' the beginnings of a recession wbicb would be equally disastrous; to this: country in its present ecoknow whether if is tbe left or right wing nomic circumstances.. That is only a limited list of the tragic things that tbe Government has, done;, but now,, its suppoarters, mealy mouthed, call upon tbe Opposition for its support for alternative plans.. Mr Haylen. The final disaster that bas befallen ths Government has been to believe in its own members propaganda. It believes that it is still acceptable to the people. As Government supporters are so fond of Gallup polls, let them take a poll on that point to-morrow morning. Tbey would be shocked at the result. In the face of this record, the Treasurer asks what tbe Opposition would do in tbe present circumstances if it were in office. Is it not an admission by supporters of tbe Government of its incompetence when one after anotber tbey lean over and breathe on our necks and ask, ""What would you do ?"" We can answer that question, because there is: established precedent for what Labour would do. Tbe record of tbe Curtin and Cbifley Governments provides a. token of what can be done to meet our present problems.. That record, muddied though it might be by Liberal propagandists, shows: that during Labour's regime Australia, in truth, experienced a golden age. At that time a. man who lost a. job knew that he could find anotber ; and the workers; knew that prices would not rise so high in proportion' to their wages as to deny tbem many of thenecessariesof life. Tbe Chifley Government embarked upon a reconstruction programme wbicb involved tbe undertaking of great public works, such as tbe Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme, that had been pigeon-holed during years of Liberal dozing and dreaming. The Labour Government achieved dramatic results in that respect. Thereforej when Government supporters ask what alternative the Opposition bas tooffer, we are able to answer tbem. We do not need to indulge in negative criticism: we shall offer plenty of constructive criticism. as is useful has been borrowed from the Labour party;but tbe Government still believes in laisser fairs and lets things rip. It forgets much that it should have* learnt from tbe experience of the past. The Leader of the Liberal party in Victoria bas said that tbeLiberal partyI do not of the Government coalition-is going too far to the socialist side. The controls and emergency measures upon wbicb it now relies have been copied from preceding Labour governments. It has not tampered with such legislation but is using it to buttress the shambles it bas created. When we are asked what alternative Labour has to offer to its old conservatism we reply that it is to return to sound government, to restore our economy, to put value back into the £1 and to follow tbe example of tlie Chifley Government, during whose regime this country was acknowledged to have a most progressive economy and a better chance of surmounting post-war difficulties than bad any of tbe other democracies. I base this contention on a -tatement which appeared in the London Eccmom.'iifi. The Australian Country party, this rail-sitting monstrosity which attaches itself to the Liberal party in the present coalition, has not only attempted to destroy the country, but has succeeded in practically destroying itself. Everything that has been done to injure tbe man who normally supported the Australian Country party is the responsibility of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), who is the leader of that party. happened in Soutb Africa, and, because The grazier and tbe wheat-grower now have no time for tbe Australian Country party: and it will be only a matter of time before the small farmer wbo, misguidedly, supported tbe Australian Country party in the past, will be sharpening tbe axe on bis grindstone with which to deal with it. Tbe Australian Country party stands arraigned as tbe architect of tbe primary producers' troubles. For it, in this Honse, it is a case of "" sink or swim "". One of the most grievous things wbicb this country now has to face is the result that has flowed from tbe Government's action in respect of our balance of payments overseas. As the Treasurer spoke for over an hour, and as bonorable members are limited to only twenty minutes, I shall not have an opportunity to analyse all that he said. But his story about the balance of payments was weak and futile, and, in many ways, most misleading. It was a tragic story. Our London balance was accumulated through the blood, sweat and tears of the British people. We are not unmindful of the fact that Australia would not have had that balance bad it not been for tbe fact that Great Britain paid us for goods for wbich it was not able during the war to send us goods in return because it was engaged in a life-and-death struggle. But tbose balances wbicb we sbould have treasured have been dissipated-dis sipated on "" Gew-gaws "" and "" Shoddy "". Surely there was one man in tbe ship of state who could have kept a look-out to ensure that imports would not be allowed to flood this country as has happened recently. But, apparently, over cocktails, the Government accepted the importers' advice to let the goods in and to wait and see what might happen. I repeat that those balances had been built up by the blood and sweat of the British people. They were accumulated through the purchase of goods for which tbe British people paid. The Government's action in allowing tbem to be dissipated was a complete dereliction of duty. Any one wbo read tbe newspapers was aware that a trade collapse bad occurred in Canada with the result that imports into that country declined. Tbe same thing of tbe military situation in the Middle East, Great Britain could not sell much of its exports there. But some one whispered in the ears of tbe British manufacturer that he bad a rich uncle in Australia where the wool-grower and the wheat-grower were receiving high prices for their products. The result ia that, to-day, Australians who cannot procure many of the necessaries of life see in abundance in the stores cuckooclocks, bed warmers, beer mugs and men'& -pyjamas at 14 guineas a pair, which must surely bave been spun by fairy fingers. Those luxury articles are obtainable in' unlimited quantities, but Australian citizens are unable to obtain bricks, tiles, timber and cement for the building of houses, and tbe farmer cannot obtain his requirements of piping, galvanized iron, wire netting, tractors, and agricultural machinery. As tbe bonorable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) pointed out, Australians to-day, as tbe result of tbe Government's policy, cannot obtain tbe essential materials they requirein order to increase production for wbicb the Government is constantly asking, but, at tbe same time, tbey see available unlimited quantities of Eussian caviare, salmon, sturgeon roe, and perfumes and scents priced at from £5 5s. to £10 10s. a bottle. The Australian housewife is unable to obtain adequate supplies of bread, butter, sugar, and tea, but bas flaunted before ber eyes imported luxury goods of all kinds that sbe cannot alford to buy. The Government still speaks of tbe need to increase production, but it bas dissipated our overseas balances, wbicb could have been used to purchase essential machinery, in tbe importation of pate de foie gras, Eussian salmon, German sauerkraut, pheasant in aspic, and truffles. That is the measure of the dynamic statesmanship of this Government. Tbat is the story of its administration. Tbe Government bas failed to put value back into tbe £1. The Australian housewife is offered unlimited supplies of imported luxury goods of the kind that I bave mentioned, but is unable to purchase many necessaries. I am reminded of thc words of Marie Antoinette, who lost her head, as this Government will lose its head. When her courtiers told her that the poor of Paris bad no bread, shereplied, ""Give them cake"". Similarly, the Government says that whilst it bas no money for tbe purchase of vital machinery that is required to increase production of food, it has plenty to make, available for the importation of such luxuries as pheasants in aspic. Tbe Government stands arraigned on its many mistakes. I have merely mentioned a few of them. We know of its disastrous foreign policy and of the Japanese peace treaty. ab'e member must confine bis remarks to the question before the Chair. stands arraigned on its internal policy as a result of wbicb tbe people have completely lost tbeir faith in it. To-day, in this country, there is no stability of mind discharged its obligations satisfactorily. ahout the future. On the contrary, gravj anxiety exists because tbere is unemployment in tbe building, light machinery and textile trades. Widespread fear exists regarding our general financial structure. In these circumstances-althoug h members of tbe Labour party would be tbe last to raise sucb a matter-tber e could arise a fear of tbe possibility of a distastrous depression. Tbe Opposition bas moved its amendment to tbe motion now before the House in order to draw attention to these things. I conclude by saying that this problem is not one that the Government can take lightly or be whimsical about, or regard complacently, as most of its supporters unfortunately regard them, because the people who elect all governments and sustain all democracies are afraid that this Government lacks statesmanship and an understanding of our difficulties. If the Government still asks for an alternative plan, tbe Prime Minister may be able to trade a suggestion witb me. If the Government must bave some one to advise it, we shall be prepared to do so upon certain terms that I shall be able to recommend to the Leader of the Labour party. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [S.40] -Tb e honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) bas asked us to take seriously the amendment that has been submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) on behalf of the Opposition. But the Government cannot take the amendment seriously, because the bonorable member for Melbourne indulged in a clowning act and the honourable member for Parkes in buffoonery.

179,Mr Eric J. Harrison (Wentworth,"of the Labonr party in respect of defence explains their silence. Is it not a fact that the Labour party opposed the introduction of the national service training scheme? Did not the Labour party oppose the EmpireA i r Training Scheine during World War II . ? Has not the Labour party always been opposed to measures for the adequate defence of Australia? Opposition members take no interest in the recruiting campaign for the Citizen Military Forces, and, indeed, set their faces deliberately against it. They have tried to sabotage defence measures which are so important to Australia. 1' ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the House is considering the national service training scheme or the nnancial statement presented to the House hy the Treasurer ( Sir' Arthur Fadden) on Tuesday evening? was definitely dealt with in the financial statement. tion memhers may try to prevent the criticism that, they deserve by taking points of order, hut their efforts will be in vain. They have taken almost every government department to task in this debate. These pseudo-administrators and alleged financiers seek to propound a policy that will satisfy the people, but, in fact, they have no constructive proposals to offer, and merely indulge in clowning and buffoonery. It may be convenient for them to forget a most significant statement that was made by their former leader, the late Mr J. B. Chifley, about the problem of inflation. They are usually eager to quote his remarks and cite action that he took in accordance with the policy of the Labour party. But they have not referred to his statements about inflation, and the reason for their silence is obvious. During the last general election campaign, Mr of the tax remission granted in tbe preChifley saidLabour, if elected, might have to do some unpopular things to arrest inflation. honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) does not know what the late Mr out of other matters. 'For instance, be Chifley has said about inflation. Opposition members speak with a multiplicity of voices. Mr Chifley continuedIt would require a numher of measures to cure-som e drastic and some politically unpopular. What does the Opposition seek to do? In the teeth of the observation of their late leader that unpopular measures would have to -be taken in order to check inflation, they seek to make party political capital out of the Government's anti-inflationary policy that has been formulated for the well-being of the country. I cite an instance of the unreasonable and irresponsible statements that have been made by responsible leaders of this Opposition of bits and pieces. The honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, became vociferous on the subject of taxation, and sought to convince himself that his statements on that matter were correct. But let us examine some of the utterances which be bas. made in the past upon that subject. Last year he actually proposed that taxes sbould be increased, because he declared at, a meeting at Frankston, in Victoria, on the 20th March, 1951, that the Labour party, if it were returned to office, would repeal the wool sales deduction legislation, and that tbe special levy on wool-growers would be spread over the whole community. The honourable gentleman, considered that be held in bis hand a really ripe political plum. He thought that be could make valuable party political capital out of bis proposal, particularly among wool growers. What would bave been tbe result of sucb a policy ? Tbe proceeds from the wool sales deduction amounted to approximately £103,000,000.

184,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"Th esaid tnat controls in war-time were less severe than they are to-day. Such a statement was nonsense and poppycock. Had the Labour party bad its way, tbe .greatest economic control of all time would bave been imposed upon the Australian people. We know perfectly well what a Labour government would attempt to do, and, fortunately, tbe people also are alive to tbe danger. The preceding Labour Government tried to impose tbe greatest form of totalitarian and fascist control wben, behind tbe backs of tbe people and without a mandate from tbem, it sought to rob them of their savings, strangle private enterprise and reduce every Australian to the status of a Russian peasant by nationalizing tbe banking system. Yet Opposition members bad tbe audacity to criticize our nnancial policy. How can tbey do so witb any degree of sincerity wben tbey sought, by one act, to nationalize the whole banking structure, and take complete control not only of the finances of the country, but also of every industry that required nnancial accommodation for its development. By a strange coincidence, that paramount controla nationalized banking system-is in line with tbe best Communist principles, because Lenin told tbe Bolshevik congress in 1917We are all agreed that the fundamental first ground that was lost through tbe inaction step . . . must be Treasures for the nationalization of the' ban:;?. Isi t not significant that, because of the infiltration of communism into tbe Labour party during tbe period of which I speak, a Communist principle is embodied in its constitution? Mr .SPEAKER -Order! Communism is completely outside the scope of this debate. propose to discuss communism. Opposition members are so steeped in it that further elaboration by me is not necessary. I was referring to the banking policy of the Labour party and to the strange coincidence that it should fall into line witb Marxian doctrine. What was the position when this Government assumed office? The country had been subject to tbe dictation to which I have alluded. Tbat bad a vital effect not only upon industry but also upon production, witb the result that tbe national finances were affected. Industrial unrest, wbicb extended even to the ranks of the Australian Labour party itself, and was aggravated by the attitude of tbe Labour Government, was a potent force whicb violently affected the financial structure of this country. Production decreased alarmingly mainly because one State Labour administration introduced a shorter working week. That, too, bad a violent effect on our financial structure and, in fact, from it bave stemmed many of our economic troubles. I do not know whether any mention bas been made in this debate of the security of the Pacific region, but that is a most important defence consideration. After tbe sorry story of Manus Island, it was necessary for tbe Liberal Government to devote considerable attention and energy to the defence of this country. a discussion of Pacific defence, and I cannot permit tbe Minister to continue to discuss that matter. propose to do that, Mr Speaker, but I do intend to deal witb the defence of this country. Tbe security of Australia has been jeopardized, and it has fallen to the lot of this Government to retrieve the of tbe Labour Administration. I consider that tbe pact between tbe TJnited States of America, Australia and New Zealand is tbe greatest diplomatic achievement of any Australian government. When this Governmeut assumed office, it was confronted by a rapidly deteriorating economy, due mainly to tbe problem of inflation over whicb tbe Labour Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, admitted be had no control. We bad to devise financial measures to rectify tbe economic situation. What did we do? Time will not permit, me to go into details of the various measures that we adopted, but I shall mention one wbicb had a marked effect on our economic structure.

188,Mr Speaker,"Order! I remindcertain motion and an amendment to it. The motion is for the printing of a financial statement made by the Treasurer, and the amendment is virtually a motion of no confidence based on that statement. Within tbose limits tbere is ample scope for debate, and I ask tbe Minister to keep within the terms of the 'Government's own proposition. endeavour to do that, Mr Speaker, but tbe fact remains that Opposition speakers in this debate bave sought to encompass the entire administration of this Government. They have dealt witb all matters that affect the economy of this country. I contend that labour conditions are of vital importance to our economy because it is from the labour shortage that many of our economic problems stem. I was endeavouring to draw tbe attention of honourable members to the action taken by the Government to stabilize tbe economy by reducing industrial disputation. However, you have ruled that line of argument out of order, and I shall not proceed any further on it. I shall return to the subject of defence which, I consider, as Minister for Defence Production, bas come in for unnecessary criticism. At the end of the war, tbe Labour Government divested this country almost completely of its munitions potential. Equipment worth many millions of pounds was sold at bargain prices. Now we bave to endeavour to retrieve the position; yet when the Government budgets for defence expenditure of £181,000,000 it is criticized by tbe Opposition. That money cannot be drawn out of thin air. It must be obtained through taxation, and tbere again the Government has come in for criticism. Let us see what the Government bas clone to improve our defences. Honourable members opposite are aware that tbe Korean force has been increased. They know too that an Australian fighter wing has been made available for service in tbe Middle East. Tbe nucleus of a substantial armaments industry has been established in private enterprise in accordance with tie Government's plan for national defence. Tbe initial financial allocation for this purpose is £250,000. The Government has approved the prin[7] cipal of the establishment of central tool rooms to provide, industry witb an assured supply of special tools and bas authorized a total expenditure of £1,286,000 on tbe provision of precision machine tools and the establishment of production technique. In the field of munitions production, expenditure totalling £4,500,000 has been authorized. An Australian-built fighter aircraft which-will be superior to any fighter or intercepter plane in the world will be in production early next year. Plans are well advanced also for the production of what is regarded as the best medium bomber in the world to-day. The Government bas done tbose things in fulfilment of its obligation to tbe nation. In addition, as I have said, we. bave bad to restore to our defence production fabric the equipment that the Labour Government sold at the end of the war; yet honourable members opposite have the temerity to criticize the Government's defence effort and to move an amendment in completely irresponsible terms that will not stand up even to the test of debate. Opposition speakers bave said a lot about inflation. Let us examine tbe Government's anti-inflationary measures. Surely the problem of inflation is sufficiently important to warrant tbe cooperation of tbe best intellects of all political parties. Surely the ravages of inflation are such that the problem should not be the subject of carping criticism by bonorable members opposite. Surely a. 'solution of the problem is so vital to tbe well-being of this country that all honourable members sbould bend tbeir energies towards making constructive proposals instead of indulging only in destructive criticism ; yet not one honourable member opposite has made a single constructive proposal. The Government's principal weapon in tbe fight against inflation is the 1951 budget. It is true that the budget was subjected to criticism wben it was introduced, but it is no longer criticized. Throughout tbe length ancl breadth of Australia those wbo formerly criticized the budget are now admitting that it was wise and courageous,, and that its benefits are now becoming apparent.

Honourable members opposite are silent wben tbey realize that tbe economic stability for wbicb tbe Government bas worked so earnestly is now becoming apparent. Perhaps that is why tbey have moved the amendment. They are taking advantage of the last opportunity that they are likely to have to criticize tbe Government's financial and economic policy because soon tbe results of that policy w ill be so evident that tbere w ill be no ground for criticism. An important feature of our changing economy is increased production. For instance, tbe monthly production of black coal increased from 1,179,000 between July and December, 1949, to 1,648,000 tons between July and December, 1951. ner's time bas expired.

Tbe bonorable gentleman, of course, took the same line as other Government supporters took by claiming that the present inflationary situation was caused by Labour governments. I bave not time to deal with the history of this situation and therefore 1 shall content myself w itb reading two brief extracts from tbe press of Australia with reference to tbe last budget.of Mr. Chifley, wbicb was introduced in .Sep1 tember, 1949. The Melbourne Age commentedIn broad results, the federal budget is a record of achievement, of sound management, of huge resources and of prudent foresight. Tbe Melbourne Argus of tbe same date statedtons Mr Chifley has produced a lower cost pf living budget. He has resisted the tendency of making spectacular eleventh hour concessions in an election year. The budget is a sound one designed to underpin the social seryice programme, to maintain full employment and economic development. They were the independent opinions of independent newspapers. Everybody wbo f a i r l y assesses tbe facts must come to the same conclusion. Of course, the present Government parties, wbicb were then in opposition, later made a series of election promises of tbe kind that were condemned by implication in the second article from which I quoted. Need1 discuss them now? Honourable members recall tbem clearly. If tbe The promises, in general terms, were to reduce the-.cost of living, or, in other words, to put value back into tbe £ 1 ; to remove controls; and to reduce taxes I call upon the progressively. Circumstances that bave arisen since tben may explain why tbose promises have not been honoured but, in I apologize for having some instances, tbe action that has been taken bas been the reverse of that which was promised. It is absurd for tbe Vice President of the Executive Council and bis colleagues to make wild statements unless they can produce supporting I apologize unreservfacts.

Tbe statement has proved that tbe because of the deterioration of the international situation, but the Labour Government's defence plan was not criticized in those days. Tbe Minister for Commerce and Agrispeech earlier in the debate. He criticized the Government of New South Wales because that State is not completely independent and actually is guilty of importing foodstuffs from other States. What a dreadful offence! Tbe Minister apparently would like all potatoes to be consumed in Tasmania, all footwear to be confined to Victoria, all cattle to be retained in Queensland, and, presumably, all steel to be used exclusively in New South Wales. The bonorable gentleman seems to know nothing of tbe movement of trade between the States. His speech developed into a tirade of abuse directed against New Soutb Wales because be was annoyed with tbe New Soutb Wales Minister for Agriculture, wbo bad outlined a positive programme for increasing food production and bad expressed criticism of the Commonwealth Minister. The State Minister advocated an easing of restrictions on bank credit in relation to primary production and the granting of tax concessions to primary producers. In fact, this Government has now given effect to many of his suggestions. That is the sort of unfair criticism that bas been expressed by Ministers and their supporters during this debate. The long financial statement made by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) dealt with many matters, and it would be impossible for me to discuss all of them in the course of my remarks. The right bonorable gentleman gave no indication anywhere in bis statement that he was convinced of tbe correctness or the wisdom of his policies. He said, in effect, "" Well, everything may turn out satisfactorily. We regarded imports as being essential to our campaign against inflation. Then we restricted imports because we bad to do so. Wbo can foretell tbe future? Some people fear that tbere will be degree of unemployment, especially amongst unskilled workers and certain skilled workers, such as building tradesTreasurer lacks any assurance that he bas a remedy for inflation at-hand in what be bas described as "" tbe measures of tbe Government"". That is a good expression. It indicates that the Government bas done only one thing at a time. The Government lacks a general policy, and tbere are constant shifts in its plans. Its views on the subject of economic policy are frequently changed. I shall concentrate my attention now upon two important matters. One relates to the decisions of tbe Loan Council at its recent meeting and tbe other to the recent sudden application of import restrictions by arbitrary methods which bave involved unavoidable breaches of, perhaps, tens of thousands of contracts between British sellers and Australian buyers. I shall discuss, first, the importance of tbe public works of the States. They have always been essential to the physical development of tbe nation. Without fuel, power, transport, irrigation, schools, hospitals and tbe like, tbe adequate development of Australia and the absorption of population increases would be impossible. Statistics show that public works represent about 30 per cent, of total investments, both public and private, in Australia. However, their significance is far greater than that proportion would suggest because, without tbe basic works that are financed by means of public investment, nearly all private investment in Australia would be held up. Public investment in that sense is the keystone of tbe development of Australia. In our view, any substantial reduction of public works should be avoided. At the Loan Council meeting, the States were unanimous. The Commonwealtb was the only dissentient to the decisions that were made. Tbe State Premiers did not represent a political party group. They represented all political parties. !In my view; they took a far more realistic view of the economic",73,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
199,Culture ( Mr Mcewen) Also Made A Wild,"situation than did the Commonwealtb. The £24=1,600,000 for State works is justified. Council sbould not have acted in the way Some people believe that it representsan increase of public works, but in fact it represents a lower volume than did tbe figure for £225,000,000, because costs of construction have risen by at least 20 per cent. The appropriate figure for the same physical volume of work as last year would be £270,000,000. The lower figure whicli tbe Loan Council adopted as a result of a vote of tbe State Premiers involves a physical reduction of works by nearly 10 per eent. Despite that effective physical reduction, the Commonwealtb insisted that tbe figure of £247,500,000 was too large and put forward tbe counter proposal that the figure should be £180,000,000, whicb would involve a physical reduction of public works by 30 per cent. I say that tbe State Premiers were right. The Premier of South Australia, Mr Playford supporter, but an opponent of Labour. In a broadcast last night, be said that the figure upon which the Commonwealtb insisted would reduce the rate of developwere unemployed. ment, impede private investment, and cause unemployment on a large scale. It was tbe desire of tbe Premiers to avoid Government, having delayed action that dangerous situation wbicb caused tbem to take tbe business of tbe Loan Council out of tbe hands of the Commonwealth for the time being. Tbe position, constitutionally and legally, is that tbe Commonwealth must accept tbe decision of tbe Loan Council, because decisions of that body bave supreme force in this country, but it bas almost openly repudiated the decision byattacks made on the State Premiers. Recently the Treasurer made a most unseemly attnck upon tbe State governments. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) have been far more subtle than tbose of the Treasurer. But what tbe two right honourable gentlemen bave said represents, in substance, an unwillingness to carry out the decisions of the Loan Council. Tbat is plain from tbe statement of tbe Treasurer, in whicb the right honourable' gentleman gives all kinds of State Premiers' figure of reasons why, ia, bis opinion,, tbe Loan it did, and in wbicb be' offers to do something that tbe Loan Council rejected. Tbe Commonwealth is. bound to last year, which was do what the Loan Council decided should be done, and I assume that it will do so. Owing to tbe Government's failure to control inflation, and its administration of bank credit policy in too harsh a manner, tbe market for Government loans became demoralized and private enterprise became embarrassed in its own developmental plans. The Government now wants to adjust tbose plans and tbe rate of private investment to this deplorable situation. It will not approve of the continued full employment of tbe labour and resources that are available for development and tbe maintenance of living standards in Australia. In essence, tbe Treasurer is now saying that we sliould adopt tbe policy of a contracting economy instead of any expanding economy. That disastrous policy was adopted during the depression of the 1930's. I think it is now admitted that development then proceeded at far too slow a pace, witb tbe result that a large portion of tbe workers of this country I turn to import restrictions. The to control the volume of imports, eventually had to impose drastic and arbitrary cuts. One possible effect of the cuts has not been sufficiently emphasized. It is possible that imports of equipment and capital goods which are urgently required by the States for tbe development of basic public works will be reduced. Tbe magnitude of the import cuts is without precedent in Australia, either in time of war or in time of peace. It is doubtful wliether, after a few months, available supplies of equipThe criticisms of the ment and capital goods will be sufficient to sustain developmental projects. Tbat constitutes a serious threat to the level of investment and employment, possibly even greater than the tbreat presented by tbe shortage of capital internally in this country. It was on that shortage of capital internally that, before the Loan Council, the Commonwealth based its",74,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
200,Mr Calwell,He is a Liberal.,75,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
201,Dr. Evatt,"He is not a Labourargument that there would be a heavy percentage reduction of public investment. Many millions of pounds worth of overseas equipment is involved in the import cuts. At the Loan Council meeting, the Government put on one side the tremendous obstacle to investment that is involved in a policy of continued import restrictions, and placed many vital projects at the arbitrary discretion of tbe Commonwealth, adopting a critical attitude towards the whole programme. The import restrictions take an extravagant form in that all existing contracts Commonwealtb loans sbould be firm. The cannot be performed. Professedly, they have been instituted to bold a situation that should not bave been allowed to deteriorate so seriously. The Government had the information on this matter. It was in close touch with all developments. Therefore, it is astonishing that action was not taken previously on the basis of the facts as tbey now appear. Tbose facts were not revealed to the Parliament a few months ago. While tbe Parliament was sitting, no hint of the import restrictions was given, but the day after the Parliament adjourned tbe cuts were imposed. I say that, by the restrictions, the Government delivered a severe blow at tbe trading and financial relations between this country and the TJnited Kingdom. It did so at a time wben tbe sterling area was facing special difficul-to join in a campaign to help to raise ties, and when the United Kingdom itself was battling witb a serious problem of its own and looking for help witbin the Commonwealtb to sustain tbe position of sterling for tbe benefit of us all. Tbe restrictions bave been conceived and carried out with no regard for local developmental plans. I ask the Government, through the Treasurer or some other Minister, to inform the House of the value of orders placed by tbe States for public works that were waiting supply from abroad when the restrictions were imposed, and the value of similar Commonwealth orders for defence and civil needs. I ask also for information about the plans that are being made to ensure that those supplies will be obtained. In some public works, tbe proportion of essential capital equipment that bas to be imported is, I believe, as high as 30 per cent. My view is that at tbe Loan Council meeting tbe State Premiers, having abandoned tbeir first proposal, came to a reasonable decision. I believe that they acted correctly. Tbe Commonwealth is bound to carry out tbe decisions of tbe council, and it should do so with tbe maximum of goodwill. The problem of the security loans of this country is involved in this matter. The last two loans were failures, for varying reasons. One reason was that uncertainty about rates of interest affected investors. Rates of interest upon rate of interest upon one loan was Z\ per cent. It is true that tbe next loan was issued at tliat rate of interest, but it was issued at a discount. Finally, tbe rate of interest was increased sharply. That action reduced the market value of previous securities by a considerable percentage, at a time when it is fair to assume the market for Commonwealth securities was being supported by the Commonwealth. Tbat is a severe loss in many instances and I consider that if tbe bases of tbe loan could be made secure it would tben be quite proper for all parties and tbe States, and all parties in tbe States'-becaus e the States represent all tbe political parties in Australia, including tbe Liberal party; tbe Labour party and the Australian Country party the approved amount. Without dealing in further detail with the matter of import cuts I point out to tbe House that it is important to ascertain, if the House can ascertain it, exactly what is proposed to be done in relation to tbe policy of import restrictions. That policy is said to be temporary. Wbat does that mean? Does the Prime Minister propose to deal with the subject of import restrictions during his mission abroad? Is tbe policy to be reviewed? Wbat is happening to Australian industry, not only importing interests but also our manufacturing interests? \Bxtension of time granted.] Australian industry is affected because the cuts accentuate the difliculty of obtaining not only raw materials for manufacture bere but also partly made articles. Tbat is happening in many instances to wbicb other honourable members have referred. Australian industry and commerce are both affected and the whole situation requires review. In summing up the arguments as they have been developed by my colleagues, and certain views that I have expressed, I would suggest that tbe following matters be considered by the House:-Eirst, in future tbe Parliament sbould accept a greater responsibility' for the nation's financial and economic policy. One can see from the questions that have been asbed in the House during tbe last few days bow difficult it is to obtain full information on tbe financial position. Such information should be available in some convenient form to the House. At present bonorable members have little information about financial matters and bave an opportunity to deal witb tbese great questions, such as import restrictions, to give one illustration, only after tbe events have taken place and it is practically impossible to restore tbe situation. .Secondly, there should be an immediate review of the administration of tbe present bank credit restriction policy, wbicb Was laid down a considerable time ago. The administration of it is in tbe bands of tbe Government, nominally through the Commonwealth Bank and tbe private banks, but under the relevant statute the responsibility rests witb the Government. that a review of the heads of policy is required. The Prime Minister pointed out during last session that imports can be financed without the necessity to apply restrictions that might be applied to other forms of business activity. Above all, tbe procedure under wbicb tbe banking system has the duty of deciding Government policy on whether a particular industry is, essential or not requires review, because such decisions are of great importance. Thirdly, a system of administrative should be applied to important decisions both in respect of capital issues and tbe refusal of bank credit on the basis of tbe Government's advances policy. In such cases I say that the judgment of the Capital Issues Board or tbe bank concerned could be reviewed with advantage in order to guarantee uniformity and justice Tbere is no uniformity in that Dr. Evatt. respect to-day. One bank may decide one way and anotber bank may decide anotber way in relation to similar matters. In cases where advances are made by banks after due consideration tbere sbould not be any administrative review unless there are some special features associated with that tbe matter. Fourthly, an immediate review sbould be made of import licensing restrictions to ascertain whether temporary arrangements can be made with tbe TJnited Kingdom Government to mitigate the harshness of their application. My fifth suggestion refers to one important aspect of our production problem, namely, the position of tbe skilled worker to-day. His wage has gone down and down in tbe last five years in comparison witb tbe wage of the unskilled worker. I suggest that the wages of skilled workers be fixed in proportion to tbe value of the particular skills concerned. That contention was rejected in tbe Galvin judgment on tbe ground that tbe award of tbe margins claimed, might increase tbe inflationary trend. As a matter of fact, it was simply as a. result of the inflationary trend that tbe claim for tbe margins was made. In primary industry, both the owner or share farmer and the employee sbould be entitled to a fair return. In making that statement. I am simply I submit restating the policy that Labour governments attempted to apply. That policy sbould be applied on tbe basis of just terms, having regard to market prices and the necessity to maintain and expand food production. Above all, liberal credit facilities sbould be available to encourage tbe sons of Australian farmers to engage in all forms of primary production. Tbe proposals of tbe Premiers in respect of loans for works programmes should be accepted by tbe Commonwealth and impartial review and a vigorous attempt should be made to put them into effect. Eor this purpose a stable loan rate is absolutely essential but, above all and more important than tbe rate, public confidence is required. An immediate investigation sbould also be undertaken to meet all cases of injustice in wbicb investors, particularly small investors, have been -deprived of the market value of their holdings in government 1 loans because of subsequent increases of interest rates. I submit that the fundamental principle in respect of public developmental works producing capital assets for tbe Commonwealth or tbe States must be that no works judged essential should be terminated or suspended..merely because of alleged financial reasons. physical means, tben I submit that mere financial reasons 'are not sufficient to j u s t if y the closing down of works to the extent proposed. The economic position of people wbo arc in receipt of fixed incomes calls for an urgent review in tbe light of still increasing prices. In any consideration of the prices problem we sbould not concentrate so much on tbe aspect of wages, because stabilization of prices is an essential stabilization of wages. Some people .contend that the quarterly adjustments of the basic wage bave been the cause of inflation. If prices were stabilized those quarterly increases of tbe wage would not * occur. The first thing to tackle is prices, although I admit that price freezing by itself is not tbe remedy. The problem of production in both its primary and secondary aspects is a difficult one and I shall not attempt to Opposition made of tbe budget when it deal with it in tbe few minutes at my was introduced bas been justified iby disposal, or elaborate upon the arguevents.

Tbe policy expressed in the Government. Such .a debate is supposed budget is quite different from the policy to produce a political crisis. It is true of import restrictions. The PrimeM in that tbe .motion was not moved by tbe ister emphasized in bis New Year's Day broadcast that imports were an essential part of bis programme to combat inflation. The chairman of tbe Commonwealth Bank also made a similar statement in December. In November or December a total of £62,000,000 Australian was actually invested in British When we bave tbe Government securities, the whole assumption being that imports would continue to flow in . Then something happened. I still do not know from tbe Treasurer's statement whether the import restrictions that have been imposed by tbe Government were authorized by tbe conference of Commonwealth finance Ministers. I assume that they were not authorized by that conference. Judgingf r o m tbe broadcast which tbe Treasurer made after the conpreliminary condition to ference I should have thought that the primary decision to which the finance Ministers came was to economize in the use of non-sterling currencies. Instead, there was an abrupt discontinuance of an enormous amount of trade between two important sterling countries, B r it a in and Australia, to the detriment of both of them. That step represented a turning back in the policy of the Government.

He floated around in a gloom of his own and tbere were no facts to be seen-n o land or sky or sea. I sbould like to refer to one or two facts, if this would not be regarded as an impertinence by the right bonorable gentleman. It appears that be thinks that tbe Government has fallen down in tackling the problem of inflation. He did not make it quite clear, but I thought that there was a vague bint that he was opposed to inflation. But if he is opposed to inflation bis remedy is indeed most curious because, in bis peroration, he made it relatively clear that be considered that tbe remedy was to be found in more credit, in higher prices, in higher wages and in tbe financing of tbe State works programmes from central bank credit. Tbe right bonorable gentleman will live long enough to be a curiosity in tbe world of political economy, because never until to-night bave I beard a responsible leader who, if this amendment is carried, will be Prime Minister to-morrow morning or, at tbe latest, to-morrow afternoon, launch an attack and indicate, in effect, that those are bis remedies for inflation. If I were not referring to sucb a distinguished gentleman I would say that it was childish nonsense but, as I am referring to the right honourable gentleman I can say no more than I have already said. The right bonorable and learned gentleman gave particular attention to two problems. I shall not bother about the rest of the negative insinuations that have been made by tbe Opposition in the course of the debate. Tbe right honorMr Menzies. able gentleman referred, first of all, to tbe decisions of tbe Loan Council. He put forward a very astonishing proposition wbich he, I hope, will live to regret. He stated that tbe duty of tbe Commonwealtb, when tbe six State Premiers vote for a certain programme at a meeting of for that programme. If bis proposition did not mean that it meant even less than I thought it meant. In effect, the right bonorable gentleman said that, as tbe six Premiers finally decided on a programme requiring tbe expenditure of £247,500,000, it was tbe duty of tbe Commonwealth to obey tbe decision of tbe Loan Council and find that £247,500,000. It must be singularly fortunate that the Loan Council did not pass the resolution a couple of hours earlier, because tbe motion put forward tben had been in respect of a programme of £351,000,000. I suppose that if tbe six Premiers bad voted for the raising of £351,000,000, then the Commonwealtb would have been bound to find that sum of money. It is a Catchpenny argument to say that the Commonwealtb is bound to find the money whicb tbe Loan Council decides should be raised. The function of the Loan Council is to decide how much money can be raised on reasonable terms and conditions. Tbat is what it was established for and those are tbe words that are used in the Financial Agreement, The Commonwealth bas a duty to tbe people of Australia to offer its own view at the Loan Council meeting and to decline to be associated with financial programmes which, in its judgment, are not capable of being fulfilled by borrowing money from the public on reasonable terms and conditions. I remind the House that, in respect of tbe current financial year, tbe Loan Council, in agreement witb tbe Commonwealth, decided to raise £225,000,000. At the time that it was agreed to raise that amount the Commonwealth stated that if, was most improbable that the loan market would yield more than £125,000,000 during tbe financial year 1951-52. Bui because the Government believed in development and because we wanted to have works carried out we did something that no government that the right honourable gentleman ever belonged to, or any of its predecessors, ever thought of doing. We undertook to find the money that was required. That guarantee, which has made possible 70 per cent, of tbe works programmes of all tbe States of Australia during tbe last ten montbs, will cost tbe Australian Government £155,000,000. In other words, it bas prosbould bave undertaken duced tbe greatest financial difliculty in £247,500,000 because that is what the one year that any Australian Government bas bad to confront. Tbe right honourable gentleman bas made light of that difficulty. He would not do so if be did not exceed £100,000,000, tbe result were in office. At the last meeting of the Australian Loan Council, at whicb the programme for tbe forthcoming financial year was discussed, we said that we could not find £155,000,000, and for a very good reason. In tbe last financial year we were budgetting for a surplus and we at least bad some surplus to work on. We are not anticipating that we shall have a surplus of that kind at tbe end of the next financial year. It is very interesting to recall and I mention it to tbe House, that with all the hullabaloo that bas taken place about increased taxes from the other side of tbe House, the total yield to the Commonwealtb of increased taxes in this country in this current financial year is of the order of £155,000,000. Every Id. of that sum will be called on to pay for works done by the States. I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as we are concerned we are not going on indefinitely laying burdens on the people, for whicb we are responsible, in order to confer benefits on States for which so far we bave not bad a hap'orth of thanks. Opposition members interjecting, yet, I am only at tbe first stage of my speech. Therefore, this year we said that tbe Commonwealtb would find, apart from tax reimbursement for special grants and purely in respect of the loan programme, £125,000,000a magnificent offer. Mr J. R. FRASER -Ho w kind! orable member wbo interjected would be able at once to tell us bow to finance public works, and bow to avoid inflation and increased taxation at tbe same time, but as be has never had any responsibility for doing any of tbose things I pay little attention to bis views. We bave undertaken to find £125,000,000, and tha Leader of the Opposition says that we to find Premiers voted for. As tbe best estimate of the market yield made by any Premier at the Australian Loan Council meeting is that, on that view, making the best estimate and adopting the right bonorable member's principle, we would bave to find £150,000,000 this financial year. It is at that point that tbe right bonorable member at last bas to face up to a hurdle. At that point be must make bis election. Assume that he is in charge of tbe country's finances us assume that be has said to tbe Premiers at the Australian Loan Council, ""We shall find £150,000,000 "". Let bonorable members opposite ask themselves bow that money is to be raised? They might fill in a fruitfu l hour or two asking themselves that question. Would it be found by reducing social services payments; would it be found by reducing defence expenditure; would it be found by reducing repatriation expenditure? Let bonorable members opposite go through the list of Government obligations and ask themselves bow tbey would find £150,000,000. Indeed, the money required would be £200,000,000, in our view, because we do not share ths Premiers' optimistic view of tbe loan market. The Leader of the Opposition says, "" Tbat is all right, you need never talk about money"". Buti f be were Treasurer be would have to give a passing thought to the subject of money every now and again, and he would have to face up to tbe realization before long that what be is telling this House and tbe country is that at a time of inflationbecause it is a time of inflation and be has complained about that-be would finance tbe works programmes of the country either by increasing taxationand if that is what be means be sbould",78,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear

I say no more about that matter because I want to leave only a few facts to rumble around in tbe minds of tbe Leader of the Opposition and bis followers.

I believe that the nimbleness witb wbich the right honourable gentleman skips on to every passing bandwagon is really remarkable. happens that seems to be unpopular and immediately he bops on to it and says, "" There you are, the Government is wrong again "". But he cannot be right all the time if he pursues that eccentric course. He has chosen to attack us, or at least I : think that he has, about import restrictions. Therefore, it is legitimate for us to ask what be would have done? Did he object to our policy of encouraging imports? Did be disagree witb our view that if you make more goods available to the public tbere will be an anti-inflationbonorable gentleman advocate such a ary pressure and tbe rise of tbe price level will tend to be arrested? I do not remember bim saying much about that.

He drops a few crocodile tears about the troubles of the people in the TJnited Kingdom-and expressions of sympathy in that quarter are no less welcome because they are novel-but what would be bave done ?' If he had done nothing he would bave found this country reaching a point when it could not pay for its imports! This Government will not allow itself to be forced into the position of allowing, tbe trade balance and the currency balance of Australia to reach a point where we will be faced by a form of international bankruptcy. We are not a control-minded government, and we were not eager to institute controls. We imposed tbem when we found-and we were greatly illuminated on that matter by the discussions whicb occurred at the January posed controls the overseas currency balance of this country would before long reach a dangerously low level. Tbe right honourable gentleman says, "" I bave yet to learn whether this is in line with the conference that took place in London"". I assure him that it is, because in London the conference, whicb was presided over by tbe Chancellor of the Exchequer of the TJnited Kingdom, clearly and unanimously laid down that, among other things, each country in the sterling area should bring itself ancl its Something overseas trade into tbe overall balance. It considered ways and means by which that might be done. It said that it might be done by means of overseas borrowing. Tbis Government has done more than its predecessors in endeavouring to secure overseas borrowings. But overseas borrowing is not tbe answer to a problem of such magnitude. I only wish that it were. Delegates to tbe .conference said that it might be done by increasing what they called "" deflation "" inside their own countries. I bave not beard tbe right course. On tbe contrary, be bas challenged it. Tbey said it might be done by means of import restrictions. What other means were there? We adopted import restrictions because it became necessary quickly to bring into control tended to exhaust our overseas balances by the end of this calendar year. Tbe right honourable gentleman has bis been so quick to read some of the articles of criticism and to seize upon tbem that he now permits himself to say,'"" ""You sbould have taken action earlier"", to wbicb I retort, ""What action?'""It .""is an interesting question.

If that is the position be bas not said so. He bas not let us know whether be would have introduced import controls in October of last year. We introduced them at what we believed to be the right time. [Extension of time granted.] I am indebted to the House for extending my time. I do not propose to trespass on its patience for very much longer because I had almost reached tbe end of tbe second matter with which I wished to deal. I had been dealing with import restrictions, and tbe first question I bad posed was, "" Does tbe rigfit bonorable gentleman complain that we did not institute import licensing early enough ?

211,Mr Menzies,"I shall arrange forexport more than on all the others put together. I refer to the export of wool. I suppose that I am right in saying that wool accounts for at least two-thirds of our export income. On the continent of Europe we happen to have as customers Eor our wool, and therefore as important contributors to our export income, several countries whose balance of trade witb us is, from tbeir point of view, comsented the Leader of tbe Opposition pletely adverse. Por instance, it will be found that the balance of trade witb Italy, France and Belgium is entirely and overwhelmingly in our favour. Much as I love the United Kingdom, and much as I desire in my discussions witb representatives of the United Kingdom Government to be able to find some way to mitigate the rigours of this unhappy business, I am still bound to say that this country is in no position to snap its fingers at customers who are of great importance to us, of old standing, with whom we bave bad long association, and who have presented us with our only favorable balance of trade. Witb one or two casual exceptions, for a long time our balance of trade witb tbe dollar world, and also witb tbe sterling world, has tended to be an adverse one. Tbe right bonorable gentleman asks. "" Wbat does it matter about that ? What does it matter what our transactions are with such countries? Cut tbem all off and then proceed to cut off from the United Kingdom what is left."" We bave honoured our obligations, as we always propose to do until tbey bave been suitably changed by appropriate means. We found ourselves under obligations of a non-discriminatory character, and we stood up to them. Having had import restrictions upon dollar goods and Japanese goods for a considerable time, this country bas now placed restrictions, without discrimination, upon goods arriving from all other sources. Tbe supreme object of that action is to render the country internationally solvent so that in due course-and the sooner tbe better-w e may get rid of tbese wretched restrictions and resume our normal intercourse with tbe world. If the problems that confront this country could he resolved by magnificent speeches, no doubt tbey would have been solved long ago. As usual, tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has delivered a magnificent oration, but he is sadly lacking in tbe translation of such speeches into action. To-night the right honourable gentleman was guilty of scandalous misrepresentation. In the course of his speech., be deliberately misrepre(Dr. Evatt). He began by saying that tbe Leader of the Opposition bad advocated more credit, more wages, and tbe financing of State works from bank credit. Each of tbose statements is, in full effect, completely false. The only one of those points to which tbe Leader of the Opposition referred was tbe marginal wage claims of tbe engineers and the metal trade workers. He said that as the recent award on their claims did not accord them justice, tbe economy of this country might suffer and, in truth, that may be so. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition said that the credit policy should be regularly examined. Is not that the sensible thing to do? Should not credit policy be examined from time to time? Better still, should it not be constantly under review? If the Government does not do that, it will fail to honour its mandate from tbe people or fulfil its trust to the nation. Honourable members surely will concede that the Leader of tbe Opposition was right in advocating that credit policy sliould be overhauled regularly. Wliere it works badly, it sbould be altered. Where it causes hardship, it sbould be amended. Where it is not sufficiently selective it sbould be made more elastic in its effect. Tbat is what tbe Leader of the Opposition advocated. On a twisted and misrepresented version of the statement of the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister huilt more than half of bis eloquent speech. Bereft of argument, devoid of any reasons to justify tbe policy of his Government, and unable to stand up to tbe statements that bave been made by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), tbe Prime Minister resorted to scandalous misrepresentation and used the lowest tricks in debate. He descended to the most miserable behaviour that could be imagined in any Parliament in the world.",82,Oppositiokt Members Hear Hear
212,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [10.0],"The Prime Minister reviewed thc part of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition that dealt with the flood of imports and the import restrictions that this Government had imposed. In another spectacular misrepresentation, the right honourable gentleman said that the Leader of the Opposition had advocated discrimination among the nations. What the Leader of the Opposition did say was that the Government had imposed savage import restrictions which had done grave harm to the countries concerned. He said, moreover, that the restrictions had done great harm to our kinsfolk in Britain, with whom we have worked and fought and who in fact provide our best market for primary products at this time and will do so for as far ahead as we can see. That statement was misrepresented savagely by the Prime Minister, who claimed that the Leader of the Opposition had said that Australia should pursue a discriminatory policy.in conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On those two items the Prime Minister based the whole of an oratorical effort which was designed to impress the people. But the Australian people are a little tired of the eloquent speeches that fall from the lips of the Prime Ministers. They are demanding that something more than eloquence should be our shield in Australia's hour of crisis. The Opposition again invites the Prime Minister to use his great gift of oratory on the public platforms of Australia. We challenge him to repeat from those platforms the story that he has told the Parliament to-night. If he will use his oratory again in that way, he will discover how little the Australian electors are impressed to-day by the type of speech that he has delivered to-night. The Prime Minister asked what the Labour party would do in tbe face of a. flood of imports. Would it bave acted earlier or before the tide flowed so strongly ? That is what any sensible people would do. According to tbe right bonorable gentleman, action sbould not be taken until the point of bankruptcy is reached. He suggested that one sbould not move to alleviate a forthcoming bankruptcy. In his view, wben tbe creditors stand at tbe doors demanding payment for their goods, tben and only tben can tbe Government take any action to protect tbe Australian people, develop this country and provide for tbe security of its future. While tbe Prime Minister made one of his usual fine oratorical efforts, he devoted more than half of his speech to a deliberate misrepresentation of tbe Leader of tbe Opposition, on wbich he based the whole of his case. For that reason his case falls completely to tbe ground. I bave not only my bearing to substantiate my charge. I read from tbe notes of tbe Leader of the Opposition as follows:Tlic Premiers' proposals as to loans for works programmes should be accepted by the Commonwealth and a vigorous attempt made to carry them out. The Premiers, as members of tbe governments closest to tbe Australian people, and with a clear realization of the works that require to be done immediately for development and defence, submitted a proposition to the Loan Council. After some discussion, tbey adjusted their requests downwards, not because they could not use the money or because tbere were not works to be undertaken, but because they accepted the view that was put forward by the Australian Government that they should cut tbe demands that tbey were making as far as tbey could cut them. Tbat is what the Leader of tbe Opposition said in effect. The Government should take tbe adjusted programme that the Premiers suggested as the basis for the works that they want to be done, and wbich tbey would be capable of doing. The Leader of thc Opposition put tbe position clearly wben he saidFor this purpose a stable loan rate is absolutely essential, but above all and more important than the rate, public confidence is required. By the fullest implication, he stated that the Australian loan market could yield, by normal process of dealing, tbe money that is required if this Government will only bring about some measure of confidence. In my view it has deliberately destroyed confidence. I believe that the Prime Minister's effort was a scandalous one. I wish that he had remained in the chamber to hear these remarks. There is no justification for the speech that he has just delivered. It 'might well be classed as sabotage of the State governments. An arrogant gentleman, such as the Prinie Minister is, would perhaps rather see the States fail in their effort than see his judgment proved wrong when appeals are made to the country. So he has said to the electors in effect, "" The Loan Council was wrong. The Premiers of Australia were wrong. OnlyI , the Prime Minister, residing in the magnificent seclusion of the guarded Lodge in Canberra, can tell you what you want and what you ought to do"". Possibly it was a deliberate attempt to ensure that the States do not get what they believe to be essential. By misrepresenting tbe facts, tbe Prime Minister bas endeavoured to counter the attack that has been launched upon bis Government by tbe Opposition. He bas said that an amendment of the kind now before the House is usually supposed to precipitate a crisis. The Opposition has submitted its amendment because events in Australia are rapidly moving towards an actual crisis. In tbe brief space of time that this Government has been in ofiice it has ruined the Australian overseas funds position, it has made a sorry mess of our financial position at bome, it bas wrecked tbe Australian loan market and caused untold losses of money to thousands of small investors throughout the country, and it has rendered futile tbe work of organizations, such as tbe Loan Council. Worse still, it has brought the Australian people into a state of complete confusion. Erstwhile supporters of tbe Government in tbe community say quite frankly that they would gladly make additional sacrifices if tbe Government would only make a definite and clear pronouncement on its financial policy. Business men wbo voted for Government candidates at the last election say that because they do not know where tbe Government is going they will not again vote for it. Wben tbe Government was elected to securities. Now we, learn from press office it made two decisions from wbich reports that Commonwealth representamany of our troubles flow. It discussed tives at the meeting of the Loan Council openly the proposal to appreciate tbe had discussed tbe fixing of a still Australian £1 in relation to sterling. The higher rate of interest. This would result that any intelligent person would depreciate tbe value of investments in have expected followed those discussions. Mr Tom Burke. A flood of investment money poured into this country. Later, tbe fall in wool prices and the need to make heavy imports forced tbe Government to abandon that proposal, and overseas investors realized that there was no prospect of the realization of tbeir expectations. Tbe Australian economy quickly went haywire and overseas investors rapidly repatriated their money to save themselves from loss. ' This movement, added to the deficit on trade, caused tbe near-crisis. Next, tbe Government openly discussed the possibility of increasing interest rates. It is an old outworn economic theory that increases of tbe rate of interest tend to reduce the borrowings of governments, corporations and municipal and other public authorities. Again, tbe inevitable happened. Many small investors wbo trusted tbe Government because they bad experienced tbe wise administration of Labour governments during the critical days of the war, still continued to invest tbeir money in government bonds; but wiser investors, who had interpreted tbe signs, refused to do so because they knew that if interest rates were raised tbeir investments in government loans would depreciate. The Treasurer, deliberately inspired by bis wealthy backers, and no doubt urged on by bis colleagues, decided to force tbe issue. Using as an excuse the apparent weakening of government securities on the loan market, be issued a loan of 3£ per cent, at £99, clearly indicating to wise investors that the Government contemplated an increase of tbe rates of interest on future loans. Tbe loan was over-subscribed. Tbe interest rate for tbe following loan was increased to 3f per cent., an action that brougbt about a situation for wbich tbe Treasurer and the Government might well be impeached. Tbe right honourable gentleman urged investors to convert their holdings in an earlier loan to the new loan wbich carried tbe lower rate of interest. Many did so, believing that tbe Government would protect tbe value of tbeir the loan that had just been issued. raising. interest rates/ My charge against the Government of Treasurer bad said that tbe decision having deliberately forced up the rate to increase the rate of interest to of interest is supported by the statement 3J per cent, had been made, not bewhich is reported to have been made cause the Government feared that tbe by a Government mysterious person who emerges when loan floated at a lower rate of interest, Ministers who make pronouncements on but because tbe higher interest rate would behalf of the Government are unwilling act as a. check oh inflation hy discouraging to disclose their names-that the loan borrowing. that' had been issued at 3f per cent, was merely designed to test the market.

215,Mr Adermann (Fisher) [10.20],"the Government's action in freezing certain deposits that are held by tbe Commonwealth Bank.. Tbeir statements in that respect closely resembled tbe views that are expressed in tbe leading article in to-day's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Tbat journal claimed, in effect, that every application that was made to the Capital Issues Board, regardless of the kind of business for wbich credit was required, sbould be granted. However, the purpose and duty of tbe board, acting on behalf of the Government and witbin Government policy, is to ensure that advances are made in respect of essential industries only. The Leader of the Opposition said that if prices were stabilized, wages would not continue to rise. I point out that tbe prices of all primary products are fixed only after all tbe costs pertaining to tbeir production have been taken into consideration, that is, after crops bave been grown and harvested. Under the present system tbe primary producer is the last to receive bis rightful due. He is not compensated until considerably later in respect of the quarterly increases of wages that he incurs in harvesting his crops. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition was again advocating Labour's policy of cheap food for city dwellers at the expense of primary producers. Tbat is one reason why Australia is now short of foodstuffs. Members of the Opposition bave claimed that tbe poor response to recent loans bas revealed a lack of confidence on tbe part of investors in tbe Government. This Government is tbe only one of tbe seven governments in this country that has lived witbin its revenue' and has not gone on tbe loan market to raise money for its own purposes. Indeed, it bas been so generous as to agree that all loan raisings should be made available to the States. Therefore, if tbere is any lack of confidence on tbe part of investors in government loans it is due to the policies of tbe States as they have been revealed in the purposes for wbicb the States expend such moneys. One cannot wonder at tbe outlook of tbe investor in that respect. Tbe Queensland Government is using portion of the loan moneys it obtains to promote socialistic enterprises sucb as that at Peak Downs, whilst the New South ""Wales Government Mr Adermann. proposes to expend £3,500,000 for tbe purpose of nationalising the Balmain electricity undertaking. Similarly, the Victorian Government is expending millions in nationalizing certain undertakings. Honourable members opposite, instead of indulging in misrepresentation of this Government for party political purposes, could more appropriately apply their criticism to tbe financial policies of the States wbicb, in fact, are the cause of any lack of confidence on the part of tbe investing public in government loans. This Government, bas treated tbe States most generously in its endeavours to help tbem to obtain their financial requirements. Repeatedly, the Premier of Queensland and the ex-Premier of New South Wales bave made statements, knowing them to be untrue, to the effect, that the Commonwealth bas restricted advances to tbe States. Tbe Commonwealth makes advances to the States under three heads. Last year, this Government increased loan allocations to the States by £60,000,000, advances to tbe States from Commonwealth revenue by £31,000,000 and advances to the States under the Federal Aid Works and Roads Agreement by £7,000,000. This year, tbe States will receive from the Commonwealth under all headings approximately £100,000,000 more than tbey received from it last year. In order to help the States to obtain tbeir financial requirements, tbe Australian Government bore the ignominy of increasing taxes, because it realized that the States bad to undertake certain essential works. The Leader of tbe Opposition said that tbe Commonwealth sbould agree to tbe proposal of the States for the raising of £247,000,000 on tbe loan market for State works. The Government has told the States, in effect, "" The loan money for wbich you have asked is not available, but we sball help you to tbe limit of our ability to obtain your requirements. The whole of the loan moneys raised .during the next financial year will be allotted to you Where are the States to raise all tbe moneys for wbicb tbey have asked ? That question was pertinently directed by tbe Prime Minister to the Leader of tbe Opposition and his supporters. Let them answer Lt. Do they expect the Government to increase taxes in order to meet the requirements of the States? Do they advocate the issue of central bank credit, despite the resultant aggravation of the inflationary conditions? Can we have any confidence in the State governments after the way in which they have handled this matter? The Premiers, who have repaid the generosity of this Government with lying abuse, have not used all the loan funds that have been made available to them during this financial year. The Leader of the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament has stated that, during the last four years, the Queensland Government has underspent its loan allocations by £12,000,000. That fact is evidence that, the loan allocations made to Queensland have been most generous. An amount of £23,000,000 was allotted to it in this financial year, and less than £13,000,000 was spent in the first eight months. However, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Gair, has closed the electrical works ostensibly because of lack of funds, but really for the Enterprise upon wbich approximately purposes of party political propaganda. He has made a lying statement in that respect, because he has ample loan money available. In fact, he has more than £12,000,000 of the £23,000,000 that has been allocated to Queensland in the current financial year. He has criticized this Government on the ground that it has restricted the loan allocations of the States. I contend that the States should face up to their responsibilities. That remark prompts me to say that government without the responsibility for imposing taxes is farcical. That statement is not necessarily a reflection of the Goadvocate that land sbould be resumed vernment's opinion. If the present system is to be preserved under which State governments are not responsible to the electors for the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of their revenues, the sooner the State Governments are abolished the better it will be; failing that, tbe Commonwealtb should return to the States the power to impose income tux, and let tbem bear tbe odium of levying taxes. The Queensland Government, wbicb State, for making land available to proshas received a generous allocation of loan pective settlers, and, as I have stated, funds, is not co-operating with tbe Commonwealth to increase tbe production of essential goods and commodities. All bonorable members in this House agree that increased production would be a counter to the present inflationary conditions, but, unfortunately, the Commonwealth is not receiving tbe co-operation of the Queensland Government and of certain other State governments in its anti-inflationary campaign. The responsibility for production rests primarily with tbe States, because they administer their various departments of agriculture, land and transpoi't. I believe -that tbe House will agree witb me wben I say that the best way in wbich to obtain increased production is to establish more farms and put more farmers on tbe land. Tbe Lands Departments of the States are responsible for making additional land available for production. Ample land is available in Queensland for that purpose, yet tbe State Government bas purchased huge stations, wbich are suitable for subdivision for closer settlement, and bas engaged in a socialist £600,000 has been lost to date. In the process, no appreciable additional quantities of food bave been produced. It is said that the socialist enterprise is to go out of existence, and, of course, tbe taxpayers would be called upon to bear the loss. Is it not preferable to have 20, 50 or 100 farms conducted on a profitable basis rather than to persist in sucb socialist enterprises? All that tbe Queensland Government has to show for its expenditure is a socialist failure. I put that challenge to the Queensland Government. I do not from tbe present holders, or recommend a repetition of the resumption of land by State governments at tbe values whicb ruled in 1942. Tbe States should proceed witb land settlement in a common sense way and, by mutual arrangement with tbe owners, they sbould purchase suitable lands, subdivide tbem and make tbem available to land-hungry people. ""Whenever a ballot is held for land in Queensland, approximately 600 persons participate in it. Queensland is responsible, as a more farms and more farmers provide the best way in which to increase production. The State Departments of Agriculture, which have important responsibilities, are doing a good job. It is their duty to induce primary producers to grow the proper commodities. I have no particular criticism to voice of the QueensOpposition, as enunciated by tbe honorland Department of Agriculture. Transport is another matter. The transport systems of Queensland and New South Wales have many deficiencies. When a crop of reasonable size is grown, the railways are unable to move it to the markets. Queensland has railway rolling stock of 1914 vintage, and the wheat harvest cannot be transported to the market in a satisfactory time. This Government has endeavoured to improve the transport position in the States by increasing their allocations under the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Act. The decision whether to support the motion, or the amendment to it, whilst it is a responsible one, is easy to make, because this Government, by its actions, will establish confidence throughout the country, as every section of the community recognizes that its rights will be fully preserved for the future and, in consequence, the value of its assets will be enhanced. I believe that this Government has adopted a wise course. It is taking measures which mark it as a Government of courage, because it is an act of courage to face resolutely the responment's failure. An admission of failure sibilities that now confront it. We have a choice between a government of courage and a party without stamina to declare its attitude on this economic crisis. We have a government of action and of principle versus a party of irresponsibility and misrepresentation. in which Ave find ourselves to-day. HowWe have a government that has a policy of moderate financial restriction, in accordance with which finance is directed into the more essential industries versus a party that stands for the nationalization of banking. We have a government of freedom and of free living versus a party that advocates socialization and State controls. We have a government that'believes in the admission of imports which are urgently required for the Mr Adermann. strengthening of the national economy versus a party that is indeterminate in its decisions. One day, the Opposition opposes import restrictions, and another day it advocates a reduction of imports. I support the financial statement of the Treasurer most heartily I certainly cannot support the policy of the able member for Fremantle, who advocates the continuation of economic controls and the re-introduction of tbe rationing of petrol, butter, tea and other commodities. The bonorable gentleman believes in tbe Colin Clark negative policy. Clark advocates that Australians should eat less so that we may export more. Sucb a policy is a purely negative approach to our problems. Finally, I desire to correct tbe statement of the bonorable member for Fremantle about tbe importation of machinery foi productive purposes. He said that Australia bas not obtained from England a satisfactory proportion of machinery compared with other imports. Obviously, the honourable gentleman has no knowledge of tbe kind of machinery required for productive purposes in this country because we bave secured from England all the machinery of tbe right type that was available able member's time bas expired. requires no fulminations from the Opposition to express the present Governhas characterized every ministerial speech from the dismal diatribe of the Treasurer the ( Sir Arthur Fadden) about tbe long, hard road ahead, to tbe statement of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) about the sorry economic plight ever, regardless of anything that may be said in this House, the facts speak for themselves. What are tbe facts? Tbe Mcnsies Administration has, been in office for two and a half years. The Fifteenth Security Loan closed only fourteen days ago, yet to-day, £100 bonds issued in connection witb it are quoted at £96 10s. Yet the Government is asking bow money can be provided! Obviously no government",86,Eaele P^Ge Th E Six State Of That Loan Were Determined By Tbe States

217,Mr Keon (Yarra) [10.40],"I tin which the people have lost confidence to such a degree that £100 bonds issued fourteen days ago are now worth £96 10s. can possibly hope to raise adequate funds. In fact, it is going to be most difficult to carry out even the moderate loan programme agreed to by the Loan Council. Therefore, the first indictment of the Government, and the most telling of all, is that it has lost the confidence of the investing public,' and no more crushing condemnation could be made of any government. I come now to the position of industry and commerce. To-day the industrial and commercial world is so plagued by uncertainty and distracted by controls and violent fluctuations of policy, that it is impossible for the directors of any organization to plan ahead with any degree of confidence. On one day we havefloodsof imports, encouraged by the Government, and on the next, we have rigid import restrictions. How can business organizations and the general public be expected to have confidence in the Government when panic action of this kind is taken 1 The second indictment of the Government, therefore, is that industry and commerce, as well as the investing public, have lost confidence in it. What is the position of the wage earner? vanishing. He is caught up in the never ending wage-prices spiral which even honourable members opposite must admit has increased tremendously since this Government took office. Witb diminishing opportunities, overtime earnings have dropped, and, in addition, many working men have round their necks a heavy loan of time payment commitments for bouses, furniture, &c, that tbey cannot possibly hope to meet. Let us look now at the developmental aspect of tbe situation. Irrigation projects bave been held up or abandoned entirely. Vital hydro-electric undertakings are not being proceeded witb or are being continued at a restricted pace because money is not available or because the States cannot obtain the necessary resources. Then we come to the most important activity of all, the production of the basic wealth of the Commonwealth. I refer, into tbe details of the misdeeds of tbe of course, to primary production, upon Government, but let me turn to one matter wbich we depend so much for our export trade. Wbat is tbe position tbere? The output of most primary products per capita of the population is at tbe lowest ebb in history. Production must be measured on a population basis. One Minister cited certain pre-war production figures and showed that present-day totals were higher, but unless such figures are related to the population, a true picture is not obtained. On a population basis, since this Government took office two and a half years ago, tbere bas been a catastrophic decline in tbe output of almost every primary industry. Tbat, I believe, is a most serious indictment of the Government because, provided that basic wealth is being produced, particularly from tbe soil, even a government as bad as that now inoffice must find great difficulty in messing up the economy. Unfortunately, since the advent of the Menzies Administration, the farming community has been hectored, distracted, badgered, lectured, controlled, taxed and given no encouragement by the Government. The result is the present crisis. What is the Government's answer to this problem? Tbe Minister for Commerce and Agriculture called a meeting of tbe Australian Agricultural. Council, fixed a five-year His purchasing power is production target and gave us to understand that tbe whole problem bad been solved merely because certain figures bave been written down. Everybody knows, of course, that basic agricultural requirements are being neglected. It is clear, then, that amongst investors, industrialists, business people, wage-earners and primary producers confidence in this Government is completely lacking. The Chifley Government relinquished office in 1949 leaving a nation that was stable, confident, optimistic, and looking forward to the most, important developmental period in its history. Now, in 1952, we find a nation that is uncertain, pessimistic, assailed by fears, frustrated in all its attempts to make the progress that was thought possible only a few years ago, and dishonoured both at home and abroad by repudiated promises. Time does not permit me to go fully that waa mentioned by tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) wben be took a few minutes off from abusing tbe Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). Apparently the right bonorable gentleman believed that if be could abuse the Leader of tbe Opposition sufficiently, that would be an adequate answer to the. indictments that have been levelled against tbe Government. He made no attempt to deal witb one of tbe most crucial problems now confronting this country, wbich is our declinto help the sterling bloc. Tbey have not ing overseas balances. Tbe Treasurer stated that, on tbe 30th June last, Australia's international reserves stood at £S40,000,000. Because, they were likely to be less than £300,000,000 by the 30th June next, panic import restrictions were imposed. At any time prior to 1942, if our overseas balances amounted to £50,000,000 we considered ourselves to be well off. In fact, in some years we had adverse overseas balances. Only in the last few years bave our overseas credits exceeded £100,000,000. because there was a likelihood that the total would be reduced to £300,000,000, wbicb, prior to tbe contribution made by last year's wool cheque, would always have been considered a handsome total, the Government panicked and introduced import restrictions without taking intq account the importance of certain imports to our economy. Had it not been for the tremendous increase of wool prices wbich knocked our wool income up from £200,000,000 to £600,000,000, our overseas balances would now have totalled only £4.00,000,000. I do not know what the Government would bave done in that event. It seems to me quite obvious that the restrictions were imposed as tbe result sterling bloc. of a direction or an invitation-which ever way one likes to put it-fro m tbe conference of Britisb Oommonwealth finance Ministers held in London in January of this year, and attended by tbe Treasurer of this country. ""We bad an exact repetition of the events that took place after Sir Otto Niemeyer and company had told Australians on anotber occasion that tbey must tighten their belts. Overseas £300,000,000 have always been considered to be ample for Australia's _ requirements for any foreseeable period, Mr Keon. Nevertheless savage import restrictions such as bave never been imposed previously, either in war or in peace, were suddenly clamped upon tbe Australian people. I bave no doubt whatever that now, as in tbe past, Australia has been made the whipping boy for the sterling bloc. Just as we are expected to provide cheap meat, butter and other foods under contract, so now we are expected to suffer tbese import restrictions in order been imposed in tbe interests of tbe Australian people. ""We should do our best to assist the sterling bloc, and Great Britain in particular, but we are entitled to demand that any action the Government contemplates in order to provide such assistance shall be referred to the Parliament and debated bere witb all tbe facts available to every bonorable member so that we may understand exactly what we are asked to do. Although tbe Treasurer bas been asked on many occaYet, merely sions to state frankly whether he was invited at the finance Ministers' conference to impose tbe import restrictions, be carefully skirted the question in his statement. He neither denied nor affirmed that such an invitation had been issued. But any intelligent person who is aware that Australia's overseas balances amount to £300,000,000 must come to the conclusion that tbese vicious cuts, wbich will have a severe effect on our economy, must bave been imposed for reasons other than tbose that were mentioned by the Treasurer. The clear truth is that tbe Australian economy bas been called upon once more to make special sacrifices in tbe interests of the If the Prime Minister were to ask the members of tbe Australian Labour party what tbey would do in the situation that bas been outlined, the answer obviously would be that tbey would consider Australia's interests first and that, if tbey bad to restrict imports, the restrictions would not be of tbe savage, unexpected overall nature of tbose that this Government bas enforced. A Labour governreserves amounting to ment would impose restrictions, for example, on some of tbe trash that is imported into this country, sucb as rubbishy so-called comics. Perhaps it would tell the newspaper proprietors that they must use a great deal less newsprint than tliey now use in order to assault the intelligence of the community. A Labour government would not restrict imports of a kind that would provide for the further development of our economy. Hut this Government has made no distinction between commodities that would help us to increase our export trade and assist our primary industries and the sort of rubbish that is imported at a cost of millions of pounds annually. Anybody wbo Wants further information about the policy that a Labour government would pursue in tbe present situation sbould study the record of Labour on previous occasions wben controls were necessary. Sucb controls were instituted only after nil relevant circumstances bad been carefully examined. Essential goods were always permitted to enter the country and only non-essential goods were restricted or banned. Having dealt witb the one matter that vvas discussed by tbe Prime Minister, I have only sufficient time left to enable me to deal briefly witb some of tbe excuses that were advanced by Ministers after tbey had admitted that tbe Australian economy was in an unholy mess. Tbeir first excuse was that the Labour Government bad left tbe economy in sucb an appalling state that nothing else could be expected. They spoke as though they had assumed office only yesterday. They apparently ignored tbe fact that tbey bad been in power for two and a half years; that, bad a double dissolution not intervened, the Government's normal term of office would have expired in August of this year; and that, in that event, tbey and tbeir colleagues would have been forced to go to tbe people at a general election and render an account of tbeir stewardship. Ministers have spoken as though tbey have had no opportunity to do anything about tbe decline in production or the waning confidence of tbe investing public in Government loans. Tbe statements that they bave made about tbe condition in which tbe Labour Government left tbe country are not true because tbe bond market, for instance, was extremely buoyant when the change of government occurred. Every government loan bad been over-subscribed up to that date. But, even if their statements were true, surely it would not be unreasonable to expect that, after two and a half years in office, tbey would have been able to effect some improvement of the economic situation. ""What is tbe present situation? In respect of finance, it is becoming worse daily. In respect of taxation, it is becoming worse with every budget. In respect of industry, commerce and primary production, it is becoming worse all tbe time. When we turn to those developmental projects that the Labour Government either bad started or bad planned, we find that progress is being made at a much slower pace than formerly if, indeed any progress at all is being made. Thus, although this Government has been in power for a complete term, it cannot show bow it bas improved the economic situation in any way. Tbe other excuse that Ministers bave offered is that everything would bave been all right but for the outbreak of war in Korea. Apparently tbey do not realize that, wben tbe Labour party was in office, there was war in Indo-China and Malaya and that tbere had been many threatening international incidents, such as that whicb led to the Berlin air lift. "" Uncle Joe"" did not worry tbem until hostilities commenced in Korea, but be was a bad boy long before tben. Tbe international situation was just as dangerous wben Labour was in office as it is to-day. Tbere were wars all over tbe globe. Nobody wbo could claim tbe right to govern the nation could honestly suggest that be did not appreciate tbe necessity for costly defence preparations at the time wben this Government took office. Tet, even if we accepted tbe Government's excuses on that score, tbe loss of confidence by tbe investing public remains unexplained. Usually wben we are at war, or wben international danger involves tbe nation in severe defence commitments, tbe patriotism of tbe people outweighs all other considerations and loans are generously over-subscribed. But that has not happened, and therefore the Government cannot advance a defence excuse in relation to finance. Likewise such an excuse does not apply to the introduction of import restrictions. I should like to hear how defence requirements could possibly necessitate sucb controls because tbey have been imposed upon items that are vital to defence witb tbe same impartiality as tbey bave been applied to raspberries in champagne and other expensive luxuries that we have seen in the sbops of Melbourne and Sydney in recent months. No reasonable person would suggest that defence requirements could bave affected in any but a minor way tbe Government's decision to restrict imports. Can any honourable member on the Government side of tbe chamber explain bow tbe military programme, through the calling up of trainees or othersigned ? wise, bas been responsible for the catastrophic decline of primary production since this Government took office? Could such an excuse bold water? Of course not! On tbe admission of the Government, honourable gentleman said that everythe nation to-day finds itself in a sorry body knew before tbe Korean war economic condition, plagued by doubts and occurred that we sbould bave a lot of uncertainty for tbe future. But the only trouble witb Russia. If that be so, why excuses that it has been able to offer for did the Chifley Government disarm Aushaving allowed this serious situation to tralia, sell all our munitions and defence develop are, first, that the Labour Governequipment, and leave tbe country pracment left tbe country in a state of ecotically defenceless? nomic disorder; and, secondly, that defence requirements have overshadowed kind. all other considerations. Both of tbese excuses fall to tbe ground under examination. Therefore, I was not astonished had practically no defences then. when only anaemic "" hear, hears"" applauded tbe Prime Minister when he ended his speech to-nigbt.

The democratic nations feel that if tbey do not develop their defences tbey will be unable to prevent a third world war. Tbey bave decided that if tbey arm themselves to such a degree that Bussia will be deterred from taking aggressive action -'against therm, we may be saved all the horrors of another world war.

Tbe problems to wbich I bave referred are inextricably associated witb internal problems. Tbere is Communist sabotage of our industrial activities. At the present time, Communist sabotage is preventing the despatch overseas of 500,000 cases of Tasmanian apples, 30,000 of whicb are destined for Sweden, wbich is a bard currency area. Biit we hear no words of protest about that from members of the criticize what the Government is doing.

A Labour government in Great Britain began the campaign fo build up tbe defences of tbe democracies, in wbicb we bave joined'. Great Britain is now expending approximately £4,800,000,000 in three years upon armaments. The British Government has asked us to discuss with it tbe problem of maintaining the solvency of the sterling bloc.

244,Sir Earle Page,"TJ p to tbe presentitinerant Foreign Minister did great damage to onr relations with America, and that this wbich are the envy of practically every harmful discordance has been transformed into a mutually benelicial alliance by the present Government. That is the position as seen by people outside this Parliament ""who have waited in vain during this dehate for any result from that particular statement. Unfortunately they have not obtained a result. The position in Australia at tbe present time, and indeed the world position, is such that we should eschew tbe carping -criticism that bas been uttered in connection witb this matter and see whether we can pull together in an endeavour to get the whole of the free world out of its difficulties, because, as I have said, the bankruptcy of the sterling area or of Great Britain would have a tremendous effect not only on Australia but also on the whole world. SoI appeal for constructive co-operation by tbe Opposition, by all the governments of Australia and, in fact, by all parties, organizations and sections of the community, sucb as we bad during the last war. An examination of tlie budget shows that the amount that we are raising out of revenue to pay for defence services is £20,000,000 more than the highest amount that we raised out of revenue for any defence works or defence activities during the worse days of tbe war in 1942 and 1943. ""We also find that to-day this Government, as a result of the action that the Labour Government took when it was in office in connection with uniform taxation, bas bad to budget for an expenditure of about £469,000,000 in order to cover £155,000,000 worth of State works for wbicb tbe States cannot raise themselves loans, £120,000,000 for Commonwealtb works and £187,000,000 for defence commitments. Tbose sums are in addition to tax reimbursements amounting to about £120,000,000 that were paid to tbe States under the uniform taxation, formula. We are raising out of revenue for tbese purposes practically as much as we were raising.by both revenue and loans for our defence commitments in the worse days of tbe war. SoI repeat that the time has come for us to pull together and use the machinery for co-operation that we have created in this"" country, such as the Loan Council, and tbe Australian Agricultural Council, other federation in tbe world, because of the smoothness that tbey bring to the handling of national problems. Honourable members opposite may laugh at that statement, but visitors from India have spoken to me on this matter in terms of envy. Canada established a royal commission to investigate the introduction of similar systems as tbe Loan Council. However, the Opposition of tbe provincial governments of Canada defeated tbe proposal. Tbe Bruce-Page Government established the Loan Council despite the opposition of the Labour party. It went to the people on tbe matter by way of referendum, and its proposals were carried by a majority of four to one in every State. Even when tbe people bad made their wishes known by referendum the Labour Opposition tried to prevent the passage of the enabling bill. We sbould make certain that the Loan Council is able to work as it did about ten years ago, wben the representatives of the various governments that form the council dealt witb matters of finance without bitterness or beat. The present position bas developed as a result of tbe uniform taxation policy, wbich relieves the States of the responsibility for raising a great part of tbe revenues that tbey expend. We have got to tbe stage now at wbich the Australian Government bas to raise tremendous sums of money to enable tbe public works of this country to be carried on. We cannot continue to raise out of revenue amounts of £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 to carry out capital works that will be of value to the people of Australia for at least a whole generation. The whole world is sick, and Australia is sick witb it, just as any part of a body is sick wben other parts of it are sick. Unfortunately, post-war inflation, wbich is one of our main causes of distress, bas been aggravated by tbe necessity to divert a large proportion of our resources to defence, that necessity having arisen as a result of mistakes that were made by Labour administrations, wbich bave prevented us from having tbe nation now in tbe desired state of preparedness. I well remember that in tbe 1920's tbe Labour party made continual attacks in this Parliament against our immigration policy at a time when we had an opportunity to bring in hundreds of thousands of British immigrants. ""We did, however, succeed in bringing in 1,000,000 Britisb immigrants during that .period. We bad to meet, not only active resistance against our immigration policy by tbe Labour party in this Parliament, but also passive resistance from many trade unions. We lost tbe chance then to bring in huge numbers of immigrants. Now we bave anotber chance to develop our population so that we shall be strong enough to face our potential enemies, but are prevented from carrying out much of our defence policy because of the actions of Labour governments in the past. Tbe first thing that the Scullin Labour Government did when it came into office was to abolish tlie development and immigration agreement that we bad witb Great Britain under which we were to receive a loan of £34,000,000 from Great Britain at a time when we were lamentably short of funds. The Britisb Government was to pay half the interest on that loan, tbe Commonwealth and the States to be responsible for the other half for tbe first ten years, after whicb tbe States were to assume the whole responsibilityBecause of that action of the Scullin Government several big undertakings which would have been as valuable as tbe Wyangala Dam bad to be abandoned in face .of the remonstrances of tbe Britisb Government. honourable gentleman's time bas expired.

If any honourable memher called "" No"" it is his duty to vote with the ""Noes"". A number of Government supporters Ii aving crossed to the "" No"" side, state the question, Mr Speaker. There appears to be some confusion. fusion, it is not in my mind. The question was clearly put. Both ""Ayes"" and "" Noes"" were called. I gave a decision for the ""Noes"", and if it is the wish of the HouseI shall put the question again. tlie time for a division has expired and the tellers have been nominated, at that stage the decision of the House cannot be altered.

Because they have done so I have no doubt that they w ill be able to provide from some other location all the clothing which the coal-miners in that district require. I remind the honourable gentleman that a considerable time ago, during tiie term of office of a previous government, the d r ill hall at K u r r i K u r r i was not required for army purposes and was made available for the manufacture of clothing.

271,Mr Ebic J. Habbison,"The Ministersame time, we knew of the Indian Government's difficulties in making adequate supplies of cotton goods available to normal export markets. At the close of last year it became apparent that the supply of textiles in Australia was overtaking uie demand. Accordingly, the Indian authorities were informed that Australia was able to relinquish most of the quota of cotton piece-goods that had heen provided by India to meet our earlier anticipated governmental requirements. In addition the trade was approached by my department with the object of determining to what extent we could relieve the Indian Government from their obligation to release for export our quota for civilian use. The position now is that, because Australian importers did not place orders in India for cotton piece-goods and cotton yarn to the extent anticipated when tlie. trade arrangement was negotiated, the Indian Government, after consultation with the Australian Government, has removed the former provision for a stipulated quota of cotton piece-goods and cotton yarn for Australia. Australian importers may still participate in the overall export quotas announced by thc Indian Government, but their ability to make purchase is affected hy the import licensing measures introduced in Australia on the Sth March. 2. Australian cotton spinning and weaving mills intimated that they were holding substantial stocks and, in the absence of sales, were forced to .'curtail production. The deterioration in the cotton textiles trade is not confined to Australia but is world-wide, and the rapid decline in the trade during the first quarter'of this calendar year has led to thc increasing curtailment of production in many countries. The situation is manifest in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, the United States of America, and even in Japan where the Japanese Government has advised cotton spinners to reduce production to 60 per. cent, of capacity over the next quarter. During the debate on the adjournment moved by the honourable member for Burke on Thursday, the 28th February, Ministers acknowledged thc concern of the Government at the position which hod overtaken the Australian cotton spinning and weaving industries. It was then explained that this was the result of developments abroad leading to the unexpected fulfilment of outstanding orders plared overseas by importers at a time when Australian manufacturers were unable to cope with the demand. The House was also told of the Government's measures to relieve the position, including the placing of defence orders in Australia to help tide over the period of adjustment'. The import licensing measures which were brought in recently for currency and balance of payment -reasons have, incidentally, increased the protection against overseas competition In theadministration of these measures, moreover, the Government will aim to ensure that essential supplies of imported raw materials are available to the cotton spinning and weaving industries. 3.
