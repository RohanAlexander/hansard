Last Week, When The Seat Of Government Bill Was Being Dis","cussed, and the honourable membeT. for Hume was speaking, I . interjected that a statement had appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that the honourable member had said that he preferred Lyndhurst to the southern sites. His reply was that that was not so; but I am now able to read to the House the absolute words of the statement to which I have referred. It occurs in a letter written to the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th April, 1904, by the Rev. H . D. Seely-Vidal, a Church of England clergyman, residing at Carcoar, in New South Wales, and is as .follows: Ere going on board the special train at Lyndhurst, when the subject of the possible sites was being discussed, I heard Sir William Lyne dis. tincliy say, in the presence of several others, that he, personally speaking, considered Lyndhurst the most eligible site, but that South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania would outvote the other States, and keep the site down south. then spoke to Sir William, and said"" Look .here, Sir William, you throw all the weight of your influence on to the side of Lyndhurst, and we will chance South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania outvoting it .

The figures were challenged at the time by the honourable member for Gippsland. As I then explained, T had received them only the night before, so that I had not had time to digest them. On referring to them again, I find that my statement of the total production was correct, but that my statement as to the local consumption was incorrect, because, instead of the line relating to local consumption, I read a line relating to population.

Wales. of Home Affairs) -The ballot which has just Keen taken leaves the wording of the clause now under consideration very much as it stands. The Government have stated throughout the discussion that it was their intention to narrow down the locality to much more restrictive limits than a radius of fifty miles. A radius of fifty miles would include two or threesites which have been suggested. But the important sites in the South-Eastern District are Bombala and Dalgety. I understand that the majority of honourable members who voted for a site in the South-Eastern District are in favour of the Dalgety site. order that we may obtain an expression of opinion which will be more definite than the clause at present contains. I think that it would be better for me to move the .omission of all the words from "" within"" to ""Bombala,"" with a view of inserting the words ""twenty-five miles from Dalgety."" give us a sufficient margin to enable the best, site within that district to be selected. It would exclude Bombala and a number of towns which, it is generally agreed, it would not be desirable to select. If the course which I suggest is adopted, it will be understood as an instruction to the Government to obtain a site within a reasonable distance of Dalgety. That, I believe, is what is generally desired. I therefore move That the following words be l e f t out :"" that amended, exclude all possibility of the portion of New South Wales bounded on the north by a direct line running from the town of Pamterritory embracing a port.' We should bula to the town of Cooma, thence due west to the endeavour to leave the Bill as nearly as border of the State of Victoria, and within fifty possible in the state in which the Senate. miles of Bombala."" to obtain a somewhat clearer explanation of tically to make a new Bill of it. what the amendment means than I have been able to gather from the the Government is to get a nearer indicastatement of the Minister.

In amendment mean that when the area order that that may be done, we must is selected any possibility of obtaining first settle the question whether Bombala a port within the Federal Territory will be or Dalgety is to be chosen.

The words which he to the Committee that honourable members; proposes to omit are absolutely useless for should know exactly what is meant and howthe purpose for which they have been infar the proposal goes. dealt with in the next clause. The purpose 'of the clause under consideration simply is to determine the locality of the Seat of Government. The question of the territory to be chosen will be considered in connection with clause 3. Monaro) I would suggest to the Minister of Home Affairs that the better way to amend the clause in order to attain the object in view is first to settle which site is the more favoured by the Committee, Bombala or Dalgety. We should take a vote in order to elicit an expression of opinion as between In Bombala and Dalgety. If the proposal which the Minister has submitted is adopted we shall probably find ourselves blocked in the endeavour to obtain a port within the Federal area. amendment will be required in clause The radius would 3, which provides that the territory to be acquired is to be the territory mentioned in clause 2.

The proper place in which to define the territory is the next clause. fine it at all. but the words proposed to be left out are absolutely useless, and are made useless bf the subsequent provision that the Seat of Government shall be within fifty miles of Bombala. I can only account for the inconsistency of the clause by assuming that the various amendments proposed in the Senate created confusion. We are here not to fix a district, but to determine the Seat of Government. We should do that, and we should not leave it to a subsequent selection from a large area which may include several sites. the honourable member for North Sydney as to the vagueness of the clause. I desire to know something with respect to the method by which the Minister proposes to ascertain the desire of the Committee. I should like to say that Governments and Parliaments have, before now, found that it is easier to create a blank than to fill it. If we create a blank in this clause as proposed, there will be nothing to prevent that blank remaining unfilled for' ever, so far as this Committee is concerned, by a combination of supporters of two sites as against the supporters of a third. I am not saying this with any desire to secure an advantage for the site mentioned in the Bill, or the site which was selected a few minutes ago by honourable members, because neither of them is my first choice. We have had previous examples of combinations. To move that these words should be left out, with a view to insert other words, would be a .perfectly right course to pursue, in the circumstances, if we knew that, as a matter of course, the . striking out of these words would be followed by the formal insertion of the other words proposed. out, the whole question is again enlarged. I should advise the insertion of certain words first, if they could be agreed to, and we could strike out the superfluous words afterwards. desire is to secure ' f a ir play for all concerned, because, as I say, Bombala and Dalgety are by no means the objects of my primary selection in this matter. In accordance with the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, it might simplify the procedure, and assuage any fears which some honourable members may entertain of the difficulties If it is necessary to dealways liable to crop up in connection with matters of this sort, if the Minister of Home Affairs were to withdraw his present amendment, and move the insertion, after the word "" within,"" of the words "" a radius of twenty-five."" Then any honourable mem. ber, who desired to do so, could move an amendment upon the amendment, with the object of altering the word "" twenty-five"" to "" fifty,"" if that should be desired. it fifty miles in the first instance? it is absolutely ridiculous to talk of the selection of a site within a radius of fifty miles. The necessity for getting this B ill through is, that Parliament may, by some determination, indicate where it wishes the Federal Capital to be, and if we indicate a territory with a diameter of 100 miles, no one can say that we have thus indicated where the Capital should be. It might be anywhere within that vast range of country. two Governments concerned. eral Parliament should indicate its choice much more nearly than that, for the benefit of the Government. I do not say that it would be putting too much responsibility upon the Government, but it certainly would be burdening the Government to ask them to interpret the will of the House in making a selection within such an area as that to which I have referred. I think that a radius of twenty-five miles would cover the maximum range of choice which should be allowed. Even that would give a diameter of fifty miles to the circle, and I am rather inclined to agree that that is a little too much. square miles. But once these words are left range.

223,Mr Kelly,"I hope so, because onthat he should have submitted this 'proposal. I do riot propose to enter into the question of the relative merits of the sites. We have discussed that matter almost ad nauseam. Nor do I propose to follow the honourable member for Hindmarsh in his highly poetical panegyric with respect to the qualities of the almost uninhabited, region that surrounds Welaregang. ber seen Welaregang? tainly have taken advantage of the very generous offer that was made to me to induce me to visit the site, except that, not feeling in the best of 'health, I feared that it might be fatal to me to visit such an inhospitable region. I do not propose to enter into the question of the relative merits of sites. I merely rose to point out that the honourable member for Gwydir seems to have reversed his former attitude. I think that the action of the Government is perfectly correct. We have reached the stage when we should deal with particular sites within the area the House has just chosen. We are dealing with them now in the best way. But I hope that we shall do nothing to stultify ourselves, by putting the question back to its position of two years ago. the matter of the selection of the Capital Site were determined on its merits, there can be no doubt that the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir would be accepted. If we looked at this question, not from a provincial stand-point, but from a national stand-point and that is the aspect in which we should regard it I believe we should have no hesitation in selecting a site in. the locality indicated in the amendment. Constitution. It is not only literally within the Constitution, but it is within the spirit of it also, as being within New South Wales,, but not within ioo miles of Sydney. I believe that if . the natural advantages and the prospective advantages to the Federation from the selection of that site were taken into consideration, it would be looked upon by honourable members in this House, and by the members of another Chamber, as the one most suitable to contain the Federal Capital of Australia. It is upon the great Australian river. It is within a district that is practically unlimited in point of its capacity for growth. I do not believe that there is a single requirement of a great national Capital which cannot be obtained near Welaregang or Tooma. It is of easy access, not only to New South Wales, being on a great trunk line of railway; but is equally easy . of access to Victoria and to South Australia. I do not believe that if we were to estimate the relative advantages of Dalgety, and compare them with those of Tooma or Welaregang, there would be any hesitation whatever in choosing the latter site. Because what would the selection of Dalgety or Bombala mean to the VicN o , but I should certorians and South Australians? It would' mean a tremendous journey; we should have to go to Cooma, and then come back. The distance, as it appears upon the map, is not at all ' indicative of the actual distance that has to be travelled from the Southern States. There is nothing in the. interjections, we have heard, that we shall be infringing the spirit of the Constitution in choosing this site, if we do choose it. There is nothing in the objection that we shall be favouring Victoria or any other State. And though it seems almost hopeless to expect it at this' stage, I feel that we should be doing right, not only to this State, but to the whole Continent, if we were to choose the Federal Capital in the district now indicated. I cannot help expressing my surprise that I think that if so many Victorian members should differ from me in the view which they take upon this subject. I believe that from every stand-point we ought to select Welaregang. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) I do not intend to allow this matter to go to a vote without saying a few words in regard to some of the remarks which have been made. I would allude especially to an observation made, I think, by the honourable member for Wentworth as to the distance of It is strictly within the Welaregang from Sydney. I think I also heard the right honourable member for East Sydney make some such reference. First of all, I want to make it clear that New South Wales has practically decided to build a railway to this very spot. line is to be built, not in the interests of Victoria, but of New South.

246,Sir William Lyne,"Yes, and Iclimate, scenery, and country. The Government of New South Wales have of their own accord commenced to build a railway to the Upper Murray. It is fifteen years since the railway to Cooma was made, but there has not been enough good land discovered in the Dalgety district to warrant the extension of the line from Cooma to Dalgety. That is the difference between the two districts. One is a poor, stand-still district, while the other is rich and progressing. I feel that the Upper Murray site is not receiving justice at the hands of honourable members, largely because of the action of the right honourable member for Swan. line paying? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It has not been open very long, so that it is difficult to say. only half the members of the Committee But it has opened up an immense area of good wheat-growing country, which previously could not be cultivated, because of its remoteness from the railway. not pay to cart wheat from the district to the only line then existing. Germanton line has been made, however, ' a great area of land has been converted into wheat paddocks, and a very largequantity of wheat was sent from Germanton last year. the valley of the Little Billabong Creek, through the Yarra Yarra property, and then on through the very rich valley which I have described, every foot of the land through which it passes will be put under cultivation. I question, however, whether, if the railway were extended to Dalgety there would be any great increase in cultivation. the valley between the Kiandra Range and the range which falls to the coast is the driest valley on the high .table-lands in the State, and one of the driest and least productive in Australia. I refer to these facts because I feel that honourable members do not know what they are doing in the action which they are taking. It is absurd to say that it is a long distance from Sydney to the Upper Murray site, because the distance, is not long when compared with the distance to the other places which I have mentioned. ment, it is, of course, quite within order, -. and every similar amendment will be in order. If I cannot get the site which I wish for, I would vote for Lake George. When1 went there two years ago I expressed myself as not opposed to the Lake George might talk at length then, just as they site, and I should have voted for it had it may now. been favourably reported upon. I believe now, however, that it can be turned into one of thefinestsites for an inland city, because of the immense sheet of water which would be near it. I think it will be better to choose the Lake George site than to choose the site which seems likely to be chosen. WhatI chiefly regret is that two honourable members who should have been here when the ballot was taken were not here. If they had been, present the result would have been different. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I believe that one of them is. AllI ask for is a straight out vote, so that honourable members may choose fairly between the various sites. If that is done, I shall be satisfied. But I do not wish for a vote to be taken when are present. Therefore, I think it would be well if we determined to take a vote at a certain hour. I know that there is It did one honourable member who will not be here in any case; but I shall have to Since the put up with that. If , when the question has been fairly decided, the site which I advocate is not chosen, I shall be as chirpy as is the honourable member for Eden Monaro. I hope that I have not appeared As the line is taken up in bad humour because the site which I advocate has not been chosen. WhatI feel sore about is that my late colleague did not give fair play to that site. His opinion oh a matter of this kind apparently has weight with honourable members, and had he visited the site, as he was asked to do, I feel confident that his iudgment would have led him to declare it to be the best site Mr Russell's tables show that available. Many of the honourable members who visited that site had previously made up their minds to vote for Dalgety; but I believe that, with one exception, they afterwards determined to vote for Tooma. I think that the right honourable member for Swan would have .come to a similar decision. There must be something very attractive in the appearance of the district when such a change of opinion as that takes place. StillI do not wish to speak on this subject at any great length. WhatI suggest is that the vote should be taken, say, half an hour after the resumpWith regard to the amendtion of proceedings after the dinner adjournment.

That being the object of the B ill , I strongly urge upon the Committee that the question as to the area of the territory is one for negotiation. The only thing that is certain is that it is not to be less than 100 square miles. mit that the expression "" not less than 100 square miles"" permits of the acquirement of some reasonable area within the standard set up by that expression. I consider, however, that an area of 900 square miles is not reasonably within the standard of not less than 100 square miles. If this point were submitted to the High Court, I would not presume to say what its opinion would be, but if it followed the decisions relating to the use of similar expressions, which have been given in the Courts for many years past-and there are a number of authorities on the point-it would probably determine that the expression was one which admitted of an excess area, but not necessarily of an excess which was unreasonably large in reference to the standard adopted in the Constitution. The provision in the Constitution is really in-the nature of an agreement or a contract between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales. It does not follow the lines of ordinary legislation. Within the lines of ordinary legisr lation, and within our jurisdiction, our laws are omnipotent. . We can say anything we like within our jurisdiction, and there is no power on earth to question what we do. But thisis a matter which falls within those questions for the decision of which the High Court has been established-question s in which the interests or property of a State may be affected by the action of the Commonwealth Government. The High Court has been set 'up simply to safeguard the rights of the Commonwealth on the one hand, as against each and all of the States, and with equal care and justice to protect the rights of each and all of the States on the other hand, as against the Commonwealth. the State we could take other territory. agreement anything that is not criminal can be done. For instance, the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments might agree to make the area of the territory 100,000 square miles. But there must be mutual agreement. I do not want to force upon the Committee my own opinion as to how large this area should be. I am putting the matter uppn much broader ground. We desire to see the negotiations between these two independent powers successfully conducted. We wish them to be of such a character that they will promote good feelI ading and not increase any bad feeling. I think that if there is one object that a responsible statesman, or member of this House, much more the House as a body, should keep steadily in view, it is that in the exercise of all our powers, and in all the transactions in which we are called upon to engage with any of the States, we should impress them with a sense of our perfect courtesy and fairness, and ' of our desire to do everything in a firiendly way. Now these are objects with which we all agree, and I wish to point out that the use of the word "" shall"" in this measure is unfortunate. After all, we are merely expressing our opinion. As the honourable and learned member for Indi has pointed out, this measure is not intended to compel a settlement of the question. It merely embodies an expression of opinion. That is the basis of my objection to the use of the word "" shall."" As the clause stands, we, the principals, are employing the Government as our' agents to deal with the people of New South Wales, through their agents, the Government of that State. We are telling our agents, "" Now you are going into a Conference with the Government of the State of New South Wales to settle this matter in a friendly way. We o tell you and we tell them in advance that the Federal territory shall embrace an area of not less than 900 square miles; in other words, it shall not contain 800' square miles or 850 square miles, or -even 899 square miles, because the expression ' shall not be less than 900 square miles' absolutely precludes the' selectionof a territory of 899 miles, and it i's not precluded as a matter of opinion, but by an absolute mandate contained in an Act of Parliament of the Commonwealth."" That is not the language to use to express an opinion, we should do so in the same courteous language that other people adopt. We should express our opinion, and not issue an ultimatum.

Even though a request might be perfectly equitable, and one that ought to be granted, it would, if it were thrown into the shape of an ultimatum, be regarded with hostility and indignation.

Let us remember the trying experiences through which Great Britain and America passed, in connection with the Alabama case, when those two great peoples were frequently on the verge of war, from which they were saved only by the exhibition of the greatest forbearance and courtesy on both sides. members will probably recollect the marvellous effect produced by the change of a few words in a despatch sent, at an exciting time, by the Government of Great Britain to the Government of the United States, when those two ' gentlemen were taken forcibly from the Trent. We know now that Her Majesty, the late Queen, probably under the advice of the Prince Consort, herself toned down the despatch which was being sent, and it is now believed that, if that communication had been forwarded in its original form, these two* great nations would have been plunged in war. Gladstone, .shows that that was a political fiction. gentleman does not suppose that there is any risk of our being plunged in war with New South Wales over the Capital Site question ? thing of the kind. If all my honourable friend's illustrations were viewed in that spirit he would be nbwhere. I am simply referring to a matter of history, by way of illustration. If the question were one of military history I should defer to the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Corio, but as it is a mere matter of recollection of historical facts I think I have sufficient authority to warrant my statement. ley against the right honourable gentleman. I quite imagine that he may be regarded as an inferior authority. an authority, he is almost equal to the honourable and learned member; that is the highest place I could give him. I stake my recollection of history against that of my honourable and learned friend. However, if I am wrong, it really does not affect the main trentl of my remarks, because ThatI think it must be obvious to honourable members that we should avoid the. language of dictation. I do not believe that honourable members have the slightest desire to do that to which I am now Objecting. I feel sure that no honourable member has the slightest desire to use an offensive word or one that would savour of dictation, if some other form of expression would answer the same purpose. I apprehend that the object of those who believe that a large area is absolutely necessary is to express their opinion, and to instruct the Government as their representatives in the strongHonorable est possible way. No honourable member desires that at the beginning of the negotiations, before the New South Wales Government is approached, we should deliberately use' the language of dictation and ultimatum, because we should then treat New South Wales as if she were so inferior that even courtesy was not her due. These may seem small matters, but from my own experience the strongest feelings excited between the States have been aroused by the use of unguarded expressions. For instance, an expression used by the late Sir John Robertson, probably as a joke, in a moment of pleasantry, was repeated year after year by those who looked upon it as a kind of insult cast upon one of the most flourishing States of Australia. I know that the Committee is strongly in favour of acquiring an area of 900 square miles. I am strongly opposed to it. I should not object to it, if the Government of New -South Wales were willing to grant that area. I do not wish for a moment to stand in the way of the Commonwealth acquiring 900 square miles, if New South Wales is willing to give it, but we must remember that underlying the bargain there is a gift from New South Wales of all the Crown lands within the area, constituting the Federal territory.

That would be the language of supreme authority, of brute force, and not the language of propriety, and of good taste, such as is used in ordinary business bargaining. It would not be good policy.

I am rather interested in the interjection of the honourable member for Darling, which I have heard for the first time.

Buti f I am right, the use of the word "" shall "" in connection with more than the legal area is all the more objectionable. If we have a constitutional right to take more than 100 square miles-to take 900 square miles, for example-the use of the word "" shall "" is.not so objectionable as it would be if we had a legal right to take only LOO square miles, and wished to acquire 900 square miles. In the latter case, the employment of the word ""shall"" in regard to'the excess of 800 square miles becomes even worse than I have said; it becomes ludicrous. We cannot take territory from a State. We have no power to do so. We may acquire the properties of private individuals for the purpose of certain services of the Commonwealth, under the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act; but there is no power to take the territory of a State for Federal territory, except within the terms of section 125 of the Constitution. There is no other power which will enable this Parliament to read into that charter of Government 900 square miles for 100 square miles. Of course, the proposal to pay for any Crown lands outside an area of 100 square miles puts the project in a much fairer light, but it does not remove the difficulty that may be created by the wrong use of words.. It rather intensifies my objection to that. If we have not the power to acquire 900 square miles, we have no right to say that the Federal territory "" shall"" consist of 900 square miles, because we are dealing with the property of others. Honourable members should always recollect that we are dealing with the property of others, under an agreement with them which is embodied in the Constitution.

321,All You Have To Do Is To Lis,"Mr Reid I am not discussing the Bill, the Government approached the Government of New South Wales and effected an admirable arrangement for the acquisition of 850 square miles of the best territory of that State, they would be obliged to return to Parliament and ask for its repeal. On the other hand, if we merely express an opinion that the Federal Territory should contain not less than 900 square miles, the Government will not be hampered in that way. I object to the clause in its entirety. I should like our views upon this matter to be put in a form in which they would express our opinion without making use of imperative language. If , instead of the words "" and shall contain an area not less than 900 square miles,""'we provided ""and it is desirable that the area of such territory should be not less than 900 square miles "" the clause would be absolutely clear as an expression of opinion on the part of the Committee, and the (government would know exactly what area we thought should be acquired.

If the Committee merely desires to express its opinion in a courteous v*ay it should agree to the amendment which I have suggested. of the word "" should "" for "" shall "" do? ment, but would be rather within the category of language which I think unfortunate. The Committee would express its views just as clearly if the amendment which I suggest were made, and the Government would have a much better chance of being liberally dealt with than they woulcl if we approached New South Wales with a club and said, "" We shall have 900 square miles of territory."" It is only a mere question of verbiage. If we were at 6u the end of our negotiations-if the Commonwealth Government found that they were met in an unfair way, that the response of the Government of New South Wales to their friendly overtures wascouched in unreasonable and dictatorial language then no one would object to their asserting their manhood and independence by employing words of equal strength. But I do not wish dictatorial and domineering language to be introduced at the beginning of what we hope will be friendly negotiations. If I went to the Attorney-General in a friendly way to settle a matter in which he had some voice, I should not begin by saying-""Look here, so and-so."" If I did the Attorney-General would reply"" Now, Mr Reid, do not you think we had better leave fighting to some other time ? Had we not better see if we cannot meet in a. friendly way, without using the word ''must' or ' shall' "" ? Every man of common-sense would say at once if I were to adopt such an attitude"" What sort of a man is he to conduct negotiations when he blunders at the start by insulting the other party""? "" should "" would be better; it is not so imperative as "" shall."" to the use of the word "" should."""" It would certainly be a vast improvement, for although it is a strong; word, it is not dictatorial. A man might say"" It is my opinion, and the area should be 900 square miles "" ; but if he said"" It is my opinion, and it shall be 900 squaremiles,"" he would, in effect, at once introduce the shillelah. This is after all a mere phrase, but I should not take up the time of the Committee in discussing it if I did not think there was something in my objection. We do not wish to expose ourselves to criticism by the use of language which is the substitution unnecessary. It is open to us to express our views just as clearly without the use of an ultimatum. The interests involved in the working together of the Commonwealth and a State in a friendly way are surely much greater than are those at issue when two dealers are haggling over a bargain of £ 5 0 . If hagglers over the smallest .bargains begin their negotiations with courtesy, I think we might well emulate their example in dealing with our national affairs.

This is not an enactment, but an expression of opinion as to what we think desirable. A man may hold as firmly as he pleases to h|is opinions without commencing his negotiations in an at all offensive way. throw out this suggestion to the Government. The clause will be discussed for some little time, and there will be ample opportunity for the Government to think over my proposal. I . should be extremely glad if the Government would even go so far as to introduce the word "" should "" in place of the word ""shall."" , If that amendment were made, we should give clear expression to our opinion without using language which, to say the least, would be unfriendly, before the merits of the question came to be discussed. As to the substantial point at issue, I am against so large an area as 900 square miles being taken from New South Wales, unless that State itself agrees to give it. South Wales were willing to part with 900 square miles of territory, my objection would should be a misfortune for the Commonwealth to become entangled in the control of a larger area of territory than is necessary for the exact purposes of the Federal Capital. That would be a mistake. If we acquired so large an. area we should find ourselves in the same position as is Congress in relation to Washington. So far as the people living within the boundaries of the Federal territorv are concerned., the Parliament of the United Stales has to play the part of a municipality; it has to pass municipal laws, as if it were a municipal council. no municipal council there. under five Commissioners. trol of Congress. municipal council; the whole business is run on military lines. of the United States is the legislative body.

I wish to point out that I am not speaking of any voluntary agreement-by mutual' agreement the territory may be as large as we like-bu t of our view of the matter, subject to the opinion of New South Wales. We must not forget that when the bargain was made it was a bargain for a Federal territory, for one purpose onlya If New Federal territory, as the home of the Federal Capital.

519,Mr Bruce Smith,"I do not nownegotiate with them, with a free hand, for the purpose of having certain territory placed at the disposal of this Parliament. To show that I am not speaking without authority, I ask the Committee to listen to the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commomvealth:The chief question which has arisen in connection with these words is whether the determination of the Seat of Government rests, in the last resort, solely with the Federal Parliament, or whether the Federal Parliament is limited in its choice to sites offered by the Parliament of New South Wales. The opening words of the section strongly favour the former view; but it has been argued that the words "" shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth "" point to a prior Act of Cession by the Parliament of New South Wales. Therefore I am not alone in the view I hold as to the meaning of the words in the Constitution, and I need not remind honourable members that in the interpretation of an Act of Parliament it is the commonly-accepted reading of a section which is taken by a Court. tions of the words "" shall have been granted,"" because, if the Constitution had contemplated that the Federal would choose a site within territory to be granted in the future, as we are proposing to do, the words "" shall have been granted "" would not have been used. I do not, I say, contend that we should now seriously consider the substitution of a resolution for an Act of Parliament; but what I have said is a strong argument in favour of our limiting ourselves to the selection of a site. If , as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, we not only provide in an Act of Parliament for the determination of a certain site, but lay down the area and the limitations of the Federal territory, our Ministeis will have no power of Imagine the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth approaching the Premieof New South Wales and saying, "" The Parliament of the Commonwealth .has passed an Act 'determining' where the Seat of Government shall be, and I now come to you, in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, to ask you to place certain territory at our disposal."" The Premier of New South Wales might .be willing to talk about it; but the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth would have to say, "" I cannot negotiate with you, because the Federal Parliament has determined where the Seat of Government shall be, and what the limitations and the area of the Federal territory shall be."" came back to this House and proposed the Mr Bruce Smith. acceptance of a smaller area than we had determined upon, we should be in the extraordinary position of having demanded, by Act of Parliament, something which we should have to subsequently forego. Would this Parliament then pass an amending Act, going back upon the original measure ? I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill how he would propose to act under such circumstances. If the Premier of New South Wales said, "" The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall have not less than ioo square miles, and we are willing to give you 200 or 300 square miles, but will not entertain a demand for 900 square miles,"" we should be in the rather .unpleasant position of having determined upon a certain territory which we could not get. The Premier of New South Wales might very well say, "" You have followed a wrong procedure. Under the Constitution you should have conie to us, and told us where you desired your Capital site to be. Then you should have asked us to place at your disThere cannot be two interpretaposal such territory as you want, and as we are willing to give. Afterwards, it would bi; for you to determine where the Capital Parliament should be within the territory thus granted by us."" I do not, I ' repeat, make the impracticable proposal that we should revert to the passing of a resolution; but, having made the mistake of passing in a Bill what should have been in the form of a motiona mistake which has been pointed out more than once, both to the last Government and to this Government-w e should take care that has ths measure is sufficiently elastic to give Ministers a free hand, subject to the confirmation of Parliament, to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales. That can be done only by limiting ourselves to negotiation. an expression of opinion, such as we have in clause 2, as to where the Seat' of Government should be. Having done that, and a debate having taken place as to what should be the extent of the Commonwealth territory, we should refrain from passing clause 3, and leave it to Ministers to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales on the subject. what area we desire? honourable member sees the objection which has been offered to the use, in the Bill, of any other word than the word ""shall.""

New South Wales made it an essential part of the bargain that the Federal Capital should be established within that State, and with that condition, and the'further limitation that the Capital should not be within ioo miles of Sydney, the Constitution provides that it shall be left to the discretion of the Federal Parliament to determine where the Capital shall be, and that the Capital when established shall be within territory of a certain size at least.

He stated that rather than surrender to the will of any State he would refuse to choose a site the for the Seat of Government. I could understand that declaration coming from an honourable member who desires to indefinitely postpone the selection of the Federal Capital, but I cannot understand it coming It profrom one who is ready to promptly give effect to the provisions of the Constitution. Is our will-whateve r it may be-withou t consideration of the lights, the equities, and even the sentiments of New South Wales, to be enforced upon that State, and if that State declines to allow of its enforcement, are we to declare that we will not give effect to the provisions of the Constitution ? WhatI . said, in effect, was that the will of no State should be allowed to stand in the way of national sentiment and national requirements. ing to the view entertained by the honourable and learned member, no consideration should be given to the request of that State for ordinary fair treatment, in regard to what was ^understood to be the meaning of The n weought to the Constitution.

Still there are 'many good lawyers who entertain a very different view. I think that any Court would decide that the area of the Federal territory must reasonably approximate to the minimum of 100 square miles prescribed by the Constitution, unless, as a matter of negotiation, New South Wales chooses to grant a much larger area.

606,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The hon-'the honourable member for South Sydney, I am not averse to that State ceding a larger extent of territory if she chooses to do so, although I personally object to large areas. Wales refuses to negotiate with the Commonwealth upon any terms other than by granting it a territory comprising 100 square miles? say that that State has any right to adhere too closelv to the minimum area of ioo square miles. The Constitution declares that there should be an extension of that area if necessary, but the extension should be merely of a give-and-take character, for which we see necessity, or consider the natural features of the' country require it. The intention of the Convention in this connection is very clear, although it was not the Convention which prescribed the minimum area of 100 sqxiare miles. The idea of the author of thiit limitation was that the Federal territory should embrace an area of approximately 100 square miles. The right honourable member for Swan was its author, and from the official report of the Convention debates, I find that when the area of that territory was under consideration, he interjected, "" Make it 100 square miles."" A little later, in speaking, he saidI should like to see it laid down in the Bill the territory taken under such a proposal that the Federal area shall contain not less than as this, and it seems to me that in respect 100 square miles. tbe large cities should be excluded from would be compelled to make.

When we demand from a State what we do not yet know will be of the slightest value to us, and without good reason say we must have our own way, we indicate a desire to humiliate"" that State. It is a proposal, by taking a large area, to cut ourselves off from the State, even if the characteristics of the country we acquire render that area undesirable. The Minister of Home Affairs referred to the question as if the Bill merely provided that an area of 900 square miles shall be acquired, and the honourable and learned member for Indi. also spoke of the same area. I interjected at the time that the Bill provides not that an area of 900 square miles shall be acquired, but that an area of "" not less than "" 900 miles shall be secured. That is a very important distinction. Under the clause as it stands it would be possible for the Government to ask, as suggested by an honourable member of another place, for an area of 20,000 square miles. I am altogether opposed to the acquiring of a large area, although I am not averse to negotiations on the part of the Parliament for what may be considered a suitable piece of country. I am personally opposed to the acquiring of a large area simply because I consider that it would be undesirable. No unearned increment would attach to some of to some portion of the area the Commonexceed 900 square miles, why not insert It appears to me that on that not provide that an area "" not exceeding 900 Some desired to have the Seat of lieve, however, that objection could be taken",59,Thomson Th E Better Ished Me So Far As It Related To The

That attitude might be followed by eventualities which I should be very sorry to see. In the interests, not of New South Wales, but of Australia, I am absolutely opposed to the idea that we should acquire a territory which we may approach without setting foot on New South Wales soil. If there be anything foreign to a 'Federal union it is the feeling that we cannot establish our Government in any StateI care not what State it is-withou t the expectation that the people of that State will become antagonistic to us. members hold such an opinion, I can only say that we have not advanced far towards the realization of the true spirit of Federal union. cate that -we have the power to compel the The honourable and learned member for Indi States to do certain things? not even dreamt of in the Convention or in the Federal Conference, and it has never been dreamt of in certain other Federations. What was the motto of those who advocated Federation ? Was it not "" One people, one destiny ?"" Yet here we are seeking to make ourselves a separate people; to insult a State; to say to the people of that State, ""We cannot put such trust in you as to allow it to be necessary for persons to pass through your territory in order to reach the Federal Capital; we must be able to get from the Federal Capital to the sea without passing over a foot of your soil. If we do not obtain that means of ingress, and of egress, we shall not establish our Capital in your State."" Is that an attitude that is calculated to breed goodwill between the States? Is that an attitude that is likely to make us one people with one destiny? I presume that if this for a large vote for fortifications, because of a fear 'that the people of New South Wales, or of the rest of Australia, may attack the Federal Executive. Instead of seeking to realize the Federal motto, ""One people, one destiny,"" we are endeavouring to create two separate destinies for the people. We are saying, in effect, to the people of one State, comprising a third of the people of Australia, that we should not trust ourselves to go among them, because if we did we might not be permitted to We are to provide for a minimum, leave their territory. To my mind that is worse than ridiculous. selves to come here? were in danger here we might escape, if we were lucky, by the Yarra, but the suggestion that we cannot trust a State is, to my mind, one of the lowest aspects from which to regard the Federation.

But at DalgetyI am afraid that we shall have to wait for the unearned increment until land begins to get scarce in Australia. I was in Washington in 1884. It was then a skeleton cityI believe that it has improved very much since then. My visit was long after the city was established. I was amazed, first of all, at the beauty and expensiveness of the buildings, and also amazed to see that the cart-wheel streets that radiated from the centre, were nothing but skeleton streets with a few houses dotted here and there about them.

The city may have increased considerably since I was there, but apparently at that time there was very little unearned increment in Washington. If that was the case in Washington, which is situated close to the Potomac River, and right in the centre of busy coastal States, how much can we expect from an area situat Dalgety? I am not finding fault with the site, but am simply pointing out that Dalgety is near no stream that reaches the sea. runs to the sea. stream by which traffic can reach the sea. No traffic can at any time reach the sea by means of the Snowy River. I accept the selection which Parliament has made, but I fear it will be a very long time before there is any unearned increment from the site selected.

The right honourable member for East Sydney said that there is too much ultimatum in it. Let me add that there is-too little pomatum. The Prime Minister can easily approach the Premier of New South Wales, and say that the desire of the Federal Parliament is that 900 square miles shall be acquired. If he can show good reasons, I have no doubt that that area will be granted, and the matter will be over. But in this Bill we are not asking for negotiations. The Minister of Home Affairs points a revolver at the head of the Premier of New South Wales, and says"" I am not going to negotiate with you; my position is that we must have 900 square miles, and you had better be a good fellow, and grant it."" But now the honourable and learned member for Indi says that he will not be satisfied even with that. He must have access to the territory by sea, becertain thing shall be done, that cause, he says, there is a danger that some time or other Federal members may be molested by the people of New South Wales. That, I suppose, is the Federal spirit! The honourable and learned member has the impudence to tell us that the people of New South Wales are a race of savages. He is afraid that he would not be able to travel through the territory of that State. We must give him a port. He must have a strip of territory from the Capital city to the sea, seventy miles by twelve. This attitude is not new on the part of the honourable and learned member. He played the same game in the last Parliament with the same motive. responsible for what he is saying? it. Tumut was selected. The .honourable and learned member for Indi moved an amendment that the territory be stretched down to the Murray River, in order to get access to' the sea. when the vote was taken. I believe that it was the honourable member for Grampians who made the proposal, but I was not here. honourable and learned member who started the idea. I apologize to him for making the mistake. New South Wales did not expect to have a model territory carved out of her province. She did not expect to have experiments made in Socialism and collective industry. She took a rational view of this question, and was prepared to grant a certain area of Crown land to the Commonwealth. She did not contemplate that the Commonwealth was to take as much as it liked. If the Prime Minister can approach the Premier of New South Wales and show good reasons for a larger area being granted, probably it will be granted. But Ave should not demand it. The Prime Minister will find that if the people of New South Wales receive proper treatment, and are taken into our confidence, they will not be inclined to strike a niggardly bargain. They have always adopted the policy of open-handedness towards the people of Australia generally. But they certainly are suspicious when Federal members like the honourable and learned member for Indi say that they will not surrender this and that. He must have a Bill, which says that a there must be an area of not less than 900 square miles and that may mean any larger area-and that there must be access to the sea. The only lesson to be learnt from this by New South Wales is either that the honourable member wishes to filch too much territory from that State, or that he wishes to further delay the selection of the site. test the question I raised some time ago, and I now move That the word "" shall,"" in line 4, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" should.""

We know that certain remarks have been made on the subject in the New South Wales press, and by some New South Wales politicians; but no one will tell us that 'She New South Wales Government will take serious'notice of those statements.

We are all agreed that the negotiations should be friendly, and it is but fair to asor even a larger area, has puzzled me. sume that the New South Wales Government will recognise that, and, personally, I think it is probable that there will be very little discussion about the area suggested. It is unfair to assume that the New South Wales Government will seek to quarrel with the Commonwealth Government, or that the Commonwealth Government will carry on the negotiations from their side in a way which will be annoying or offensive. The New South Wales Government will not analyze and criticise the wording of this provision, as our legal friends have done. Such criticism and analysis may be very necessary in connection with legal matters, but in business communications between members of Governments, who are men of the world, and have no desire to misunderstand each other, that kind of analysis of terms is not necessary. I have heard no honourable member state that he has any authority from the New South Wales Government for making the assertion that they will We object to the terms proposed in this clause.

I wish to say a few words about the area. The apparent fear in the minds of some people in New South Wales about our taking 900 square miles, I am satisfied with the Government proposal that the area should be 900 square miles. I do not think that less than that area would do. I might give one or two reasons why, in my opinion, we should acquire a much greater area than 100 square miles. before the Committee is that the word "" shall"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" should.""

679,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I thinkWales authorities in this matter in a diplomatic way than some honourable members appear to imagine. I was quite in agreement with the policy of the late Government-who , unfortunately, did not have sufficient back-bone to stand by their policy -that the Seat of Government Bill should fix a certain site, and that the question of the territory should be dealt with by sub sequent legislation, which should be the outcome of negotiations between the Common, wealth Government and the Government of New South Wales, and which should be based on information with respect to the territory proposed to be acquired, which at present we do not possess. We may deal with this matter in a reasonable, diplomatic way, or in an offensive way, and it must not be forgotten that the people of New South Wales are inclined to be a little sensitive on this subject. I remember that on the last occasion, when this matter was dealt with by this Parliament, and when, against the policy of the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the area proposed to be acquired was stated in the Bill, the Government, the leader of the Opposition, and a large number of honourable members at once committed themselves to an attitude of hostility to the proposal. That was due largely to the way in which it was put. I ask honourable members, on this occasion, to be guided by the experience we have gained in that connection. The late See Government, in New South Wales, was, if anything, over-friendly to the Federal Government. That is to be accounted for by the fact that it was, to some extent, a Government which had been brought into power by the honourable member for Hume, who was at first the Minister in charge of this measure. So careful were the members of the See Government not to in any way infringe upon the authority of the Federal Government, but on the contrary to consider their wishes in this matter, that although Sir John See was asked to move in the direction of suggesting a site himself, he resolutely refused to do so, and left the selection accept the amendment. entirely to the Federal Government. But as soon as word was sent to New South Wales that this Parliament was asking for a much larger territory than that mentioned in the Constitution, Sir John See, on the very limited information at his disposal, felt compelled to take a hostile stand at once, and the debate which ensued in the State Parliament was decidedly hostile to the Federal proposal, and largely because it was misunderstood. We do not wish to have any misunderstanding with the State Government on this matter. I wish to say that, in supporting the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition, I am not opposed to the larger area asked for. My view is that we should adopt the diplomatic method of dealing with this business. In order to prevent friction, and to have it settled as amicably as possible, we should meet the State authorities reasonably. The experience we gained in the last Parliament should teach us that to make anything in the nature of a demand upon New South Wales is not the most diplomatic way in which to secure the concession for which we are seeking. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment, as it will in some way tone down the request we are making. to hear from, the Government that they intended to accept this amendment. intend to accept it. see that last year a number of the members of the Government voted in favour of a similar proposal. of the Bill at present did not vote for the proposal, nor, do I think, did the then Minister of Trade and Customs; but the present Prime Minister, Postmaster-General, and Minister of External Affairs all voted in that direction, and -I know they are too consistent to reverse a vote on a maLter of this nature. cumstances I think, perhaps, it would be better for me to "" climb down "" than to ask my colleagues to reverse their vote. I admit that it is possible we shall be able to carry out these negotiations and bring them to a conclusion more quickly by using the word proposed in preference to any other word; and, therefore, I am prepared to Amendment agreed to. some force in the observation that the clause as it stands leaves the area unlimited, . and I suggest that there should be a maximum as well as a minimum. ever; that would hamper the negotiations more than ever, because there would be an ultimatum with two extremes.",65,Thomson Th E Better Ished Me So Far As It Related To The

At present it is left open to the Government to ask for as much more territory as they like, though there is a minimum below which the New South Wales Government cannot go. However, if the right honourable member for East Sydney thinks the clause will satisfy New South Wales, I have no more to add. posedThat the word "" nine "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" one."" the matter of area, there are some considerations which I do not think have been laid before the Committee. There are several requirements of a Capital city which cannot, in my opinion, be complied with if the area be restricted to ioo square miles. For instance, commonage would be required, and there must be quarries for the necessary buildings. Further, it is desirable that the watershed and supply should be within Commonwealth territory; and there are other considerations, such as the provision of parks, a race-course on which to run the Great Federal Capital Cup Race, and other reserves for recreation. Of course, there cannot be a city in Australia without a race track; and I merely suggest these as requirements which it would be difficult to satisfy with an area of ioo square miles. Apart from the consideration of the unearned increment, an area of 900 square miles is not at all too large for the ordinary requirements of such a populous city as we hope to see at no distant date. therefore, that the Committee will not accept the amendment. Tn this matter we might, I think, safely trust the Government during the negotiations, to ask for 900 square miles more or less, because we cannot be exact to a yard. It is not fair to assume that the Government, composed of sensible men, will use any technical power they may possess to ask for a great deal more than is absolutely necessary. recognise that the Committee are against me, and to save time. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. I content myself by saying that I do not think there is the slightest chance of New South Wales agreeing to any such area as that proposed; and, in my opinion, such an area ought not to be granted. that the honourable member for Parramatta has withdrawn the amendment. I am just as strongly as is that honourable member against the proposal to take a large area, but I recognise that the majority of honourable members present wish that, at any rate, the attempt shall be made. I bow, with great reluctance, to the decision, feeling that when matters come to negotiation, a mutually conciliatory spirit will be shown. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. That the following words be added, "" and have access to the sea.""

A. great deal of the criticism levelled at us on account of the slow progress made with our business, is, I am afraid, somewhat justified, and I do not think that this matter ought to be taken over to another sitting.

I am not speaking of honourable members who voted for Lyndhurst, where there was no possibility of getting any water. difference between voting for a site with a/i abundance of water, and where it was thought there would be access to a seaport, and voting for a site where, to say the least, I saw no water during my visit. The question arises how much territory do we want, and what is to be the width of the land connecting the territory with the port of Twofold Bay? What land are we to reserve immediately around the Bay for the purpose of conserving ' the interests of the Commonwealth in its control of that part of the territory? Honourable members for Western Australia have said that they voted for Dalgety, not particularly because of the site and its surroundings, but because they thought that some day there will be a jiort at which they will be able to land, and from which they can be carried by a short line of railwav to the Capital without any very great inconvenience. for the Commonwealth to own the land to I agree with the honourable member for enable honourable members to reach the Capita] in that way; New South Wales will not stop honourable members. arises whether the Commonwealth should not hold that territory. I do not say that it is absolutely necessary that the land should be taken from the control of the State, because I know there would still be access to the harbour. But in view of the fact of Twofold Bay, it seems only reasonable that the Commonwealth should control a harbour which is open to attack by an enemvj and which it might be necessary to fortify a work which could not be carried out by a State. trol. no guarantee that the Government of New South Wales will be willing to spend the money necessary to make the port suitable for the purpose. iCommocwealth do it. is : Would the Commonwealth be warranted in the expenditure if it had not possession of the harbour? As we seem to have selected Dalgety largely in the hope that we shall thereby secure a port at Twofold Bay, it is essential that we should have a strip of territory between Dalgety and Twofold Bay which would enable us to There is a great connect the Federal Capital with the port, and a strip of land round the foreshores of the Bay, which would enable us to fortify it, and to make it suitable for the purposes of the Commonwealth. I am not able to go very thoroughly into the subject to-night, because J. have not had time to examine the map, or to consider the matter in all its bearings: but if we do not get an approach to Twofold Bay, many honourable members will have voted for the Dalgety site under a misapprehension. T shall vote with those who are trying to get as much as they can under Commonwealth control. I object to the Dalgety site, but since it has been selected, I think we should give it a port for the advantage of the people of Western Australia and Tasmania, who will have to travel there by sea. though I was in favour of the selection of Tooma, I had, before seeing that site, ex L",67,Thomson Th E Better Ished Me So Far As It Related To The

The right honourable member for East Sydney has said that the Commonwealth will have access to Twofold Bay in any case, because the Government of New South Wales will not put up fences to debar them; but that argument maybe used in another way. It may be said that the Commonwealth Government will not put up fences. Furthermore, if the Commonwealth obtains possession of Twofold Bay, the State of New South Wales will be saved a large expenditure in making the harbour a good port. I think that if we choose a territory near the sea, it should extend down to the coast, so as to give the Commonwealth an independent outlet. to make the proposed amendment in order to bring that about. ter to determine that Twofold Bay shall be part of the Federal territory,' and I hope that New South Wales will show sufficient Federal spirit to agree to the arrangethe Government of New South Wales, and ment shows the same Federal spirit as the other States are showing, it will not give anything to the Commonwealth. able members who do not represent New South Wales have shown a large amount of .Federal spirit in this matter.

Judging from the remarks made by some of the representatives of New South Wales, there will be very little difficulty in getting the people of that State to give us a port, because of the benefits which the State will receive from the Commonwealth expenditure in making the port what it should be. I shall support the amendment. it will be better to leave the matter to be settled by diplomacy than to agree to the amendment. If the Government of New South Wales is prepared to include Twofold Bay within the Federal territory, I shall not raise my voice against the arrangement, but if the State is not preslow that some one must drive them. Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. pared to do so, no vote of mine will be given for the proposal, and there is nothing in the Constitution which will require her to do so. New South Wales interests are supposed to give way whenever the Federal spirit is mentioned, but the Federal spirit is a practically unknown quantity with the representatives of the other States when dealing with New South Wales. What weighed with the members of the last Parliament was the desirability of obtaining access to the Federal Capital without going through New South Wales territory, and that, apparently, is the factor determining the decision on the present occasion. We have been led to suppose that the people of New South Wales are so hostile to Federation that it would be dangerous to have the Commonwealth territory situated entirely within that State. That does not seem to me to be a good exhibition of the Federal spirit. tion of the word ."" should "" for "" shall "" makes the matter one for negotiation with therefore, I think it desirable that we should insert in the clause whatever conditions we wish to impose in regard to the Federal territory.

I believe that future generations member is not in order in reflecting upon a vote of the House. to secure this advantage that a large number of honourable members voted for Dalgety-is the possession of a Federal port, and, therefore.
