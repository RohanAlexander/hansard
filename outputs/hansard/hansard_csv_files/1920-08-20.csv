27,Sir Joseph Cook,"No active stepsthe honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) an intimation that .he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""the unsatisfactory distribution of sugar to retailers by the Commonwealth Government."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. [11.13] I am reluctant to take this course, because interference with Government business is likely to annoy Ministers; but I want to have the sugar question settled satisfactorily, and no other way was open to me. 1 have approached the officials who are responsible for the distribution of sugar, and I have seen the Minister on the matter, but have received no satisfaction. An adequate supply of sugar is a3 much needed by the people as an adequate supply of other ordinary commodities, not excepting coal; sugar is a necessity, not a luxury. Although the Government of Australia owns all the sugar, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the wholesale merchants will not recognise that fact, and wish to handle it in their own sweet ""way, as in the past, and for their own interests, instead of those of the public. I could speak at length of the unfair action of the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company and the wholesale merchants, who have not been interfered w t h by the officials of the Department administering the distribution of sugar. I desire, however, to confine my remarks to one phase of the subject in the hope that I may receive from the Minister an assurance that the grievance of which I complain will be remedied. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), in explaining the sugar agreement to the House, said that grocers who purchased sugar in half-ton lots would be able to obtain it direct from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and would 'be granted the f u l l rebate, while those who did not desire to purchase so large a quantity would obtain what they required from the wholesale merchants, and secure a proportion of the rebate, while the remainder would go to the merchants. I fully appreciate the fact that there is a scarcity of sugar, and, while I hold that the Ministry are responsible for that shortage, I know that it is unreasonable, in the circumstances, to expect the Minister to satisfy all demands. As the sugar is the property of the Government, however, it is their duty to see that every man in business obtains a fair deal. That is not being done. Grocers, in my division, and in the adjoining division of Fawkner, are constantly complaining to me of the unfair distribution of sugar. They state that, while some grocers can obtain ample supplies, others in the same neighbourhood cannot. Those who are able to supply sugar naturally get the trade of their less fortunate brethren. This differentiation should not be permitted. Messrs. Moran and Cato, a very large proprietary grocery company, prior to the new agreement, were allowed to purchase direct from the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company, although other companies could not do so, and-they have to-day plenty of sugar. The result is that other grocers, who are short of supplies, are losing their trade to them. I had to complain to Colonel Oldershaw that a South Melbourne firm of. grocers was unable to get a supply, while neighbouring grocers were securing what they wanted. That firm has since been a little more fortunate. I have to complain now of the treatment meted out to another grocer carrying on business at Yarraville. The Minister, I fear, thinks there is something wrong with him, and I shall, therefore, stress his case. His name is J. A. Safe, and he carries on business at Stephen-street, Yarraville. On 9th July last he got a half-ton of sugar, and since then he has had only four 70-lb. bags. His financial position is satisfactory; he pays for all that he purchases according to trade usage, but I have an idea that he is not supplied with sugar for a reason which seems so utterly impossible that I do not care to advance it. a Labour candidate for a municipal council election which takes place next week. I should not have mentioned that matter but that I feel that the Minister thinks there must be something wrong",20,Constitutio N Convention

I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to inquire into this man's case. I ask him to make an investigation, not through the medium of the official usually dealing with such matters, but by means of an independent officer. I have communicated with the official who usually looks after this matter, and he will not see .this man righted. Surely my request will not be regarded as unreasonable. If the Minister does what I ask, I am satisfied that the result of the inthey have a very big trade, and are never quiry will be that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the wholesale merchants will deal more fairly with the grocers. The wholesale grocers do not like the new arrangement under which retailers may obtain sugar in half-ton lots from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and get the full rebate; but that arrangement, owing to the shortage, cannot be fully carried into effect. The Minister will admit that where two or three grocers in the same neighbourhood were drawing, in normal times, half a ton of sugar per fortnight, those people, having the same trade as before, should now get at least half their usual supply instead of one or two of them being granted the full supply and the others very little. ister deal with every case? sible for him to do so; but since the Government have undertaken the handling of sugar, they should see that every man in the trade is fairly treated. statement. ment will see that an end is put to this unfair treatment. fifty cases of the same kind in my own electorate. founded Socialism keeps breaking down! thetic administration. blame, not the sugar company or the wholesale merchants, but the officials under the Minister who have charge of thf distribution. has cited instances where grocers have obtained less than their average quantity.

77,Mr Greene,"I can tell the honortrouble this morning to see both tbe merchant who supplied this man, and the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who brought the dockets to show what the deliveries have been. There is no doubt as to the accuracy of the information I can give the House, or as to the inaccuracy of the information given by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In the first place, I wish to state one or two general considerations. Owing to the lateness of the Queensland season, which was entirely due to seasonal causes, over which the Government have no control, deliveries of Queensland raw sugar to the refineries have been much lower than usual, and we have had for a considerable time past difficulties in shipping. One of these difficulties was that a boat we had chartered for delivery of sugar in Melbourne scraped its bottom when trying to get into some port, with the result that its cargo was not delivered in time. Such circumstances as these it is impossible to control; and we have been trying to get along as well as possible witha very short supply. It naturally follows that not a single distributor of sugar, or manufacturer, has got his full quantity. The only people who have had their f u ll supplies, according to the orders which they always give, are those who have the control of hospitals; and, under the circumstances, nobody will complain of that discrimination. It follows, of course, that otherwise we have had to give short deliveries of sugar all round. that. vour to do, as the orders come in, and the quotas are allotted from the very limited amount of sugar we have, is to serve each man in turn; ias the orders came along every man is being given his quota. not do it fairly. in the merchants send them on to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Everybody knows that the company delivers sugar direct from its own refinery; the sugar does not go through the merchants' stores except in comparatively few instances. As each order comes along the quota is allotted from the very limited stock. all these orders in their sequence, and there could not be anything fairer. are kept back. are kept back are those which come in subsequently to the previous orders. To give honourable members some idea of the difficulties under which we have been working; I shall give some dates. On the 1st June the Yarraville refinery stopped work owing to the engine-drivers and firemen's strike, and ceased taking orders from both manufacturers and merchants. Every order, that was then in was fulfilled according to the quota we were able to allot. On the 29th June the refinery started again, and on the 30th resumed taking orders from merchants and manufacturers, unexecuted orders on the books also being proceeded with. I ought to explain here that, owing to the extreme shortage, it was impossible to introduce a new system at once, and allow everybody to go direct to the Colonial Sugar Refining Companyi f desired. supplies based-o n the orders ""or on the supplies previously? filled according to the annual consumption of the customer, whoever he might be, and we have been obliged to do that as the only means by which we can get a basis. it is done, but it is not done. 21st July the refinery stopped altogether owing to the exhaustion of raw sugar; we had just a few pounds that were kept for the hospitals. I think there was a little reserve kept for the milk condenseries, for otherwise we should have lost a very large amount of one of onr primary products. there no sugar? deavoured to explainthat the shortage was due to the lateness of the Queensland season, and to the delay in the delivery",23,Adjotjenmeistt Formal Distribution Of Sugab

118,Sir Joseph Oook,"On the 12th may be adjusted speedily without holdingcountry filed a plaint. The workers did not desire to resort to the strike if they could get a fair means of settling their disputes peacefully. But, by the inepti' tude of Parliament at that time, the work of the Arbitration Court became so congested that hearings were delayed, and the workers lost all confidence in arbitration. That has continued up to the present moment. The Minister stated that, before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court alone, thirty-three Public Service cases have been listed. That is far too great a number of cases to be awaiting decision. However much inclined meu may be to have their troubles settled in a peaceful legal way, they cannot be expected to wait year after year to get a hearing. I remember that I , together with a fellow officer of my union, the late Mr James Curley, had occasion to file plaints in the Arbitration Court soon after it was established in New South ""Wales. The men were behind us in resorting to arbitration rather than to the strike; but, after having consider whether the constitution of the filed our .claims, we could get no hearing, in one case for nearly two years. Our members were disappointed, their confidence in arbitration was undermined, and we have never since been able to get them to look kindly upon the principle. The same objection applies to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Its business has been allowed to become congested. We have not been able to give the workers quick access to the Court. Some effort in that direction should have been made long ago. Either we should have appointed additional Judges, or we should have introduced legislation such as the Industrial Peace Bill. I believe that is the best industrial legislation ever passed in this or any other Parliament. Amongst other things it will have the effect of considerthem. The result is always a compromise ably lightening the work to be performed by the Arbitration Court. I believe that when it has been in operation for some time, most of the industrial bodies will realize the advantage of being able to get a remedy for their grievances immediately they arise. They will apply for the Local and Special Tribunals to deal with their troubles, and thus the work of the Arbitration Court will be very much reduced. When the Industrial Peace Bill was before the House we did know the contents of this measure, and we had a doubt as to the Government's intentions in regard to the Arbitration Court. It is pleasing to find now that the Government do not intend to abolish the Court. But I .believe that, when the Industrial Peace Bill is in full operation, the work of the Court will be so reduced that additional Judges' will probably not be required. There may be no need for a special tribunal for the Public Service. I believe that the claims of the Public Service can be dealt with by the Arbitration Court in conjunction with the machinery provided by the Industrial PeaceB ill / and that we shall be able to save money by not creating any further tribunal. Whilst it is necessary to facilitate in every way the approach to the Court we do not desire to expend more money than is necessary for the purpose. Therefore, I doubt whether it would not be better to allow the Public Service to remain under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. I believe that the Service is agreeable to that. Buti t may be advisable for the Government to Court should not be amended so as to include a representative of each party to assist the Judge. That is especially necessary in connection with Public Service claims, because, after all, a Judge cannot know much about the industrial technicalities of a claim. If he had the assistance of representatives of each side he would often be able to come to a better decision that would be acceptable to all concerned. In the New South Wales Arbitration Court the Judge is assisted by two representatives of the parties. After every phase of the case has 'been placed before the Court the Judge asks his two assistants to endeavour to arrive at an understanding. If they fail he decides on the matters in dispute between acceptable to both parties. It would be an advantage to have a similar system in connection with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In the States,, but not in the Commonwealth, men have been appointed to preside over the Arbitration Court who were not suitable for the position. For arbitration work a man must have special qualifications. It is not sufficient that he has a legal mind; he may be disqualified by temperament for arbitration work. Therefore it would be better if the Judge, were assisted by representatives of employers and employees. are things in connection with the Postal Service, of which neither the Judge, nor any of us, can know anything. But if the Judge were assisted hy two men representing the /Government, and' .ithe employees respectively, they would understand thoroughly all the details of the points at issue, and it would be easier for him with their assistance to come to an acceptable decision. Probably the two representatives would agree amongst themselves, and the Judge would give an award in the terms of that agreement. I understand that the Public Service would prefer that system. A very large number of claims by Government employees is before the Arbitration Court now, but once the machinery for dealing with them is in operation this class of arbitration work will decrease, and only small troubles will require to be adjusted from time to time. The position in the Arbitration Court to-day is much the same as when arbitration was first introduced in New South Wales. The public servants have grievances, and they are filing their plaints so that they may be dealt with in a legal way. Until all the various organizations have been before the Court there will be many cases to be dealt with, butl later the work of the Court will decrease, and will be mostly confined to the interpretation of questions that have arisen in connection with the operation of awards. I am not sure that some of the amendments proposed by this Bill will be satisfactory, although the majority of them will be. Some of them are merely consequential, but there are some proposals in regard to which I have doubts. No end of trouble has been caused in the Commonwealth shipbuilding yards, and other works, in regard to the question of demarcation, which is constantly cropping up, owing, to the fact that different unions claim that various sections of employees should belong to their organizations. It is a wise step to give the Court the fullest possible power to lay down the boundaries of work, and classify employees in different industries in order that they may work harmoniously. Australian Workers Union will view the anything in the nature of a strike. There amendment. Workers Union is one of the biggest organizations in Australia, and has loyally abided by the Arbitration Oourt, in this respect setting an example to other unions. It would be. perfectly satisfied to abide by the Court as it stands to-day. It has always availed itself of the Court in the past, and I am sure will continue to do so in the future. effeet of the delimiting sections. As a union, the Australian Workers Union believes in embracing every one in its ranks. sident of the Arbitration Court is given this power to say what should be done,, it does not necessarily follow that he may declare that such an organization as the Australian Workers Union should not extend throughout Australia. The amendment is aimed at meeting the trouble I have referred to in the shipping yards, the question of demarcation, which has been the cause of nearly all the disputes at Cockatoo Island within the last few years. There is a far-reaching amendment in clause 2 of the Bill. The definition of ""strike"" is to be amended to read as follows:"" Strike"" includes the total or partial cessation of work by employees, acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employers; and the total or partial refusal of employees, acting in combination, to accept work, if the refusal is unreasonable. I do not quite know how far that amendment will go. Men may be declared guilty of striking because of the refusal of a section to work, although the organization may not approve of their action. In the coal mining industry, there are many branches of work. If the wheelers refuse to work, as they frequently do, coming to their decision quite independently of the miners-wh o are in the majority in the organization-the latter are unable to work, and under the wording of this amendment, may possibly be considered as having taken part in a strike. must be combined action in ceasing work.",26,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

Clause 10 proposes to amend section 2S of the principal Act by making provision for varying awards under abnormal circumstances, and similar provision was made in the Industrial Peace Bill, but when, we reach the Committee stage I shall endeavour to have new awards made retrospective to the date of the expiration of previous awards, or to the date of the submission of claims.. It of ten happens that, owing to the congestion of business, a new award is not made until fully twelve months after a previous award has expired. The new award ought to be made retrospective to ihe date of the expiry of the previous award. Industrial agreements should also be made retrospective in a similar way. If a new claim is not heard for months after Ibeing lodged the award ought also to be made retrospective to the date of the submission of the claim. By making provision for this we shall go a long way towards satisfying the industrial unions. be fair. Mr 'CHAELTON -Exactly. unions will be satisfied that, although delays 'may take place in the hearing of their cases, they will not suffer in consequence of them. When they find that their claims cannot be heard for months, there is a tendency for them to take action off their own bat. I put forward this recommendation with the knowledge given by years of observation in such matters. When, because of the congestion of business in the Court, men have had to wait a considerable time to have their cases heard, and the awards are not made retrospective, it is no wonder they become dissatisfied, and no matter how anxious the leaders of the organization may be to prevent turmoil, they cannot avoid it . In some cases claims have been awaiting a hearing for two years. My request is a fair one, and I hope that when the Bill is in Committee the necessary amendment will be made. It is my intention to move the followSection 44 of the principal Act is amended by inserting in paragraph (&) of sub-seetion (2), after the words, ""breach or non-observance,"" the words, "" or by any officer of the organization authorized under its rules to sue on behalf of the organization."" In the operation of this section of the Act the unions find that they have not got the satisfaction they .desire, and in this connection have forwarded fo me the following statement of the position:Under section 44 (1) of the-1004-15 Act, as amended by section 3 of the 1918 Aet, penalties for breaches of awards may be recovered in Courts of summary jurisdiction. Section 44 (2) provides that the proceedings may .be taken by the Registrar or the organization whose members are affected, or the individuals who are affected. In practice this policing of the award is done by the unions, the Begistrar rarely, if ever, prosecuting, and the individual employees, for obvious reasons, hardly ever prosecuting. The Judiciary Act applies the procedure in Courts of summary jurisdiction in each State to informations or complaints brought for breaches of a Federal Act in the State Courts of summary jurisdiction. Proceedings under section 44 in Victoria are, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Justices Act. This has created the following difficulty. If proceedings are taken in the name of the organization as informant, they may be objected to on the ground that the Victorian Act contemplates informations being laid by individuals. Section IS of the Justices Act provides that the information must be signed, and section 19 provides that the justice who takes The the information, which is the foundation of the whole proceedings, may require it to be on oath, even though it is not intended to have defendant arrested. Now the union obviously cannot sign, nor can it take an oath, and it has been expressly held in Victoria that an information in the name of a corporation cannot be made on oath.",28,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

131,Mr Maxwell,"The request seems toAnd the union, by virtue of section 5S of the Arbitration Act, is a corporation. On the other hand, if the information is laid by some person authorized by the union, who, being an individual, can sign and can make an oath, it is open to the objection, that in Victoria, at any rate, the agent for the person aggrieved cannot lay an information on his behalf. It has been held in the Melbourne Court of Petty Sessions that an information laid by a union official claimed to be authorized by the union is bad on the ground, not of any defect in authority, but that he is not one of the persons named in section 44 (2). It may be that both positions are justified, that the official cannot lay the information because the Statute does not authorize him so to do, and that the union itself cannot, at any rate in Victoria, lay the information because it cannot sign, and cannot make an oath. In the ease of Steane v. Whitohell, in 190G, Victorian Law Reports, the Victorian Full Court doubted whether a municipal corporation could comply with the provisions of the Justices Act and lay an information. The best way of getting over the difficulty would be by an amendment of tlie Act empowering the organization to authorize some person on its behalf to lay informations under section 44. It appears that this can be done in Xew South Wales under the existing State law: see, for instance, the case of Peck v. A<Zelaicle Shipping Co., 18 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 167. The amendment suggested is quite a simple one, and should cover all that is required. I do not think that much exception can be taken to the bulk of the amendments contained in the B ill . believe it is the intention of the Minister to make the Act more workable, and to Mr Mc WILLIAMS -Does the honourable member imagine that anything would make the Conciliation and Arbitration Act workable? tries which will prefer arbitration according to the methods of the B ill to arbitration according to the methods for which we provided last week; but I believe that the greater number of our industries will elect to come under the legislation of last week, and that as time goes on very little work will be lef t for the Arbitration Court to do. will be able to do more efficiently in consequence. who go to it will have their cases heard with more expedition, which is to be desired. If all the work is done under the hew law, the Arbitration Court must be abolished, because there will be no need for it. But we must await developments. In any opinion, the Arbitration Court mu3t be kept in existence for the present. I doubt the need for the Public Service Arbitration B ill , because I think it would be better to continue the present arrangement than to create additional machinery for dealing with Public Service cases. The more Courts you have, the greater the expense. But no expense can be too great that will preserve industrial peace. one will say that leave things as they are until we can see What has taken place. I said last week that there were only two blemishes on the measure that 'we passed then. I suggested certain amendments, with' which lionorable members dealt in a fair spirit, and accepted, with the exception of two, and I think it will be found that the measure, providing as it does for the hearing of disputes as they arise, will be considered satisfactory, and that Parliament will have earned the gratitude of the community for it . The measure now before us ought not to occupy much time at the second-reading stage, because its provisions are more the subject for Committee consideration. I trust that i i i Committee it will be dealt with . as fairly as was the B ill last week. If we I are all actuated by the desire to i m prove it , we shall be certain to do good work upon it I believe that the B ill which was passed last week w ill do more to secure industrial peace than any other that has become law in Australia, The amendments that were made strengthen it , and render it more popular with the industrial organizations, and I am very hopeful of good results.

There was not a member of the three parties of which the House was then composed who did not honestly and conscientiously believe that that measure would And what it does it go a long way to prevent industrial strife, and all three parties supported it unanimously.

When Mr Justice Higgins declared that, no matter what verdict might be given by the Court, men could not be compelled to work, or to obey the order of the Court, the usefulness of the measure departed. There cannot be arbitration of any advantage to the community unless both sides to a case are compelled to accept the verdict, whether it be in their favour or against them, or a compromise. The Arbitration Court has outlived its usefulness, and to-day is rather a barrier to industrial peace than the means of securing it . The President of the Court has been asked to do the impossible. He has been asked to determine the conditions of all kinds of industries. Some of the Court's decisions have been positively ludicrousr Never was a more insane and stupid decision given by any Court than that of the President that the salary of the members of the Merchant Officers Guild must depend on the size of the ship on which they were employed. Consequently, the master of a collier of 5,000 tons, carrying a crew only, which is tied up. for more than half of its, time, gets more than the master of the Loongana, a vessel of much smaller dimensions, which carries on an average, all told, 400 passengers and crew, and during the summer season clears Port Phillip and Low Heads once every day. The master of the Loongana has ten times the responsibility of the master of the collier. Then, ou the light passenger boats, with high-powered engines, the engineers in many cases receive more than the captains. ganization. MrM c WILLIAMS to the stupidity of the decision which I am criticising, which is as absurd as it would be to handicap horses entered for the Melbourne Cup according to their size'and weight. No one who had to appoint two men, one to be captain of the Loongana, and the other to be the captain of a large collier, would p u t the better man on the collier. a money-making vessel, upon which the .accommodation is abominable MrM c WILLIAMS I have done my best to assist the honourable member in getting the accommodation improved, and I have done as much as any man in this House to secure; better accommodation for the seamen. MrM c WILLIAMS Thank you. -It is impossible for any one man to determine properly what conditions should prevail in the shearing, engineering, shipping, and all other industries. The congestion in the Arbitration Court became so bad that in many cases plaints remained eighteen months unheard, and a direct incentive to strike was offered by reason of the fact that when an organization that had a plaint before the Court struck, its case was moved, perhaps from the bottom' of the list, to the top, and heard before those of the organization that remained quiet. the Act. MrM c WILLIAMS It was the fault of the Act , because the Act required a Judge to do more than it was humanly possible for one man to do. Organization after organization has refused to go before the Court. I have said here and elsewhere that the present system should be amended or ended. The measure passed last week entirely supersedes the Arbitration Court, and If a i l to see a reason for continuing to expend money on it uselessly. The organizations are certain to prefer the methods of arbitration for which we provided last week. Why, then, should we duplicate machinery and staffs, as has been done before and so often? That is a thing against which I have protested time after time. No reasonable expense would be too great for the securing of industrial peace. I heard it said that the Bill passed last week would be costly because T h a t is due to better orof the number of Boards created. But my reply was that a big strike of .coal No ; it is due miners, shearers, seamen, or others would cost more than would be spent under the Act during a period of ten years. I cannot understand any body of workmen preferring the present Court to a Tribunal on which they will have three representatives, who will confer across a table with three representatives of the employers. I know the feeling of the House is that the Arbitration Court, which, to my mind, is inept, ineffectual, and an excrescence on our industrial life, should be continued. I urge the Government to give tha new measure every chance., and to allow the organizations of employees and the employers to settle their difficulties by means of the new procedure rather than the Arbitration CourtI f that be",30,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

141,Mr Riley,"T h a t was not the faul t ofdone, I think that it -will be found next year that the Court has ceased to be of use. I think that it reached that stage long ago, and I hope that Parliament will not hesitate to sweep away the whole of the paraphernalia of the Court. It has been ineffectual, and a source of discord for the last three years. Instead of preventing strikes during that time, it has been a breeder of strikes, because men have had to strike in order to have their cases dealt with by it. Organizations whose plaints were at the bottom of the list have struck, with the result that their cases have been dealt with in advance of others which have been awaiting a hearing for months, and in some cases for a year. Organizations which have loyally obeyed the behests of the Court;-whic h have declined to strike-and have been waiting for months to have their cases dealt with, have thus been penalized. I do not desire to be too severely critical of the decisions of the Court; but many of them have been quite useless. Quite a number of them have been absurd, and the whole procedure of the Court-for the last three years has tended to create rather than to prevent strikes. I hope the day is now at hand when the Court, with all the expenditure it involves, will be swept away, and the employers 'and employees will take advantage of the Industrial Peace Bill, which we passed last Aveek. By transferring the decision of grievances to the employers and employees-to the men actually concerned-as is provided for in the Industrial Peace Bill, we shall do a thousand times more than the Court can do to put 'an end to the industrial strife which at the present time is a serious menace to the peace, progress, and prosperity of Australia. I am surprised that the honourable member have declared that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been a breeder of strikes, and I hope that he will follow up his speech by voting against this Bill, so that we shall know exactly where he stands. My desire is that honourable members shall endeavour to promote industrial peace, instead of trying to stir up strife by utterances such as those in which my honourable friend has just indulged. Let us consider for a moment what the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has done. Take the history of the pastoral industry since the establishment of that Court. The largest organization of Labour in Australia is associated with that industry, and has sworn its allegiance to the Court. Awards have been made by the Court, and agreements between the pastoralists and the unionists have been registered by it, with the result that, since its creation, despite ' all its faults, there has not been a strike in the (pastoral industry throughout the Commonwealth. If the Oourt had done no more than secure industrial peace in that, the key industry of the Commonwealth, it would deserve well of the country. There are 100,000 men in the Australian Workers Union, and, although the awards which they have secured have not always satisfied them, nor pleased the employers in every instance, they have obeyed them and have observed the Act. Quite recently the men took a ballot to determine whether they should withdraw from the Court, and they decided to remain loyal to it. The honorliams) comes from a small State, and seems to be oblivious of the conditions under which we are living at the present time. It is true that we have had industrial' disputes, even since the establishment of. the Court, but we have fewer strikes here than in any other part of the world. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), on his return from a tour of the world recently, testified to that fact. _ He declared that no country is enjoying the industrial peace that we have, and that our freedom from serious industrial trouble is due to the training of the industrial unions to look to the Courts and Boards for the settlement of their grievances. We certainly have industrial disputes; but, unlike the big strike disturbances which take place in some countries, they are not attended with any destruction of property, but are conducted in lan excellent spirit. I look back with pleasure upon the work of this Court, which is one of the monuments standing to the credit of this Parliament. It is all very well to find fault with the Court for its failure to prevent strikes. We admit that it has not done away with industrial disputes, but it is beyond the ingenuity of man to devise machinery that would wholly prevent them. From the moment that we ceased to have industrial disputes we would begin to fall back. It is a fine spirit that leads men to strive to improve the conditions of the",31,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

The old Arbitration Act of New South Wales remained in operation for six years, and during that time did good work. Since it provided for an entirely new system the industrial organizations naturally availed themselves of it, with the result that the Court became congested, just as we have a congestion of business at the present time in the Commonwealth Court. That, however, is due, not to any failure of the principle of arbitration, but to the overworking of the Court. Leader of our party ( Mr Charlton) has intimated that he proposes to move to amend the Bill in a certain direction. A most decided improvement would be to provide that in addition to the President of the Court there shall be two laymen on the Bench, one elected by the employers and the other by the employees. The recognition of representatives of the employers and the employees as part of the Court would be beneficial to the whole industrial community. mean duplicating the measure which we passed last week. any duplication if by means of it we secured industrial peace. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) pointed out last week that when you go into the Conciliation land Arbitration Court you see on the Bench a Judge wearing wig and gown, and on every hand all the paraphernalia of an ordinary Court of law. That is not what we want in connection with arbitration. What we need is a Court of equity and good judgment. Dr. .MALONEY -And lawyers should not be allowed to appear before it. direction in which the Bill might be amended with advantage to the whole community. capable he may be, cannot be expected to grasp the details of every industry. Today a claim made by the carpenters and joiners comes before him, and for the next three weeks he is occupied in hearing evidence in regard to it. He masters every intricacy of the trade, and ultimately gives a judgment which brings about industrial peace in the industry. On the following day he begins the hearing of a dispute relating to the boot trade, and is expected to assimilate all the details relating to the many branches of that industry. He has no sooner completed the hearing of that case than he has to deal with, say, ia marine engineers' dispute. No one man can grasp the details of every industry, and, therefore, the presiding Judge should be assisted in every case by two practical men, representatives of the employers and the employees. If that were done, arbitration would be attended with greater success. I am pleased that the Deputy As the honourable membeT for Wentworth said last week, the proceedings should not be conducted in a Court. The parties to it should sit round a table, and the proceedings should be free from Court frills. Another wise amendment of the Act would be to exclude members of the legal profession from the Court. I have seen lawyers in a case looking at the clock again and again orable member was on the Arbitration Court Bench of New South Wales. them to argue at length little details of no consequence. bad as those who are not lawyers. point I wish to make is that lawyers will argue about little things that are not vital to a case, with the result that the proceedings are unduly Drotracted. I do not say that this is done deliberately they receive by way of fees from twenty guineas to fifty guineas per day? sire of the House is to make the Act as perfect as possible, since the great industrial organizations of Australia have not lost faith in the principle of arbitration. They believe in it. They will have faith A Judge, no matter how also in the Industrial Peace Bill passed last week if it will reduce the pressure on the Arbitration Court.

153,_ Mr Riley,"No; but I think the dethemselves of them. The honourable member for Franklin has said that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is obsolete; but I would remind him that other countries are following the lines laid down by us in establishing that Court. Even in Russia Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes are being set up. The honourable member may regard the Court as a failure, but where should we have been without it? In the absence of the system for which it provides, we should have had strikes all over the country. The secretaries and other officials of unions do not encourage strikes. there is dissatisfaction amongst the members of a union, the officials say, "" Let us go to the Court."" All their efforts are in the direction of securing industrial peace, and if there were no arbitration machinery to which they could resort, there would be no industrial peace whatever. The Conciliation and Arbitration Court has hitherto had no power to vary an award; so that when the marine engineers,feeling the pressure of the high cost of living, applied some time ago for a variation of their award-whic h had still a certain time to run-and intimated that they were prepared to abide by the decision of the Court, they were told that the' Court had no power to grant their request. They were thus unable to secure any redress, aud the only course open to them was to strike. remedy that position, since it will give the Court power to vary its awards. That, I think, will make the Court more popular. The seamen also desired to obtain a variation of their award. told the gas-workers, when they approached the Court to obtain a variation of their award, "" I can give you only Id. per day extra."" is not popular; but that is due to its limited powers under the Act. I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court should be vested with all the powers which can be conferred upon it under the Constitution. In view of prospective industrial upheavals, the Conciliation and Arbitration 'Court is at this moment the most important in the Oommonwealth. The ordinary criminal, equity, divorce, and other Courts do not perform functions which so nearly affect the immediate interests of the people at large; for the Arbitration Oourt keeps the wheels of industry going, keeps people employed, produces wealth, and assists largely in the general development of the country. Parliament should do everything in its power to make such a Court a complete success, and that, I believe, is the desire, not only of honourable members on this side, but of honourable members opposite. IfI trust that when in Committee we shall deal with the Bill in the same spirit that we imported into the discussion of the Industrial Peace Bill, and make the measure as perfect as possible. We on this Bide have nodesire to see industrial disputes; on the contrary, we wish to see the country develop and prosper throughout. This can be achieved only by promoting harmony between the employers and the employed, and giving, a fair deal all round. The honourable member for only way in which the workers can come before the Court is by striking; but I ask, What other action has been left to them, seeing that if they go to the Court they can get no redress ? The conditions up to the present have offered a premium on striking; but this Bill will, I believe, relieve the position, and provide means of settlementr I shall support an amendThis Bill will ment to reconstruct the Conciliation and Arbitration Court by providing that a representative (of the employers and a representative of the employed be elected by their fellows to sit with the Judge, and give him the benefit of their practical experience. .This would give new life to industrial arbitration, and materially help in the settlement of disputes. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), but I must say I was taken a little aback by certain of the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin .member, I think, wrongly blames the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, which was instituted in 1904 as the first Court of the kind in the history of this country. Because the Court does not al-",33,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

A Conciliation and Arbitration Court should be a Court of justice, but it frequently becomes a Court all know that the Legislature, at an earlier of ""law, where, on technical grounds, appellants are unable to obtain justice. We all hope that the measure before us will have the effect of doing away with inin the hearing of claims, and would have dustrial disputes The opinion is freely expressed outside that the measure was originally intended to remove Mr Justice Higgins from his high position as President of the Court; but if such a thing were attempted I am sure the community generally would not permit it. I have studied Mr Justice Higgins for over twenty-five years, and I do not think that l t is quite impossible for the Court to be any man has better graced the Bench, in spite of the fact that he has been largely does not co-operate with it ; and it is "" handcuffed ""-tie d down by legal enactequally impossible if the legislature will ments that should long ago have been amended. The cloak that fell from the dead shoulders of the late Chief Justice Higinbotham has found a worthy wearer in the person of Mr Justice Higgins; and more than that I cannot say. It may be that when, perhaps a little heated, and with all his knowledge of the intricacies of the law, he has felt himself "" cribb'd, remains constant while a particular award cabin'd, and confin'd,"" may have expressed himself in such a way as to hurt the feelings of some people. But the fact that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has received the endorsement of the most powerful organization in Australia, the Australian Workers Union, an organization which, in proportion to population, is greater than any in the United Kingdom, is a monument to the good it has done in this community. As the honourable inember for South Sydney said, the Divorce, Equity, and other Courts do not concern the lives of the people of Australia so nearly as does the Arbitration Oourt. I trust that honourable members will take the advice of those better versed in the matters at issue than the majority of us, including myself, can possibly be. The Bill is capable of doing great good, and I shall strenuously oppose any efforts sent President of the Court. No one will deny that arbitration has done industrial peace in this country since thc establishment of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. But no much more successful if certain of the obstacles which were in its way had been removed earlier by the Legislature. We period than this, could have made certain amendments of the law, which would have prevented the delays that take place removed the Serbonian bog which blocks the approach to the Court. Although the Arbitration Court itself may do a great deal of good-and we must all admit that it has-still , in order to have it thoroughly effective, it is necessary that the other branches of government should co-operate with it, and simultaneously do their part, a success if the Executive Government not confer on the Court the necessary powers which it could confer. After all, Ave must not shut our eyes to the facts of the case. No system of arbitration, and no tribunal set up for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, can be successful until some means is found of seeing that the purchasing poAver of Avages is in force. If the cost of commodities can constantly rise after an award has been made, and there is no machinery for a corresponding increase in Avages, the natural result must be industrial unrest and strikes. Governments Avhich do not realize this fact and remove the evil fail in their duty; and the reason is not far to seek. Governments very often represent particular interests; they do not stand for the interests of the workers and Avageearners, and, consequently, there is ahvays",34,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng
159,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [12.53],"a balance thrown into tbe scale against tbe workers. While that is so, it is impossible for any Arbitration Court or Tribunal to maintain industrial peace. We must .admit that there is sufficient production to enable a fair share to be given to all. "" slice of the cake/' if I may so term it, and as they are entitled to a share, it is our clear duty to see that they get it. It is our duty as a Legislature to confer such powers on Courts of Arbitration and similar Tribunals a3 to insure that the wage-earners shall receive a fair iand full share of the results of their labour in production. this, there is no system of arbitration, and no Tribunal, that can prevent industrial unrest and strikes. It is idle for us There is far too much apologetic attitude to talk about making this or that amendment unless we are prepared to face the real issue, and demand, at the same time, that the Legislature and the Executive Government shall each do its particular part. It is no use blaming the Court for industrial -unrest while we fail to insist upon all branches of government doing their duty. In short, we must haye the co-operation of all the arms of government. When I was speaking on a Bill which we recently passed with a view to setting up certain Tribunals for dealing with industrial unrest, I referred to the fact, vvhich I may be permitted to refer to again, that this Parliament failed to base the power of the Tribunals on all the conplete success from any Tribunal estabstitutional powers of this Parliament. The Tribunals in that measure were permitted to rest on a particular power of the Constitution given by section 51, sub-section xxxv., "" to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to Conciliation and Arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.' We could rest the power of the 5 Tribunals on all the powers given to the Commonwealth under section 51, but Parliament has refused to exercise all the powers it possesses; and while that is so, we invite the decisions of such Tribunals to be challenged on constitutional grounds. Under the circumstances, we cannot hope to see the Tribunals a complete success. I do not hesitate to say now that any Government that fails to exercise all its Mr Ryan. powers-fail s to confer all the power it can on these Tribunals-fail s to do its duty with regard to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and to the maintenance of industrial peace. And this the Government have refused to do. The workers demand a It would be very pleasant if I could rise here and pass compliments across to the other side, with an assurance that they are doing everything they can to bring about industrial peace; but I know that the Government are not using the instrumentalities and the powers they have. We should be failing in our duty to the great body of wage-earners and workers Unless we are able to do outside, who look to us, if we did not have the courage to stand up and tell the Government wherein they fail in their duty. to the Government in connection with this matter. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. I was referring to the necessity, if we are to do. our best to maintain industrial peace, oT having a complete co-operation of all the arms of governiment; we must not throw the whole onus upon the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration or upon any other Tribunal. No one can deny that the Government have failed to give the Arbitration Court the assistance that is necessary, and until Parliav ment insists upon action in that direction we cannot hope to have comlished for the settlement of industrial disputes? A Tribunal must be clothed with the power to investigate from the point of -production to the consuming point, and authority must be given for a complete investigation of that character so that a proper distribution or apportionment to labour engaged in production may be made. The Government have utterly failed in the past, and are still failing to do anything to remove the most serious cause of industrial unrestrampant profiteering-and while that is allowed to continue we are sure to have industrial unrest. Instead of endeavouring to restrict profiteering tlie Government have deliberately set about repealing those regulations which gave them power over those who were charging excessive prices. I am prepared to go further and say that the Government by their action",35,Conciliation An D Arbitration Bill Second Readtng

Every reasonable man will admit that it ""is time the War Preto do that, but until we do take such cautions Act was repealed, and that no further regulations are issued under it. Much of the trouble we are experiencing to-day is directly traceable to the powers the Government have exercised under that Statute. The Government have used their authority in a most unreasonable way, and I can quote as an example-^apart from the regulation relating to the marine engineersa regulation passed the other day, which waa laid on' the table of this House, conferring on the Government the power to charge to Consolidated Revenue the losses incurred in connection with the requisitioning of ships. that provision was made for the requisitioning of ships under the War Precautions Act, and that originally a regulation was framed which specifically prohibited the charging of any loss or expenditure incurred try Consolidated Revenue, we naturally wonder why it is now necessary for the Government, without coming to Parliament for authority, to charge such losses in the manner mentioned. I presume it was the seamen's dispute which led ' to the holding up of ships in different ports, and the Executive Government, under the War Precautions Act, have made this the expense of the taxpayers of Australia, and not of the shipping companies. shipping companies apparently were allowed to go on making their profits, and the seamen were being fought with the taxpayers' money. The men were really fighting themselves. While that sort of thing is allowed to continue we cannot hope to have industrial peace, and we might as well face the position source, which is the incapacity of the Godustrial unrest.

We all wish for industrial peace, efficiency, and the maximum of production, so that we may be able to discharge our great financial obligations and responsibilities, but we do not all combine to remove the causes that are hampering us in the attainment of that end. I hope that either the Minister will of his own volition ask for the report I have suggested from the President of the Arbitration Court, than whom I know of nobody more qualified and more willing to give a report that will be When we remember helpful to the country, or, if the Minister will not do that, that honourable members will join together and exert the power they undoubtedly possess to compel such a report to be obtained. rise mainly for the purpose of expressing regret that a suggestion I made during the last election campaign has not been adopted, because I think it would be one of the best possible means, if not of preventing strikes altogether, at any rate of reducing their duration.

Some people are always desirous of holding the working community responsible for industrial unrest,' and, sometimes, for trade depression; in fact, anything that goes wrong with the industrial and social system is debited to the account of the working man. means of protecting the worker from these gross libels are limited, because' of the fact that those who constitute the real driving force of dissatisfaction control the newspapers and means of propaganda. As one who has worked in the factory and workshop I have known what it is to be deprived of my legitimate rights, because of the commercial pirates of society who, by excessive charges, usurped the advantages momentarily received. Even the honourable Herbert( Mr Bamford), who has been associated movement all his life, has . so far fallen from grace as to have failed to appreciate the conditions with which the workers now have to contend; and he is actually willing to aid and abet those agencies of employerdom which are -always making inroads upon the working community while, at the same time, endeavouring to place the entire blame for social disturbance at their door. thing of the sort. judge of the remarks of the honourable member, and to say whether or not he evinced a desire to saddle the industrial community with the blame for to-day's unrest A few weeks ago I heard Professor Meredith Atkinson express views very similar to those of the honourable member for Herbert, whereby a solution for much of the present unrest, the -learned gentleman thought, could be found. If we are to bring about normal conditions we must first grant justice where it is due, and the forces creating industrial unrest must be eliminated. compelled, together with my fellow workers, to take a strong stand against what we have deemed injustice. Working men do not take extreme action, calculated to bring suffering and deprivation upon themselves and their families, unless they consider they have very good reason for so doing. If , however, there is good cause for dissatisfaction and extreme action is decided upon, it is always the working community that contends with the greatest sacrifice and sufferings in their noble attempts to right many a wrong and thus pass on to posterity more congenial conditions of labour and higher standards of living. The capiUnfortunately, our talist loses nothing. Because of his sharp practices in the manipulation of our economic system he passes on to the general community the extra charges for the inconvenience occasioned by social unrest. Strikes merely provide the medium for greater profits. I am not now referring to the retailer, who very often is also a victim of circumstances to the wholesale firms, which have proved so indifferent to public interests. There are,' however,' honest business men and traders, for whom I member for have the greatest respect. If there is some medium whereby an adjustment of existwith the working class ing conditions can be secured it is our duty to discover that medium and make full use of it. I hope that this Bill-for which honourable members on this side have been so long waiting-wil l be made as effective as possible. I candidly admit that before we can secure a really satisfactory form of arbitration there must be an alteration in the Constitution. If the people were taken into the confidence of the Government this Parliament would soon be given power to make laws much more effective. I leave the public to I was disappointed with the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Mcwilliams) He expressed no appreciation of the services rendered by the Arbitration Court. True, it has not done all that could have been wished, but it has made an honest attempt to overcome existing difficulties. Circumstances have been against it. Its Judges have been hampered and circumscribed by decisions of the High Court. They have been limited by the narrow scope of the Constitution; and, generally, the Federal Arbitration machinery has proved so cumbersome that the principle itself has Many times I have been been placed at a discount in the eyes of sections of the community. It is for this Parliament now to restore confidence in the Court. Delay in securing awards has been very largely responsible for existing dissatisfaction.

First, a log has to be prepared. It is collected and compiled as au outcome of the preliminary views expressed by various branches of an organization. A composite log is then framed by the central executive, and it has to be returned to the branches for endorsement or otherwise. pense with that. log is, of course, essential. I may say that I firmly believe in a basic wage rate being fixed, and for a corresponding percentage to be conceded over and above that to skilled trades, according to ability a mistake, even to the extent of a and capacity, and for a quarterly adjustment of all rates on a percentage equivalent to the increased cost of living cedure: the log has next to be served upon the employers concerned, after which the organization must further intimate to the employers that if they do not choose to comply with the rates and conditions set forth, the matter must go before the Arbitration Court. Next, in order to establish in the eyes of the Court that there is a dispute, the trade organization must secure from an employee in t each of the workshops involved a signed and witnessed affidavit that he has a grievance and desires an amendment of his working conditions. must then be signed by the person collecting the signatures, in the presence of a justice of t i e peace. With regard to the organizations of engineers to which I am attached, two months were occupied in securing necessary signatures before a plaint could be presented to the Court. Unfortunately, under' our present form of arbitration, a common rule cannot be established, and it is possible for one empost. Its case must be sufficiently clear ployer to be cited by a particular organization, and required to observe the terms of an award, while his neighbour, employing members of another organization engaged in the same form of industry, or even persons who are not members of any organization whatever, may be quite immune from the responsibilities attaching to the award. I repeat that the delay in the original Act empowering the Arbitration Court to make the common rule, but I propose to relate the the High Court decided that our constitutional powers in that regard were limited. 5 there gross anomalies in the original Act, but we are also circumscribed by the limitation of our Constitution, demonstrating the need for extending to the Commonwealth Parliament greater power to deal with such matters. Reverting to the procedure an organization mu3t follow before it can approach the Arbitration Court, after the signing of the authorization and the affidavit, a list of all persons to be cited to the hearing of the plaint before the Court must be prepared and printed; and if there is printer's error in the spelling of any employer's name, it is possible that the employer thus wrongly indicated may To continue with the proescape the responsibility of adhering to any award which is given. In the case of the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Association, C. ancl G. Hoskins Limited were cited; but, as the proper designation of the firm is G. and C. Hoskins Limited,' the error would enable it to escape the responsibilities attaching to any award. identified in legal proceedings, otherwise innocent persons may suffer. An affidavit step the society has to take is to serve a plaint upon the employers. It is well known that a legal summons is usually delivered into the hand of ths person to whom it is addressed; but, to overcome the difficulties attaching to personal service, it is necessary for ah organization to apply to the High Court for an order for substituted service, which will enable plaints to be served by registered to show that there is a dispute in existence, otherwise the Court will not sanction substituted service. The organization must next make an application for a chamber summons, and so on.

I have no desire to unduly delay the proceedings to-day, but I felt it my duty to place before honourable members the views held by many members of the working community. It is our desire to obtain a medium of redress which will be expeditious and will not involve the necessity for taking that action which requires the greatest sacrifice on the part of the workers when endeavouring to uphold the claim for improved conditions in industry. to be made binding. a difficulty in the Act, which I am hopef u l we shall be able to overcome. An award is made for a certain period, although circumstances may afterwards arise considerably altering affairs, and which in normal circumstances would have governed the award. such alterations. that the provision in clause 10 is too ambiguous, although the phraseology may appeal to the great majority as being sufficiently effective. I do not think it is explicit enough to absolutely guarantee that it means what it endeavours to express. In Committee, I shall move to add the following words to the clause:"" Provided that the period so specified can, on application to the Court, be varied if the Court be satisfied that such variation is just."" If we had had such a provision in the Act, many of the past outbreaks of industrial unrest a night possibly have been avoided. Another requisite is to make awards retrospective. It can be readily understood that the employees in the engineering trade are greatly dissatisfied when they realize, that, although their case has been in preparation for over twelve months, they have not been able to obtain admission to the Court, and that when any award is made it will date only from the time of its delivery. Awards should date from the time of the submission of plaints. There would be much greater satisfaction in the industrial sphere if ample provision were made in this Bill to make awards so retrospective. Dissatisfaction exists at the present time because the workers feel that continual delays, which are brought about by legal technicalities, are not only depriving them of their just dues, but also involving them in a great expense in litigation which they should not be asked to incur when endeavouring to obtain justice. I am hopeful that, in Committee, the various amendments suggested by our experience of the .operation of the Arbitration Act since this method of settling industrial disputes has been accepted in this country will be adopted, thus enabling us to mould the Bill in a form that will give the greatest amount of satisfaction to the great body of men who are subject to the decisions of ArbiI n that Tespect ""there is tration Courts, but who, unfortunately, owing to the limitations of the existing Act, as well as our Constitution, have been seriously and severely handicapped time after time by being deprived of their just dues.

For years business was carried on ou the Kalgoorlie Field by industrial agreements that were registered in the Arbitration Court. matters in dispute were settled between organizations of employers and employees without any appeal to the Court. It has been only in later days that appeals have been made to the Court, and that has given rise to some of the bitter feeling that has grown up. I hope that in the near future we shall get to work.

The workers have passed through a very difficult period, and the Act should have been amended long ago. Had the Government possessed the business instinct, they would Tiave long since introduced a special provision for the automatic in creasing of wages, in accordance with the increase in the cost of living, without any appeal to the Court, the increases being highest for the lower rates of pay. This should have been done a year or two after the warstarted. Hadi t been done, it would have prevented much industrial turmoil and agitation, one of the chief grievances of the workers being that they could not carry on under the awards that they have got. I am pleased that power is to be given to alter awards. The law should be binding on every person who goes to the Arbitration Court, .whether he be an employer or a worker. An A ct which is obligatory on one party and not on another-is unfair, unjust, and immoral, and should not remain on the statute-book.

I have gleaned from the reports of deputations in Western Australia recently that a demand has been made upon tlie farmers to comply with certain rules of the Shearers Union. The shearers' representatives have gone to the farmers and said to them, ' ' We want you to enter into an agreement with us.

It is time that we realized the injustice of existing conditions. I hope that in Committee honourable members will endeavour to make the Bill a workable one by providing every facility for approaching the Court and for doing away with the. enormous expense which has hitherto been incurred in getting there. Some eighteen months ago, in connection with the waterside workers' case, representatives of various organizations from Queensland and the other States were kept in Melbourne for more than three months. Upon that occasion the expense to the employers alone amounted to more than £20,000. necessarily to be passed on to the general community. We ought, therefore, to endeavour to prevent a repetition of such delays and to obviate the expense that is involved in getting plaints before the Court. When once an award has been given we ought also to provide that its terms may be varied so as to make them in agcord with any increase in the cost of living.

ThinkingI had made a mistake, I wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and was informed by him that the matter was in the hands of the Attorney-General's Department. The other day I asked some further questions, upon this subject, and in reply was told that if any person in Queensland or elsewhere who had these articles for sale would communicate with that Department, specific replies would be given. We cannot continue to carry on trade in this manner. Shortly after the outbreak of war I felt very much aggrieved at the embargo which was placed upon metals generally. steel and scrap iron cannot be so very serious a matter. matter, but a precedent is being established, and a question of principle is involved. an incident that took place some time ago in connection with the disposal of scrap tin ? At a time when Japan was offering £4 15s., f.o.b., for scrap tin, I produced a contract, made through Messrs. Dalgety and Compaaay, for the sale of 500 tons, but the Attorney-General's Department refused to allow it to go out of the country. The result was that it had to be sent, to a local factory, the owners of give anything for it unless they were able to make a profit out of its treatment. The proprietors of this scrap tin had to become responsible for the cost of treating it, and the owners mation of the Zinc Producers Association ' of the plant had the right to take 25 per cent, of any profit made. We have had too much of that sort of interference on the part of the Government. Apparently, an embargo has now been placed on the export of scrap iron and scrap steel. A merchant in Western Australia asked for a permit to export such material, but received a refusal from the Metal Exchange. This House knows nothing of the Metal Exchange. from this Chamber. When I brought the -matter before the Prime Minister's Department, I was told that it was not the Metal Exchange, but the Attorney-General's Department, that had refused the But although I permit. I had, however, a copy of the actual refusal by the Metal Exchange, and sent it to the Prime Minister's Department. must have been moved by some Government official to take that action. some one has started to set up, in Western Australia, a plant for the electrolytic treatment of scrap steel and iron. It may 'be in the best interests of Australia that the export of such material should not be permitted. I do not admit that it is, but, assuming that it is, the Government, as soon as it imposed that embargo, should have immediately prepared regulations to insure that those who have scrap iron and steel for sale will get a fair price for it. These people tell me that at the present time there is no buyer in Western Australia for this scrap, and they cannot dispose of it, but I can get no information from the Government as to whether or not its export will be perDoes the Treasurer remember mitted. If there is no local buyer, there can be no reason for the continuance of the embargo. When questions are asked here, it is the duty of the Government to try, especially in its correspondence, to supply clear and lucid answers.

Last night we had a confession by the Government that, as a result of their bungling administration of the Department of Trade and Customs, £1,000,000 had been lost. The Treasurer tells us that the Government cannot afford to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, although the present rate is not sufficient to keep body and soul together.
