There is little likelihood that the Commonwealth would be prepared to continue the establishment there unless the for next year. State of New South Wales is prepared to transfer the island to the Commonwealth without payment. Minister is dealing with this matter will he take into consideration the recommendation of the naval advisers of the Government that the naval base should be removed from the port of Sydney altogether, and whether it should not be transferred to Port Stephens as originally intended ? Government must give consideration to the whole matter. It is also certain that the recommendations that have been made in regard to Port Stephens which, if carried out, would involve the complete removal of the naval base from Sydney, must have the consideration of the Government.

There is no agreement to carry out this work, and there would be no breach of an agreement if it were never carried out. An agreement with the State of South'Australia gives us a permissive right to build the line if we wish to do so.

I have not yet been informed whether the other dominions have moved to have the treaty ratified, but I have no doubt that the ratifications on behalf of all the nations comprising the British Empire will be deposited at ""Washington in the near future. The Government does not propose to offer facilities for debating the treaty in this Parliament, because it was submitted to and fully discussed in this Parliament last year.

The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and the Railways Commissioners of Victoria were asked to report as to the saving, improved traffic facilities, and other benefits that might result from the work.

Will he make provision in the immediate future for the installation of a similar set on Cape Barren Island, where about 250 people at present residing are often isolated for long periods owing to an unsatisfactory mail service? honourable member's questions are as follow:1 and 2. The department, during the past five years', has frequently given consideration to establishing wireless communication for isolated settlers, but the cost of providing such services, except in one or two instances, has been found to be unjustified by the very small return that would be received. As an alternative, the department has encouraged settlers to establish their own services, and in this connection has authorized the Australian Inland Mission to install several low-power sets as an experiment. The comprehensive results of these experiments are not yet known, but information is now expected in reply to inquiries recently made. 3, On receipt of that information, further consideration will be given to the Cape Barren Island case, which has already been investigated.

Some accounts are still honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is proposed to examine this matter further before reaching a decision. A reply will be furnished later. 2. The radio telephone connection between Tasmania and the mainland cannot be tapped at intermediate points for telephone service to those points. It is therefore impracticable to give telephone service to Flinders Island by this means. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. In view of the fact that the home, independent of .its value, is secured to the old-age pensioner without deduction from the pension, provided that no income is obtained by the letting of rooms, will the Minister request the Government to make more equitable regulations, so that the old-age pensioner who has saved two or three hundred pounds will not be deprived of pension, when such pensioner reaches the statutory age? bodies the principle that any amount of property used as a home, even though exceeding £300, is not taken into account in determining the amount of an old-age pension. Further any claimant whose property does not exceed £400 may receive a pension, though a reduction is made in the amount of pension where the property exceeds £50. It is not As a result of his promise to look into the many vexatious and unnecessary questions old age pension applicants have to answer, has he decided to eliminate any of these questions? which applicants for old-age pensions have to answer have been reduced to a",18,Canberra Expenditure

Yes. 2, 3, and 4. The question of prohibiting the importation^ of Alsatian dogs has been under consideration, but further inquiries are being made for the purpose of reaching a decision. upon notice1. Has Ins attention been drawn to the issue of a special order by the Fascist organization calling upon all Fascists living abroad not only to wear the party badge, except where local laws forbid it , but to send their children to Italian schools. Fascists failing to observe this rule may be dismissed from the party as "" incapable of understanding the spirit and ideal of Fascism."" grating abroad in search of work must register immediately upon arrival with the local Fascio? 2. If so, what action ( if any) has been taken in connection with the matter? honourable member's questions, are as follow :1. Yes. 2. It is not considered that any special action is called for. The naturalization law of the Commonwealtli provides; inter alia, that naturalization shall not be granted to any alien without his first renouncing his former allegiance.

ELECTORAL LAW. D r . MALONEY asked the M in is t e r for Hom e A f f a i r s , upon notice1. Isi t a fact that, under the law in Great Britain providing for the registration of new voters, the question of age is simplified by the female voter being asked whether she is 21 years of age or over? 2. If so, in view of the fact that many of our women citizens object to giving their ages, will the Minister alter the regulation in order to show to the women of Australia the same consideration which is extended to the women of Great Britain? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is understood that in Great Britain upon the matter of age an elector has merely to state in the claim for enrolment that he or she has attained the qualifying age. 2. The information as to the date and place of birth which is required to be furnished by claimants for Commonwealth enrolment is a valuable aid in the maintenance of accurate rolls, in that it prevents the possibility of mistake in regard to the enrolment of persons bearing similar names, and affords protection to electors against the erroneous removal of their names on the ground of duplication in cases where two or more identical names appear on the rolls. It would be inadvisable to amend the form of claim. notice1. What is the present total net debt of the Moreover, Fascists emiCommonwealth ? 2.

Arc liver extract and tetanus vaccine manufactured hy the Commonwealth LaboraT h e answers to the tories; if so, what is the cost of same to tlie as people? answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. The process of extraction of liver extract is costly, and the price is doubtless fixed with regard to that fact. The extract is not made in Australia, and no duty is charged on its importation. It is understood that extract is available at the principal hospitals. 2. The cost of tetanus antitoxin is not considered to be unduly high. 3. Liver extract is not manufactured by tlie Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The price of tetanus .antitoxin, made by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, varies according to quantity from Is. 9d. for 500 units upwards. From 1,000 to 3,000 units is the minimum dose; larger doses are recommended in treatment, but there is considerable variation in tlie dosage used by physicians.

CHAIRMAN"" OF COMMITTEES. move That the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. Very few words are needed to commend this proposal to the approval of honourable members. Throughout its history this House has been very well served by the gentlemen chosen from time to time to preside over its deliberations. But by none have those duties been carried out with more conspicuous success than by the honourable member for Oxley, who occupied the position of Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament. His fairness, tact, and ability commended themselves to honourable members; his firmness, also, was gratifying to all. There may have been occasions when certain unruly members may have considered that firmness to have been carried too far, but on the whole those 1928-29; towho served in the last Parliament had very good reason to appreciate his conduct of the business in committee. together with have much pleasure in seconding the motion. The honourable member for Oxley as Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament displayed a thorougb knowledge of the rules of debate and parliamentary procedure. The honourable member for Oxley was Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, and I express my pleasure that he is likely to be re-elected to that office. I understand that ambition prompted him to aspire to greater heights, but to ensure success ambition should be made of sterner stuff. At one stage of strenuous debate during the last Parliament, I was impelled by a high sense of public duty to declare that the Chairman was then awake. I was immediately required by him to withdraw that statement. Obediently I said that the Chairman was not awake, and for that was asked to apologize. Thereupon I declared that the Chairman was neither asleep nor awake. He named me and sent for the Prime Minister, whose stern duty it was to propose that effect be given to Workers Act Regulations the disciplinary forms of the Committee. The result was that I , a docile and more",21,Pernicious Anaemia

I did not rise to congratulate you, Sir Littleton, upon being elected Speaker of this chamber, although I may tell you confidentially that if your position had been challenged I should undoubtedly have done my best to secure your retention in that high office. Not having congratulated you at the moment, sir, I take the liberty of doing so now, for that seems to be peculiarly relevant to the motion before the chamber. I believe that the highest office of the Parliament, that of Mr Speaker, should be left to the decision of the House and should not be the subject-matter of party manoeuvring. member to confine his remarks to the motion before the chair. desire me to pursue that line of discussion, sir, I shall cheerfully let it alone. 1 do not say that I would have proposed the honourable member for Oxley as Chairman of Committees; I merely congratulate him upon the fact that he is to be appointed. The honourable member has some excellent qualities which perhaps fit him for the position. On the other hand, a too intense loyalty to the friends of one's party should not be manifested by the Chairman of Committees. Friendship is an admirable quality. Loyalty to one's friends is desirable. Loyalty to one's party is at least a political virtue. But these are not qualities which should show in an incandescent light in the Chairman of Committees of a deliberative assembly. In congratulating the honourable member upon his prospective appointment, I may at least say that I accept it with Christian the knowledge that His Majesty's recovery resignation. I do not promise him an absolutely easy passage, but I assure him that the application of draconian methods will not be found to be the most effective way to discharge his duties. I hope that if he presides at all in the next Prime Minister and his Governmeut upon Parliament it will still be as Chairman of Committees. Question resolved in the affirmative. thank the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Hurry) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) for their remarks in moving and seconding the motion, and honourable members generally for supporting it. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) must, of course, have his little say; but one need not give much attention to it. I assure the House that I shall do my utmost to uphold the honour and dignity of the Committee. My one object will be to see that the forms of the Committee are properly observed. I trust that I may pursue that aim so long as I retain the office. The committee appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's speech (vide page 6), having presented the proposed address, it was read by the Clerk. I move That the following Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's speech be agreed toMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.

118,Mr Bayley (Oxley) [3.48],I,24,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
119,Mr G. Francis (Kennedy) [3.50],"a very remarkable record in tbe bistory of tlie Commonwealth by holding the office of Prime Minister in a continuous ministry for a longer period than any of his predecessors. That he has held office for so long and with such marked success is undoubtedly an evidence of the confidence that the people of Australia have in him. It is a matter of gratification to the citizens of the Commonwealth that Australia was one of the original signatories to the treaty for the renunciation of war. and that she has taken her stand with the Mother Country, than whom no other country has made such great sacrifices with the object of outlawing war. That the weather conditions over a large area of Queensland and New South Wales have greatly improved is also a matter for thanksgiving. A great deal more rain is still required in our pastoral and' farming areas to make the position satisfactory. Such rain as has so far fallen has relieved the position temporarily. The proceedings of the Industrial Conference are being hopefully watched. There never was a time in the history of the Commonwealth when it was more necessary that the employers and employees respectively should get together. Of late the spirit that has been abroad may be described in this way-""We enemies because we do not understand one another. We do not understand one another because we are enemies."" kind of thing takes us nowhere except into trouble, and it is time that those engaged in industry should recognize their complete oneness. Wages must come out of industry and industry must be profitable and prosperous before it can pay satisfactory wages. No one in this House desires more than I do to maintain a good standard of living and a high rate of wages-in fact the highest rate of wages that industry can pay. But a satisfactory position in industry is impossible without complete co-operation. The happenings of recent years cannot be allowed to continue. We have an Arbitration Court which at one time was held in the highest admiration by the Labour party. We were told that it was the panacea for all ills from which the community was suffering. If we consider the attitude which Mr G. Francis. the Labour party adopts to-day towards the Arbitration Court we may ask ourselves whether the Labour party is such except in name, or whether its ideals have changed. Time after time the so-called trade unions, which are largely political unions, have approached the Arbitration Court and asked that an award should be made. When the award has been made they have accepted it if it suited them, or have rejected it and declared that it was incapable of acceptance. Such conduct can only lead us into a morass of trouble and difficulty. We heard the references that were made to-day by the honourable member for Anstey ber for Bourke. orable member for Anstey deliberately, Mr Speaker, because I felt that the honourable member was representing nobody but himself when he made the remarks which I have in mind. I did not hear the honourable gentleman advance a single argument with the object of getting the workers of Australia to obey the laws of the land in order to avoid the plight of the coal miners to whom' he made reference. None of the so-called leaders of the Labour movement on the otlier side of the chamber have told us what will happen to our coal mining industry if the present course of action is continued. are In the last few years we have had the spectacle of many of our key industries being dislocated. It is a singular thing That that whenever a strike of any magnitude occurs it is in a key industry. First of all -we had the great maritime upheaval, for which there was not the slightest justification. Then there was 'the trouble in the coal mining industry. It must be apparent to everybody that there is something radically wrong in this industry when coal can be purchased practically anywhere in Europe, shipped 12,000 miles and landed on the wharf at Newcastle for 7s. a ton less than the price for which it can be purchased at the pit's mouth in the Newcastle district. Our timber industry is at present in a parlous condition. The Timber Workers' Union sought an award of the court and, having obtained it, refused to accept it, and decline to be bound by it. The men working in the industry are quite satisfied with the conditions which the judge of",24,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
120,Mr Speaker,Tb e honorablateiem,25,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
121,Mr G. Francis,"I said the honthe court has laid down, but the officers of the union are doing their utmost to hinder them from settling down honestly at their work. Several efforts have been made in this Parliament to increase the duties on timber, with the alleged object of protecting this industry, but we cannot go on for ever doing that kind of thing. The whole system must break down if we persist in attempting to apply the theory that the trade unions are above the law of the land and are not bound to uphold it. Although the rank and file of the Labour movement are steadfast in their desire to see Australia prosper they are led by men whose actions are not conducive to that end. The men are not. allowed to follow their own inclinations in regard to employment, with the result that both they and their employers suffer. These and cognate causes have been responsible for record unemployment throughout Australia. This unemployment is not due so much to seasonal difficulties as to the lack of security in industry, resulting from an absence of co-operation between employers and employees. These facts must be well known to honourable members opposite; but apparently they lack the courage to tell them to their supporters and members of trado unions. ""We are all looking for closer co-operation in industry as the outcome of the industrial conference which was inaugurated in Melbourne towards the end of last year, and I am sure that none will welcome it more than honourable members on this side of the House. There should be no unemployment in Australia. If we are to progress there must be a clear recognition of the fact that men who take a day's pay but give only half a day's work in return, are. neither more nor less than industrial parasites destroying the host upon which they live. But, unfortunately, the trouble does not end there. Industrialists who adopt this practice interfere seriously with the position of their fellow workers, because an inadequate return in industry sends up the cost of living against every person in the community. There is another. matter to which I desire to allude. I u recent years, attempts have been made throughout Australia by persons associated with political movements to interfere with the right of other men by constraining them to adopt a course of action which they do not necessarily desire to take. Trade unionists who, by the exercise of freedom of thought and action, incur the animosity of militant members of their organizations, have the opprobrious epithet of "" scab "" applied to them. This should not be tolerated in a free country like Australia. Every man who claims the right not to work himself, should also concede to another man the right to work if he so desires. Any man is at liberty to say that he will not work for a certain wage, or under certain conditions; but certainly he has no right to say that another man shall not take up his job if he chooses to do so. These are things that have to be recognized, and I believe the recognition of this principle will be the outcome of the further sessions of the industrial conference, because I am sure that all genuine workers in Australia desire peace in industry, so that they may share in its prosperity. I am exceedingly gratified to note that, in the main, the report.of the Economic Mission is a complete endorsement of the policy of this Government for sever a i years past. On the question of public borrowing, it is shown that the public debts of the States have grown from £519,000,000 in June, 1922, to £723,000,000 in June, 192S, an increase of £204,000,000. In the same period the Commonwealth public debt, exclusive , of loans raised for the States, increased by only £7,000,000. ThisI regard as convincing evidence of the economy practised by the present Government, and of its desire to restrict public expenditure. A considerable portion of the expenditure in certain of the States has been in connection with fantastic, socialistic enterprises, launched by State Labour governments in spite of their obvious unsoundness. Members of the Economic Mission, in their references to the increase in our public debt, pointed out that much of it was due to expenditure on developmental schemes undertaken without sufficient regard to their probable financial and economical results, or without adequate preliminary investigation of the schemes themselves. This is a matter to which the present Government has been directing attention for several years. Let me cite, as an illustration of my argument, what has happened in Queensland. The public debt of that State has increased from £56,000,000 in 1915 to £111,700,000 in 1928. This increase is due largely to socialistic enterprises undertaken by the ment. State butchers' shops, which were supposed to give the people cheaper meat, were established various centres. These shops did nothing of the kind. The meat was dearer and not necessarily of as good quality. This particular enterprise has cost the people of Queensland £1,406,580. The State Government has now reduced the number of State butchers' shops from 72 in 1923 to 45 in 1928, but still they are a losing proposition. At long last the deluded workers realize that these fantastic proposals do not give an adequate return, but that, on the contrary, they add to the financial requiring increased taxation, higher costs and by the multiplication of the unemployed. Indeed, so rapid has been the increase in unemployment in Queensland that the authorities have ceased to take statistics regarding unemployment in that State. I am hoping that the Government will be able to arrange for an extension of the term and a modification of the migration agreement with Great Britain, on the lines indicated by the Economic Mission. The mission suggests that the period of the agreement should be extended and that the money to be made available under it should be expended on works calculated to encourage migration without conditions governing the number of migrants to enter any particular State. The right honourable the Prime Minister, in his policy speech, urged that migration would be stimulated by the wise development of our natural resources. The extension of our primary and secondary industries has been the objective of this Government ever since it came into power, and for this and other reasons the Government is well worthy of the confidence of the people. The shortening of hours in industry, with the consequent decrease in output, is not calculated to benefit the workers, or indeed any section of the community. It may be true that the manufacturer is in a position to pass on increased charges; but if the increased cost is unduly burdensome to the Mr G. Francis. primary producer, the manufacturing industry must languish and many of those engaged in it will be in danger of losing their jobs. The Prime Minister State Govern( Mr Bruce) and the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) have properly emphasized that it is undesirable at to continue protecting inefficient industries. Any commercial or industrial concern, to be efficient, must be conducted on modern and scientific lines. The plant and machinery of an industry must be thoroughly up to date and the workmen employed in it must give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. If any of these factors are absent in an industry, it must necessarily be inefficient, and the Government would not be justified in giving it protection by means of customs duties. burden of the State by I am sure that all honourable members will welcome the announcement that the Government proposes to revert to the holding of regular sessions. This will enable honourable members, especially those living in distant States, to visit their constituencies at more frequent intervals, and generally it will facilitate the conduct of public business. I am glad that the referendum with regard to the proposed alteration of the Constitution, to enable the Commonwealth Government to make agreements with the States in respect of State public debts, was carried by such an overwhelming majority. It is most desirable that there should be greater co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, because this must result in the improvement of our credit in overseas money markets, and consequently bring about a reduction in the annual interest bill on our public debt. It will also restrict public borrowing. The granting of special financial assistance to certain of the States is, I am glad to note, receiving consideration. The manufacturing States of New South Wales and Victoria have been in an advantageous position ever since federation, in that they have been able to expand operations to meet the needs of primary producing States. The latter have been carrying on under certain difficulties due to the higher costs of manufactured goods, and it is only right that they should receive consideration at the hands of the Government. I notice with satisfaction that the Government contemplates an extension of civil aviation services. These are essential to the proper development of the back country, and at the same time they will strengthen Australia's home defences. I observe, also with pleasure, that it is the intention of the Government to extend economic research so as to carry on with greater vigour the work of the Oouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research. There is now general recognition of the importance of this new branch of governmental activity to ensure entymological control of diseases and pests, to appraise at its true worth the value of animal nutrition and various other matters of vital concern to primary production in Australia. Equally important is the adoption of a more up-todate system for the production and treatment of ores and metalliferous products. Work along these lines will make for the prosperity of Australia and must lead to an increase in employment. I am pleased that the Government proposes to repeal the coastal sections of the Navigation Act. It is high time that this was done. The act was designed to strengthen the Australian coastal maritime services, but it has failed utterly to do that. In spite of a substantial increase in population and a consequent greater production, the coastal provision* of the act have so operated as to strangle industry and hamper the activities of all those engaged in primary production. The subject of sea transport is important, and I am pleased, to notice that a conference of overseas and Australian interests is to be held for the purpose of discussing shipping facilities generally. At the same time. I again congratulate the Government on having sold the Australian Commonwealth .Shipping Line, thereby saving this country an enormous expenditure on the upkeep of this line, which gave little or no return to the community. The action of this Government has been endorsed, if any endorsement is necessary, by the action of the Government of the United States of America which is now considering the sale of the remainder of its fleet, in order to curtail the terrific years of the administration of the Comlosses that have been made by it for several years past. If that Government succeeds in selling its fleet, then Canada will be the only country in the world with a government-owned fleet. £100,000,000 to America! felt to any extent in America, but a loss of a half million pounds a year was more than Australia could afford, particularly as £600,000 had to be found to meet the interest on the aggregate loss. I notice with pleasure that the Postmaster-General proposes to extend the telephone activities of his department. I recognize that much has been done by that department during the last five or six years. I hope that it will be possible for the Postmaster-General to arrange for night telephone services in the country districts, because they are more important to country residents than day services. The Government policy of development for Northern Australia must commend itself to every honourable member, particularly to those on this side of the House because it has a close relation to thu white Australia policy. I look forward to the fulfilment of the contract made with South Australia by the Deakin Goverument to construct the north-south line, and also to the ultimate construction of a line from Daly Waters, through Camooweal, to Western Queensland. I wish, in conclusion, on behalf of the electors of Kennedy, to thank honourable members for the kind reception that they have given me. realize that a great honour was bestowed upon me when I was asked to second the motion for the adoption of the address-in reply which has been so ably nioved by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis). I join with other honourable members in their appreciation of His Excellency's statement respecting the improvement in the health of His Majesty the King, and we all hope that he will soon be restored to health. The policy enunciated by the Governor General is a continuation of the general policy of progress and development that has been carried out during the last six posite Government.

124,Mr Corser (Wide Bay) [4.17],"Imajority and its election promises are included in the speech of the Governor General. The great record of the present Administration, its humanitarian legislation, its desire to build up industry, and to do its best for every section of the community, have certainly been appreciated throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The prosperity that we now enjoy, even under adverse circumstances, and during industrial turmoil, when practically all parts of the world are suffering financially and industrially, is an evidence of the sound administration of the Commonwealth. The Government realizes clearly the problems that confront this young nation, and it has made every effort to solve them and to improve Australia's position. Recently it secured a report from the British Economic Mission which was sent here at the request of the Australian Government. The report of that body gives every honourable member of this House, and, indeed, every individual of the Commonwealth who appreciates our difficulties, food for reflexion. Our industrial difficulties are many, and it is a big problem to endeavour to satisfy all sections of the people. We do not wish to see one section of the community living in luxury and another section starving. We do not want one section to be paid huge wages in return for a small amount of work, while at the same time other sections are unemployed. want employment without results. Wages in industry, if this country is to develop, must be based on a certain amount of production for the money paid. We have great problems in our tariff regulations and reforms. When masters in industry take advantage of a tariff protection by unreasonable increases in prices, with a division of profits between employer and employee, an injustice is done to the community. With our present industrial difficulties we are likely at any time to have strikes and trade depressions. The Government is doing its utmost to overcome difficulties as they arise. Before our industries can progress' to any extent we must discredit the fallacy which is being propagated by a section of Australian citizens that it is impossible for employer and employee to work peaceably togetherthat their interests are not interwoven. Mr Corser. As a matter of fact, it is clearly evident to any reasonable person that the interests of all sections of the community are interwoven, whether they be employers or employees in secondary industries, or producers in our back country and consumers within Australia. Our interests are so interwoven that the Government was wise in its determination to secure a report from an independent and outside body as to the best means of bringing about the advancement and_ prosperity of Australia. The Government, to assist industry, has established a Council for Scientific and ' Industrial Research, and honourable members will be able to obtain from this institution valuable data to aid them in their deliberations on all subjects that are discussed in this Parliament. The council is to-day making investigations along scientific lines and its work has already proved of advantage to the pastoralists and the agriculturists of Australia, and, indeed, to many of our secondary industries. Tlie Government's policy has been to assist industries generally, so that all sections engaged may be benefited to the ultimate welfare of Australia. The Government also proposes to invite the State Governments to confer with it on transport matters, social legislation, health, and questions of general development. The Government recognizes the We do not necessity for the greatest co-operation between the various States and the Commonwealth in order to serve the best interests of Australia. All sections of the community should join together in bringing about the advancement of this country. We must realize that our problems affect not only Australia, but our oversea markets as well. These, if neglected to any extent, will be lost to us and gained by countries whose industries are organized. Australia can progress only if all sections pull together in matters of national importance. Much benefit has accrued from conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The recent Financial Agreement was the outcome of one such conference. It has already greatly benefited Australia. It has placed Australian loan issues on a safe basis, and ensures greater assistance in securing further moneys when required. The people of Australia have approved of the agreement, and it has been ratified by the State parliaments. The Commonwealth scheme of developmental roads was evolved at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Minister that during the forthcoming conference a discussion should take place on the general marketing of our primary products. Some scheme to facilitate the marketing of primary produce on an Australian basis might thus be evolved. It might be possible to form not only a branch of industry, but also a bureau of agriculture, which would act as a safeguard to the community, and be of assistance to the Governmeut in fixing tariffs and overcoming the economic difficulties of Australia. To-day a tariff placed on one primary industry may seriously interfere with another industry. I notice that a War Pensions Appeal Board is to be appointed. This is a splendid proposal, and will be of great advantage to many of our returned soldiers. the Appeal Board was disapproved by the Government some months ago. promised by the Prime Minister before the election campaign, and it is now provided for in the Government's policy. Last year the Government paid no less than £7,600,000 in the form of pensions for invalid soldiers. I hope many cases will now be adjusted to the soldiers' advantage. During the time the Composite Government has been in office approximately £73,000,000 has been expended in this way. During the same period about £186,000,000, exclusive of interest, has been spent on behalf of returned soldiers. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth should have been committed to such heavy war expenditure; but we are now all hopeful that, as the treaty for the renunciation of war has been signed, there will be peace between the nations, and that money which in the past has been spent for war purposes will be used on developmental works. I notice in the Governor General's speech that it is the intention of the Government to continue its naval programme. That is essential, as Australia, as a portion of the British Empire, should do its share in protecting this great country in which it is our privilege to live. The Government also proposes to I suggest to the Prime appoint a Wine Export Board in order to afford to grape-growers better facilities for marketing their products. The boards which have already been established by the Government, such as the Dairy Control Board and the Paterson scheme in connection with the butter industry, the Dried Fruits Export Control and others, have been of great benefit to the primary producers. The Government has also given considerable assistance to the sugar, banana, peanut, and cotton-growing industries, and has placed many producers of these products in more favorable circumstances. It is pleasing to note that, in addition to assisting the primary producers, the Government is also rendering valuable help to our secondary industries. The progressive policy of the Postal Department referred to by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Francis) is a pleasing feature of the Governor General's Speech, and I trust that the department will continue to provide telephonic communication, particularly to those who are assisting in the development of the more remote portions of the Commonwealth. The provision of telephonic communication renders conditions in the outback portions of the Commonwealth more attractive, and enables settlers to transact their business with greater facility. I trust it will not be long before the Postmaster-General will find it practicable to provide a continuous telephonic service in many country districts. As promised during the election campaign, the Government proposes during the forthcoming session, to embody the regulations framed under the Transport Workers' Act in that statute. It is also intended to proceed with a measure to provide for national insurance against sickness, invalidity, and death. The provisions of that measure were fully explained by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) during the last Parliament to enable friendly societies, employers, employees, and others interested in the scheme to study its provisions closely",28,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

126,Mr Corser,"Such a board wasbefore it was debated in this Parliament. Doubtless, it will receive the careful consideration of honourable members, and it is to be hoped that a scheme acceptable to all concerned will be evolved. Attention has been given by the Government to requests which have been made from time to time for a revision of the tariff, and although every effort has been made to provide a tariff acceptable to all parties, anomalies still exist. Efforts have been made to protect Australian, manufacturers against the products of coloured labour, and the Government now proposes to reconstitute the Tariff Board in such a way that requests for tariff revision may be more expeditiously investigated, and if possible a tariff adopted under which, when one industry is protected, another will not be detrimentally affected. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be of great assistance to the Tariff Board in its work of making recommendations upon which a scientific tariff can be framed. I sincerely trust that the Government will, at the earliest opportunity,, consider tbe recommendations of the Tariff Board in relation to the cotton industry, which at present is languishing owing to the lack of adequate assistance. Those engaged iu the cotton industry have experienced many difficulties. They have been in trouble ever since the Queensland Labour Government let them down very heavily. Since. then the Commonwealth Government has come to their assistance, without which it would have been impossible for them to have continued. As the marketing of the cotton crop commences in March or April, I trust that the recommendation which the board is submitting to the Government will be considered by this Parliament before the Easter adjournment. The Queensland cotton growers should be placed in a position to enable them to arrange for the marketing of their product in Australia during the present picking season. ber think that the Tariff Board is justified in delaying this matter for nine months ? debated during the election campaign in Queensland, and in some centres it was said that the board was not conducting an investigation. A t the time such statements were made the board had completed its inquiries in regard to the industry. its report. now awaiting the report, which I trust will be considered by Parliament before Easter. The subject of transport in Northern Australia is receiving the consideration of the Government, and as a representative of Queensland, if the construction of a railway is impracticable at present, I trust that, in the interests of the development of Western Queensland and Northern Australia, provision will be made for a main trunk road to connect the Western Queensland railway system with the North. I thank honourable members for the courtesy they have extended to me while seconding the motion so ably moved by the honourable member, for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis). terday we were summoned to attend in another place to hear the Governor General's Speech, which has been prepared by the Ministry for His Excellency. With other honourable members, I attended to hear the speech, and the only thing about it that was at all impressive, was the atmosphere in which it was read. According to the speech,, all that the Government proposes to do is to resurrect some old measures that have been in cold storage for some months, and to introduce perhaps one or two new proposals which are destructive rather than constructive. The speech on the whole consisted mainly of ponderous platitudes and unnecessary verbiage, employed in an endeavour to make it appear important. It reminded one of a phial filled with cotton wool and containing a few pills. The speech did not embody anything substantial or new. It consisted mainly of vague generalities. As for the serious problems confronting Australia to-day, there was little or no indication of any action to be taken beyond consideration by conferences. Let me give an example.

131,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.40],"Yespolicy speech, prior to the last general election, a number of promises were set out, one of which was that if the Government was returned it would endeavour to eliminate unemployment. I ask honourable members if , beyond convening conferences and holding discussions, there is any indication in the speech of any action in the direction of minimizing unemployment? Whilst the Government is committed to a policy of relieving unemployment, it is actually increasing the trouble by allowing goods made in foreign countries to flood the Australian market. There is no indication of any action to provide employment, although thousands of people in Australia are on the verge of starvation. Money is being wasted while the construction of necessary public works is being deferred. If the Government will bring forward a constructive policy and submit it to this House, it will receive every assistance from honourable members on this side of the chamber. Sufficient commissions, boards and committees have already been appointed, and it is time Parliament got down to business in order to justify its existence in the eyes of the people. The document handed to us yesterday is sufficient in itself to justify want of confidence in the Government. It indicates that the administration is incapable of handling the problems that confront us to-day. If the Government cannot shoulder its responsibilities it should bring them before the House, and give it an opportunty to see what it can do. If it does not provide honourable members with opportunities we shall have to make them. The Addressin-Eeply also consists of a series of generalities, and the discussion on this motion will be futile. I do not propose to assist in a futile discussion ment for holding his position through a If the Government has business to do, if it proposes to carry out those works which it promised to the people of Australia, let it drop this obsolete procedure one which, I predict, will be considerably and begin immediately upon the real problems of the country. Leader of the Opposition referred to the barrenness of the programme outlined in the Governor General's speech. The honourable member should be a very good judge of barrenness, seeing that the speech which he has just delivered was the most barren to which I have ever listened. He had really nothing to say against the Government, no criticism to advance concerning its policy, but after talking for some time he sat down like a whipped dog, and there has been a constant yapping going on behind him since. The honourable member must not use the word ""yapping"". Is the honourable member for Angas in order in referring to the Leader of the Opposition as a whipped dog? Chair is not aware that the honourable member for Angas referred to the Leader of the Opposition in those terms. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I said anything to annoy the Leader of the Opposition, but probably, since their defeat at the last elections, honourable members opposite are feeling very sore. Personally, I am in a very happy position, in that my actions which were frequently criticized in this House during last session, have been endorsed by the electors of my constituency, and I increased my majority from 250 to 8,046. That disposes of the assertion made once by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that I was present in this House through a fluke, and that after the next election h would have pleasure in welcoming my successor. I. congratulate the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) upon the excellent manner in which he moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The honourable member for Kennedy, like myself, was twitted during the last Parliafluke, but the electors of Kennedy have rightly answered that aspersion, and have returned him by a substantial margin, increased at the next election. I also congratulate the Speaker upon his re-election to the Chair. I trust that scenes such as occurred in this House yesterday will not be repeated, and that the dignity of the House will he preserved.

136,Mr Parsons,"I am very sorry,I join in the expressions of sympathy with His Majesty the King in the very serious illness through which he has heen passing. Out of this trouble, however, one thing of value has come: It has afforded the people of the Empire an opportunity of giving a magnificent expression of their loyalty and love to the person aud throne of His Majesty. I am confident that this must have demonstrated to other nations the fact that the people of the Empire are genuinely attached to their Sovereign. I am pleased to observe that Australia has joined with many other nations in signing the treaty for the renunciation of war. War is opposed to all that is best in civilization, and I trust that this country will never in its history feel the foot of an invader on ita soil. war, I recognize that the best way to preserve our country from its horrors is to be prepared to defend ourselves. I trust that we shall continue the policy of training our young men under the system which was introduced some years ago by a Labour government. This system has been endorsed by every government since, but I understand that the present Labour party is pledged to its abolition, a fact which may have had something to do with its defeat at the recent elections. I am myself the father of a son who is nearing the age when he will become a trainee, and I look forward with pride to the time when he will take his place with those who are being fitted to participate in the defence of their native land. I regret that during the last two years we have had most unfavorable seasons throughout This has been the cause of much suffering among primary and has been reflected in a general diminution of the country's prosperity. Short of the return of the Opposition to power, no greater disaster can overtake Australia than a poor rainfall. the records are studied it will be seen that whenever there has been insufficient rain unemployment and depression have followed. I hope that those lion-hearted people in the outback ,-and there are some hundreds in my constituency-who have been facing such Mr Parsons. tremendous difficulties during the last two years, will be rewarded for their faith and endurance with copious rains during the coming winter. I am in entire sympathy with the movement for bringing about a greater degree of peace in industry. I wish I could believe that certain honourable members, whom I shall not name, were also as well disposed towards it. It has been said, and there is much evidence to prove the assertion, that there are persons who thrive on industrial trouble. In the report of the Economic Mission many references are made to the operation of the tariff in Australia. Throughout my election campaign I strongly emphasized my belief that we have gone further than we should in the protection of secondary industries, AlthoughI am opposed to thereby placing on the shoulders of the primary producers a burden greater than they can bear. On every hand one sees what formerly were prosperous primary industries unable to carry on because they cannot compete in the markets of the world owing to the high cost of production. The report of the Economic Mission deals exhaustively with the proposal to spend £34,000,000 on developmental schemes for the absorption of migrants. I am pleased to observe that suggestions have been made for modifications of the agreement. Before the elections a great deal of criticism was directed at the Government because it had appointed many commissions and boards. Too often in the past, both State and Eederal governments have spent money unwisely, and then have appointed commissions to inquire into the mess .so made. This Government has appointed the Development and Migration Commission Australia. to advise it from the first, so that the money which is being borrowed shall be producers, wisely spent. There would have been fewer heartaches and failures amongst our returned soldier settlers if such activities as the Murray Waters Repatriation scheme had been inquired into by comIf petent authorities before being undertaken. It has been proposed that a large scheme shall be put in hand for the development of an extensive wheat area in Western Australia. This scheme is to be inquired into thoroughly, but I am confident that under ' previous governments, if the money had been available for such an undertaking, it would have been spent without any investigation whatever. But as a result of its reference to the Development and Migration Commission the Government has been advised that initially, only £150,000, instead of millions of pounds, should be spent to test the worth of the scheme. That is wise. I am glad, also, that a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the admittedly unsatisfactory condition of the finances of South Australia. That State has been seriously handicapped during recent years. First, a Labour government was in office for three years, whicli, after squandering money, incurred a bank overdraft of £2,000,000, and left a deficit in the Treasury of over £1,000,000. Secondly, the State has experienced two bad efforts of the Liberal Government to straighten out the finances, these are still honourable member turned to me and said, in an unhealthy state, and the Government could not carry on but for the hope of receiving some assistance from this Parliament. In addition to the three tragic years of Labour rule and two bad seasons, the State has suffered several disabilities through federation. Not the least of these has been the operation of the tariff. listening to the honourable member-no t even his own colleagues. orable member for Maribyrnong is out of order. orable member must not address the Chair in that flippant way.

I am pleased to note that the cruisers and submarines which constitute the new naval unit have arrived in Australian waters. The people of the Commonwealth, I am confident, support the Government in making this provision for the defence of our continent. In this regard, it is satisfactory to note that in framing the financial proposals for the coming year, consideration will be given by the Government to the recommendations contained in the report of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Salmond on air defence. Should Australia ever be involved in war the air service will be the principal arm of defence. I am glad therefore, that the Government is encouraging in every way possible civil aviation. Apart from the advantage we shall derive in time of war from having a large number of experienced pilots and fully qualified mechanics, aviation can render tremendous service in the commercial and industrial development of the Commonwealth. As one who understands the hardships of the pioneers in the outback country, and the wonderful advantage relieving them of anxiety and even saving life, I am prepared to give wholehearted support to any proposal for the promotion and further development of aviation throughout the Commonwealth. I welcome the announcement that serious attention is being paid by the Government to the operations of the Tariff Board. In the last Parliament and throughout my electorate I had a good deal to say in criticism of the operations of the tariff and the board which administers it. Too often, absurd proposals have been foisted upon that body. I shall mention one instance that came under my notice recently. Some time but you ago the Border Electric Company of South Australia contracted with the Waikerie District Council to install electric light at Waikerie. To carry out the installation it was necessary to procure a withdraw. supply of Stobie poles. These poles, which were invented by a distinguished South Australian employed by the Adelaide Electric Supply Company, require a particular kind of girder or channel. Incidentally, cement of Australian manufacture is used in their construction. The",34,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

169,Mr Parsons,"I hope that as a recompany searched throughout Australia for girders of the required size. The Hoskius Company, and the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, were both approached; but neither could execute the order. Application was then made to the Tariff Board to allow girders of the required size to be imported duty free or at a low rate. The Tariff Board delayed the matter for many months, but eventually informed the Border Electric Company through me that a certain firm in Victoria was prepared to install rollers and manufacture the girders. But subsequent inquiries elicited that the installation of the necessary plant would cost from £1,200 to £1,500. Seeing that the order which the company wanted to place was for only £481 worth of poles it would have been absurd for the company to install the necessary plant. Had a reasonable view of the situation been taken the girders could have been imported at a figure which would have permitted the people in ""Waikerie to obtain current at i i . per unit less than they now have to pay. The paragraph in the Governor General's speech relating to the encouragetivation have caused the desert to blosment of economic research is worthy of notice. Certain people in Australia tell us that our country is already carrying as many people as it is capable of supporting. These same people are fond of proclaiming from the house tops that Australia is the finest country in the world. I agree with them in that regard, but to say that the finest country in the world is able to support only about 6,000,000 on 3,000,000 square miles is ridiculous in the extreme. The area of Australia is slightly greater than that of the TJnited States of America, but the population of America is over"" twenty times greater than ours, and there is still upon its back. I believe that we are only room for more people. It is deplorable that we should have people in our midst who malign our country by saying that it can support a population of only 6,000,000. If the facilities for research are increased I am Sure that it will be shown that we are only on the fringe of development in primary industries. Years ago, as honourable members, except those who never go beyond a city tram terminus, very well know, wheat was grown in Australia without the aid of artificial manures. In those days nobody dreamed of producing crops of the size that are now reaped. In the days when some farmers used superphosphates and others did not, one could travel through a wheat belt and pick by the merest glance the crops that had been fertilized. To look over a tract of wheat country in those days was something like gazing upon a huge draft board. Land which without the application of superphosphates could only produce from five to six bushels to the acre yielded crops of from 30 to 40 bushels after manures had been applied. To-day our farmers, in addition to using superphosphates, are adopting other improved methods of cultivation. One result of this is that today in the Mallee district crops of from ten to twelve bushels to the acre have been grown on a 4-inch rainfall over the growing season. Land which was considered to be practically useless for agricultural purposes years ago because it was beyond of what is known as Goyder's line of rainfall has become most valuable. Part of the area that I have in mind was called desert land, but scientific methods of culsom as the rose. During last season, on a property where the rain gauge registered only fourteen points between the 1st August and the 30th September, a man reaped crops of from ten to fifteen bushels to the acre. In the light of these happenings who can say what development may not occur in our agricultural areas? The pastoral industry is another which has prospered exceedingly through the application of scientific methods. It has been truly said that in recent years the pastoral industry has carried Australia at the beginning of the development of this great industry. With the top dressing of pastures, the planting of subterranean clover and other herbage, and the adoption of other up-to-date methods, we are already able to realize something of the marvellous possibilities that are ahead of us. Within the next 25 years it is quite likely that much of our pastoral country will be carrying three to five times the number of sheep that it is capable of carrying to-day. Around Mt. Barker, and in other parts of the Adelaide Hills, one can inspect properties which, years ago, were considered to be almost barren, but are to-day carrying five sheep to the acre. We have in South Australia the Waite Institute for Agricultural Research, which is one of the finest institutions in the world for grappling with the problems of the man on the land. I believe that it will prove to be of increasing value to our agricultural .and pastoral interests. During the last Parliament, and also while the election campaign was in progress, we heard a great deal from honourable members opposite about the terrible crime that the Government committed in disposing of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. one act more than all others which commended the Government to the people of Australia during the last three ears it was the disposing of that incubus, which hitherto has been shown to i ment to run businesses. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Francis) .has told us something of the unhappy experience of Queensland in connection with government business enterprises. Possibly the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) could supplement his remarks in that regard, for he had a painful experience. I suggest that, as the Government has disposed of this line, the way is now open for it to follow the example of the South African Government and make an agreement with the Conference Shipping Line for the carriage of our primary and other products. After negotiating with these interests the Government of the sister Dominion was able to obtain enormous reductions in the freight charges on primary shipped from South Africa to Great Britain and the Continent. The agreement also specified that freights agreed upon should stand for ten years, and that increased sailings and better boats should be provided. If the South African Government was able to secure a favorable agreement of that nature the Commonwealth Government should be able to do so, too. That it has done away with its shipping line has been a good thing. If it could follow that action up by obtaining a favorable agreement with the Conference Lines it would earn the praise of Mr Parsons. every person who has the welfare of the country at heart. The Commonwealth Shipping Line was sucking the life blood out of the primary industries of this country and costing the nation millions of pounds. I applaud the Government for having disposed of it. I was sorry to read in the Governor General's Speech that it is proposed to set up a War Pensions Appeal Board. I presume that the reason for this is that the Minister for Repatriation ( Sir Neville Howse) has found it impossible' to deal with all the claims that have been made. Boards, as everybody knows, have neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned. While we had a Minister for Repatriation, who was himself a "" digger,"" I believe that if there was dealing with the claims of the "" diggers "" we were fortunate' indeed. I am afraid that the introduction of a board will mean that a good deal of the sympathy t is not part of the duty of the Governclaimants for pensions will be missing. As the representative of the greatest wine-producing district of Australia, I am glad to notice that the Government intends to take steps to assist in organizing the industry and in marketing its products. Notwithstanding all the specious promises made by my opponent during the election, the grape-growers in my constituency stood by me to a man. I headed the poll in every grape-growing district. When I addressed a meeting at Tanunda iu the last week of the campaign, one of the most prominent representatives of the grape-growers told me that my opponent had promised them the sun, the moon, and the stars, but that they preferred to back my performances. The result of the poll shows that the growers thoroughly products endorsed those sentiments. The Government will have to handle the wine export business in such a way that the industry will have a chance to recover. This Government is not responsible for the present condition of the industry. The whole trouble has been caused through placing returned soldiers on areas without any regard to the marketing of produce. ' No parliament and no particular party can be blamed for the existing unsatisfactory state of affairs. All parties were equally anxious to settle returned soldiers on the land, with the result that it was not long before there was enormous over-production in a limited market. The grapegrowers are extremely graceful to the Prime Minister for the measure of preference which he was able to obtain from the British Government at two successive Im perial Conferences. also to the Prime Minister and his Government for the passing of the ""Wine Bounty Act; but my constituents, by their votes at the last election, demonstrated conclusively that they are behind rae in my opposition to the hasty measure introduced in March of last year which reduced the amount of the bounty before the industry was on a satisfactory footing. tion. The contractors on the present The responsibility now devolves upon the Government to rectify that mistake. Anything that the Ministry can do in this direction for the benefit of grape-growers it is their duty to do, and it should be unnecessary to add that I shall wholeheartedly support the Government in this matter. I notice reference in the Speech to the as these that we can hope to develop our proposed extension of postal and telephone facilities. This Government has done more for country people than any other government in the way of extending postal, telegraph and telephonic services. a wide and comprehensive one. wisely, the Ministry considered that an extension of telephonic services would be an absolute necessity for people in outback areas. I wish to thank the Postmaster-General, on behalf of my constituents, for what has been done in my electorate during the last three years. No fewer than 29 telephone exchanges have been established in Angas in that period. I have had many letters from my constituents thanking me for my efforts on their behalf, and I have passed them on to the Minister from time to time, so that he may know how greatly the people appreciate his action. I am glad to notice reference to the Government's Northern Australia. Since about 1880 this subject appeared in every Governor's speech made to the South Australia Parliament when that State controlled the Territory, and in every such speech made to the Federal Parliament since it was handed over to the Commonwealth; but this Government has been the first to do anything of a practical nature during the Federal management. It has really started on the construction of the north-south railway, and, in June next, the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs section of the line will have They are grateful been completed. Now is the time to continue that great work. I feel sure that all honourable members will support me in this matter. At present we are faced with a great deal of unemployment, and the construction of the next section of the railway, besides being a fulfilment of the pledge to the Government of South Australia, will help to relieve the situasection to Alice Springs have all their plant and organization available, so this should be an opportune time to complete the north-south railway. When the through connection has been made, lines should be taken into western Queensland and the north-west of Western Australia. It is only by such undertakings great inheritance. Under existing conditions the freight charges on one ton of goods from Adelaide to the Fincke River Mission, 85 miles beyond Alice Springs, is £25. It is impossible to develop Its policy has been Central Australia, for either mineral Very or pastoral purposes, under such unfavorable conditions. The absence of adequate transport facilities is almost entirely responsible for the undeveloped state of Central and North Australia, the western portion of Queensland, and the north-western district of Western Australia. I am glad to notice that the Government intends, during the next recess, to convene a conference between, the Commonwealth and State Ministers. That gathering will have many important questions to handle. One which I may mention will, no doubt, be introduced by the Premier of South Australia: I refer to the proposed extra petrol tax proposal to develop to take the place of the present inequitable system of taxation on motor vehicles. Speaking as the owner of a motor vehicle, I say that a petrol tax is absolutely the fairest impost that can be devised. WhilstI am in Canberra attending to the interests of my constituents in this Parliament, my car is lying idle; but taxation is being levied upon me all the time. By the substitution of a tax on petrol, every car owner will be taxed for the amount of work done by his car. One point in the Speech with which I cannot agree is the proposal to bring about unification of railway gauges in Australia. I feel strongly on this subject, and I ask honourable members to give it serious consideration-to think where it will lead us. Can the expenditure of £60,000,000 on the unification of gauges be justified? Is it not possible to find better avenues for so great an expenditure? think that the agitation for the unification of railway gauges is sponsored chiefly by travellers who have to change trains at 11 o'clock each night at Albury on the journey to Sydney, or when travelling to Melbourne are obliged to get out of their sleeping berths earlier than usual to join a Victorian train. I submit that, at this stage in the history of Australia, the contemplated expenditure on the unification of railway gauges cannot be justified. I am a keen supporter of the scheme for national insurance against sickness,, invalidity, old-age, and death, and I am pleased to know that the bill brought down last year, and carried to its secondabroad. These began with the tour reading stage, is to be re-introduced. I trust that, as a result of representations made by friendly societies and other bodies interested, the bill, when it is placed on the statute-book, will be as near perfection as possible. It would be most undesirable if a measure dealing with such an important subject were to require amendment in a few years' time. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the bill will for at least six months on a tour of the receive the most careful attention. I trust that when other honourable members of the Opposition join in the debate, they will endeavour to give us some constructive criticism. We listened just now to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who spoke for a few minutes only. His remarks were as barren of constructive thought as are the interjections of honourable members opposite. It is generally agreed, and my studies of parliamentary institutions conJuly of last year and proceeded to Canada firm me in the belief, that the best government obtains when there is in Mr Parsons. opposition a body of men strong in numbers and debating strength, prepared at all times to subject government proposals to the most searching criticism. The Government's policy, as outlined in the Speech is, I submit, full of good meat for the people of this country, and it should commend itself to honourable members opposite. It is to be regretted, therefore, that the Leader of the Opposition treated it so lightly, and by a wave of the hand, so to speak, declared that there was nothing in it. There certainly was nothing in his speech. It was as I am inclined to barren as the desert of Sahara, unrelieved by even the suggestion of an oasis. The people of this country expect the Leader of the Opposition at least to offer some solution of our difficulties. The only conclusion that they can come to, after reading his speech, is that he is not capable of putting forward ideas, the execution of which might assist in the advancement of this country. I trust that honourable members will not for one moment think that I have dashed into the breach to keep the debate going. That is far from my intention. I am taking this opportunity to place before the House all the information that I have gained from my recent journeyings with the Parliamentary Delegation to Canada, and, as to that, I shall let my brother members on that delegation speak, because I have other information to place before the House. I have always been of the opinion that it would be advantageous to Australia if every honourable member, on election by the people, were, at the public expense, sent various countries of the world. There is nothing like travel to enable a man to gather ideas and to broaden his mind. I do not wish honourable members to gain the impression that I intend to lecture them. I shall not do that; but whatever information I have obtained at my own expense I wish to place before honourable members to help them if possible to carry out their duties.

170,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [5.46],"arrival at Quebec we joined up with other parliamentary delegations under the leadership of Viscount Peel, a fine man in every respect, who has recently filled the position relinquished by Earl Birkenhead, formerly Secretary of State for India. From Viscount Peel we received every assistance. The whole tour was a great success, being most informative and instructive. I join with the other members of the delegation in placing upon record our sincere appreciation of the lavish and courteous hospitality extended to us by the Canadian Government. Nothing was left undone, either in entertainment or in the conferences held in each State with the provincial parliaments throughout Canada. It was my fourth tour of Canada, and I travelled 7,000 miles through that country. I could not help but absorb information and I met many of the members of each parliament. My impression is that Canada is a wonderf ul country. It is a land of enormous possibilities and of huge wealth. The wheat yield this year is staggering. Coal has been found at Quebec, and the industry is well established and gold mining has made great strides. The tourist traffic is the second largest industry of Canada. During the last financial year the revenue from the tourist traffic in Canada was £40,000,000. Our trade and customs revenue is somewhere about £44,000,000. It is difficult to imagine any country obtaining such a huge revenue solely from tourist traffic. when one knows the hotel charges. high, but one gets a lot for one's money. Certain sections of the Australian press have ridiculed Mr Gepp for daring to spend £100,000 in exploring avenues whereby tourists may be attracted to Australia. One way in which we can attract tourists is to advertise extensively. theatres. Several American millionaires said to me.."" What is the use of going to your country?"" I said, "" Why not ? "" They replied, ""Look at the pamphlets and the ships."" I asked them what was wrong with them. They said "" My dear chap, the ships have' only two funnels."" The great tourist ships trading on the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans have three or four funnels. The Americans take up our illustrated pamphlets and find that the vessels trading to Australia have only two funnels and a limited number of cabins de luxe. They absolutely refuse to travel on such vessels. I suggest that we should increase the tonnage of our oveiv seas passenger ships. A vessel of 19,900 tons is too small; they should be over the 20,000-ton class. That is a small point, but it has a vital bearing in attracting people to our country to look us over. On leaving the parliamentary delegation I at once commenced to investigate the film position in Canada. I wish to express my deep thanks to the Prime Minister and to the Australian representatives of all the British and American film-producing companies for the assistance that they gave me and for the cablegrams that were sent by them to Canada, England and America, which made my investigations so much easier. All doors were thrown open to me, so that I might return to Australia and place before this Parliament information which will assist members when a bill embodying those sections of the report of the royal commission on the moving picture industry of Australia which the Government adopted in the last Parliament is introduced. I appeal to the Prime Minister not to overlook the importance of such legislation. We must bear in mind the attendances at the picture theatres of the world to realize how the films to-day can make and mar nations, can foment riots and control them; in fact, can do anything. In Australia we have a population of just over 6,000,000 people, yet the attendance at our picture shows during a year is close on 114,000,000. America has a population of 120,000,000 people, but 140,000,000 people attend the picture shows every week. That estimate is gained by counting the tickets sold at the various Honourable members cannot but realize what effect the films have upon the nations. A prime minister, or the president of a country, is not likely to deliver a speech which attracts the attention of the people more than once a month or every six months, but the film is talking to the people daily from 11 a.m. until after midnight. That is one of the",39,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
171,Mr Jackson,It is not so difficult,40,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
172,Mr Marks,"The hotel charges aregrounds upon which. I shall ask honourable members to support me when a bill to control the picture film industry in Australia is introduced. What is the position in Australia? Last year the Government adopted the report of the royal commission with the exception of recommendations that Avere ultra vires of the constitution of the Commonwealth. for Trade and Customs last year said that the Government intended to ask my co-operation in approaching the States and placing the whole position before the various Governments of Australia. BeforeI left for CanadaI placed the result of my conferences with the State Governments before the Prime Minister. I am quite satisfied with the results of those conferences. Negotiations with the States in furtherance of those conferences are now proceeding. The States have to pass short enabling bills before this Parliament can legislate for the purpose of giving to the film industry of Australia one control instead of several-Commonwealth control. I have studied the film industry from every angle and am therefore able to supply honourable members with authentic information regarding it. Canada has only one company engaged in film production. It is producing ""Westerners "",-films like those in which we have seen Tom Mix and other outback men. The Government itself has a most extensive film industry which is' carried out under the able guidance of Mr E. C. Badgley, the Director of the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau. He is in charge of a huge department which is paying its own way. Australia lost £3,000 last year on producing the "" Know Your Own Country"" series. I have given the Prime Minister a long report on the Canadian Government film activities, and asked him to forward it to Mr Gepp so that many admirable innovations may be copied by the Development and Migration "" Know Your Own Country"" series. The Canadian exhibitors are very anxious to obtain our pictures, but they cannot get them. wrong with our methods of distribution. Colonel Cooper, President of the Canadian Film Exhibitors and Distributors Mr Marks. told me that two years ago he exhausted every avenue in trying to obtain Australian "" Know Your Own Country"" films. The Canadians are quite willing to allow us a fair profit so that we may become self-supporting. In Canada, England, France and the United States of America, I heard nothing but unstinted praise The late Minister for the report of the royal cornrnission on the moving picture industry. Even the Americans said that it was the most sweeping investigation of the industry ever made by any nation. It was pleasing to me as chairman of the royal commission, as it must be to those senators and members with whom I was associated during the inquiry, to know that our investigations and recommendations were so favourably received. I then went to London, where I conferred with Mr Amery, the Secretary of State for the Dominions, with Sir Phillip Cunliffe Lister, President of the Board of Trade, and heads of his department, and with other members of the British Government, and the result of those conferences has already been conveyed to the Prime Minister. I wish to assure honourable members that the British Government is wholeheartedly supporting British production. I visited the Wellwyn Garden City Studios, erected at a cost of £80,000, where British instructional films are produced. In these studios the most modern machinery and equipment are installed; they are practically perfect. It was at these studios that I had the honour and pleasure of meeting Mr Anthony Asquith, the son of a late Prime Minister, .the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, who, strangely enough, is a brilliant producer. The British Government is standing solidly behind the British picture production industry, and the Motherland is now taking an active part in film production and exhibition, which Commission in our is one .of the greatest and most profitable industries in the world-. The British moving picture industry could not have made such wonderful progress There is therefore something were it not for the assistance it has received from the quota act passed by the British Parliament. Directly the quota system became operative, £3,500,000 was made available to British producers, which gave them a start. Without it they would have been confronted with great difficulty. The International Film Company is at Elstree, which is the Hollywood of England. It occupies approximately 27 acres, 20 acres of which are utilized for studios, and have a "" talkie"" studio, costing some £50,000, which has just been completed. I visited the British Gaumont Studios, where Maurice Elvey, the director of the ""Flag Lieutenant"" series, operates. He is now producing the big "" Balaclava"" film. I also inspected the Gainsborough at Islington. When I had thoroughly inspected the studios and their modern equipment, I set to work to interview directors and producers, whom I found very keen, and optimistic concerning the future, if screenings can be got for their productions. It is useless to spend £50,000 on a picture unless there is an opportunity to obtain screenings. Nothing has encouraged British production more than the quota system. During my absence from Australia. I saw many British films, and in general artistry they are 100 per cent, improved; but, of course, much yet remains to be done. There is no doubt that at least 100 British feature films will be available this year to meet the British and Australian quota. the American producers and distributors are using a good deal of pressure; the Americans are keen business men; but I do not say they employ improper methods. In the pursuit of business they are displaying only ordinary business acumen. They will sell their goods where they can get a market. What is the position in London from the American viewpoint? It is surprising. The Plaza in Piccadilly Circus is under the control of the Paramount Company, and the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square which_has been reconstructed at a cost of £400,000 is owned by the Metro Goldwyn Mayer Company. In Birmingham, Sheffield and Dublin, as well as in many important provincial centres, many picture theatres are under the control of Americans. I do not say that this is improper, but it is competition with which British exhibitors have to contend. They will have to win out. I am pleased to say that I was most courteously received by Colonel-A. C. Bromhead, the head of the British Gaumont Company, which when I arrived in England owned 200 theatres, and when I reached New York was controlling 400, in all of which British as well as American films were being screened. That circuit in itself provides wonderful opportunities for British and Australian films. This company is most anxious to get British and Australian productions, provided they are of merit. I should like to know what there is to prevent the Commonwealth Government from at once announcing tlie awards of merit for Australian films recommended by the royal commission. If these awards were made, it would encourage Australian producers. market for British and Australian production, they would not need these awards. and the producers, particularly those who have spent many thousands of pounds in production, would be glad of financial assistance. It would be a wonderful advertisement for a producer to say that he had received one of these Government prizes for his film. I am sure that Colonel Bromhead would give special Of course consideration to a film which had received the imprimatur of the Commonwealth by being awarded such a prize. prizes to novelists. writers need similar encouragement. As honourable members are aware, the royal commission when conducting its investigations ascertained that a number of films of British production over a specific period were objectionable. In fact, some were worse than American films to which exception had been taken. I therefore had conferences with the British film censor and representative British producers. The position in England is extraordinary. The British censor can deal with films_ for exhibition in London or the provinces, but he cannot prevent the export of the original, negative to Australia or Jndia. That is one of the reasons why trouble has been caused in India by the projection of films showing white men acting",40,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

In these circumstances it is essential that the a v e r y in t e r e s t in g statement on this subCensorship Board here should be able to deal with such films. I have personally met many British producers who are fine men, and have no wish to produce such stuff, which is usually produced by irresponsible small men, who will in future be closely watched by. the Board of Censors out here. Little trouble is to be expected in this direction in future. Generally speaking, the British producers are enthusiastic, very active and optimistic concerning the future, so long as the American pressure is not too strong. I do not think for a moment that we have anything to fear. I believe we shall be able to produce our ful l quota, and that in the matter of artistry and photography there is little to be desired; but more must be done in order to reach the extraordinary high level of American producers. I wish to take the opportunity of publicly thanking those gentlemen in America engaged in the moving pictur-3 business who were so courteous to me during my investigation, particularly Mr Will Hays, an ex-Poatmaster-General of the TJnited States of America, who gave up his important portfolio under the become president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America. The producing and distributing companies of America appointed Mr Hays at a staggering salary to control their activities. In America they are willing to pay for brains. The offices of this organization are in Fifth-avenue, where there is a department to see that no film offensive to a foreign power leaves America; although, unfortunately, some get through. 1 found Mr Hays a sincere man, and extremely anxious to assist in the production and distribution of cleaner pictures. Soon after his appointment Mr Hays called a meeting of all the leading American societies-eve n the Boy Scouts were represented-and the question of censorship and better pictures was discussed from every angle. At Mr Hays' suggestion, this conference appointed a representative to be attached to his prganization, and in Colonel Jason Joy they have a most able representative.

There w ill be a slight tendency now and then to yield to tlic argument of influences within member companies, that quick profits are probable by the injection of objectionable matter or the treatment of objectionable themes. I say that our members know these instances. I say that the directors of the pictures know these instances. Our members in control of the companies know them. Andi f this watchfulness is not continually exercised for some time yet to come, human nature may again operate. It is not altogether a question of morals, however, it is a question of good business to make and keep pictures right and to do these collateral services to develop the maximum usefulness of pictures. Colonel Joy, inter alia, looks after public relations work at the source of supply. One of his important duties is to carry to the directors of the pictures themselves at the studios, the information and knowledge which he has obtained in four years here (New York) of the things that must not be in pictures. A t the time the picture is made, he contracts with the important men in every studio, to keep out of pictures things that his four years' experience have shown should not be in . One of Colonel Joy's representatives is late President Harding, to supposed to "" sit in "" at the stages whenever a "" shot"" is being made. Mr Hays, Colonel Joy, Mr Beetsqn, and all those with whom they are associated are quite sincere in the desire that the picture shall be clean. On the 8th June, 1927, the representatives of 24 leading picture companies got together to discuss what should and should not be "" shot"" in a studio, and the conference passed a great number of resolutions, which were duly signed by the representatives. When I read those resolutions I came to the conclusion that, if they were complied with no film could be made. The industry in America considers that the Australian filmcensorship is more rigid than that of any other nation. But those resolutions are 100 per cent, more stringent than our Censorship. Apparently the American producers or directors are forgetting about them, because, in the magnificent Roxy moving picture theatre, which is on Broadway, and is capable of seating 7,250 people, having a weekly box office taking of £25,000,1 saw a film with "" shots "" and titles or captions which would not be",42,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
177,Mr Marks,"I have here a copy o ftolerated for five minutes in Australia. I saw the same thing in several other big theatres. What, therefore, is the slogan 1 and objective of Mr Hays? It is an ideal, and one with which I entirely agree. Abolish censorship by nations, and have the censorship of films where it should be, within the studio itself. That is an admirable ideal, but it cannot yet be realized. To whom is the present laxity chargeable-the director who makes the picture, or the producer, who provides the means for making the picture? Certainly it must be partly attributable to the director, as he is primarily responsible for making the "" shots,"" and the producer or owner of the film is finally to blame iu allowing the film to be made. I Mr Hays and those associated with him cannot attain the objective for which they are striving until the producing companies in America, with their huge capital, support that ideal, and say "" You must stop any of this stuff being shot."" Until that time, the censorship board, which this Government so wisely brought into existence, will'be a vital necessity. In passing, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government upon adopting the recommendations of the royal commission on the motion picture industry regarding the censor and appeal boards, which are now operating. Evidently, the conclusions that I have arrived .at. are supported in America itself, because the Federal Motion Picture Council, which met at Washington on 27th November, 1928, passed resolutions favoring Federal supervision, and affirming that films have become morally worse though mechanically and artistically better. I agree with the first of these resolutions, which supports exactly what I have urged should be done in Australia. I do not agree with the second resolution, as I consider that American films are almost 100 per cent, better than they were fifteen months ago. It is interesting to note that Senator Walsh, of Montana, stated that he felt that the improvement of motion pictures should have the immediate attention of Congress. That is precisely what has been given in Australia. In order the better to make the people of Australia appreciate the magnitude of the moving picture industry, and to assist them in arriving at a decision as to the advisability of Australia setting up further studios for the production of moving pictures in Australia, I shall quote somefigureswhich were supplied to me by Mr Will Hays. Tbey are:1. There are 27 companies producing motiou pictures in the United States of America. 2. The industry stands well amongst the first ten industries of the United States of America. 3. The industry stands first in the percentage of the world's supply of a single commodity. 4. 255,000 persons are permanently employed in the industry. 5. £25,000,000 is spent every year in producing moving pictures. 6. Approximately, 100,000,000 persons attend arrived at the conclusion that picture shows every week in the United States of America. 7. Moving pictures Are shown in 70 countries, with titles translated into 37 languages. S. In"" 1927, 236,000,000 feet of film was exported from the United States of America. 9. An average of 905 extras are engaged daily at Hollywood, at an average daily wage of 35s. The proportions are 603 men, 209 women, and 33 children. We must grasp, those figures firmly in our minds when considering the advisability of facing such competition. I wish to thank everybody in America who was instrumental in granting facilities to enable me to make a close inspectionof the studios in that country, and for the great courtesy which \vas so cordially extended to me. In a period of three weeks I visited ten studios, fitting in my visits between my conferences. Naturally, I selected the great studios, such as United Artists-Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Norma and Constance Talmadge Metro GoldwynMayettj Charlie Chaplin, Fox, Paramount, Hal Roach, First National, Universal and the FoxH ill Sound Studio. ber visit Fatty Arbuckle? member for that interjection, and am pleased to say that in the United States of America, as in Australia, if a man is so unfortunate as to be down and out, his friends make an effort to l if t him out of the mire.

179,Mr Marks,"I . thank the honorableby bis former associates, is now conducting a smart restaurant at Hollywood, and is making good. It is indeed difficult to describe the magnitude of the great American studios. When visiting individual studios one needs a motor car to take one through the streets running around the studio walls, as each studio covers from 30 to 37 acres. there are eight or nine gigantic studios, surrounded by administrative ancl an abundance of beautiful flowers aud shrubs. The streets are cement lined. tbe largest studio in Australia, which is in my electorate, that of Australian Films, at Bondi Junction, which cost £50,000 to erect. In each of tlie great Hollywood studios there are eight or uine studios, each bigger than that at Bondi. When the talking films came into existence in America the Fox Film Corporation erected a studio at Fox Hills at a cost of £1,800,000, although that organization already had some 80 to 90 acres at Hollywood, upon which their main studios were built. That illustrates the fact that no monetary expenditure will prevent these people from achieving their object. Of course, they are aware that they have a world-wide market to bring their money back. On one occasion I saw John Barrymore making the film "" The King of the Mountains*"" In this there was a snow scene, and four aeroplanes were used to., blow about porridge meal to represent snow. He was satisfied with the result, but also wanted the work done outside. went out to Universal City, and taking a strip of mountain side 400 or 500 yards wide, and \ mile high, they painted the entire area white. Here they erected the villages and shelters for the ""mountaineers at a cost of about £25,000, all for into British theatres, and theatres the taking of a scene which lasted only twenty minutes. This must be taken into consideration when we are dealing with the suggestion that the Commonwealth Government should -establish studios in Australia. We cannot establish studios here to compete against enterprise of that kind. The question then remains, what chance have Australian pictures on the American market? I am sorry to say that they have very little. We have not Mr Marks. many pictures to offer-onl y two perhaps, ""For the Term of His Natural Life,"" costing £50,000, and ""The Adorable Outcast,"" which cost £40,000. When I inquired about exhibiting our pictures iii America, I was told that the big Broadway theatres in New York could not risk their box office receipts by showing our films. It has to be rememWitlr'n each enclosure bered that Australians have invested very large sums of money in blocks picture theatres, and the only chance of getting a return on that money is to screen American films. Shut out As a comparison I cite American films, and the Australian investor will lose his money, at least until such time as we can get sufficient British Sydney, films, and that time is not yet. The American exhibitors will not risk their box office receipts by showing our films unless they are of undoubted merit -somethin g so good that people will fall over one another to see them. In Broadway, New York, there is, for instance, the famous Roxy Theatre, the weekly takings of which are £25,000. There is also the Paramount Theatre, a little further down, a magnificent place with a seating capacity of 7,000, and a weekly return of £17,000 to. £18,000. My advice to the Australian producer is to sell his films to Empire theatres, and not to bother about America for the moment. One man whom I met in England controls 400 theatres throughout the British Isles. He extended great hospitality to me, and threw his whole organization open for my inspection. He said that he wants They Australian pictures, and will exhibit them in all his theatres. Here is a market ready made, and if taken advantage of will prove a great boon to Australian producers. I advise them to get films out as quickly as possible, and to put them throughout South Africa, Canada, India and other parts of the Empire. Quality alone will count in America; but England wants quality and numbers as well. I was _ sorry to learn that certain great British producers were not distributing their films in Australia through British or British-Australian distributing companies, in compliance with the recommendation contained in the report of our Royal Commission. We recommend that the producers should start distributing and many have done so. Others, however, have not, and it is a great pity. When I inquired the reason, one managing director told me that they had established a liaison with interests in France and Germany for the release of films in those countries, and it was necesmatically the success of a production. I sary to release their films in Australia through the same companies. pete against American productions in the British theatres? because the British exhibitors are asking for them. asking for our films? one firm which controls 4X)0 theatres, and when the others see what profits this firm is making out of Australian pictures they will be very anxious to obtain some for themselves. The British producer must build up his own industry, although it is true that the British Government is behind him. I have already thrown out this hint through the press, and I wish to repeat it now: If the British producers desire to build up their industry, let them secure the services of some of the famous film stars at present working in Hollywood. When1 was there I had an opportunity of meeting many of these great stars, and found that a large percentage of them, both men and women, were Britishers. These were persons whose names were famous throughout the whole world, and they were receiving enormous salaries for the work they did. They are anxious to get back to the Motherland to help forward film production there. Why, then, do they not return ? Many of them have not even been asked, and others, while they have been approached, have not been offered salaries commensurate with their positions. The British producers should secure these stars now while they are at the very height of their fame. The psychology of the picture public makes an interesting study. JEEow does the ordinary person make up his mind which picture theatre he will go to? He either looks at the newspaper to see who the star players are in the different shows, or he walks down the street and sees the names agencies in Australia on the posters or electric signs outside the theatres. The Americans know this, and have the names of the stars emblazoned outside the theatres in brilliant lights. In Britain there are few great stars whose names are sufficiently well known to secure autounderstand that some Hollywood artists who are already on the down grade have been approached, but it would be a collossal mistake to bring them over to England. The most recent development in the film world is the introduction of the talking picturea most wonderful thing. Take, for instance, the news reel which shows His Majesty the King performing the ceremony of opening a bridge. His Majesty, as we know, has been a very sick man for months; but in this picture he is heard speaking as clearly as any one can be heard in this chamber, and there can be heard also the sound of the horses coming down the street, the cheering of the crowd, and the music of the band. The talking films have come to stay, and Australia must get into the business. I urge upon the Minister for Trade and Customs the need to install apparatus for screening talking films in the office of the Commonwealth Censor in Sydney. At the present time it is necessary for the Censor to get permission to screen such pictures in some theatre in which the apparatus has been already installed. The Film Censorship staff is a very hard-worked body, and we should help them as much as possible. In conclusion, I desire to thank the Prime Minister, the British Government, and the producers and directors whom I met for the hospitality they extended to me, and the facilities which they provided for me as a member of this Parliament when I was seeking information regarding this industry. I deeply appreciate it, as I am quite sure every honourable member of this House does. Something has to be done to improve the marketing of Australian produce in London. The position to-day is far from good. Our growers are not getting proper prices for their produce.

191,Mr Marks,"The labelling of ouriu Australia House who does not help, but, on the contrary, rather impedes our advertising. I suggest that more power should be given to Captain Smart. The men who I suggest should be appointed to perform in London the various duties I have mentioned should do no other work than that which they are appointed to do. When I was in LondonI tried to find out what would be a fair salary to pay. One cannot live in London for nothing. The more people you meet who entertain you the more you have to entertain. In my opinion it would be necessary to pay £1,500 a year to each of these one-job men. They would earn the money, and at the same time the Australian growers would get more for their produce because there would be a better system in operation. Each man would need to be under the control of Mr Farraker, in the commercial department of Australia House, because that department has the respect of every one in England. There is not much wrong with Australia House; but I made the suggestion to Captain Smart that he should make use of more electric light in the display of Australian goods. When a person passes out of the street into Australia House it is like going into a vault. Yankee enterprise by the use of electric light for the display of our Australian produce in the big hall at Australia House. I hope that Captain Smart has acted on my advice. When we were sitting in Melbourne the suggestion was made that, perhaps, it would be well to have a Commonwealth Minister in London. ThenI was opposed to the idea. I believe that the present Prime Minister, in common with all honourable members, was opposed to it ; but I have greatly altered my views. It is impossible now for the High Commissioner to get through all his work. He has to consult with the "" powers that be "", and 'has to accept the bulk of the big invitations sent to him. The members of his staff declare that it is impossible for salaried officers to get the big "" powers that be"" to listen to them. The big man cannot get over the fact that the visitor is only an ordinary employee of the Commonwealth. A Minister of the Crown would be in quite a different position. I am not after a job, and unless an honourable member has a fairly safe seat it would not be a very easy matter for him to say to his constituents "" I am going abroad for my government, but I shall be in Australia for three months each year."" Yet the only course to follow is to send a Minister to England. A Minister of the Crown could walk into Mr Baldwin's room or into that of any other British Minister and get a hearing, but this our officers at Australia House cannot do. For some time we have had an excellent representative in the TJnited States of America acting in the absence of a trade commissioner; I refer to Mr Dow, who is doing excellent work in New York. Our offices there have now been shifted from Battery Point to very much more commodious rooms in the Cunard Building. I spent the whole day going over the place, trying to find out anything I could to bring back with me. It will be remembered that when Sir Hugh Denison came back to Australia he advised the appointment of an ambassador at Washington. That suggestion was rightly turned down by the Government. But Mr Dow suggests, and I agree with him, that Australia We need to adopt a little should have a room at the British Embassy in Washington to which our representative in the TJnited States of America or one of his officers may go each week, to act as a liaison officer between Washington and New York. Mr Dow has asked me to bring under the attention of the Commonwealth Government a, matter in which he is concerned. He wishes to see that his services in America do not jeopardize his standing in the Commonwealth Public Service. He is doing good work in America, but he does not want to come back to Australia and fall in at the bottom of the line of promotion. I do not propose to deal with the question of migration at any length, but when I was in Canada with the Empire Parliamentary Association the one subject that was engrossing the attention of Viscount Peel and the other members of the British Delegation was migration. While we were there the British Govern-^ ment sent out to Canada 10,000 miners for harvesting operations. A big fuss was made and the newspapers stated.that a large number of the men were returned to the Old Country. The fact is that of the 10,000 only 800 or 900 were repatriated. The others are likely to remain in Canada permanently. Population cannot, however, be transported to Australia in wholsesale fashion and absorbed. Canada is seeking to get the best of the British migrants; so are Australia, South Africa and other parts of the British Empire. Britain on the other hand naturally desires to retain the best. How is the problem to be solved ? Too many departments are involved in dealing with this matter. Migration is the greatest problem taxing the ingenuity of the inner councils of the Empire, and what is most urgently needed is co-ordination of effort. Speaking at our conference in Vancouver, I made a suggestion which appealed to the Right Honourable Thomas Shaw, and other members of the British Delegation. Just as there is at Geneva a gathering of leaders of all the great nations of the world 'to promote international peace, so should there be in London an empire migration league composed of one delegate from each dominion. This representation would be a full-time job and should be entrusted to either a highly-paid officer or a private person of independent means. The purpose of the league should be to ascertain by systematic investigation the type and number of migrants each dominion can absorb. The Empire Marketing Board could co-operate with it by ascertaining in detail the actual or potenbe helped to a better understanding, tial production of each dominion and the most likely markets in which the products could be sold. Australia is far distant from the markets of the old world, and obviously it is waste of effort to produce what we cannot sell. These two great bodies-the Empire Migration League and the Empire Marketing Board-coul d do much to solve the twin problems of migration and markets. Without some system of co-ordination such as I have suggested, we shall continue to flounder, notwithstanding the good intentions of governments and others who are interested. The suggestion with which I am about to conclude, may provoke some ridicule, but it originated with some of the biggest Mr Marks. financiers in London and Wall-street, with whom I had the privilege of lunching or dining. Two of them are mainly responsible for providing the loan money which Australia obtains abroad. In the course of one such conversation, I received news of the waterside workers' strike in Australia, and the speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) when endeavouring to induce the men to return to work were warmly applauded by influential men in both London and New York. When I asked one of my hosts whether he, as an investor, was worried by these strikes, he replied, ""Not overmuch; an occasional heat spot or carbuncle on the neck of the Australian body politic is not serious, but if these eruptions spread over the whole body something drastic will have to be done."" In other words, if these strikes continue they will have an effect upon the money markets of London and New York that will stagger us. What is the solution? I was amazed to learn how closely the financiers of London and New York keep in touch. A British money magnate said to me, "" Party politics will kill Australia, and the suggestion I make is that for the benefit of your nation, Bruce, Hughes and Scullin should meet together at the council table and thresh out this matter thoroughly. If those three men cannot find a way out of the trouble, Australia will be in a parlous state."" When I said that I did not think such collaboration was practicable he replied that it must be made practicable and that the workmen of Australia must irrespective of the merits of any dispute. I believe that such a conference would be worthwhile. Surely the brains of the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney, and the Leader of the Opposition, collaborating without regard to party politics, could evolve a solution of this acute industrial problem. I hope to have another opportunity later in the session to speak further on this subject. surprising feature of this debate is the silence of honourable members opposite.

In the circumstances, one is forced to the conclusion that honourable members opposite cannot suggest anything better than the programme set forth in the Governor General's speech. I am glad that His Excellency referred to the fact that Australia was one of the original signatories of the treaty for the renunciation of war. I believe that the scourge of war can be, and eventually will be, stamped out by the League of Nations, and I am proud that Australia was one of the first countries to declare its adherence to the Kellogg Peace Pact. Another paragraph refers to the tariff and the operations of the Tariff Board. We have heard a good deal about the need for a scientific tariff; we certainly need a lower tariff. Many of the customs duties should be reduced, and I believe that a scientific investigation would prove and production. Although the woolthat they are doing to Australia more harm than good. Por many years the customs duties have been steadily mounting, and every increase has added to the cost of production. Because of the higher cost'of living, the workers have gone to the Arbitration Court and asked for increased wages. With the awarding of higher wages the cost of production has further increased, in consequence . of which the manufacturers have obtained from Parliament still higher protective duties. Again the workers have obtained from the Arbitration Court higher wages, and again the cost of production has risen. neither the workers nor the manufacturers, and hits hardly the primary producers. It is obvious that although the worker handles each week a larger sum of money, his effective wage is no greater if it will not purchase any more of the necessaries of life than he obtained formerly. A worker whom I have known for many years told me recently that although he is earning in Canberra 28s. 2d. a day, he cannot save as much money as when he was receiving 10s. a day before the war. The effect of the high tariff is to place the primary producer at a disadvantage. increase in duties recoils upon him, because he has to buy in a highly protected market and to sell his produce competitively in the markets of the world. pass on increased costs, but the primary producer cannot. we break the vicious circle of rising costs, it will break us. The cost of production in Australia is mounting continuously, whereas in other countries it is being reduced. We shall have to alter our fiscal system. It has been truly said that the sheep is carrying Australia on its back, wool being the only product that can be marketed abroad without government aid. in a precarious condition; much wheat land is going out of cultivation, and that retrogression will continue unless something is done to reduce the cost of living growers are now receiving for their product a price twice as great as that which they received prior to the outbreak of the war, their income is very much less, on account of the higher costs of production and the largely increased taxatiou that they are obliged to pay. The high tariff under which our industries are working is not conferring a benefit upon any section, but on the contrary, is having an adverse effect upon all classes, because the effect has been to increase the cost of production and to cause thousands of persons to be thrown out of employment. The Economic Conference has a good deal to say in its report with respect to This vicious circle benefits the closely related subjects of the tariff and our arbitration system. I again remind honourable members that the prosperity of Australia is dependent mainly upon the success of our primary industries, which are responsible for 96 per cent, of our exports, and which represent 73 per cent, of the wealth of Australia. It appears to me that the practice has been not to advance, but to retard the development of those industries. The imposition of increased duties, and the application of our arbitration system, are having a most adverse effect upon them, and unless the existing Every conditions'are altered, the result is likely to be disastrous.

We are aware that much of the information necessary for a scientific revision of tlie tariff is not availahle anywhere, but we are conM c n t that it is urgently necessary that a f u l l scientific inquiry and investigation should forthwith be instituted by the Commonwealth Government into the wide question of the economic effect of the tariff and the incidence of its duties, with the particular object of furnishing reliable advice to the Government as to the removal of any extravagances and anomalies which it may be found to contain, as to the confinement of its benefits to industries which may reasonably be regarded as efficient, and as to the reduction of its total cost to the community. We consider that while the investigation is proceeding legislative or administrative action to increase duties or impose deferred duties should, so far as is consistent with the continued effective working of the existing tariff, be avoided, in order that the investigation may proceed so far as possible untroubled by disturing changes in its subject-matter. The r e p o r t goes on to sayBut all measures designed for the increase of Australia's wealth production and power of absorbing new population tend to be defeated if there are strong forces within her which operate so to raise her costs of that she cannot sell her products in the markets of the world, and is restricted within the limitations We could not fail to be impressed, our travels in Australia, with the fact of which we wore continually reminded, that, standing the magnitude of the interest on her external debt and of her imports for which payment can only be made in goods or services or, temporarily, by fresh borrowing, exports only an almost negligible quantity of the products of manufacture, unless we include therein minerals such as lead, silver and zinc; while, broadly speaking, the only primary products which she exports in important ties_ and which are not directly assisted by tariffs or bounties, though they may be assisted indirectly taxation on roads, railways, water schemes and the like, are wool, hides and skins, meat and tallow, wlieat and timber. wheat are by far the most important, and it has often, though somewhat loosely, been said to us that the primary industries with these products are the only industries in Australia which stand on their own feet and sell their goods at the world's price; or even, still more loosely and with a change of metaphor, that all Australia is riding on the sheep's back. Without to full acquiescence with these broad expressions of opinion, we may say that we have been strongly disposed to the view that the combined operation of the tariff 'and of the Arbitration Mr Killen. which has laid an excessive and possibly even a dangerous load upon the unsheltered primary industries, which, having to sell in the world's markets, cannot pass on the burden to other sections of the Australian community, and, consequently, as between the various States, upon those, notably Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, which are poor in manufactures and are principally concerned with primary production. These States, and Tasmania probably most of all, are further handicapped by the high costs of freight in interstate trade which result from the operation of the Navigation Acts along wit h the other causes which we have mentioned. . . . We have felt much force in the oft-repeated complaint that successive increases in the tariff whicli affect prices and the cost of living, following upon, or being followed by, successive advances in the cost of labour as the result of decisions under the Arbitration Acts have involved Australia in a vicious circle of ever ascending costs and prices, and that this condition of affairs is crippling Australia's progress and her power of supporting increased population. There lies no task before the Australian people more urgent than that of in some way breaking the vicious circle and of bringing down costs of production, as is being done in the other industrial countries of the world, without lowering *he standard of living of the workers as measured not by money but by real wages, which are the reward of labour in the form of goods and services. The report quotes the opinion of the production Tariff Board in the following termsOur views have merely been strengthened of her own home market. . . . by our study of the reports of the Commonthroughout wealth Tariff Board, who, we observe, in their report for the year 1925-20, say that they notwithare"" strongly of the opinion that the industrial unions of the Commonwealth should be induced to realize the critical Australia position into which the Commonwealth is d r if t in g and the absolute necessity for preventing the wages gap from becoming still wider between the United Kingdom, the Continent of.

Thef o l l o w in g q u o t a t i o n deals w it h our arbitration lawBy workmen's representatives, not less emActs has raised costs to a level phatically than by representatives of the employers, it has been consistently represented to us that the Arbitration Courts are not achieving their purpose and that a system designed to arrive by judicial decisions at fair and prompt settlement of industrial disputes such as could be freely accepted by both sides must be held to have failed. The members of the commission offer the following objection to compulsory arbitration, ancl with them. I cordially agree:The most important of the reasons which have been advanced for this view are that experience has shown that there arises between the two parties who appear before the Arbitration Court Judge or Arbitrator the spirit of antagonism inseparable from litigation, and that the object of prompt settlement is defeated by the delay occasioned by the necessity for the collection and presentation of detailed evidence in a form acceptable to a court. It is complained that the procedure of the court occasions the expenditure of much time and money by the litigants and involves very long absences from their ordinary occupations for a large number of persons whose time might be more profitably employed; that the subject matter of the questions, which are brought before the courts is not of a nature with which judicial tribunals, necessarily unversed in the contend, as do these gentlemen also, that practical problems of industry or in the economic questions to which they give rise, are best fitted to deal; and that the overlapping jurisdictions of tlie Federal and State Arbitration Courts have led to an almost in extricable tangle of conflicting decisions so complicated that large staffs have to be maintained to keep track of them and to endeavour to guard against involuntary contravention of any of them in the course of every-day business. The indictment of the system of the Arbitramembers being asked to take part in an in tion Courts which we have heard is a heavy one; and we feel that it is well founded on' many grounds, and particularly on the ground tliat the system has tended to consolidate employers and employees into two opposing camps, and has lessened the inducement to either side to resort to round table conferences at subsequent meetings there should he no obfor that frank and confidential discussion of difficulties in the light of mutual understanddelegates of their difficulties and their aspiraing and sympathy which is the best means of arriving at fair and workable industrial agreesessions of the conference there w ill result ments. They go on to sayA change in the method prevalent in Australia of dealing with industrial disputes appears to us to be essential, and we hold that there should be a minimum of judicial and governmental interference in them except in so far as matters affecting the health and safety of persons engaged in industry may be concerned. They then deal with the basic wageFurther, a system of wage fixation resting upon a basic money wage which rises or falls with a varying index figure of the cost of living is open to the gravest criticism, as tending to deprive employees of any interest in the prosperity of the industry with which they are connected. Let us assume that by better, more energetic, and more willing work on the part of all concerned from the highest to the lowest, the output of Australian industries were increased with no increase in overhead cost. The natural economic effect would be that prices a l l round would f a l l and that consumption and profits would rise; but as the cost of living would f a l l the basic wage would also fall, and with it all wages fixed by the Arbitration Courts in relation to the basic wage with margins for especial skill and the like. Thus the system is such as to give the worker in industry no interest in a cheaper cost of living, and no inducement to that increased efficiency which would tend to bring it about. In such a case as we have imagined it would be only right that wages should rise and that tlie workmen should share in the increased prosperity so largely attri butable to them. It is only if all concerned in industry genuinely feel that their own fortunes are hound up with its success or failure that that solidarity in industry 'which is essential to its prosperity can be achieved. No person wishes to see wages fall. I the real wage would be higher, and that the workers would be better off than they are now, under a system of payment by results, such as that which is enjoyed by workers in the TJnited States of America. The output of our industries. also would be very much greater than it is at the present time. Our Mission was honoured by two of its dustrial conference held in Melbourne during December last. A t that conference the necessity for closer and more friendly relationship between all concerned in industry was fully"" recognized by the delegates present, and the discussions were of so frank a nature that stacle to the candid exposition by all the tions. We hope and believe that from future the formulation of agreed alternative methods for fixing wages and laying down conditions of employment, which may render the present functions of the Arbitration Courts unnecessary, and substitute for them a system of settlement of industrial problems by industry itself on practical and acceptable lines in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and goodwill. We even venture to hope that the spirit generated from this conference w ill be such as to facilitate the task, which after investigation such as we have recommended we trust that the Government will undertake, of tariff revision. The problem of the tariff is, as we have said, closely interlocked with that of the fixation of wages, and a happy solution of tlie latter problem should do more than anything else could to make possible the soluwages unless it yielded good profits. The tion of the former under the indispensable conditions of freedom from class or political strife and bitterness. In my opinion, this is a most valuable expression of opinion with which every one who has studied the subject must agree. It coincides to a large extent with the view expressed by the delegation which the Government sent to the TJnited States of America last year to inquire into industrial affairs there. I submit that this document proves conclusively that the system of payment by results greatly increases the prosperity of the workers and of the community generally. We should adopt the system in Australia. I am glad that His Excellency the Governor General sympathetically referred in his Speech to the necessity for encouraging co-operation between employers and employees. think that we shall have to abolish compulsory arbitration before we can expect a proper spirit to be displayed in industry. What is needed is more roundtable conferences, where the problems of industry can be discussed in a friendly spirit away from the atmosphere of a law court. We couldvery well learn a lesson from the TJnited States of America in this connection. bered that during the war the people of the TJnited States of America experienced a time of remarkable prosperity. obtained high prices for all their products, and the employers paid high wages to the workers. But after the war prices fell, and for a considerable time the industries of the nation were dislocated. When the employers suggested that wages should be reduced the workers strenuously resisted the proposal. However, the time soon came when both parties realized that something had to be done. This conclusion was forced upon them by the distress which existed throughout the country. At that stage the Government took a hand and called the parties to "" a round-table conference with the object of devising ways and means of remedying the troubles which were afflicting the people. employers on their part admitted that the workers had every right to a reasonable wage which would enable them to live in comfort. The workers on their part who have never done a hard day's work admitted that industry could not pay good in their lives to talk as the honourable Mr Killen. result of the conference was that a system of payment by results was adopted. This led to an increase in wages of from 30 to 40 per cent, in the case of energetic workers, and a new era of prosperity was ushered in for the nation. Many of the workers in the TJnited States of America own motor cars to-day. The more thrifty ones hold shares in the industries in which they are engaged or in other industries. The workers of America actually own 25 of the banks operating in the country. How different is the situation in Australia! Here we have strike after strike. During the last six years between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 bave been lost through cessations of work. Our workmen do not own shares to any great extent in the industries which employ them, and generally there is a Personally, I lack of co-operation between employers and employees. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite do not agitate for the introduction of the system of payment by results. Perhaps they are afraid that it would upset the slow and lazy worker, or might offend some of the unions which champion the go-slow policy and penalize the energetic employees. At any rate I have never heard one honIt will be rememorable member opposite speak in favour of the adoption of the system here. It would appear that their desire is to They reduce the first-class worker to the level of the slow and lazy workers. Do honourable members opposite intend to sit quietly by and allow our industrial situation to drift from bad to worse? The experience of America is an object lesson to the world. If the American method of dealing with industry were adopted iu Australia the workers and the community generally would be far better off. It must be remembered that good wages .and good conditions, like all good things, can be had only at a price. The price of good wages is work. It is of no use for us to imagine that we can prosper under the prevalent go-slow policy.

More white people were living in that district before the railway was built than are to be found there at the present time. To within a short distance of Alice Springs, the country is not capable of carrying more than from one to three cattle per square mile, and it is useless to spend millions in trying to develop it. I know a gentleman who has been a large holder of land along the route of the railway for the last thirteen government under which they live, but or fourteen years. I saw him on my return from the Northern Territory, and he imagined that the object of my visit was to acquire cheap land. As a matter of fact, nothing was further from my mind. I went there simply to discover whether or not the construction of the railway was justified. He remarked that he was prepared to sell me some good stations up there. He offered me 8,000 square miles of country along the route of the railway between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs for £5,000 with all improvements. I replied that I would not have that country at a gift. He then said, "" You are right. I have had it for thirteen or fourteen years and have not made a shilling out of it . "" What hope, therefore, would there be for small settlers? It would be a pure waste of money to continue the line northward. The tragedy of it is that while this poor country is being opened up, good country on the Barkly Tablelands, which could have been developed very much more cheaply, is being left idle. developed without, a railway ? velopment by means of a line from Borraloola, which could be later extended to connect with the Queensland system on the east and with Wyndham on the west. There would also be the line from Pine Creek to Daly Waters. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to the matters referred to by the Economic Commission and by the Industrial Delegation to the United States of America. If heed were given to the recommendations of those bodies, much could he done to improve conditions in Australia. It is essential that this be done if we are to. progress as a nation. The satisfactory nature of the bulletins now being received regarding the health of His Majesty the King is most gratifying. The whole Empire has been moved by His Majesty's illness and the deep concern of the people shows that he has won the love and esteem of his subjects throughout his wide dominions. His people appreciate not only the system of also His Majesty's personal qualities as a ruler.

We regret, of course, that we have lost a number of able and patriotic men, but we do not despair. We intend to carry on the affairs of this country in such a way that when the Parliament again seeks the suffrages of the people, we shall be returned in greater numbers than ever. It is only natural, considering the present Ministry's long term of office, that there should be some attempt to bring about a change of government. It is remarkable that the Nationalist party has remained so powerful as it has been for so long a period, and the Prime MinI advocate its deister and his colleagues are to be congratulated on their success. The Ministry that now adorns the Treasury bench has a majority sufficiently large to enable it to carry on the government without fear of serious trouble from the Opposition.

215,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [9.37],"fail to see bow that is to be accomplished. I have always favoured a reduction in the duties imposed on commodities used in primary production. We should be destroying the foundations of the national structure if we hampered our primary producers. Our secondary industries have made great progress, but we do not send secondary products overseas to a sufficient extent to bring new wealth into the country. It is easy to find evidence of unemployment in Melbourne and Sydney, where the curse of centralization has long been felt. Honourable members opposite have their own special cure for these industrial evils. Their remedy is to raise the tariff. Indeed, some members of the Labour party would place an absolute embargo on the importation of all conomodities that can be produced in Australia. I disagree with them. In tariff matters, I prefer to judge every request for a protective duty on its merits. I do not care whether honourable members opposite say that, in this matter, I am consistent or inconsistent. If I believe that a certain industry is likely to develop along satisby the amount produced. In some factory lines and eventually provide employment on an extensive scale, I am prepared to give it every reasonable support through the tariff. Unfortunately, many Australian industries have been bolstered up under our present system of high tariffs and for this reason they are not economically sound. In respect of such industries I should advocate a reduction in the duties imposed. industry ? try is capable of immense development. It breeds some of the finest men in Australia, and if those engaged in it were left alone; if they paid no attention to the advice of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, they would be able to patch up their present differences with employers and the industry would progress normally. I am hoping that during the life of this Parliament my friends in the Country party and a number of Nationalist members who share our views will be able to 'do something to ease the tariff burdens on primary production. We shall then be able to go to the people and say that at last we were strong enough to secure for them some of the tariff reforms which we had promised. I have always held that if Australia is to be prosperous, we must have industrial peace. I have stated also that the Arbitration Act is faulty from start to finish, because it has done nothing to ensure peace in industry. I am afraid that the act is largely responsible for our present unsatisfactory industrial position. I fail to see any reason for the existence of the Arbitration Court. In nine cases out of ten, if the workers engaged in an industry had an opportunity to meet their employers in . conference, they would be able to settle their differences amicably. No judge of the Arbitration Court can expect to gain a complete insight into the difficulties of a particular industry and therefore give an award that will be satisfactory to all the parties. One of the objections to the arbitration system is that if the award rate in an industry is £5 a week, that rate must stand regardless of the ability of the employer to pay it, and still carry on. Again in many awards the remuneration of labour is fixed according to time and not instances this operates unfairly. It should be clear to all honourable members that industrial concerns cannot be carried on in this way. No one had a higher regard than I had for the late Mr Justice Higgins as an equity barrister, and a humane, impartial man; but I am afraid his formula for the fixing of a living wage is against the law of economics, and therefore must fail. Personally, I ' should like to see every one in Australia in receipt of high wages. I believe that the Commonwealth would then be a much better place than it is; but if high wages are paid, there must be a corresponding increase in industrial output. No one could continue to pay me, or any other man, £2 a week if I did not give £2 worth of labour by way of return. handed to the honourable member just now! Is there any chance of a ministerial job?

220,Mr Atkinson,"I can assure theI t is' distressing to find that many Australian industries, which formerly were flourishing, are now in a bad way. We can trace a good deal of our present trouble to the action of militant' industrial leaders, who have succeeded in misleading employees. Honourable members opposite give good advice to trade unionists, but they seem to be guided by such bodies as 'the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Consequently, we have this frequent dislocation of industry, which works more harm to the employees than -to employers. If , as I have said before, it were possible for employers and employees to meet in conference, there would be a much better chance of industrial peace. Unfortunately, industrial agitators are continually stirring up trouble and members of industrial organizations find themselves called out on strike ""willy ""nilly "" whenever a dispute occurs. The 'men do not get a fair chance. In the majority of cases they Would prefer to remain at work, and arrange their differences with their employers in an amicable way. I have never been able to understand why it has not been possible to resume work in an industry when the aid of the Arbitration Court has been invoked. Surely it should be possible to get the men back to work pending a settlement of the difficulty that has led to a strike. I am inclined to think that under the act as it stands, there -is some obstacle, because we have had that measure on the statute-book for 24 years, and I have not seen reference to any provision Which would get over the .difficulty I have mentioned. There should be no trouble about the matter, because an award can be made retrospective. I am hoping that before long better counsels will prevail, and that we shall have peace in industry. This will only be possible,, however, if the men follow the advice of their recognized leaders. Trouble >always will occur if they remain under the domination of -militant industrialists.

They do not know whether they can trust their leaders, and they are looking to honourable, members opposite, who have been elected to represent them, for guidance at this time. They want a lead; yet not one honourable gentleman opposite has the courage to give it to them. The reason that the timber workers are fearful of what is going to happen them is that the leaders, the men whom honourable members opposite are afraid to challengeI refer to the Australasian Council of Trades Unions-ar e the very men who brought disaster upon the unfortunate waterside workers, who followed their guidance.

Honourable members opposite realize the seriousness of the position, but have not the courage to challenge the leadership of the Australasian Council of Trades Unions.

Another great issue to which the Leader of the Opposition addressed himself throughout the election campaign was the volume of unemployment in Australia. He rather led the people of this country to believe that he had some remedy for this evil, some practical proposal whioh, if he were returned to office, he would put into effect and unemployment would disappear. The Leader of the Opposition has now an opportunity, not to indulge in vague platitudes from the platform, but, on the floor of this chamber, to make known to the country the nature of his remedies for unemployment and to give to this House an opportunity to fully debate his proposals. But. we have not heard one word from him on the subject. In his policy speech he gave neither the Parliament nor the country any assistance in dealing with this problem. It will be remembered that he saidTo alleviate the sufferings of the unemployed, PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE. early action will be taken to establish a system of unemployment insurance, the sum created timating that Senator J. B. Hayes, to be distributed, as far as practicable, in providing work. At the first glance one might consider that to be the germ of a great idea, but it will not bear analysis. The honourable gentleman has assured us that there are 180,000 persona unemployed in this oountry. He has said that he would provide for these people by means of insurance payments, and I am sure that neither he nor any member of his party would consent to the payment of less than £4 5s. a week. If 180,000 persons were paid SA 58. a week the annual payment would be £39,700,000. The Leader of the Opposition gave no indication, of how and where this money could he obtained. He did not say whether the workers would contribute to the insurance fund; but he said most emphatically that borrowing must be reduced, so apparently his idea is not to borrow the money required for insurance. He also said, in his appeal to the electors, that taxation must be reduced ; that our taxation had been excessive. That statement means nothing at all, and he knew that when he made it.
