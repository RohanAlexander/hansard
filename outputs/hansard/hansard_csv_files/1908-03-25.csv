0,"$?Ouse Of Tirprcsnitatibrs. And Read Prayers. South Australia Appearing, In To","day's newspapers, it is stated that the practice followed at Port Adelaide during the last"" twelve months in regard to Customs entries has been found somewhat unsatisfactory, and a return to the old system is asked for, subject to the modifications necessary to check the possibility of frauds such as were recently discovered being again perpetrated. On the 2nd October last, Tasked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether entries might not be -madeand checked before the reporting of the vessels carrying the goods to which they referred, and he told me thafa trial of that system would be given, and that, if it were found to work satisfactorily, it would' be made permanent. I now ask him whether any-' thing has been done in the direction of complying with the request which I thenvoiced for the agents and importers of Port Adelaide. A large deputation had previously waited on the Minister in connection with, the matter. at Adelaide a deputation on this .subject, and it has since been engaging my attention. When the honourable member asked .this question in October last, a trial was being given to the new system, and I deemed it advisable to extend the period of probation. The Department is anxious to give every facility for the passing of. entries without the removal of 'any safeguard against leakageor frauds on the revenue, and I shall be glad to ascertain how. the. matter stands, and let the honourable and learned member know later, the result of my inquiry. any objection to laying on the table all the papers connected with' the appointment of Mr Beale as Royal Commissioner to inquire into certain matters affecting, the use of drugs, and the papers connected with, the publication of his report?

I ask the Minister to inquire as to the cause of the delay, and to expedite matters as much as possible. which have come under my notice are various. In the last instance, it was due to our dependence on the Works Departments of the States, whose officers, when there is pressure, naturally give preference to State undertakings.

Those boats which are not owned by Japanese are manned by them, and the divers are allowed to keep all the pearls they find, after first of all receiving £80 a ton for their shell. Twentythree thousand pounds a year is the average value of the pearls obtained, and practically every penny of this goes home to Tokio or Nikko, as well as the £&> per ton for the shell. Australian dealers buy most of the pearls, so that it may be said Australia pays the Japanese over ^20,000 per annum for her own pearls. Of the uses to which that ^20,000 may be put some of these days there is no need to speak, for every one knows. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister's attention has been directed to the above paragraph, whether, to his knowledge, the facts are as stated, and whether proper steps are being taken to see that the provisions of the. Immigration Restriction Act are rigidly enforced? paragraph in question,-and, speaking from memory, the facts,as stated, are substanI desire to ask the ' tially true. The Immigration Restriction -Act is being rigidly enforced. The condition of things referred to in the article quoted by the honourable member exists because of the State law in regard to the working of the pearl fisheries. The disposition of the pearls and any advantages gained by the Japanese are not under Commonwealth control. PRI CE OF HARVESTERS . asked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether reductions had been made in the price of harvesters in accordance with the Act of 1906, which provides for a reduction of £ 5 in 1907, and of another £ 5 in 1908.

27,,"I am not aware of any Mr POYNTON -Some time ago Isurer tells me that harvesters are selling in his electorate for ^65 each, and we know that there was, in the first instance, a general reduction in price. In October last an investigation was made throughout the States as to prices charged for Australian stripper-harvesters and drills, and it was found that the cash prices charged were in accordance with the Act. No single complaint has reached the Department of any overcharge. It may be mentioned that the Act specially provides for cash prices. Most of the sales are on credit, with various conditions as to the manufacturer keeping the machines in repair, & c , for varying periods. In regard to credit sales, we are advised the Act does not apply. Further investigation is now about to be made in regard to the reduction in prices which the Act provides should become operative from 1st February, 1908. of the. sales are on credit. DoI understand the Minister's answer to mean that unless farmers are prepared to pay cash for their harvesters, the manufacturers of these machines are at liberty to charge any price that they may think fit, notwithstanding the Act passed by this Parliament in 1906? advised that in regard to credit sales the Act does not apply. can charge just what they please. farce and a sham. when the Act in question was passed, the Government had in their minds that the' price to be paid for these machines was to be considered as either cash or credit. In other words, they had no intention of asking Parliament to pass a measure, regulating the price of these machines, which would be utterly useless? that the honourable member presumes too much in venturing to state what was in the mind of the Government, and in saying that the Act has proved to be utterly useless. If he knew anything about the matter, he would know that quite the reverse has been the case. Section4 of the Act readsI f the Governor General is satisfied that the three, six, or twelve months, or for two or cash prices at which stripper harvesters and drills manufactured in Australia are sold exceed the prices hereunder set out he may by proclamation reduce the rate of duty specified [339]2 in the schedule in respect of stripper harvesters, but so that the reduction shall not reduce the rate of duty below one-half the rate of duty imposed by this Act. that was. all that the Government intended to accomplish when the Act was passed? we intended to accomplish that which the Act sets out. ment fooled the House. ter of fact the prices of harvesters, both for cash and credit, have been reduced as far as we know, but further inquiries are being made. do not know very much. far as we know. Government is very limited upon that score. knowledge I am aware that in New South Wales the prices of these machines, both for cash and credit, have been reduced. But any honourable member ought to know that when certain risks have to be taken, very frequently the prices charged differ from those which are charged for spot cash.. ister whether it is not possible to fix a price for cash, plus so much for terms of credit, so that persons purchasing these machines, will know the amount that is being charged them for credit? tainly would be possible to do that. But: the Department can only carry out the provisions of the law"". the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to. introduce a Bill amending the Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906 by limiting the price at which stripper harvesters may be sold upon credit terms? open to the Government to reconsider the whole question of these Excise duties at a comparatively early date, and' to adapt its .proposals to what we shall then know . of -the exact constitutional powers of the Parliament.

The Opposition has endeavoured, without success, to minimize some of the very drastic proposals of this measure, but the Government, in this instance, as in many others, have had behind them a majority prepared to impose upon the minority whatever conditions If a case they chose to suggest. In this respect they have succeeded in producing an instrument which, in its penalties, sanctions, and I am afraid that the powers, goes far beyond anything that has been attempted in a British community. I do not pretend to say that legislation, severe and unusual, is not required to meet the far-reaching evils of industrial trusts; but the measures should receive the fullest possible consideration, with a desire to make their provisions such as will afford a possibility of administering them as Parliament intended them to be administered. We have not been able to modify any of the drastic provisions in this B ill ; but.there is ence, there is not the slightest danger of those provisions being put into f u l l force. The question should None of the provisions of similar legislation passed by this Chamber have ever been f u l ly operative; and it is just about time for honourable members, in the Labour corner particularly, who are constantly clamouring for legislation, such as we have passed in recent years, to begin to realize that it is simply a political placard, and is intended for nothing more.

As The Opposition have in this discussion has been launched, however, I shall very briefly address myself to one aspect of the question. I have said before I should not like to prefer that I think some measure of this kind is necessary, and that some of the powers given by the Bill are desirable. I have supported the Government proposal with regard to the onus of proof, since it only shifts on to the-person accused the onus of I agree with the honproof as to matters which are strictly and entirely within his own knowledge.

What is the position ? At present in Australia a vast amount of money which, in a new country like this, ought to be available for starting industries and giving employment to men out of work, is being hoarded. It is being deposited in banks or invested in safe securities. Arid for what reason? I can give one, although I do not say it is the only reason for this state of affairs.

Mr W. H . IRVINE not plain enough ? I differ from the Labour Party as widely, perhaps, as any member in the House; and I never conceal the f a c t ; but, while that'is so, we can discuss matters in a friendly way. I ask members of the Labour Party whether they have considered the side of the question I have presented. When they talk about unemployment, have they fully considered whether legislation of this character may not be one of the causes which conduce to the shrinking of the whole area of employment? starve with this legislation as without it . Mr W. H . IRVINE --What kind of argument is that? I am in favour of proper, reasonable, and effective legislation in this direction, in accordance with our necessities. I am also in favour of exjDerimental legislation in reference to the fixation of wages, under reasonably secure* conditions, so that a-man may have some kind of certainty as to the tribunal he has to obey. of the reasonable conditions?

Such legislation may be rendered necessary at some future time, if. we ever approach anything like the state of things existing in the United States of America. private investigations made in connection with the income tax? Mr W. H . IRVINE No t to nearly the same extent. Besides such inquiries are absolutely essential to collecting money in the form of an income tax; and there is a great distinction between the two cases. The Income Tax Commissioner is entitled to make certain inquiries for a very de : finite and limited purpose; but under the Bill an officer can demand any information from a man, who, it may be, is obeying the law, paying a fair wage, and honestly carrying on his business in his own way. Is the position obeying the law, or these inquiries would not be made. Mr W. H . IRVINE T h a t interjection points my argument. All that the Opposition desire is that these inquisitorial powers should not 'be exercised until a 1 prima facie case has been madeout that a man has broken the law. Under such a condition, a man might enter on a new enterprise, reasonably -confident that, until a prima facie case was established, he would not be liable to have his most prii t is just as well to vate concerns investigated by an officer under the direction of the Minister. I do not desire to detain honourable members longer, because it is too late now to make any alteration in the Bill. The interjection of the honourable member for Kennedy shows that he and his colleagues do not f u l l y appreciate the lengths to which this legislation goes; and I simply rose to present one aspect, which, I think, may have escaped the attention of my honourable friends in the Labour corner.

Here, in my opinion, is the crux of the whole position. It is that uncertainty as to wages that has-given rise to conciliation and arbitration and other industrial legislation. If a man, in commencing an industry, is able to obtain labour at 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, less than is paid by a rival in the same line of business, the latter is forced to come down to a lower level, or be undersold. Mr W. member mistakes my argument. WhatI said was that I am. entirely in favour of the regulation of wages, but totally opDosed to that regulation being carried out by half-a-dozen different and possibly conflicting tribunals. puts a different complexion on the question. I desire to show, however, that one of the principal causes of unemployment is the competitive system under which our industries are at present carried on. That system has given rise to two classes in the community-one , the employer, who is trying to get the most work for the least money, and the employee*, who is trying to get the most wages for the least work. So long as we have the competitive, system, we shall have these antagonistic classes; and the employer will be constantly on the lookplundering the people generally. If that duction, with the result of throwing thouskilled to the unskilled labour market. home of machinery? This Bill is an attempt to regulate these matters; . and I may here straightforwardly say that I have no faith in the ultimate success of the attempt. It is, I believe, an effort on the part of the Government to do something, but', personally, There is only one method by which trusts and combines can be successfully controlled, namely, the nationalization of industries. We realize, however, that this Parliament is not prepared to accept the policy of nationalization; and, in the meantime, we are content to accept whatever legislation may tend in the direction of regulating these matters. Sir JOHN FORREST I understand that the honourable member and bis party believe only in nationalizing monopolies? if we can, as the platform of the Labour Party shows. wishes to make a big Russia of Australia ! a stage in the industrial conflict, when questions of this kind must' be discussed intelligently; and the Labour Party is not to be affected by mere abuse from one side or the other. started the abuse. if I did, I apologize. What led to the introduction of this Bill? It is, as I say, an effort to regulate certain persons, who are trying to abolish that very competition which has been the means of Bringing about unemployment, and which has had such a detrimental effect on our industrial life. Huge monopolies are formed with the object of crushing out all competition, and securing complete control; the existence of such monopolies proves that competition is the great curse of our commercial system. competition, and yet it is a curse? away with competition for the sole purpose of obtaining complete control, and",27,Australian Industries Preservati On Bill Third Reading

I do not know why elaborate reports are prepared upon the subject, and why extensive correspondence should take place between the Premiers of the States and the Prime Ministeri f whatever guidance may be obtained from such reports and correspondence is to be disregarded, and a new policy is to be entered upon. There is no doubt that as Imperial citizens of Australia we are bound to take an interest in the development or the check of immigration to the Commonwealth from other parts of the Empire. days ago, in looking up the Times of 31st December, 1906, I noticed that a report had been presented by Mr Coghlan to the New South Wales Government on the subject of emigration. Of course, the Times considered the matter from the Imperial point of view. article in that journal, the report stated that between 1884 and 1904 the total emigration of British subjects and foreigners from British ports had increased from .303,901 to 453,877, but that fKe proportion directed to Australia and New Zealand had declined from nearly 46,000 to a little over 14,000a decline which is somewhat disconcerting from the Imperial point of view. It was further pointed out that during 1904 the actual net emigration to Australia and New Zealand-that means, I take it , the emigration from British. ports showed an increase of only 5,336. Just about the same period there was some talk of an extensive policy of immigration being entered upon by a concert between the Commonwealth and the various States. this fact in mind, I noted shortly afterwards that we were cautioned against bringing out certain classes of immigrants. I do not wish to refer to the particular bodies in the United Kingdom who desired to organize emigration of this class, but in one of the reviews it was pointed out that there was a very large number of persons-the emigration of whom was being suggested-wh o would be utterly useless as new colonists. Take, for instance, the report of the London County Council, which showed that out of 1,212 pupils examined in its schools, 75 per cent, were ineffective and 43T were mentally affected. It does not necessarily follow that because there is a large surplus population ""in one part of the Empire its introduction into Australia would be of benefit to this country. Of course, Canada has recently been very much favoured by immigrants. I think that last ypar's record was 250,000. The Dominion Government have spent about ^200,000 in assisting those immigrants, and in addition we know that very large inducements are offered to them by the railway companies.. A t present a new Canadian Pacific lineI think it is called the Great .Northern line-is being constructed. Necessarily these companies have to import a certain class of labour. So that, taking these facts into consideration, and also the fact which was pointed out in the report of the Agents-General that during Two or three the three years ended 1.906 about 13.000,000 acres had been taken up in Canada by about 86,000 settlers, it is no wonder that there should have been a very large increase in the number of immigrants arriving there. I believe that the actual number of emigrants to Canada between 1901 and 1906 According to the was 661,000. We know, too, that there has been a very iarge development in the western, provinces.. Within four or five years the wheat production has increased six-fold --that is, from 30,000,000 bushels to over 200,000,000 bushels. This enormous increase in production has led to a "" spurt "" in connection with immigration. But we must also recollect that Canada has not been able to retain its natural increase. In 1900 there were 1,200,000 native-born who had passed over the border, and were living in the United States. few years the exodus has been in the other direction. facts which I am stating.

Then they refer to a class of men who, as the result of their industry have saved perhaps £ 2 5 to £50, and also to a class "" which is comparatively numerous"" men with no means, some skilled farm labourers, and some without even that qualification, who, in the opinion of the Agents-General should be assisted to wherever they wish to emigrate. This particular class-and especially labourers, whose average wage in England is only about 14s. per weekhas been swelling the tide of immigration to Canada during the last five or six years; but' it is not, on the whole, the class that we should seek to induce to come to Australia. some very fine men amongst the immigrants to Canada. no less than 38,000 emigrants leave Ireland, aind a good many of them go toCanada. They, are not, I think, assisted immigrants. They either pay their own fare, or their friends who have preceded them assist them to emigrate. Immigrants to. Canada and America have saved money there and helped their friends to join them. Even the hard-working servant girl has often used her savings in assisting her brother or, let us be no need for assisted immigration, if hope, her sweetheart, to join her in Canada or the United States. There are inducements, apart altogether from assisted immigration, for people to go to some countries. The Agents-General, after very carefully considering the whole matter, recom 1 mend that a substantial class that canbe put upon the land is the classof immigrants that we 'ought to encourage, but they state that the greatest number that the Commonwealth could hope to accommodate in one year is about 2,000. It is mentioned, at page 6 of the memorandum, that Queensland was making an average concession of £ 1 1 per head to nominated immigrants, whilst Western Australia was making a concession of about £ 5 per head. That arrangement, however, does not seem to have been very successful. I do hot know what are the figures as to immigration to those two States during the periods when In the this inducement was held out, but I believe that in ten years not more than 50,000 went there. speaking from memory. We ought to bear this in mind in connection with financing an immigration scheme. What the Agents General said isand are anxious to emigrate, At this distance it is difficult to gauge the capacity of Australia to receive immigrants, and, therefore, we do not attempt to make an estimate of the cost of introducing the policy herein outlined; but we certainly think that 2,000 adults would be as many immigrants, of an eligible type, and of the classes herein indicated as suitable for immigration to Australia, as could be accommodated in one year. That is the report presented to the Prime Minister for his guidance, and I should like to know whether he proposes to act on it. Is all this talk about immigration to be simply directed towards the subvention of not more than 2,000 eligible persons per annum ? If so, what was the use of all the talk at the Conference in England about the millions that could be settled in Australia under a certain policy. What are the electors to understand from ' No doubt. Every year, the Prime Minister's recent estimate of an ultimate total of about 100,000,000 people in Australia ? What are the electors asked to do in view of those rhetorical statements from the platform, and of the coldblooded presentation in the memorandum of the Agents-General of what is possible ? available for the people. there were available areas of land, which would tempt people to come here, notwithstanding the distance.

223,Mr Sampson,"But we have reached 'the development of the iron industry, and the commencement of certain public works, we shall inevitably require more people. The question of immigration always impresses me as being the most important that this Parliament has to deal with, seeing that it is the very foundation of a national policy. What is the value of protection, or of our defence proposal, unless we have people here to do the developmental work? Only a glance at the statistics is required to show that our progress in the way of population has, for many years, been too slow. In the ten years from 1851-61 the increase of population in all Australia was 744,988 ; for 1.861-71 the increase was 512,237; for 1871-81 it was 587,232 ; for 1881-91 it was 923,983; for 1891-1901 it was 594,659, and from 1901 to 1905, the increase was 278,769. crease at the same ratio for the remainder of the ten years up to 1911, we shall have a total increase of 557,000 odd, which, of course, is a decrease as compared with former decades. the natural increase by births over deaths. that the great falling off in population has occurred since the States ceased to carry out a policy of assisted immigration. the States ceased borrowing. something to do with the decrease. Since the inauguration of Federation, Australian production has increased by 30 per cent -, whereas our population has increased by only 15 per cent. A comparison between Australia and Canada has been made in connection with immigration; and it has been stated that the policy in the latter Dominion has been overdone, with the result that large numbers of people are going to the United States, while others are finding their way back to their own countries. I take that to mean that the resources of Canada are not to be compared with the resources of some other countries. In the United States, the average annual increase in population is 750.000, though last year it was nearly 1,500,000. alone. show that when immigrants go to the United States, they find a country with a great variety of resources. This additional population causes those resources to be developed, because it stimulates the Government to undertake public works, and encourages private enterprise to invest in large ventures, all of which tend to general development. The Commonwealth and the States Governments have an annual revenue of about £50,000,000, and yet less than £50,000 per annum is spent on immigration. member is understating the amount a good deal, because .my information is that this year Queensland alone spends more than £50,000. which I saw, I was under the impression that 1 was overstating the amount, If we take the inthough possibly the Prime Minister has later statistics than I have. pended must be over £100,000. has an oversea trade of something like ,£114,000,000, and yet, according to the statement of the Prime Minister,we have spent this year only about £1,200 in advertising the Commonwealth. 1906-7, not 1907-8. I conveyed a mistaken impression when I spoke of it as this year's expenditure. This year, I think, the expenditure now reaches about £2,500. spending the vote which has not yet been passed, of larger sums for items which have been approved on previous Estimates. The telegraphing of the Tariff items this year represents an additional expenditure of £500 or £600, as compared with last year, and publications are .being more widely circulated at an equally increased cost. there has already been spent £1,200, and that it is anticipated that there will be additional expenditure, amounting, however, to only hundreds, and not thousands. as I say, I was using last year'sfiguresinstead of the present year's figures, which are larger. has for many years taught us a lesson in immigration, the Dominion Government spending something like ,£200,000 a",34,Department Of External Affairs

I saw that Mr Mead, the new Chairman of the Water Commission of Victoria, said the other day that the immigrants who found their way to Canada last year, chiefly assisted by the Government, possessed a total capital in cash of something like £12,000,000; and it appears to me that an immigration policy on the part of the Commonwealth could be justified on purely business principles, as returning a handsome and immediate result. estimated by the honourable member for East Sydney, when attending the Hobart Conference as Prime Minister in 1904, that a subsidy of about £ 8 per head would be sufficient to bring out immigrants. If we spent £400,000 per annum in bringing out 50,000 immigrants, this would mean, on the Canadian basis, additional residents possessing amongst them £2,000,000 in actual cash. Then, if we calculate £200 per head for about one-third of the number, as representing what is generally acknowledged to be the value of an adult man in good health, we have represented an additional value of £3,500,000; and, therefore,. 50,000 people would, as soon as they landed, mean an added value to Australia of about £5,000,000, in return for an expenditure of £4.00,000. must lay down sound principles before we can proceed with practical legislation. The Prime Minister has emphasized the importance of the immigration question on several occasions, and the probability is that he has said all that can reasonably be said. With his keen grasp of political questions and his statesmanship, the Prime Minister, recently at Lilydale, in one of the most pungent, practical addresses he has delivered, emphasized the importance of the question; and Australia is waiting for the Government to introduce some definite, practical measure to give effect to the views which have been so frequently and eloquently expressed. We have had enough talk on this question. "" Population is needed, not merely to train as soldiers, which is a secondary consideration, but to develop its resources, and therefore we must, without, further delay, offer encouragement to immigration' by passing such legislation as will tend to bring here in sufficient numbers the proper class of immigrants. If the Prime Minister introduces practical definite proposals such as he has forecast, he will properly interpret, the views Colony and the Transvaal, because the of the majority of the people of Australia. other honourable members,, think that there should be no cheese-paring or niggardliness in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, because the money will be wasted unless we do things well.

I have such faith in the country that I believe that if , to-morrow, I had only my swag, I should be top-dog again within twelve or eighteen months. In Queensland there is an immigration system which allows any resident of the State to nominate for' assisted passages persons up to the age of fifty years, on payment of a scale of charges ranging from the price of the kit for female domestics and males up to the age of twenty-one, to j£io as a maximum. persons resident in Queensland to send for their relatives and parents.

But although the honourable member for Wimmera loudly advocates a vigorous immigration policy, let me read to honourable members a letter which the honourable member for Echuca brought under the notice of the Treasurer in August last. It is as followsMethodist Parsonage, Rushworth, 30th July, 1907. Dear Sir, It is now a long time since the Government dumped down some twenty-seven returned Australians from South Africa here. They were informed by some one in the office of the Closer Settlement Board that work would be waiting for them on their arrival in Rushworth. The whole thing was a sad bungle both for the men and the public of this town, on whose charity they were cast. A public subscription was made, but this was insufficient to provide for them until the Government (State) agreed to give them a fortnight's work at Waranga Basin. gentlemen here had in addition to what they did before, to guarantee six or seven publicans the cost of the keep of most of these men for a time, feeling that when the authorities were made aware of their action they would reimburse us for this outlay : indeed, possibly return the pubNow that lic subscription in f u l l , seeing that the fault lay solely with the authorities who sent the men. here.

Did the writer think that he would get a reply after being told that? If so, he was a fool. The letter continuesAfter a considerable lapse pf time and nothing further arriving, I again wrote Mr Jenkins, and two others signed the letter; but no reply has as yet come to hand.

Sydney) [6.16] I do not propose to enter the very wide field of discussion which this question presents^ since I feel that there must be some termination to our consideration of the Estimates, and that it would be unwise at the present time to deal very fully with the subject. At the same time, I wish to say that I do not share the readiness of the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Kooyong to vote a sum of £20,000 for advertising Australia in the absence of an intimation from the Government as to the nature of their proposals. Much more than £20,000 will be necessary for the purpose in view, but though I will gladly support a larger outlay, I hesitate to agree to an item of this kind which is not accompanied by any definite proposals on the part of the Government. I had hoped that the Prime Minister, since he cannot spend the whole of this sum during the current financial year, would be satisfied with a vote covering what is likely to be expended, leaving any demand for a larger vote to be considered in connection with future Estimates, and in conjunction with a scheme to be carried out with or without the co-operation of the States. We cannot altogether blame the States for the attitude they have taken up. They say, in effect, "" We have the land. We have to provide for the people who are brought out here in large numbers, and we can do so."" We could arrange to bring out imit can provide for them? land, New South Wales, and Western Australia, to the extent of their available lands, provide for immigrants, and they say, "" We can do the work for ourselves. If the Commonwealth is going to expend money in bringing immigrants to our snores we shall be debited with our proportion of that expenditure. That being so, we might selves."" I am not supporting such a contention ; I am merely pointing out that we must not consider that, the attitude taken up by the States is wholly unreasonable. I agree that one central authority acting for the whole of the States can do this work more effectively and cheaply than any of the individual States could hope to do; but the Prime Minister should not expect Parliament to vote considerable sums of money for this purpose until he has outlined the scheme in connection with which he proposes that they shall be expended. I admit that it is not his fault that no scheme is before us. He has been endeavouring to work with the States, but, probably for the reasons I have given, they have shown a reluctance to join with the Commonwealth. At the same time we ought to be satisfied, before agreeing to vote so large a sum, that the method of expenditure to be adopted will be such as to commend itself to us. continue to vote money that is not spent. voting money that cannot be spent during the current year unless it is thrown away. The importance of this phase of the question is shown by the experience of Canada.

I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs made some inquiries from the Canadian Government as-to the number of departures from the Dominion oversea or across the United States border, and that he was informed that the information desired could not be given. from America into Canada with a view of following up the crops as they ripen-jus t as our shearers go from one State to another-and return to the States at the close of the season. as immigrants, and no deduction is made in ' respect of their departure. . That being so, the results of the Canadian immigration policy have been greatly magnified. Then,, again, we have to remember that Canada has been willing to receive persons of all occupations, whilst Australia has been seeking chiefly to attract farmers or farm labourers. The immigrants to Canada comprise only a small proportion of those classes. And all our expenditure, if we continued to hold those views, and went to the same extent as Canada, would be spread over a much smaller number lof people. Then That there is the difficulty of the distance and of the passage-money, though, of course, Canada was able to find our efforts might be directed to reducing the latter. It will be seen, therefore, that even if we spent the amount which is spent by Canada, we could not be nearly so successful as is the Dominion. I am not making these remarks in order to throw a wet blanket on the scheme, but only to show In the first place, the necessity of cheaper and more effective work than is done in the case of It is not Canada. Whatever class we desire to attract to Australia, our efforts should, as As a rule, directly as possible, reach that class. If we desire to have farmers, farmers' sons, and farm labourers, we ought They have the hope to place in the possession of every farmer in Great Britain, direct, the information that we have to impart.

Immigration largely arises from the necessity for providing a sufficient defence; otherwise I do not see why we, as a Commonwealth, should trouble ourselves and make special and strained efforts to attract people here. In my opinion, the attractions of the Commonwealth, to those who know them, are sufficient to induce large numbers of people to settle in the country ;and if the resources are sufficiently advertised, as proposed, the result will, I think, be a constant influx of immigrants. If the.

What the Labour Party is opposed to is having workless persons here who must be supported by those who are working. It is remarkable that so much should be said about the need for immigrants, at a time when we have thousands of unemployed, many of them ready to turn their hand to anything. I believe that there would be no difficulty in bringing about a large inflow of most desirable immigrantsmen who have money with which to begin the battle of life-if it were not for the' fact, that many of those who have done well in Australia go to England after they have become wealthy and then curse the country which made them prosperous. honourable member of that? lished only a few months back, Mr Charles Edward Russell, one of the keenest observers of the day, and a brilliant writer, says that he does not remember reading an article in the British press during the five at the hands .of conductors throughout the years that he was living in London which did not contain a sneer or some disparaging remark, about Australia. He speaks of our people and conditions in a manner which betokens knowledge gained by residence here, showing that he was not a mere globetrotter.

He said that he discovered that members of Parliament monopolize the compartments of trains, and travel like princes; but that he got to Canada himself, he found that he did not know whether provision was made for them by the State, in addition to their salaries.' I have not known honourable members to travel like princes, but I know that they pay for every farthing's worth of food that they consume. This contemptible cad tells the public that honourable members are the servants of train conductors. How are we to get immigrants if a man like Major Trevor, those in charge of the press of the Old Country, and others, are continually sneering at and belittling us? princes ? travel like a prince, but I usually have to travel like a peasant, though, with very few exceptions, I have always found my fellowtravellers to be gentlemen. the servant of the train conductor? found the conductors careful to do their duty, and to keep their places.

I am very anxious to see a large population settled in the Commonwealth. If we are going to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 in attracting immigrants to our shores, I do not think that we can spend it to better advantage than we can in the Northern Territory. There is land available for settlement there if we only wish to place immigrants upon it . That is where population is' most required, seeing that the unsettled state of the Territory constitutes our greatest danger. Let us spend, if need be, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in endeavouring to secure some settlement there. I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee at any further length, but I hold that it is chiefly due to the slanders upon, and the slanderers of, Australia, that the stream of immigration to our shores has been so small during recent years. It will continue to be small until we provide more opportunities for the employment of labour than exist at the present moment. entirely with the honourable member for Hindmarsh in holding in abhorrence any slander on Australia which emanates from an Australian. taches rather too much importance to ""the statements which have been made by Maipr Trevor. type which numbers thousands.

I was rather struck by two statements of the honourable member for Hindmarsh which appeared to be mutually contradictory. He declared that the Socialist Party in this House did not oppose immigration. I believe that his statement is based upon fact. It is not safe to oppose immigration in Australia, because it is a subject upon which the electors are unanimous. I do not know of any electorate in the Commonwealth which would return a candidate who was opposed to an immigration policy. All the constituencies are unanimous as to the supreme necessity which exists for endeavouring to fill Australia's empty spaces. Consequently the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. that he was in favour of an immigration scheme appeared to me to be a very natural one. But I notice that his enthusiasm does not take a practical form, because he subsequently affirmed that the Commonwealth should not take the initiative in this matter, but should allow the States to make the first' move. Now, what is the actual position ? The States are asked to provide land for the immigrants before we move at all. the proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth control of the Crown lands and railways?

A ""special., meeting of the Immigration League' was convened for the purpose, and the honourable gentleman ' made a speech which filled most of the immigrationists in Australia with the belief that he intended to take action, and that at last Australia would be filled. But the hen has been clucking for three )'ears, and we still have no egg. lay eggs. events, the hen has not done so. I hope that a comprehensive Scheme will be introduced, and that it is not going to include a proposal to wait further upon the States. It is up to the Prime Minister to give proof of the bona fides of the contention of protectionists, as to filling Austies have decreased. tralia, by the incidence of the Tariff, by offering assistance in the shape of reduced passages and by other means to suitable industrial immigrants to come to Australia. There are one or two matters in connection with this question to which I should like to refer. members are afraid of introducing industrial immigrants because they think that already too much of our population is congested in our cities. That feeling may be very considerably overdone. Mr .POYNTON -I s it not a fact ? plore it, that population is very congested in the great Australian cities. tion? not itself healthy, is the natural sequitur of the great improvements which have been made in machinery, in methods of commercial distribution, and in other directions. corollary of land monopoly? to do with land monopoly. If honourable members will bear with me for a moment I shall put my view of the reason for this state of affairs. Honourable members have no doubt observed that country . towns, which used to serve-as distributing agencies for-their respective districts, have for years on the general average been .growing less, ;. whilst the -principal cities in each State or in each great distributing district have been yearly growing larger. The reason is that the country town as an agency of distribution has been gradually dropping out of existence, while the distribution of .the States has become more and more operative from the great cities. In this .way we have a natural aggregation of population towards the main cities. That is one factor in this position, and it is due to improved methods of distribution more than to any artificial reason. not only of country towns, but of rural districts, is decreasing. than does the honourable member that production can be carried on with less men than was formerly the case. Owing to improved methods of production, the number of men required to obtain certain results is less now than it was. Australia"" is not increasing at the rate of more than 2J per cent, per annum, more people can live on the production of fewer people than was previously the case. Consequently more are entering our big cities. I believe that some honourable It is not healthy to have large aggregations of people in our great cities,but at the same time that aggregation is due largely to natural causes, and the introduction of more industrials will not lead to the diminution of the population of country districts. It will give them a new market; and lead in consequence to more, people being placed upon the land. Therefore, as. far as I . can see, there is no reason why the Prime Ministershould not attempt to bring out industrial immigrants; there' is every reason why he should. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee further on this question. I explained a few nights ago the methods by which I thought immigrants could best be brought to Australia, and I shall not touch again on the natural that question. I merely wish to say, in conclusion, that it is somewhat ridiculous that we should be called upon to vote a large sum of money-no t too large for the purpose if it were intended to beput to any use-whic h we know will not be expended.

A glance at the statistics is sufficient to-show that the proportion of our population in metropolitan areas is much larger than it ought to be. The position is altogether different in New Zealand. Since the early nineties the increase in the' population of trie rural districts and the cities of New Zealand has been fairly even. That has largely been the result of land settlement. about plenty of land being available for immigrants when there are sometimes hundreds of applicants for a block in some of our States? By every boat leaving Victoria men are sailing for other parts.' A great many have left this State for New Zealand, and I have heard of men who have returned in the hope that they would be able to settle down here, but who have been reluctantly forced to go back. -the honourable member will find that ""the [340]2 balance of transfers lately is against New Zealand. followed very closely for some time the land board allotments,and know that the I hope that Governments of the States have not had available anything like the land required by our own people.

In .view of these .facts, those who talk about immigration are merely playing at the'game. . Notwithstanding what the honourable member for .Wentworth has said, I do not hesitate to assert that land monopoly has. driven thousands of people from the country into our cities. The land policy of Australia generally has a tendency to monopoly. dency to monopoly is' different, from saying that there is no land available.: there is not one eligible block available for every, ten applicants for land in Australia.

It is useless to keep prating about immigration, until there is some progress in rural settlement. ber mean that we should not proceed until there is a graduated land tax in order to throw open the land? to assisted immigration until I saw possible chances of settlement for the immigrants.

In Victoria a resolution must pass both Houses before there can be compulsory purchase; and in South Australia it has not been possible to pass a measure of the kind. In my opinion, the progress of New Zealand is chiefly owing to the fact that, during the influx of immigrants in the last ten or fifteen years, the lands have been thrown open and rural settlement has kept pace with the settlement in the towns. Personally, I do not see what the Commonwealth Government can do in the matter. Mr W. H .

445,. Mr Palmer (Echuca) [8.47],"Th epolicy be one of a White Australia, I venture to say, with all due respect to the Labour Party, that we must of necessity be in favour of bringing, not a few, but thousands of immigrants into the country, and treating them properly when they get here. It is absolute nonsense to say that we have no land available, seeing that Australia at the present time is practically an empty country. We must set our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavour to attract immigrants. Of course, constitutional difficulty arises from the fact that it is hard to get the States Governments and the Federal Government to work in unison. That, however, should not be impossible; and doubtless our persuasive Prime Minister-and I use that term with the utmost respect-wil l be able to induce the Premiers in conference to do something to justify our spending something more than the sum at present proposed in. this connection. The Prime Minister has promised to do so; and in his important speech on defence he made it quite evident that ' if there is any man who recognises the necessity of bringing people to Australia, it is himself. I venture to .say that none of us desire the yellow people to come here; and yet it would be impossible, with a population of 4,500,000, to defend our shores if Great Britain ever became em'broiled in a great war. Are we prepared to. maintain -our hearths and homes, our wives and families, by the only effective means? scheme of defence of the Prime Minister, I say that, when we have put forth our utmost efforts in arming and in drilling our people, we shall not be able to defend Australia's 8,000 miles of coast line; and the only sensible course is to join political forces, both State ment introduced this afternoon by the honand Federal, in one common determination to make it possible to settle a large populaor three times' applied offensive epithets ""to tion on the land. The honourable member for' Grey referred to"" the movement in progress of inducing men, for various reasons, to leave one State for another; and I do not know that that is altogether an unmixed evil from the point of view of land settlement. Every man who moves from ""Victoria, for instance, to take up land in New South Wales or Queensland,, leaves areas available for other people; and the -process referred to is, in my opinion, only a natural one. It is quite true that a man may sell out his small holding, to a large landholder; but, at the same time, when a man dies, his land is very often divided amongst ""members of his family. There has never been a greater national work, or one which would more justify us in seriously considering the question of immigration, than that represented by the great irrigation scheme in Victoria. Such a scheme makes it easy to subdivide great holdings in the Goulburn Valley, and settle numbers of families in the place of one; arid what is possible there is possible in many other parts of Australia. It is proper ""that the Federal Parliament should do something to induce immigration; and there is no need to wait for the States to take action. In Queensland there are thousands of acres available, and I believe that in the near future the policy of that country will be the same as that followed in America, inasmuch as railways will be constructed in order to induce settlement, instead of settlement preceding railways. I should like to say a word or two about the congestion of population and the effects of machinery. With great regret I heard an honourable member say to-day that, as the result of machinery, men were thrown put of employment. The teaching of experience is that the employment of machinery does not throw men out of employment, but, on the other hand, makes it possible for the poor to enjoy luxuries hitherto undreamed of. Machinery substitutes for hard work employment of a character pleasing and elevating to the worker. That is th<? natural result of all mechanical deWith all respect to the velopments. . The establishment of industries to cater to the present luxurious tastes of the people gives much employment in cities""; and that is one of the reasons why we find congested populations in the capitals. Let me now say a word in reference to what I regard as a somewhat silly arguorable member for Maranoa. He has two me, and he did so again to-day, in quoting a letter which I read to the Chamber in August last. It was from a reverend gentleman in Rushworth, who stated that twenty-seven repatriated Australians had been dumped in that township, and had to be fed by the residents. I well remember the effect of that letter upon the"" members of the Labour Party. They rejoiced when it was made known to them by one in favour of immigration that employment could not be 'found at once for these twenty-seven men. Their exultation was, however, groundless. The men had been dumped down in Rushworth,and, of ..course, for the time being. were a source -I think that the honourable member made of .annoyance, because employment could -a mistake in giving that person the adnot be found for them .immediately.

To take money out of the pockets of the whole of the people is as much robbery as is the act of taking it out of the pocket of an individual.

I believe that the best way to advertise Australia is to provide those individuals who are already settled here with constant work at good wages. That is how America has been advertised. If my honourable friends opposite had worked in America they would know that the best advertisers of that country are immigrants from Europe.

I have no desire to hurl objectionable epithets at any party, ""but any section which maintains the cry that there is no land available for settlement here is running down Australia without just cause.

It. is because of the possibilities in that direction, amongst others, that I think we should appoint a High Commissioner as soon as possible.'

There are certain ways in which the Government might move in the direction of As soon encouraging immigration; and while I am not in favour of indiscriminate immigration, I say that we could absorb any ableThe repurchase of estates is a bodied, sober, steady men. The cry about supplying immigrants with land at once S o that the story that is utterly fallacious, because no man new to the country can go straight on to the land on his own. account without courting almost It is absolutely fallacertain hardship and ruin. In QueensWe have in Australia vast areas land, the land is being; thrown open to settlement as quickly as possible ; but we ought to realize that closer settlement has only commenced in the bigger spaces of Australia. Any able-bodied agricultural or other labourer, aftertwo or three years of local experience will be qualified to' take up land; but it is sheer cruelty-and I speak from Victoria is settled, but because personal knowledge-.to dump down,', even an English farmer on the land in Aasj tralia before he has become familiar with the conditions of the country. In the case of Canada, it is the common practice for a fawner, when he intends-to settle.there, to send out his sons'to work for a year I recognise that in or two to spy out the land and acquire experience, arid then to follow them; and any assistance in attracting that class of If the Federal machine is to run settler would be most valuable. But that is not the only class of immigrants' whom The Federal we have to consider. We desire to have men here who, though Without means, depend on their' own brain and muscle in order to make their way; and there should be provision for these men when they arrive. It is therefore very important to get into touch with people who desire the sendees of immigrants. We are told that there is already surplus labour in Australia, and that work for 100 additional men could not be found in central -Queensland. That, .however, is not so; and we must remember that there ..will always be unemployed in the towns.' In 'the big cities, I am afraid,, there will always' be .poverty.

515,Mr Kelly,,57,Batchelor Orde R
516,Mr Archer,"the socialistic State arrives, when, I suppose, those will be made to work. But I know that in the moderate-sized towns not manufacturing towns of central and northern Queensland there are numbers of young men who will not go into the country to work. Queensland, just now, owing to the low price of copper and other minerals, numbers of men, who have hitherto worked small ""shows"" of their own, have found employment on the land; while others are looking for work. But that, I contend, is no argument against an immigration policy. If such arguments are acted upon, we shall never people Australia or keep it a white man's country. We shall never be free from fluctuation in employment, from temporary overpluses in different directions. ber apparently argues that a surplus of labour means, at the same time, a scarcity of labour. I contend is that, for instance, a temporary failure in one industry, such as I have mentioned, may cause a surplus of labour, but that such surplus is no argument against an immigration policy. The fact is that, when there is a surplus of labour in the towns, the men there will not go on to the land, and would not be able to do anything with it if they did. I have addressed myself broadly to the question, with special reference to Queensland. I know that it has been difficult to get land in suitable locations in Queensland, just as in other parts of Australia; but those days are passing away. Even the' alienated lands along the railways, like those on the Darling Downs, are being broken up 'and absorbed; and I know that the Queensland Government will even more rapidly push railways into districts where there are thousands of acres available for settlement. .Some of this land is under lease, but no new leases are being issued. will fall in during the next ten years or so; and those men who are coming to Australia now, and obtaining experience, will become settlers during the next few years. ferential right to the land when the leases fall in? [9.48] -Despit e the inference drawn by the honourable member for Echuca that a section of the House is opposed to immigration of any kind, I am sure that all sensible Australians recognise that an important factor in our wealth and prosperity is population, and that, at our present stage of internal deI n north velopment, the country cannot assume its rightful position unless we resort largely to immigration. The difference between the two sides of the House on this question may, I think, be easily summed up. Honourable members who, like myself, belong to the Labour Party, desire to see a healthy population of energetic go-ahead people who will help to build up and develop the industries of the country. In order to get that population certain facilities and inducements must be offered, or, as in the past, people from outside will refuse to throw in their lot with us. On the other hand, there are other honourable members who seem to look at the question from the stand-point that the conditions here are all right and cannot be improved very materially-that all thati is required is an increased supply of labour by means of a large influx of people. Those honourable members look to that supply being kept up to such an extent that the country will be called upon to establish soup kitchens and labour bureaux in orddr to support the labourers during the slack times, so that they may be readily available at the lowest cost in the busy times. I say unhesitatingly that I am not prepared to lend myself to introducing labour from the Old Country under false pretences. orable member will read some of the literature circulated by the Immigration Leagues here, notably, the league presided over by Dr. Arthur in New South Wales, and even much of the 'literature fathered by our States Governments in the Old Country, he can come to no other conclusion than that the grossest misrepresentations are being circulated in order to attract a parThe leases in existence ticular class of immigrants. of placing the facts before the public, and then allowing the immigrants to take the risk. the honourable member in that, but I think we should do something more.

525,Mr Thomas Brown,"I am with,may do something in the way of advertising Australia, it can do very little in the direction of encouraging and retaining immigrants ' without the assistance of the States Governments, and, so far, the States Governments have shown very little disposition to co-operate with the Federal authority in attracting the right classes. Some of the States Governments have endeavoured to secure an influx of manual labourers, quite regardless of the fact that the native population is leaving because of their being unable, under present conditions, to retain what they themselves produce. Under such conditions, we can only hope for the very lowest class of labour in our immigrants, because any man with energy and push, desiring to make the best of his life, will not rest satisfied. If we really desire to increase our population, we must set ourselves the stern task of improving our social and industrial conditions, in order, first of all, to retain our native born, and next to attract desirable immigrants. This is an object we have not Been able to attain up to the present time, because the immigration is practically counterbalanced by the emigration, the net improvement being very small over a given number of years. The honourable member for Capricornia quoted, amid some approval from honourable members near him, certain figures comparing the additions to population in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth during the last couple of years. But I think the honourable member should have extended the comparison further back, because if we take the seven years of Federation, we find that New Zealand has by immigration added 48,000 to her population, while the Commonwealth has added only something like 6,000. The time was when New Zealand was considered a bankrupt dependency of the Empire, and one of the least desirable nlaces for emigrants to go to ; but the legislation introduced by those eminent statesmen, Mr Ballance and the Right Honourable Richard Seddon, completely altered the position of affairs, so that the Dominion is now the most inviting country in the Southern Hemisphere. Until we put an end to the exodus from our own shores, it will be useless to try to attract people from the United Kingdom. We must first make sure of retaining our own population. When we have done that, our conditions will prove attractive to others abroad. honourable member for Yarra, when he referred to the. land monopoly which exists, particularly in the older settled States, mentioned the chief cause for the decrease in our population, and its undesirable and unhealthy concentration in the large centres. Official statistics show that of 700,000 adult voters in New South Wales, about 1 ,coo own half of rhe alienated land of s the State, and about 3,000 half of its accumulated wealth. Its land is divided amongst 170,000 or 180, JOO persons, and its accumulated wealth between about 200,000 persons, so that about 500,000 arelandless and without wealth. Until something is done to make the land available, our population must decrease year by vear. The honourable member for Wentworth attributed the flow of population to the cities to the increased efficiency of agricultural machineiy. I do not think that that is the true explanation!. The last redistribution of seats gave New South Wales another representative at the expense of Victoria; but in rearranging the etec toral divisions of the State the count ty divisions were reduced by one, another evidence of the d r if t of population to which I refer. Those who know the conditions under which people reside in the cities areaware how unhealthy a sign it is when the population is drifting there from the country. We are told authoritatively that in Sydney 1,000 women and children. work for from 5s. to nothing a week. Many young girls employed in shops and factories are content to give their services for nothing, merely to learn a trade or business. Last session a proposal was brought forward in the State Parliament for preventing the payment of a lower wage than 2s. 6d. per week. We find, too, that men employed in responsible positions, handling large sums of money, receive only from 30s. to £ 2 a week, while the remuneration generally of those earning weekly wages is not sufficiently high to offer an inducement to men who are not forced to leave the country to go 'to the cities. when cabled Home, will not induce people to come here. true, and if the present state of things can be altered only by telling the truth, the truth must be told.

The United States are taking a most active part in this scheme, believing that it will serve a most useful purpose. When in LondonI met one of the leading agricultural authorities of the United States, who spoke in the warmest terms of this enterprise, and assured me that the conviction of the authorities in. his country is that the institute is going to prove of the greatest value. As there seems to be some doubt as to the area of land available for settlement in Australia, I should like to assure honourable members that in Western Australia, at all events, vast tracts of country are available. stretching, say from Albany to Geraldton, 600 miles long and probably 300 miles in width. Railways are being carried into it, and the country is being rapidly settled. There can be seen some of the finest crops that are raised in Australia. SinceI first went to Western Australia settlement there has made enormous strides. Northam at one time was the chief centre of cereal production in the west; but farming operations have since extended for no less than 150 miles due east towards the gold-fields. The facilities for acquiring land in Western Australia are all that the people could desire. The Agricultural Bank makes advances to settlers in respect of any work done by them on their land. If they build a house, they receive assistance, and they are also Helped to fence and clear their holdings. I do not know of any State where the facilities for settlement are so satisfactory. tained for practically nothing. intending settlers holdings of 160 acres for practically nothing. _ If a man wishes to commence operations on a larger 'scale, he may take up 2,000 acres, and also 1,500 acres on behalf of his wife. No doubt, in time to come, the cry for closer settlement, now heard so frequently in the east, will be heard in Western Australia. I would remind honourable members that those who want land need not go even so far as Western Australia for it."" Within the last fortnight, at the Mount Barker Agricultural Society's Show, I saw exhibited by the Agricultural Department of South Australia a very fine sample of be grain grown in the Pinaroo and other districts, where there is an average rainfall of only 8 inches. This wheat was grown on land which no one would have looked at five or six years ago. Had we been told a few years ago that it was capable of producing wheat of such fine quality, we should not have treated the statement seriously. Another large area of land, stretching from Port Lincoln in a northerly and north-westerly direction, was at one time looked upon as a desert, but it has been opened up by a line of railway 40 miles in length, which the Government propose to extend by another' 40 miles. Less than ten years ago, that country was regarded as useless, but settlers there are now doing well by wheat-growing. ItTnas been clearly proved that wheat can be grown on all areas which enjoy the winter rains, or, in other words, districts There is, for instance, an area where the rain falls at the right time for cereal crops. When we reach the tropical areas, good crops cannot be relied upon, but there are in South Australia, as well as in Western Australia, vast areas of wheat-growing country that have not been opened up.. It only, remains for men with pluck, who are willing to work and to rough it, to take action. We certainly do not want to settle on the land men such as those we often see hanging about the street corners here. I have often looked at them, and would be afraid to mention within their hearing. that I was in search of labourers. Such men will not leave town to obtain employment, because they will not go far away from an hotel. An expenditure of £20,000 will not be nearly sufficient for this work. We shall have to expend something like £200,000 in inducing people to come to the country. voices such extravagant ideas, he cannot hope to secure the transcontinental railway. ing our country, we spent money in inducing people to come here, we should have no difficulty in finding money for railway construction purposes.

I impress on honourable members that, if they know anybody who requires land, they should send him to Western Australia, I recognise that the Where very large areas are available. This afternoon I mentioned that the whole of Australia had last year spent not more than £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 on immigration. I had not the details before me then, but I have since looked the matter up, and I find that the latest statistics support my statement. During 1906-7, New South Wales spent £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 , Queensland spent £10,000-of which something like £ 3 , 0 0 0 was refunded by the immigrants themselves-and the Commonwealth proposes to spend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 .
