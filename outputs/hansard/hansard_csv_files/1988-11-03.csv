Naturally we require time both to study these amendments and to enable new self-governing Territory. The short point about it is this: the system set out in the Bill Opposition members to be consulted and to give their views. is not one that we can support because, on an analysis of the mechanics of the system I should also say that we do not support as set out in the Bill, it does not provide for in its entirety the proposal in the Bill for a a proper and effective system of preferential four-year fixed term for the Assembly.
