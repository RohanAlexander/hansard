SMITH MP Speaker of the House of Representatives 15 February 2017 Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Water Resources) (09:32): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 will help in our fight to manage biosecurity risks and further strengthen Australia's biosecurity system. A strong biosecurity system contributes to a strong economy. Our agricultural industries are forecast to earn $60 billion in 2016-17. Today threats to our biosecurity can emerge faster than ever before. The recent global outbreak of zika virus, spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, has shown us how important control of disease-carrying pests is. This bill will provide additional powers to control exotic mosquitoes and other disease carriers at Australia's airports and seaports, including on incoming aircraft and vessels. This includes spraying insecticide to kill mosquitoes capable of carrying zika virus as well as other disease-carrying vectors so they do not establish populations in Australia. The bill gives us the ability to direct airports and seaports to control such incursions. The bill will strengthen Australia's ability to manage ballast water in ships. It will provide additional protection for fisheries and coastal environments from the risk of marine pest incursions by fostering new, more effective, ballast water treatment technologies, and phasing out ballast water exchange.",20,Private Members Business
9,Mr Joyce (New England,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture andThe bill will position us to ratify the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments. This convention was adopted in 2004 and signed by the Howard government in 2005. It is a key international measure for protecting marine environments. It aims to stop the global spread of potentially invasive and harmful aquatic organisms that can cause havoc to marine ecosystems, especially diseases that are current, such as white spot in prawns. These organisms can be transported in the ballast water of ships travelling around the world and can effect biodiversity and lead to substantial economic loss to our maritime industries. The convention is an important global initiative involving over fifty countries. It will come into force internationally on 8 September 2017. We hope to ratify it this year. For Australians more broadly, these amendments mean there is much less risk of infection from viruses such as zika. It also means we can continue to enjoy the sea and all the joy that it brings us. Strengthening Australia's biosecurity system through these legislative amendments means we can continue to enjoy our unique environment, and way of life. Debate adjourned. Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading for Counter-Terrorism) (09:36): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 responds to the recent full Federal Court decision in McGladev Native Title Registrar. It provides certainty to indigenous and non-Indigenous parties alike where they have voluntarily made, or are proposing to make, agreements about the use of land and waters subject to native title. The effect of the McGlade decision was to overrule an earlier decision of a single judge of the Federal Court in 2010 in a case called Bygrave (No. 2). Bygrave settled the law in relation to the necessary requisites for an Indigenous land use agreement to be registered. Bygrave held that it was not necessary for all members of the registered native title claimant (who are the authorised representatives of the broader native title claim group) to be a party to the ILUA. Rather, Bygrave held that what was important was that the broader native title claim group, being those claiming to hold native title in the area, had authorised the making of the proposed agreement. The McGlade decision has overturned this position, requiring that all members of the registered native title claimant be a party to the agreement.",22,Bills
10,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterThis is a very significant development in relation to not only Indigenous land use agreements that have already been registered in reliance on the rule in Bygrave, but in relation to all Indigenous land use agreements seeking registration. This is because the effect of the decision in McGlade is that the will of the broader native title claim group may be frustrated because not all members of the registered native title claimant have signed the agreement. This may happen for any number of reasons including that the member of the registered native title claimant does not agree with the decision that the broader claim group has made, or has passed away or became incapacitated before being able to sign the agreement. These amendments seek to return to the status quo ante as established in Bygrave (No. 2) for agreements that have already been registered or were awaiting registration at the time of the McGlade decision, and which were duly authorised by the broader native title group and which followed the law as it was at the time. These particular amendments will operate retrospectively to counter the potential impact of the McGlade decision. The amendments will give primacy to the decision of the broader native title claim group for agreements in the future, as it is the group who claim to hold native title within the area of the agreement who should ultimately have the right to decide whether an agreement should be accepted or not. Greater reliance on collective decision-making reflects the communal nature of native title rights under the act. The amendments provide that the native title claim group may nominate one or more persons of the registered native title claimant to be a party to the agreement. The group may also specify a process for determining who will be a party to the agreement. This will guard against the possibility that the person or persons they nominate become unable or unwilling to be a party to the agreement. If the claim group does not specify a process for determining who is to be a party to the agreement it will be sufficient if a majority of the registered native title claimants are parties. This position is consistent with the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Connection to country report that the registered native title claimant should be able to act by majority. To give maximum flexibility to native title claim groups when making these key decisions, the bill also implements recommendations 10-1 and 10-2 of the Australian Law Reform Commission report, by allowing the group to follow a traditional decision-making process if one is available or to agree to another decision-making method. Currently a group must use a traditional decision-making process if one exists. Taken together, the amendments in this bill will provide certainty to Indigenous and nonIndigenous parties who have already registered their agreements or whose registration is pending. These measures will protect the benefits and interests that have been granted on both sides, and provide certainty for parties who have commenced or are proposing negotiations for an Indigenous land use agreement. The amendments return the control over the realisation of such agreements for Indigenous parties to the hands of the wider group of native title holders, who can ensure that their will is carried out. Debate adjourned. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 move: The proposal described as Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 in the terms to be printed proposal, which is now being circulated to honourable members. The customs tariff proposal I have just tabled amends the customs duty rate applied to tariff subheading 6907.30.10. This tariff subheading was created by the Customs Tariff Amendment (2017 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2016 to cover certain types of mosaic tiles. That act mistakenly applied a customs duty rate of five per cent to this subheading when it should have had a customs duty rate of three per cent. The amendment contained in this proposal will ensure that the correct rate of customs duty is applied to goods imported under this tariff subheading. Debate adjourned. Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. parliamentary entitlements and work expenses. Indeed, few people here would say that that was their motivation. I have been told it could be considered a little courageous, in the Sir Humphrey sense, to even speak on this and express a view, but I did want to share a few thoughts from three perspectives. Firstly, as a new member here, still adjusting in my transition to this chaotic and complex environment; secondly, as someone who, as a citizen with a deep interest in public affairs, has watched this mess of entitlements play out over many years and despaired at the lack of reform, the inability to fix the system and the damage that has been done to public trust and confidence in our national life; and, thirdly, relatively fresh from a long and hard fought campaign, where I spoke, for more than 12 months, to literally thousands of people. In the middle of the Bronwyn Bishop saga, I remember for a few weekends that I certainly heard the full gamut of views from the community. Firstly, as a new member. When we are out of the spotlight of this chamber, it would be no exaggeration and fair to say that many of my colleagues, particularly us new folk-I see the member for Fremantle, a new member like myself-live in abject terror of making a mistake with a travel or expense claim. And there are two reasons for that. The first reason is that the rules are a complex mess. The current system comprises a mishmash of legislation, regulations, rules, guidelines, determinations, unwritten conventions, ministerial decisions and so on, and it is almost impossible to get a definitive answer on some matters. There are literally hundreds of pages of documents and web pages to try and figure out what you are supposed to do. I noticed that the Prime Minister told us in the second reading speech that there are apparently eight separate handbooks that the Department of",23,Bills
11,Mr Dutton (Dickson,Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:41): I,25,Bills
12,Mr Hill (Bruce) (09:43,"It is fair to say that I did not come to Canberra to talk aboutFinance has produced to explain the framework, which scared me even more, because I am still not sure that I have managed to find all of those handbooks. Like many people dealing with government, though, and we are no different in that regard, we usually just want a clear yes or no-simple: is this permitted or not? Obviously, in the political realm, once you understand whether or not something is permitted, you of course need to overlay your own moral or personal and political judgements on that, and that is our responsibility. But you can only do that when you have a sensible understanding of what the rule actually is, what is permitted, within which you can exercise judgement. So, like all of us, I am hoping that the new framework will clear things up. One caution, which I know still worries people, is that there will always be matters of discretion and judgement because it is impossible to codify everything in this or indeed most other businesses. And, while our first duty is to our electorates, which is where those of us who are new, in particular, spend the vast bulk of our time, I also believe that, if we take this role seriously, we have national responsibilities and need to develop national perspectives. People should expect us to be curious about developing and considering national views in the national landscape to engage with businesses, stakeholders, governments and so on. Parliamentary committees are a primary mechanism by which we do this, but at times it is necessary and legitimate to travel and meet with people elsewhere in the country to advance issues important to our electorates and to build a picture and understand how the country ticks. The second reason that we live in abject terror is that the media coverage and public perception is now so poisonous that there is no tolerance left for even the most honest of mistakes. Aside from the rules, the forms are complex and archaic; they are full of codes and little columns; you need to go back to the websites and manuals to make sense of it all; and they are the kinds of things that you do just infrequently enough to have forgotten what you read last time, because it really is not the most important thing in your day. But the reality is that, with the best will in the world and the most perfect systems, over hundreds of people in many years, some honest mistakes will be made. It is a pity, I think, that there is no tolerance or understanding left in the system for MPs as a species, particularly for those of us who try and do our best to do the right thing, and that is a bit confronting. But I hope that the new rules and the authority which are in the bill we will debate shortly will over time reset the environment so that there is some common sense and perspective available. The second perspective I wanted to add is that of a citizen who has watched the mess of entitlements play out over the years. I have seen a long and slow but continuing degradation of trust in the political system and in MPs, which is distressing to watch, and I mean that sincerely. I say that as someone who confesses to being a bit of a nerd for politics, public policy and democracy. Unlike many, since childhood I have always had an interest in public affairs and public service and just how the world ticks, how we shape change and approach the future. Coupled with that, like many here, is a respect for this institution of parliament. As a keen observer it was as much of a surprise to me as anyone that I came to join this place. Now, I do not respect and have not respected every member of this place or the other place, and I do not like and have not liked or approved of the way all members have approached order to approach their role, and I do not agree with all the ideas they put forward. But I have always deeply respected the office, and that is a key distinction based on which I hope we can start to rebuild some public confidence, and start to re-prosecute and establish a distinction between the person who occupies an office at a given point in time and the office itself. I know that is not a fashionable view, with the prevailing cynicism. But my distress at watching the degradation of trust is not just an intellectual or personal thing; I believe that trust in our political system and elected members is part of the capital of our democracy. Many policy commentators have written in recent years about what is termed 'the trust deficit', and the real-world impacts and harms that that trust deficit does to our society and country, and that this trust deficit is hampering the ability of the political system, certainly in the last decade, to progress reform, to act in the national interest and to prosecute beneficial changes which may not be popular in the short term but are good for the country. It is the kind of thing we see where there is a lack of trust and capital, under the previous Labor government, in politicians as a species. It is certainly not the only reason, but unfortunately we end up with situations where you cannot prosecute a sensible policy conversation because it is too easy to rip down the politicians leading it about how we tax the resource industry and so on. Of course, the media play a part in this, and the narrative is written-that sort of prenarrative that we all get stuck into that we are all on the take, we are all here on the gravy train and that is our sole motivation, and so on. But the system, combined with a few MPs who do stupid and unconscionable things, then feeds this narrative. SoI dearly hope that these new arrangements can draw a line in the sand, reset the issue, rebuild some trust and focus debate on more meaningful things for the people we represent. The third thing that I want to touch on is community expectations. Having doorknocked extensively, I think it is fair to say that there are a range of views out there, many of them strongly held, as to what is considered reasonable work expenses for members of parliament. Indeed, that is an understatement. I certainly heard the full gamut of views while out and about during, as I touched on earlier, the three weeks or so that the saga ran in relation to the previous Speaker and the infamous helicopter ride. There was utter community bewilderment that anyone could think it was appropriate to ride a helicopter-a luxury helicopter, I notice; it was the upper model-from Melbourne to Geelong for a political fundraiser on a golf course. In that sense, 'entitlement' is not a misnomer; it is a completely accurate use of the word. It is a kind of peak Tory Australian version of the British Tory moats, which I think was the archetypal example that finally forced reform-welcome, beneficial reform, so we hear-with the creation of an independent authority in Britain. There is the view, of course, at one end of the spectrum, as I said, that we are all in this for the money or the pension. I just want to put on the record that I do not get a pension. I will not get a pension. I do not get a pension. I will not get a pension. I do not get a pension. There is probably a rule about repetition; I cannot remember the standing order, but you get the point. The majority of us here now, I think, will not ever get a pension. We do not get a parliamentary pension. But the number of times that people in the street still stop us and say, 'Oh, you'll be right; you're only in this for the pension,' is astounding. For people elected after 2004, there is no parliamentary pension scheme, yet still this persists. That raises some concern for me about how long, even if we fix this system once and for all and the authority works, it is going to take to wash these scandals out of the public consciousness and rebuild that trust. But we have to start. As one former senator put it to us in some of the briefings of new MPs last year, his view was that the reality is that nothing we could do would make some people happy. Even if we were paid nothing and walked to Canberra while people lined up to throw fruit at us, he told us, it would still be an outrage. But I actually find that, if you spend a few minutes with people and get past that rightful anger and frustration, most people-that big bit in the bell curve, in the middle of the median distribution-are pretty reasonable. They believe that good MPs work hard, travel frequently and are away from our families more than anyone would wish on others. As someone who has travelled a fair bit for work in my previous lives-more than some, less than others-my firm view is that work travel can seem glamorous except when you actually do it. I see nodding around the chamber. Most of us have around 150,000 people in our electorates, depending on the number of noncitizens and where the boundaries are drawn-put Tassie out of the picture. That is a fair number of people, and I think most people in the community seem to accept that, if they want us to be able to return a phone call, respond to the emails, read the letters, attend to the legislation and pressures of the job and so on, it is reasonable to ensure that, while people hold elected office, they should be supported to be able to work and move around the country quickly, efficiently and safely. Having worked with MPs and ministers from all sides of politics for many years, I have always held that view myself before coming here. Having seen the lives of ministers up close and personal, I know it is a very difficult life, and I have great respect for those opposite who currently hold that responsibility and the burden that they bear, and particularly for their families. I will hold that view when I leave, maintaining that distinction, as I mentioned before, between the person and the office. I note, though, that community expectations now do not support generous benefits anymore for MPs after they leave elected office. That is being addressed, for example, with the abolition of the Life Gold Pass. That does mean that costs for transport and accommodation are absolutely essential if elected MPs are to do their jobs properly. Provided we are not using taxpayer funds to buy apartments or go on holidays and so on, work expenses are necessary. AndI do spare a thought for some of my colleagues who have copped, I think, some pretty unfair media-gratuitous and lazy summer media-just for doing their jobs. I did once have a job managing a couple of hundred staff across Victoria, which I know is not really a region compared to many in this place. But I have some appreciation for the difficulties of travel and transit for the MPs from regional seats. I know that my life in the city is so much easier, logistically. It is hard to comprehend for many opposite, but it is easy for some on our side who hold enormous electorates. The stories about MPs from regional seats chartering planes-shock, horror!-to move around their electorates are, I think, nonsense and lazy. I do hope to see an environment where those things are simply not media and are understood. WA MPs always feature at the top of the travel list, as if there is something odd about that, because no-one has noticed that Perth is actually a long way away from Canberra and the flights cost more. Who knew? Or the foreign minister went overseas and therefore had a high travel bill! I would hope that an environment where the rules are clearer, where there is proper accountability and transparency, where things are audited and where these reforms strike a fair balance can start to restore public confidence. Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 today. I was keen to do so primarily because my views on the scrapping of the gold pass have certainly been grossly misrepresented by various media outlets that have not even bothered to check the facts or pick up a phone and speak with me. I appreciate the comments that were made by the previous speaker in this regard. Quite frankly, there is lazy journalism and those with their own particular agendas, or those who see themselves as commentators rather than having an obligation to report the facts. Unfortunately, it is a growing trend. I thought I would take the opportunity today to set the record straight. Most aspects of this bill I do not really have any issue with at all. I agree with imposing a 25 per cent loading on travel claims that require a subsequent adjustment, so long as they are found to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts and not an honest oversight, given the complexities as were described by the previous speaker. I think there needs to be the flexibility to accept that complexity can cause errors-quite often not in the favour of the member, but nevertheless errors. They should not be penalised for that. The bill also limits the travel provided to dependent children of senior officers to those who are less than 18 years of age. I have no issue with that either. The bill makes other amendments to enhance parliamentary work expense frameworks, such as establishing an authority to make payments beyond entitlements in certain circumstances, and I agree that there needs to be, as I said earlier, a certain level of flexibility in this regard. So, again, I have no issues with that. And the establishment of a statutory authority to recover payments that are beyond entitlement from parliamentarians and impose that loading of up to 25 per cent on certain claims, in itself, I do not have an issue with-as long as there is clarity and transparency in any of the decisions that are made. The bill also abolishes the Life Gold Pass for all pass holders, excluding former prime ministers and their spouses. It is the fact that this bill retrospectively removes eligibility for Life Gold Pass travel from 14 May 2014 that I have a very major issue with. To be absolutely clear, I have no issue with the abolition of the gold pass for all future travel. Members' and senators' remuneration today is very different to what it was 30 or 40 years ago. We have a new pay package now that no parliamentarian should be unhappy with, and it does not need to include side benefits such as a gold pass. However, most politicians who are able to access that gold pass have earned it under very different conditions to what we have here now. I am talking about those that were in this place 30 or 40 years ago or more. There was an acknowledgement that a parliamentarian's salary at that point in time was very low. As a result, there were extra incentives for long service. For the average backbencher to earn the gold pass, they had to serve seven terms, a period of around 21 years. Most of the public and the media either do not know that or tend to overlook it: seven terms, or 21 years. It is a long time. We know how tough it is-and I say this to all of those that have come in here for the first time-to go through one election, let alone to earn the trust and the confidence of an electorate to win seven consecutive times. Very few politicians over the decades have managed to achieve this, given that the average political life is somewhere around six years. The overwhelming majority of people that serve in this place never, ever have access to that, and for that matter they do not have access to a lot of the other",25,Bills
13,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (09:56,"I also rise to speak on the Parliamentary Entitlementsthings that are often cited here-for example, even the previous superannuation scheme. Most of them never got access to that. But we need to acknowledge that for those that did access it it was part of their package well before all of these changes happened. I accept that it should never be uncapped, and I understand that that uncapping was for senior executives and prime ministers, but nevertheless it should not have been uncapped. There is always a limit. There should be a limit, and it should be restricted to particular types of travel and be subject to regular reviews. However, I have to say that the majority of passholders use it for the purpose it was intended for and ensure that there is some level of community benefit. The issue is that, where there have been breaches, people have not been prosecuted. If passholders have abused it, they should have been penalised, rather than there being the kneejerk reaction that we have seen here today. In 2014 there was a high-profile incident where a handful of individuals were identified by the media as excessively using the system. Have a look at who they were. They were all former prime ministers, former senior cabinet ministers or former Speakers, all of whom had accelerated access in gaining the gold pass over the average member of parliament. In the case of the Prime Minister, the fact that you were appointed Prime Minister gave you automatic entitlement. In the case of senior cabinet ministers, you got an acceleration of three to one. So the value to those earning that was significantly less than for those that had done their seven terms, their 21 years to access it, and I think that needed to be recognised. The decision to scrap the gold pass, in my view, was a kneejerk reaction. Instead of addressing the problem and actually defending the rights of those who in previous parliaments had earnt that as part of their employment contract, now we are going to see that this decision is going to have an impact on people that have long since left this place. At the same time, the people making this decision have made sure that they are not going to be impacted by it. It is a rather interesting scenario. For all those backbenchers who earnt it over an extended period of time, I think it is shameful to take it away from them after they have left the parliament. They are not being given the opportunity to express a point of view to defend it or put forward their case. So my argument is on behalf of those on all sides of the chamber who have already served and are no longer with us. Yes, by all means abolish the gold pass, but if it is going to be retrospective let's take it off everybody, including former prime ministers, or let's set some time frames. Let's argue that if you have not done five years as a Prime Minister then you are not eligible. I understand that there will be some effort in the other place to make amendments of this nature. That would save even more money for the taxpayers by ruling the member for Warringah ineligible, along with the former members for Lalor and Griffith. Even the former member for Blaxland, Prime Minister Keating, would also be ineligible. Let's have it for longserving prime ministers-five years or more-to be able to gain that eligibility. Let's go back for a moment. We talked about the gold pass and the outrage that is expressed by the broader public about the fact that gold passes were actually attached as part of an employment contract for members of the parliament. This is not a unique situation. I am going to reflect on my own father, who joined the Queensland railways in the 1950s and spent his entire working life working with Queensland Rail. He retired in 1982 due to illness, but the thing that he was most proud of was that he had earned a gold pass, which was presented to him on his retirement. My dad died 20 years ago, but my mum, who is now 87, still has that gold pass which allows her free travel on Queensland Rail. She does not use it, but still has pride in the achievement of her husband. Should we take it from her now in retrospect? I would argue no. And there are lots of other incidences where gold passes have been allocated for service that has been given over extended periods of time. Why should the service of members of this place it be any different-and I am talking about extended service-from anywhere else? And why should we, after they have served their time and left this place with a great deal of honour for the work they have done here, suddenly say, 'Well, we've changed our minds. Now we're going to go back and take that from you.' As I said, gold passes are still being handed out to Queensland Rail employees, as they are across the country in many other areas. In the case of Queensland Rail it is after 25 years of continuous service. As I said, other professions also reward longevity for one company. Their spouses and dependents aged up to 16 years, or 21 if they are full-time students, are also eligible. I know it is hard for the younger generation to comprehend, given how people expect to chop and change between jobs and industries these days, that in those days things were very different. I have also spoken to a number of former colleagues about this. Alex Somlyay, a good friend of mine-I would like to highlight his situation. Alex retired four years ago after 23 years in this place. He was one of the whips when MPs' salaries were increased from $140,000 to $190,000 a year. The superannuation of previous members remained calculated on the lower level because of the benefits that were included in the package, such as gold passes and study leave. For the new members, it was calculated at a higher level because they did not have access to these additional benefits. Alex tells me that he has used his gold pass twice in four years. The first time was to come to Canberra for a function in the parliament. The second time he travelled to Melbourne to speak at a seminar about his work in the parliament. When I talk to the majority of ex-members there are similar stories. The thing that the general public has to realise is that for most of us when we finish in this job, the last thing we want to do is get on another aeroplane! I have spent 20 years travelling to this place for up to about 20 weeks of the year, and then flying around my electorate. It is about eight hours of travel from when I leave my home to when I get down here. And then of course there is all the committee work by aeroplane. And in my electorate-as the previous speaker mentioned, one of the larger ones-I have to travel from my home base in Cairns up to the outer islands of the Torres Strait, which is only four kilometres from the mainland of Papua New Guinea. SoI spent a lot of time on small aeroplanes. I spend a lot of time in helicopters and on dinghies, and on a whole range of other transport to get to these places. In my retirement, I can assure you, the last thing that I want to see on a regular basis is an aeroplane, unless there is a good cause for me to travel! While I think it is disappointing that the government has removed the gold pass in this, at least I am still here to make noise in this parliament about this issue. My key concern is that we are establishing a very dangerous precedent of retrospectivity that can apply to anything in the future. When governments see themselves with a problem and they can just take away something that individuals have earned over the years, that is something the Liberal Party has stood against. It has certainly argued against retrospectivity. Next time, it may not be the politicians who are affected-and yet we are allowing this to happen. The prospect of retrospectivity has now been established through a Liberal government, with the full support of the opposition. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you never know where this is going to end. At the same time, it is interesting that we have another piece of legislation that has just been introduced and this is the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017. In light of the controversy regarding the former minister for health, this bill aims to prevent future inadvertent or purposeful misuse of entitlements. It has been raised after numerous travel claim controversies et cetera. What is interesting about this one is that it is going to cost more to establish this than what they claim the savings are in relation to the abolition of the gold pass-which, over a short time, would have died out naturally with those who have received it in the past. I just find it amazing that they would actually do this. I have to say that Ministerial and Parliamentary Services have always done a pretty good job, and if there are any issues it is because of the ambiguity of the guidelines. I have always thought that the Remuneration Tribunal was an independent body responsible for determining financial packages. SoI think we had it pretty well okay. This legislation would establish another bureaucracy. To conclude, the most disappointing thing about this is that I am accused of arguing purely in my own self-interest. People forget that I argued against retrospectivity in the superannuation debate, and people applauded that-the public and the media. As a result, we had some success in getting changes. NowI stand to make the same argument and people criticise me, because this one is different-no, it is not different. I am being consistent. But I also point out that at the same time as the government and the opposition are freely allowing retrospectivity on this issue, the government is working hard to avoid the same sort of reform in the paid parental leave legislation, where they are actually deferring it to avoid retrospectivity in that case. There is no consistency. I know my vote will not make a difference on this issue, but I think it is important to put my objections on the record. I do not support this bill. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (10:12): I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill with mixed feelings. I am heartened to see that the government is finally taking some action to impose penalties which would provide a disincentive for parliamentarians to rort the system. But I am frustrated by the many years of inaction; the endless reviews and reports that have served to delay any action or change. In reality, it is too little, too late. In fact, it could be described as a kneejerk reaction; a form of damage control in response to the most recent scandal, with further legislation foreshadowed to be introduced later in the autumn sitting. The last time a Prime Minister took decisive action about travel rorts was in 1997, when then Prime Minister Howard took only three days to sack three ministers over inappropriate travel claims. Of course, Prime Minister Howard was bound by a code of conduct which set out an expectation that all action by a minister should be calculated to give the public value for its money, with an expectation that they would not abuse any of their privileges. It is a sad indictment of the state of play that the code of conduct has long since been abandoned. Since that time, the pattern in relation to expenses scandals has been predictable. Firstly, an expenses claim that has failed to pass the 'pub test' comes to light. Then there is increasing public outrage, magnified in recent times by the proliferation of social media as a mechanism to spread the story. The Prime Minister of the day toughs it out for as long as possible and the person at the centre of the controversy makes a statement that they 'acted within the guidelines'. Sometimes money would be repaid in accordance with the `Minchin protocol'-that is, pay back the incorrect amount and no further action will be taken. If the situation festers with the public even after repayment, on a couple of occasions people have resigned from the ministry or from an office of the parliament. Then the government of the day responds by announcing a review of parliamentary entitlements, with an implied or explicit promise to implement the changes recommended in the review. Or it hastily introduces legislation to implement changes which were last announced on 9 November 2013-yes, that is right; a major part of this bill is giving effect to changes announced almost four years ago. To be fair, almost a year after the changes were announced, the government introduced a bill to implement them-you cannot rush these things, can you?-but it failed to give it a high-enough priority, and the bill lapsed without being passed before the last election. The Nick Xenophon Team is committed to greater accountability and transparency in relation to parliamentary entitlements. It is part of our core values, the DNA of our party. In fact, I fear that my colleague Senator Nick Xenophon must feel like he is trapped in a version of the movie Groundhog Day in relation to parliamentary entitlements. In 2015 Senator Xenophon introduced a bill that would have meant harsher penalties for breaches of the entitlement rules but it was rejected by both the coalition and Labor. Senator Xenophon's bill would have led to more transparency, an independent watchdog, greater financial penalties, the public having a right to complain and monthly disclosure of pollies' perks. Significantly, he proposed a penalty of double the amount claimed if MPs are found to breach the rules, increasing to four times the amount for repeat offenders. That would have provided a much greater incentive to do the right thing than the 25 per cent loading proposed in this bill. It also amazes me that the only time the major parties agree on anything, such as rejecting Senator Xenophon's bill, is when they are acting out of self-interest. So that claim brings me to the proposed 25 per cent loading on incorrect travel claims. In my view that it is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. It is marginally better than the current system, which Senator Xenophon recently described as 'like being slapped in the face with a piece of wet lettuce'. It is a stronger disincentive if we can double the penalties of those overpaid and, as proposed in the 2015 bill, also then have extra penalties if you are a repeat offender. I want to foreshadow that I intend to move an amendment during consideration in detail to substantially increase the penalty for submitting incorrect claims. I believe this is in keeping with public expectations, and also it serves to benefit all of us as we all then have greater integrity in our communities. Another major element of this bill is the discontinuation the Life Gold Pass for travel of all former MPs except Prime Ministers. I support this wholeheartedly. I cannot think of any reason why former MPs should be entitled to have business class travel funded by the taxpayer. There is no other circumstance that I am aware of where a retired or sacked employee has their ongoing travel paid for them by a former employer. No wonder members of the public have consistently expressed outrage over this particular perk. I listened intently to the member for Leichhardt's speech, and I would just say to him: in what other job, 20 years on, do you still get airplane travel? He did mention Queensland Rail, but let us remember: that is a business; that is not the taxpayer paying for that travel. I would like to turn my attention to the travel entitlements for current parliamentarians. As many of you know, the Nick Xenophon Team members choose to travel economy class even though we are entitled to travel business class. We believe that travelling business class is a waste of taxpayers' money. Certainly, for flights of less than two hours it is an unnecessary indulgence. I have done a back-of-the-envelope calculation and I estimate that if parliamentarians who travel on flights of less than two hours travelled in economy instead of flying business class for sitting weeks, we would be saving over $2 million a year. That is right: we could be saving more than $2 million per year if we were required to have a seat at the back of the plane. Some people might say, 'It's only $2 million; it's not much'. In my book, that is a lot of money. My mum used to say to me that if you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves, and this change to entitlements is something that I believe is worth pursuing. Again, it will restore public confidence in us. I want to focus on the term 'entitlements' for a moment. The term itself is problematic, because it clearly leads to the expectation that one is 'entitled' to have travel paid for by the taxpayer, rather than it being related to a work expense. This creates a mindset of privilege and is partly what leads to people claiming to attend weddings, to claim New Year's Eve parties, sporting events and to fund family holidays. The most recent review, released in February 2016, recommends changing this terminology to refer to it as 'work expenses'. I hope that the foreshadowed legislation to be introduced later in the autumn sitting will take up this recommendation. I would also like to spend a bit of time focussing on the rules or guidelines. There is no doubt, as has been observed in the reports of both 2010 and 2016, as well as the National Audit Office report of 2015, that the rules are complex, confusing, contradictory and difficult to follow and administer. They also allow claims that are legitimate under the rules which do not pass the pub test. The 2016 report recommended adopting a new principles based system allowing the parliamentarian flexibility to apply judgement, choice and personal responsibility when using it. If parliamentarians were able to apply judgement and personal responsibility, we would not have the travel rort scandals we are seeking to address in this parliament! On a personal level, I am absolutely appalled that people who have sought public office with the level of public trust and personal ethics that that should entail seem to be incapable of asking themselves the simple question, 'Is this a legitimate work expense?' or that, when considering putting a claim in to attend a friend's or colleague's wedding, or a sporting event, they do not ask themselves: 'Would taxpayers expect to pay for my travel to this event?' This is at the heart of the problem with the current system. While something such as a family reunion visit might be allowed within the rules, taking one's family to Central Australia or a beachside resort is not in the spirit or the intent of the provision; neither is manufacturing business appointments to coincide with personal business. It is simply not ethical. SoI have to confess that I am sceptical about moving to a principles based system. However, the aspect that might curtail inappropriate travel expenses would be the requirement to publish travel expenses on a monthly basis on a publicly accessible website-which is the subject of another bill before the House. These provisions would provide for public scrutiny and lift the public's perception of us all. Our standing with the public is very low because of the rorting by some. I think we are actually below used car salesman. We must work towards restoring the confidence and trust of the public in us. In summary, I think that the current system needs a complete overhaul. The Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill is tinkering at the edges. It does not fundamentally change the rules around the parliamentary entitlements. We will still be operating under a system that is complex and confusing, where people make claims that are allowed under the rules but that are not in line with public expectations. Senator Xenophon recently said: … the current rules are a joke, and they need to be changed. I support this legislation, recognising that it is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to the next phase of reform, which has been promised in the autumn sittings, ensuring greater accountability and transparency in parliamentary entitlements. This has been a personal mission of Nick Xenophon's for many years and is now firmly embedded in the ethos of the Nick Xenophon Team as something we are 100 per cent committed to and something we will continue to fight for. I invite every member of parliament here to join me in economy class; it is really not that bad. has finally found the courage to abolish the Life Gold Pass travel perks for former politicians. The end of the gold pass scam really is a victory for the strength of public opinion. This scam has been hanging around like a bad smell for years and would still be in place had it not become untenable for MPs to be associated with what really is an elitist scheme. Whilst this is an important step and one the Greens will support, we think it should go further. We do not understand what reason there is for an exemption so that some members of parliament should still continue to get it. More importantly, there does need to be a thorough overhaul of the so-called entitlement system. Really, members of parliament should not be expecting to get additional entitlements-allowances for work related expenses that are in the public interest, yes, but entitlements, no. We need to clean up and reform electoral funding so that big business cannot make big donations to political parties. As we are seeing at the moment in parliament, then they get to write the laws and in some instances get to rewrite the laws of this country. If we really want to restore public confidence in our democratic institutions, we need to get the big money out of politics, we need to get it out of donations during election campaigns, we need to ensure that expenses that are claimed by parliamentarians are legitimate and we need a much more thorough overhaul of the system than we are currently seeing from this government. Members of parliament, of course-it should not have to be said-use public money to do their job, and they are doing it on behalf of the public and for the public, so accountability to the public should be an integral part of any allowance scheme. This gold pass scheme that is the subject of this bill has been a long time under our blame. It was first introduced in 1918 and originally provided unlimited domestic travel to former members of parliament, but since 2002, in response to growing public disquiet over the scheme, the reach of the gold pass has been reduced, but not always with the unanimous support of current and former MPs. In that year, the pass was changed to limit retired MPs to 25 return flights a year. In 2012, this was further reduced to 10 return flights. The Gillard government wound up the whole scheme for MPs who retired after 2012. Last year, four",29,Bills
14,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (10:22,"After three years of broken promises, the governmentformer federal members of parliament lost a High Court challenge that they were hoping would ensure they retained their Life Gold Passes that entitled them to free travel. In the notorious 2014 Abbott-Hockey budget, the government committed to further reduce the gold pass for all former members except prime ministers, but the changes under this plan were not due to be in place until 2026. But, even with that extended time line, the government failed to take the legislation through both houses, despite having cross-party support that would have ensured the passage of the bill. When current Prime Minister Turnbull became Prime Minister, he continued to drag the chain, and the government was all over the place. Then, in the second half of 2016, the then Special Minister of State promised the bill would be introduced before Christmas, and that did not happen. But after a woeful summer, during which the rorting of the system was exposed for all to see, even this government was no longer able to sit on its hands and was forced into action. At the end of last year, before the scandals broke, the Prime Minister claimed that his government was too busy to deal with the gold pass legislation. When you remember that there was a period towards the end of last year where the Senate ran out of legislation to deal with, you really wonder whether the government would have done this at all had it not been for the exposure of so many scandals. But the good news is that the government has come to its senses. It has been dragged there kicking and screaming by the public and by parties in parliament who have been calling for reform in this area for a very long time, including the Greens. The gold pass repeal is no longer on the shelf gathering dust while the government dithers. The gold pass itself is now going to be consigned to the dustbin of history, and this will be a small step in restoring public confidence in how members of parliament undertake their work. On the question of penalties that has been raised and was going to be agitated further, and on the question of amendments that will come up in this bill and another bill, I say that, when these bills come before the Senate, the Greens will be pursuing amendments consistent with our policy that there needs to be greater scrutiny and accountability of expenses that are claimed and that there ought to be fewer perks paid to members of parliament who have retired. So we will be pursuing those amendments when we get there, and we will be having a lot more to say about the bills when the matters come before the Senate. I will end my contribution here, but I will say more during the amendment stage. I foreshadow that here in this place I will be happily supporting the amendments moved by the member for Mayo. You will find that, when it comes to the Senate, we will argue that it should even go further, but the amendments that are to be moved by the member for Mayo here are a good step in the right direction and they deserve to be supported. But I will say that, if the government were serious and really wanted to restore faith in our institutions, we would not have to be dragged kicking and screaming and then taking the minimal action possible. What we would be saying is, 'It's time for a thorough overhaul of the relationship between money and politics,' and we would be looking around the world at how they do it elsewhere. We would be saying, 'Perhaps the answer lies in public funding of election campaigns with limits on how much can be spent.' That would be a discussion that we would have to have with the Australian people, because it would involve putting more money into elections. But, if you said to people, 'Look, you're already tipping in an enormous amount of money into elections anyway,' and if the quid pro quo of publicly-funded elections is that donations are excluded and private money has less of a sway over what happens, I think a lot of people would accept that. That happens in other countries around the world, so perhaps we ought to look at that. We ought to look more broadly at caps being made on donations into the electoral process and, perhaps, even as they do in some states around the country, caps on how much you can spend in a particular electorate. That would level the playing field, and that would stop some of the incentives for money coming in, in the first place-if there was less that you could actually spend during the course of an election campaign. Until we reform this system, everyone is forced to play by a set of some pretty broken rules. It is the rules that need to change. It would give the public much more confidence if we were able to have that kind of rigorous examination of the connection between money and politics, in this place. Until we fully fix that, a lot of people are going to have a lot of doubts about the integrity of this place, and that is enormously disappointing for Australia, for us and for democracy as a whole. This bill is worthy of support. We have been calling for this for a very long time. We could have seen action on this a while ago if the governments, at the time, had supported the Greens, but, in some senses, on this bill, better late than never. But we should be amending it so it goes further. thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. This bill implements changes to the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 and Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002, consistent with reforms announced in November 2013 and in the 2014-15 budget respectively. In addition to previous announcements, the bill accelerates the termination of access to travel under the Life Gold Pass scheme. The bill ceases Life Gold Pass travel on the day it commences for all current pass holders, including spouses and de facto partners, other than retired former prime ministers and their spouses or de facto partners, and renames the remaining benefit as Parliamentary Retirement Travel. The bill continues Parliamentary Retirement Travel for qualifying current and future retired former prime ministers and their spouses or de facto partners; however, the amount of travel and the purpose of the travel will be limited even further. The bill reduces Parliamentary Retirement Travel by retired former prime ministers from 40 to 30 domestic return trips per year and from 40 to 20 domestic return trips per year for their spouses or de facto partners. The bill requires that parliamentary requirement travel undertaken after 14 May 2014 be for the public benefit. In relation to the changes to the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, the bill reduces the qualification age for travel provided to the dependent children of senior officers, ministers, presiding officers and opposition officeholders from under-25 to under-18 years of age. The bill also imposes a 25 per cent loading on any claim for a prescribed travel benefit that requires subsequent adjustment, unless the adjustment is as a result of an administrative error made by the administering department or the adjustment is made within 28 days of the original claim. The bill establishes a mechanism to minimise the risk that payments made in the course of administering parliamentary-work expenses will breach section 83 of the Constitution.

15,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,"Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (10:31): I would like toThis bill contains sensible reforms to improve accountability, in the spending of taxpayers' money, which strengthen the parliamentary work expenses framework. Once again, I want to thank all members for their contribution, and I commend the bill the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (10:35): I move: (1) Schedule 2, item 7, page 23 (lines 31 to 33), omit subsection 10C(4), substitute: (4) The recipient is liable to pay the Commonwealth, by way of penalty for the contravention of section 7A (the current contravention), an amount equal to: (a) if the recipient has not contravened that section, or has contravened that section once, during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the day on which the claim to which the current contravention relates is made-200% of the amount to which this section applies; and (b) if the recipient has contravened that section 2 or more times during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the day on which the claim to which the current contravention relates is made400% of the amount to which this section applies. Ms SHARKIE: I would certainly like to. The amendment relates to the penalties, and it is fair to say that a 25 per cent penalty is inadequate. The public will roll their eyes and they will see it for what it is. It is a slap in the face to the public and their hard-earned taxpayer money. In essence, a $1,000 rort would mean a penalty of just $250. A penalty under my provision would see that if you take $1,000 of the taxpayers' money inappropriately, in the first instance, you would have a $2,000 penalty and, for three offences or more, within 12 months you would be paying $4,000 back on top of that $1,000 rort. I think that is a fair penalty, because what we want to do here is restore, for the public, our integrity. The Nick Xenophon Team is committed to greater accountability and transparency, in relation to parliamentary entitlements, and I believe that a much larger penalty is needed as a greater deterrent. We have greater deterrents in the criminal system. We do not give somebody who murders another person just three months. We recognise that there are aggregated offences and, for the same thing, what we are looking at here with repeat offending is aggregated offences. If an invalid claim is made, the penalty would either be 200 per cent or 400 per cent depending on the number of transgressions. This amendment would increase penalties significantly, and I would like to think that both of the major parties would support this and see this for what it is. This is us being far more accountable for our own behaviour, because, when we have one person who decides to take their family on a holiday to Central Australia or they decide that they are going to take their family to Noosa, it affects us all. For those of us who do not stop and ask ourselves whether it is appropriate to spend taxpayers' money in this way, the larger penalty may force them to stop and think.",37,Bills
16,The Deputy Speaker,"Are you going to speak to them. I urge this House to support this amendment, as it sends a message to our communities that says that most of us are honest, that most of us do the right thing, and that we are prepared to impose harsher monetary penalties on those of us who do not. for Mayo. The government's position is clear: we have introduced this legislation to amend the act and we feel that the 25 per cent financial penalty for members and senators who decide to make a repayment is an appropriate penalty in the circumstances. In a sense, these changes are providing additional penalties that, to date, have not existed. So, whether or not one accepts the premise of the circumstances that the member for Mayo describes, these are penalties that will be put in place that hitherto have not been there. So our position is that these are sensible changes and a 25 per cent financial penalty will provide a significant incentive for people to ensure that their claims are correct. supporting this amendment because it is a step in the right direction. When the bill comes before the Senate, we will be arguing for a targeted and potentially harsher approach because, in our view, there should be a much higher penalty for members of parliament who knowingly misuse entitlements. An inadvertent mistake might be one thing, but, when you knowingly misuse your right to travel somewhere or to claim overnight accommodation and you have gone to a place-for example, the Gold Coast-just for personal reasons, to improve your own personal financial position by perhaps buying an investment property, that is beyond the pale. If you fleeced the company that you worked for you would go to jail, or you would face going to jail. If you took money out of the coffers of a company to improve your own personal position and your own personal standing, you would face the full force of the lawand rightly so. So the question arises: when you have a member of parliament who knowingly does something wrong and knowingly says, 'I can get taxpayer entitlement X, Y or Z and use it to improve my own personal situation,' what is the appropriate response? Why should it be any different to someone who defrauds their company or the boss that they work for and who could potentially find themselves in jail? That is a very simple question that the government should answer. Should we not at the very least-and this is an argument that we will be pursuing in the Senate-be increasing the penalties for those members of parliament who intentionally do the wrong thing? When it comes to the following bill, we will have more to say about the expenses authority and the situation where members of parliament might get the rules wrong. We think there are steps that could be taken to fix that so that you do not incur the expense in the first place. But, if you knowingly do something that is really for personal benefit, surely the consequences should be much higher. Slipping up-okay, let's deal with that in a certain way. But, if you knowingly do something wrong, the penalties should be higher. This government, in particular, should have some even-handedness, because, if you happen to be someone in this country who has lost their job and is reliant on Centrelink or Newstart to get yourself by until you get back on your feet again, if you miss an appointment, your money gets turned off and you go without. This government says, 'We want to make it even worse; you might have to go up to a month without any money at all'-not for having done the wrong thing but just because you find yourself unemployed. So this government is quite happy to",38,Bills

18,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (10:38,"As foreshadowed in my speech, the Greens will beturn around and say to people who find themselves out of a job-and it might because you are living in a town where unemployment is over 20 per cent-'You get no money at all, because you didn't turn up to an appointment,' but then effectively give what could amount to a slap over the wrist to people who have a lot of money and who are in a position to afford this kind of penalty. So you really have to ask whether this government is prepared to be as even-handed and as tough on politicians as it is prepared to be on people who are unemployed. I reckon the answer is probably no, and that is probably why the government is not going to support this amendment. In moving this amendment, there are some very valid questions as to whether the government has the balance right, particularly when it comes to people who make claims they know in their heart were not right from the beginning. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (10:43): Labor supports the implementation of the panel's recommendations unaltered and unhindered. On that basis, the opposition opposes the amendment and supports the timely passage of the legislation in its current form. Parliamentarians of every political persuasion have acknowledged that the complicated and often disjoined system of work expenses can generate genuine error by parliamentarians seeking to utilise work expenses in the course of their duties. The suite of bills proposed to reform entitlements seeks to ensure the system for claims, advice, monitoring and auditing is clear and concise. The intent of these reforms is to remove the incidence of incorrect claims altogether, following the implementation of the Independent Review of Parliamentary Expenses, led by John Conde and David Tune. We have been awaiting the government's response to that review for over a year. It was undertaken by a group of respected and eminent Australians with experience and knowledge in this area. That is why Labor will be supporting the implementation of those recommendations, unaltered and unhindered. Importantly, for those who might seek amendment, the provisions in this bill allow for review every three years, which is, in the opposition's view, the opportune moment to reconsider changes and improvements. So, again, Labor supports the bill in its current form. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (10:44): I would just like to briefly respond to the minister's comments in relation to my amendment. I appreciate the minister's acknowledgement that this has never been done before; we have never had a 25 per cent penalty. And so I say to the minister: do it once, do it right. Let us not go back in three years' time. I think that we are missing the community's expectation here, if we think the 25 per cent penalty is enough. It is not enough for this, and particularly if you are a repeat offender and you are rorting-this is using taxpayers' money; this is not using your own money. And so, I think the community expectation for this would be that, if this is your second, third, fourth, fifth or eighth offence of this kind, then you should be receiving a higher penalty. I think the community's expectation is that 25 per cent is far too low. We should be looking at least 200 per centbecause nothing else will ensure that we do the right thing here. We have had so many examples of this. I have to say, I feel very strongly about this. When one of us is betraying the trust of the public, we all suffer. I know that when the recent controversy was being reported-and it was being reported relentlessly-people in my community looked at me differently. They spoke to me differently. They made requests of me differently. AndI felt the contempt that they had for politicians generally being directed at me personally-even though I was not guilty of anything. It was guilt by association. And they seemed to be wondering how much I had my snout in the trough, just like other members of parliament who have been found to be doing just that. And so I would urge both sides here-our two major parties-to show some leadership in relation to this and to support this amendment. for Mayo. I think we are all in violent agreement that a penalty regime is appropriate; we are disagreeing on where the line should be drawn. It is our position-and I fear that we are covering old ground-that the 25 per cent financial penalty is appropriate in the circumstances. I welcome the opposition's support of that penalty regime and the 25 per cent penalty-that is the position of the government and we think that it strikes the balance. Again, we will have an opportunity in the legislation to review this in due course, but I am confident and the government is confident that this penalty regime will provide the incentives necessary to ensure that all members-and can I just put on the record that the absolute bulk if not all members are very honest individuals, including those in the opposition and on the crossbench. This is an appropriate penalty regime. However, I thank the member for Mayo for her contribution. what the member for Mayo is trying to achieve here, which is to make the penalties much harsher. I agree with the member for Melbourne: the penalties should be much harsher. Let us put this in perspective. If someone-anyone; a member of parliament, a business, a welfare recipient-if anyone knowingly and deliberately takes a sum of money from the Commonwealth-steals a sum of money, effectively-whether it be a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars, that is theft. That should be regarded as a criminal matter. For some reason, we have this idea that if an MP effectively steals a sum of money from the taxpayer, then we might shame them and we might ask them to pay back a little bit extra as a fine, but otherwise it is okay. How would we treat someone who tried to defraud Centrelink of a thousand dollars? The police would go after them, and put them in front of a judge. What would we do if a business tried to defraud the Commonwealth for $1,000? The police would go after them and we would try and drag them in front of a judge in a court. There is no reason for this exemption for members of parliament-that they should pay some paltry little fine, and maybe get a slap on the wrist, and maybe named and shamed. No wonder the community is sick and tired-they have absolutely had it up to here-with politics and politicians and most of the political parties. Because they think that we have got our snouts in the trough. And they think that we think we are above the law. And how can you blame them for thinking that-when we think it is okay, when the government thinks it is okay, when the opposition thinks it is okay, to have some token penalty for what amounts to theft? If a member of parliament trips around this country and, on that trip, does what any reasonable person would say is substantively a private matter, and then they sign a form to say it was for official purposes, then that is theft. That is a criminal matter. The police should be called in. Regrettably, I am not surprised at this half-baked approach by the government and the opposition when it comes to penalties, because all of the evidence is that the government and the opposition have been dragged kicking and screaming to this day-kicking and screaming. The fact is that when former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop got into strife over the use of a",39,Bills

It was early last year that the government announced that those recommendations would be implemented. And here we are, a year later, and they have not been implemented, and the only reason the government is moving now is because of the political pressure as a result of the former health minister. I make the point again: the government and the opposition have been dragged kicking and screaming to this point. Neither side is beyond fault here-the Labor Party: you were in government for years, you did not do anything; the Liberals and Nationals: you are now in government, and it was only the former health minister's scandal that forced you to act. WhatI would like to see done is exactly what the member for Melbourne has foreshadowed-that is, much tougher penalties. How dare the government and the opposition come in here and say they will not support the sensible amendments from the member for Mayo? While I agree for the member for Melbourne-we should go much further, and it should be a criminal matter-how can you not bring yourself to support the member for Mayo's amendment? It really goes to demonstrate that you have been dragged kicking and screaming to this point in time, and that what you are doing is the barethrough the chair, Member for Denison. government and the opposition have, indeed, been forced to come in here most reluctantlytotally against what they would rather be doing right now. They do not have their hearts in it. If Labor had their hearts in it, they would have acted on this years ago. If the government had their hearts in it, they would have acted on the 36 recommendations a year ago. They do not have their hearts in it. They do not care about this. They will keep working together to diminish reform in this area-because, quite frankly, too many of them have got their snouts in the trough. We see it all the time: members of parliament gallivanting all around the country, maybe meeting some colleague in their office for 20 minutes and then spending a weekend in that town, probably with their partner and having a lovely old time, and racking up thousands of dollars of bills on the taxpayer. That is theft and that should be a reason for the Federal Police to be called in. Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (10:52): I would like to add words of support for my colleagues and briefly add a couple of other salient comments. When we had the election in 2016, a quarter of the population of Australia voted for non-party members of parliament. In this parliament there are five of us on the crossbench who represent that quarter of voters of Australia who do not want and did not vote for parties. What we are hearing today, exactly as my colleagues have said so well, is a strong voice from the crossbench. We are saying to the parties: 'You have got it wrong.' We are saying that a quarter of the population in Australia want something done about this particular issue and it is significant. SoI am adding my voice of support from the people of Indi, a traditionally conservative electorate in the country. We have seen what has happened and we do not like it. We would like the government and the opposition to do exactly what the member for Denison has just said: come together and absolutely show the people of Australia that you get the serious nature of the problem of how we behave.",41,Bills

Particularly for the Independents, but I also know this from my smaller party colleagues, the scrutiny that is applied to us is enormous. The scrutiny by the major parties that is applied to every single act I do is so particular. So, as other members have said, we pay particular attention to make sure we follow the rules. We pay particular attention, but not because we want to follow the rules; we do this because we know it is right and proper. We do this because we respect that taxpayers' money-paid and earned so hard by our electorate-needs to be accounted for. SoI say to the very good members of parliament, the members of the government and the opposition, 'This is at your peril. If you do not listen to us, it will be upon your shoulders.' There is nothing in this particular bit of legislation for us other than representing our communities. I bring my comments to a close and say that this debate is going to go on for a bit of time today. We have put an enormous amount of work into working with our communities. We have spoken to them, we have consulted with them and we have asked: 'What would you like us to do as Independents?' What you are getting here today is heartfelt representation. We are saying to the major parties, 'Listen to us. Listen to the quarter of Australians who don't want what's happening.' You have all heard the big debate in Western Australia about preferences and what is happening there. The community is getting behind it and saying, 'There's a pox on your parties. We don't like it.' Here is your chance today to actually do something that would be really popular with the community-really popular-to show the communities of Australia that the major parties get what they are trying to say. Hear the strong message from the crossbench. In adding my comments, I acknowledge the representation of my colleagues and I thank them for the amendments they have brought through. I am absolutely committed to supporting you on those amendments. members for Melbourne, Dennison, Indi and Mayo. The government does not propose to immediately introduce criminal penalties to this legislation. There are already provisions in place for members and senators, like any citizen, who genuinely defrauds the Commonwealth, but to suggest that a member or senator who genuinely makes an incorrect claim based on very ambiguous rules should face criminal penalties is nothing more than a stunt, in my view. One strong reason for introducing the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority is to provide clarity and certainty for parliamentarians about whether something is within or outside the rules. The government believes this is a better way of approaching things, along with other measures including increased transparency, than continuing to have the system we now have, with vague guidelines, and simply adding criminal penalties to help some on the crossbench get a headline. strawman argument that I have ever heard. This portrays how this government is not serious about it. When I first got elected to this place and wanted to use a travel entitlement, I rang up everyone I could find to ask, 'Is this trip that I want to do within the rules? I'm new here and I want to know whether it's in the rules.' WhatI was told by the departments who were just doing their job is, 'We can't tell you whether it's in the rules. You have to make your own assessment about that, and there's no way of it being judged.' That is why, for a very long time, we have pushed for an independent authority that you are able to go to before you incur",42,Bills

24,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (10:57,"That has to be responded to because that is the biggestthe expense as an MP and ask for a ruling about whether it is in or out. If we had an independent authority like that, I bet former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop would not have got the tick for a chopper flight to Geelong and I bet several other former ministers would not have got the tick for trips to places where they were about to purchase investment properties or the like. So there is a strawman argument being put up here. There have been pushes for reform for a very long time saying, 'Let's make the rules crystal clear and let's have an independent umpire you can go to before you incur the expense so that you've got absolutely no excuse if you get it wrong.' If we did that, the public would have an enormous amount of confidence in us because they would know that someone was overseeing what we do. The government have finally heard what the Greens have been pushing for a while-an independent umpire who can make those assessments-and they have come part of the way towards it with their next bill that is coming up. We will have a few things to say about that. That is a good step in the right direction, but it is something they have been dragged to, kicking and screaming, because some light was shone on the behaviour of their own frontbench and backbench and the public said enough is enough. But the minister said, in his comments just then, 'No-one should go to jail for a slipup.' None of us are arguing that. We are saying two things. We are saying: make the rules clear so that there can be no excuse, and put an independent umpire in place before you incur the expense so that members of parliament have no excuse if they do the wrong thing. We are arguing that there are people who do not unintentionally slip up. Everyone makes mistakes; whether you are working for a private company or for the public, it will happen from time to time. We are not talking about unintentional slip-ups. You can fix the rules so that they are clear and so that people have no excuse but, if-once the rules are clear-you deliberately go out and flout them, then surely you have to be held to a higher standard than someone who makes an innocent mistake. If you go out and say, 'I will use public money to get myself an investment property,' or if you say, 'I will use public money to go to a personal event that has no connection with my work,' then surely that has to be held to a higher standard than someone who just slips up because they filled in the wrong form or did not dot their i's or cross their t's. If you want to have this argument, Minister, do not build up a straw man. Do not suggest that those of us here are saying that we want people to face potential prison sentences for making a simple mistake. No, we are not saying that. We are saying that if you know what the rules are, you have clarified the rules, and if you then use public money for private gain, what standard should you be held to? If you were working for a private company and did so, you would be charged and hauled in front of a court. If you were a welfare recipient and you did not meet the government's test, you would lose your payment. If the government is seriously saying that the penalty for someone who slips up accidently should be the same as the penalty for someone who intentionally rorts the system, then they are massively out of touch. They are massively out of touch, and they should go and listen to the kind of reform that people around this country want. Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (11:02): I too would like to respond to the comment from the government. Absolutely, it is true that there is confusion, but there is no argument about how broad this particular area of work is. There was a really good recommendation in the report that was tabled in February 2016-that we should overhaul the system and have one act of parliament that would bring it all together with really clear purpose, and go back to the drawing board to get rid of the confusion. Minister, I would be really keen to hear your response to that. What is the government's plan for giving us an act of parliament to cover off on this topic? I have not seen in any of the literature I have been reading, nor in any of the briefings that we have had, that there is any commitment from the government to implement that recommendation in the report-one act of parliament that covers it all off and makes it clear. So often in this parliament, when we try to fix things up, we make something like a smorgasbord of everything. I think in this particular instance we need to do exactly what your report has said-develop one act of parliament. Let's clear it all up, let's simplify it and let's stop trying to fix it by adding little pieces at the side that will make it even more confusing and more hard. I welcome your comments, and I would be really keen to hear your advice on when the government is going to accept that particular recommendation. member for Indi. The government is conscious that we want all senators and members to have a very clear understanding of what is within and what is not within entitlement. I think we can all agree that the current set of arrangements certainly provides for a lot of grey area, and that is one of the reasons the Special Minister of State is doing a lot of work at the moment-to try and make that as clear as possible. That will be expedited, though I cannot give an exact time frame. As for the criminal penalty regime that has been proposed by some members, if anybody, any citizen, knowingly defrauds the Commonwealth, ordinary criminal provisions will apply. But it is our view that a penalty regime of 25 per cent, that could include inadvertent errors, is appropriate and is enough of an incentive to ensure that everybody gets their own house in order and makes sure that those mistakes are not made. minister says that the existing arrangement is enough, does the minister believe that the recent scandals that we saw over the summer-where members of parliament used public money to improve their own personal position with investment properties-amount to something that should attract the attention of the criminal law, or does the minister believe that that is the kind of activity that should only be dealt with by a 25 per cent penalty? for Melbourne and, as I passed him in business class when walking down to my economy seat on a plane from Melbourne to Canberra, I did not realise he was such a bastion of purity on these issues-not to mention your carbon footprint, member for Melbourne, in a business class seat compared to mine in an economy seat. Our position is very clear. We think that a 25 per cent penalty regime which, up until today, has not existed, will provide sufficient incentives for members to ensure that they do not make those inadvertent errors. And, if any citizen, senator or member knowingly, deliberately defrauds the Commonwealth, the ordinary criminal law will apply. How hard is that for the member to understand? It will ordinarily apply. Our position is very clear. A penalty regime of 25 per cent will provide the incentives to ensure that all of us scrutinise our entitlements in a way that, clearly, in isolated circumstances, has not been the case in the past.",43,Bills

Yes, the rules have been difficult to decode and understand. Yes, there has been ambiguity. Yes, often people have in their own words complied with the rules, they have acted within their entitlement. I fear that many people in this place have failed to understand that all that sort of talk though just appals the community. For the community, it is about what is right and what is wrong. In some ways it does not matter what the rules are, because there are some fundamental measures of right and wrong. Some people call it the pub test; I would actually rather call it the test of what is ethically right: what is the behaviour of someone with integrity versus something that is ethically wrong or the behaviour of someone who lacks integrity? In some ways this whole discussion is irrelevant, because it really comes down to what is right and wrong. If someone travels around Australia and, on that trip, the substantive activity is private-even if they are doing some official duties around the margins and then they claim allowances for that trip-then I think any reasonable person would say that claiming those allowances is the wrong thing to do. I think that is the way a lot of people in the community are viewing this. In fact they see our preoccupation with the rules, fines and penalties in some way as a cop-out, because we are suggesting that, by needing to tighten up the rules-and we do need to tighten up the rules, unfortunately-and the time we are spending on debating this, we do not have an understanding of right and wrong and that we need these rules. Unfortunately, we do need these rules in this place, because some people do not have integrity-many people do; there are a lot of good men and women in this place, in all the parties. I am not picking on all of my colleagues. I am not saying I am better than that or I think I will have a cheap shot at the member for Melbourne for where he was sitting on the plane. I think this is an important thing, and it is in the public interest to, as we have generally done, keep the debate and the discussion at a good and civil level. I want to make that point. It is a little vague what I am saying, but I think people get it. It is the sort of feedback I am getting in my electorate and as I travel around. It is not about the rules. It is not about whether or not the former health minister was within entitlement or outside entitlement. It was about whether or not we are doing the right thing, whether or not we are acting ethically and whether or not we are acting as leaders in the community by setting a good example. I will talk about the business class point. I think that, if the community had confidence that we are good and competent people in this place-people of integrity, people who are focused on good public policy and we work hard-they would probably forgive us if some people sit at the front of the plane and some people do not. The problem at the moment is that respect for us is rock bottom. When they look at these things-like the former Speaker, the former health minister or other people-they sense that we are not men and women of integrity and that we need to act as people with integrity, because that is ultimately what this is about. It is about right and wrong and, if this place was populated by good people with integrity, you know what? We would not need any rules, and the community would have confidence in us that we were always trying to do the right thing.

28,Mr Wilkie (Denison) (11:07,"I would like to bring a different perspective to this, if Irecognise that a flat penalty of 25 per cent for the first offence, for the second offence and for the 20th offence will not restore the community's faith in us, which they currently do not have? We are at such a loss in this place as far as community respect for us goes. It will provide very little thought or understanding within the community that we are trying to address this. Does the minister believe that that is an acceptable penalty when there are repeat offences? It could happen; it has happened before. We only just saw it in the summer where, unfortunately, we had a health minister who was found to have travelled many, many times. Even though that was within the rules of entitlements, it affected every single one of us in here and it brought us down below choppers. It brought us down, and people have such little respect for us so that I think we need to, as a parliament, look a little closer at ourselves and be a little tougher on ourselves for the benefit of all of us, for the benefit of the wider community. As the member for Denison said, this is about right and wrong. This is about us being able to very clearly see when something is right or wrong and act as leaders in our community, which is what we are supposed to be when we walk into this place. At the moment, the community has very little faith and very little trust in us, and these measures are about restoring that trust. member for Mayo. I do not think it helps us to get into a debate here about who is more righteous. I think the reality is that the requirement of a repayment of any incorrect claim plus a 25 per cent penalty in my view in a rational sense should not lead to repeat offences. The whole idea that we are imposing a penalty regime that does not exist at the moment for any sane or rational member of parliament would mean that you will not have those repeat offences, and I think, in most cases of what we are talking about today, we are looking in the grey area. I take the member for Indi's point around making the regime clearer for members, and that is what the Special Minister of State is doing now and it will be in the next round of legislation that he will be proposing. The government's position here is that we are taking a big step in trying to restore, by imposing a penalty regime, the confidence that you rightly say is lacking. We can all try to outbid each other on who is more righteous by saying it should be 100 per cent, 200 per cent, 400 per cent. In my view, in a place where we think most members and senators should be acting rationally, if not honestly, I do not think there will be those repeat offences, because a strong penalty on any overclaim will apply. It is the wish of the government that we do not see a single offence, let alone repeat offences, and I think we are in agreement that a penalty regime is the best way of doing that. We perhaps disagree on where we would draw that line, but I do not think any number of questions to and fro are going to change where we both sit. We think a 25 per cent penalty is appropriate-indeed, the opposition believes that a 25 per cent penalty is appropriate. Obviously, we will have an opportunity to review this in three years time. CanI just say more broadly: I have been in parliament for probably less time than many of you-perhaps not you, member for Mayo-and far be it from me to defend all the members of this House or the other place, but I think, overwhelmingly, members of parliament work very hard.

I do not think there are ministers or shadow ministers who are desperate to spend another night away from their families. I think these are duties that we take very seriously on behalf of Australians and, again, that is why we believe that a 25 per cent penalty regime is appropriate in the circumstances. I agree with the member for Denison that, ultimately, if all members and senators act with the integrity that the Australian people expect of us then we will not even have circumstances where a penalty on the first strike is cast, let alone further penalties as you have described, member for Mayo. Our position is clear: a 25 per cent penalty regime is appropriate. agreed to.

Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (11:24): Perhaps the most poignant thing to come out of the tragedy that took place in Bourke Street on 20 January this year was a letter by Henry Dow, which was read at the Federal Square remembrance for the victims. He told the story of Lou, a taxi driver. He said: 'Administering first aid with me under that skinny little tree is a man named Lou. He's everything great and courageous you've seen, heard or read rolled into one authentically humble bloke.' He talked about how, having seen the car fly by, he managed to help some passers-by, and he said that was the moment at which Lou came over. 'Lou grabbed my hand and firmly told me to ""keep it together"", that I was okay and that we needed to keep strong for this woman. In a level and loud voice Lou barked orders at other pedestrians",47,Bills

He directed assistance to several of the victims lying on the pavement around us, all whilst keeping me calm and speaking lovingly to this woman: ""I'm Lou. You're going to be okay. We are looking after you.""' Lou, in his white shirt and neat, dark tie, was a taxi driver. He had been smoking a cigarette, waiting for his next ride, and this story that Henry Dow told was not one of tragedy but one of courage. As he said, 'There was only kindness in the voices of the police who came to relieve us. I felt only love when an older man hugged me, having just told a father he had lost a daughter. Many images and sounds will stay with me much longer than I might like, but I am glad to see, and I hope never to forget, just how brave and loving strangers can be.' As Henry summed things up, 'Hundreds responded with the love and sense of community that makes Melbourne such a beautiful city and Victoria such a great state.' In this chamber during this parliamentary sittings fortnight we have acknowledged the victims: Matthew Si, a son, a husband to Melinda and a father; Jess Mudie, a daughter, and a twin sister to Emily; Bhavita Patel, a daughter and a sister; a 25-year-old visitor from Japan whose family have asked us for privacy in their grief; and, most painfully for those of us who are parents, Talia Hakin, aged 10, just a week away from starting grade 5, and Zachary Bryant, who was just three months old. We always look for our own stories in these situations and, as somebody whose eldest son started grade 5 and whose youngest son is named Zachary, these hit me particularly. We are here today speaking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Bourke Street Fund) Bill 2017 because this bill ensures tax deductible gift recipient status for a memorial fund that has been established for the victims. There are those who stepped forward on the day-such as Lou-who were there as heroes in the moment, but there are many other Australians who, in their generosity, have given more than $1 million to the Bourke Street Fund. That fund does not automatically receive tax deductible gift recipient status-it does not fall into the established categories-and so this bill allows it to do so. A permanent memorial garden will also be established. We hope that this fund will help to assist the many victims-the many who were injured and the families of those who were killed. In this parliament we are united in supporting the families, the friends and the relatives of those who lost their lives. We are also united in supporting the Victorian government's fund and the Prime Minister's announcement that donations will receive deductible gift recipient status. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (11:29): Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. As we are all aware, on 20 January this year a senseless and vicious attack took place in central Melbourne that resulted in death and injury to innocent people and shocked our nation. The crime was evil and incomprehensible. What remains for us as a community is to remember those whose lives have been taken and console and support those for whom life will never be the same. Australians are overwhelmingly good and kind. In difficult times, I am always buoyed by the unfailing generosity of people, who simply want to help. To facilitate this desire, the Victorian government announced the creation of a fund to provide financial support to the immediate families of the deceased as well as the injured and their immediate families. To ensure that donations would be tax deductible, the Prime Minister and I announced that the fund would receive deductible gift recipient status and committed $100,000 from the Australian government to the fund. This bill ensures the deductible gift recipient status of the Bourke Street Fund and will assist the fund to attract public financial support. In doing so, this is but one way in which we can demonstrate our care, empathy and support for those so tragically affected. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to.

Bill read a third time. Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017 Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (11:31): I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition in support of the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017. This bill seeks to establish an independent authority to monitor and manage travel and work expenses of parliamentarians. In 2015, the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, announced a review into the expenses of parliamentarians following the impromptu helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong taken by former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop. The understandable public outrage following that incident prompted the former Prime Minister to act, and he promised the review would fix the system. The government received the recommendations of that review and formally accepted them in February 2016. There were 36 individual recommendations and many related to the travel undertaken by parliamentarians. We are aware, based on the comments of the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State, that further legislation is on its way to implement the recommendations of the Conde review. In addition to supporting the recommendations, the Prime Minister has announced an independent authority, similar to that which currently exists in the United Kingdom, to monitor, manage and audit parliamentarians' work and travel expenses. This announcement was again prompted by scandal, following the member for Farrer's failure to appropriately manage her travel expenses. The authority established by this bill would assume many of the responsibilities of the Department of Finance and would require the resources to process claims by parliamentarians and staff. The authority, managed by a chief executive officer, would be led by a chair, the President of the Remuneration Tribunal and members including a former judicial officer, a former parliamentarian and people with experience in corporate governance and auditing. Labor supports the establishment of such an independent authority to oversee the system, but the coalition's dithering on these important reforms-I remind members that the review was brought down a full year ago-has contributed to further undermining Australians' confidence in those they elect to serve them. Australian families should not have to wake up to the news of another Bronwyn Bishop. They should not wake up with another reason to be fed up with what is going on in Canberra. These scandals and misuses of work expenses damage not only the individual or party but all of us in this place. From day one, the opposition has supported the recommendations of the independent review into parliamentary entitlements and the creation of an independent tribunal. The government has been sitting on the recommendations of the independent review of the expenses system for almost a year. It has been shamed into action only because of the revelations of the actions of the member for Farrer. Today's legislation is an important step. The Labor Party has and will always stand for increased transparency and accountability in the political system. We know and respect the importance of this place, and the importance of the public's faith in those of us who are fortunate enough to have been elected to work in this place. A lot of luck goes into being elected into parliament, and those of us who are here feel lucky every day that we have the privilege to work in this place. But we have to work together on reforms to address the community's lack of faith in the existing system. It is absolutely critical that we restore that faith because, as we have seen, the numbers of rusted-on supporters and the deep tribal loyalties are not what they once were. People have become more disconnected from community life. We see this not just in the waning public membership of our mass membership organisations, declining church and union membership and declining engagement with friends and neighbours but also in disengagement from politics. The problem of us becoming disconnected is reflected in declining party membership, declining rates at which Australians cast a valid vote and declining support for major political parties. We see this not just in Australia but around the world, where the vote for centrist parties has declined and the support for populist parties has risen. Too many Australians believe the political system is broken, and all of us in this place have a duty to fix it. We must ensure that we debate what matters and focus on the issues affecting millions of Australian families-families who have felt at times that some in this place have been acting out of self-interest, instead of for the interests of those whom we serve. These scandals make it easy for Australians to think that politicians are in it for themselves. When you look at the surveys that have been conducted by the Australian National University through the Australian Election Studies, you see a rise in disenchantment in politics. It is a problem which I wrote about back in 2002 in a book I coedited with David Burchell called The Prince's New Clothes, which was about why Australians do not trust their politicians. But since that book came out we have seen further decline in the degree to which Australians have trust and confidence in politicians. We do, collectively, need to lift our game. Of course, the vast majority of parliamentarians respect taxpayer money, respect their duty to represent the voters, and do the right thing. But the exceptions are those that hit the front page and tarnish us all. Labor wants to see these recommendations implemented without further delay, and I commend this bill to the House. Ms HUSAR (Lindsay) (11:38): I rise to make a contribution to the debate around entitlements reform, and I do so because this is an issue that my constituents often bring up with me in my electorate of Lindsay. AndI also note a lack of speakers from the government on this bill, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017. I think the conversations of my community with me reflect the broader views around the country on this issue: they want to see more accountability and transparency from their parliamentarians, and rightly so, and they want to know what their tax dollars are being spent on and spent in a way that actually benefits their issues and their lives. We all know that Australians are losing faith in our political system. They are losing faith in our collective ability to represent the issues that matter to them, as my colleague the member for Fenner has just pointed out. Too many people see parliamentarians as self-serving and self-indulgent, removed from the stresses and strains of ordinary life and too concerned with fringe issues that impact very little on their lives. I know this because, prior to entering this place, I was a single mum struggling to get by, and I was raised by a single mum who struggled to get by also. SoI understand how people can look at parliamentarians and wonder how connected they are to ordinary people. In my former life before entering here I also ran a charity, and every cent that was spent in that charity was directed to the right causes. The recurring scandals around entitlements do nothing to help people's faith in the system. It is up to us to prove to our constituents that the things we do as their representatives are valuable to them. It is up to us to improve, and to prove to our constituents that they get value for money in everything that we do. From Bronwyn Bishop's 'choppergate' scandal to the former health minister's Gold Coast getaways, these kinds of self-indulgent abuses of taxpayer funds undermine the important work that members of parliament do, and, at a time when the average family's pay packet is stagnant and the cost of living is going up and up, the last thing Australians want to see is parliamentarians wasting taxpayer dollars. Likewise, at a time when this government is cutting support to pensioners and throwing our unemployed young people under a bus, the last thing Australians want to see is parliamentarians who are addicted to tightening the belts of others but cannot tighten their own. That is why Labor has been committed to entitlements reform for quite some time, and that is why Labor has offered to support the government to pass this important legislation. Now this is an incredibly important point: if we do not act to improve people's faith in our political system, we leave ourselves open to extreme fringe groups who would rather spread hate and fear through our country instead of doing the important work of building and supporting our communities. So both sides of this chamber have a job to do in rebuilding people's faith in our political system. That is why the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, established a review into MPs expenses some time ago. The recommendations from that review have been sitting with the current Prime Minister for almost a year. There were 36 recommendations given to the Prime Minister, all of which I will not go into, but it seems recent circumstances have hastened this government's overdue response to those recommendations. In particular, the move to establish an Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority is welcome, and it promises to provide greater accountability and transparency and more uniform advice to parliamentarians about their work expenses in this place. And, as a new member of parliament, I have got to say: I personally welcome this as well. Currently the system is governed by a multitude of different acts, regulations and ministerial directions, which contributes to the opaque perception-the sense of confusion-that undermines people's trust in the system. Of course, at the heart of the new authority has to be value for money for the taxpayer. That must be central to these reforms, because that is the expectation of the community. And that has been made very, very clear to me. The authority will assume many of the functions of the ministerial and parliamentary services when it comes to parliamentarians' work expenses and claims, relieving the pressure on the Department of Finance and shifting the responsibility to an independent body. The independent body will be in charge of providing clear advice to MPs and their staff and remove much of the ambiguity that currently exists. Another issue that is often brought up with me is the Life Gold Pass, which can only be described as an anachronism that fits very poorly against the backdrop of modern budgetary household pressures. Labor has been clear and unequivocal in our support for removing the Life Gold Pass because we recognise that it sits so far outside community expectations. While I appreciate that some people will be unhappy with this change-probably the beneficiaries of the pass, I suspect-we have to remember that this is taxpayer money: money that has been earned and forfeited by someone else, quite often earning far less than a parliamentarian. We should recognise that every dollar spent in the course of our jobs representing our community is a dollar that was hard-earned by our community. I know that there are an incredible number of hard working MPs in this place who understand this fact, and that is why there is broad support to scrap the Life Gold Pass-apart, of course, from a few rogue coalition MPs who have decided to defend it. Now, as I mentioned before, much of this debate centres around people's faith in the system and their faith in the idea that we parliamentarians should expect from ourselves what we legislate and regulate for others. And-at a time when this government is ruthlessly chasing innocent people for fake debts, cutting pensions, ripping money out of schools and making unemployed young people live off nothing for five weeks-the absolute least we could do in this place is to subject ourselves to proper scrutiny when it comes to spending taxpayer money. This is why ordinary people are so obsessed with MPs' entitlements, because they are constantly being attacked by this Liberal government and they do not think it is fair that they end up footing the bill for the same MPs who vote to reduce their benefits. These reforms are long overdue, and I am proud to say that I understand why they are necessary-I get it-and I represent a party that understands why they are necessary, too. We have a job ahead of us, but it is fundamentally important that people have faith in the system and faith in their elected representatives to spend their money wisely. That is the aim of this bill, and I support it. comments of my colleague the member for Lindsay, with which I wholeheartedly agree. I did",48,Bills
34,Mr Hill (Bruce) (11:44,"I would like to make a few brief remarks building on thespeak earlier for the full time on the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Authority Bill 2017. I said on that bill that it could be considered courageous, in the Sir Humphrey from Yes Minister sense, for any of us to get up and say anything about entitlements in the current environment. It is a bit less so on this one, as I cannot imagine that anyone in the community or anyone in this place would have any opposition. Indeed, I think there is far less room for debate about where to draw the line in relation to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017. I would say at the outset that I am entirely unclear as to why the bills were not debated concurrently, given it is possible to traverse pretty much the same ground on each bill. AllI can conclude is that it helps fill the airtime here, given the government's lack of any substantive policy agenda. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that most of us, if not all of us, did not seek election to talk about expenses or to talk about ourselves-although in recent weeks we have seen those opposite spending more time talking about themselves than about the nation. I would certainly prefer it if we could focus on other issues, substantive issues, that relate to people's daily lives. I am sure everyone in the chamber would agree. As the member for Lindsay pointed out, if the government had done its job properly in the time before I arrived in this place last July and acted on this quickly after the Bronwyn Bishop scandal then this would have been dealt with in the last parliament. We know that in August 2015, after three weeks of prevarication and a national scandal, former Prime Minister Abbott finally called an end to it and commissioned a report. We understand that that report was received by the government in February last year, a full 12 months ago. It went round and round in circles, and it was only when the member for Farrer became the January news story and some of her travel records were exposed that all of a sudden the government decided that she had to walk the plank-presumably to protect the member for Curtin and the polo misadventures-and so the story goes. Nevertheless, we are where we are. We have had a sense in recent days as to why the delay, given the public tantrum from Senator Macdonald in the other place about the outrageous suggestion that we could see the Life Gold Pass removed. Presumably there is one ray of hope in that tantrum for the rest of us in that perhaps he is thinking about leaving the parliament soon and is focused on the next phase of his life, however long it may be. I spoke in my earlier remarks from three perspectives. I spoke from the perspective of a new member-someone trying to make sense of all of this in a chaotic, complex environment with the incredible mishmash of rules. I also spoke as a citizen who has watched this mess unfold from outside this place for far too many years and seen it, year after year, bleed trust in this parliament and its elective representatives. I spoke of the impact that that trust deficit has on our ability to prosecute more complex arguments for national reform, which are in the public interest but which may not be popular in the short term. It is hard to get up in front of people and be taken as credible when you keep being blindsided by outrageous and stupid expense scandals. AndI also spoke from the perspective of the community's expectations. I will not further traverse that ground, lest I be cast as Mayor Quimby, one of my favourite characters from The Simpsons, who is known for quoting himself. But I do want to add one other dimension to my remarks on this: as someone who worked for over 10 years-after 10 years in a place you start losing count, but I think it was about 12 or 13 years-as a senior Victorian public servant. Generally, my time in the Public Service has been one of working within a culture of prudence and with an expectation of public scrutiny of everything you do. Notwithstanding some shameful examples that have arisen-and that are now quite rightfully being prosecuted in the courts-of education bureaucrats ripping off the taxpayer and some other incidents that have occurred, my experience in all the departments that I worked in, under all the secretaries that I worked for, was one of high integrity. That culture of prudence and the expectation of scrutiny drove a desire for clear rules. When something was not clear, there were always processes to work it out and gain agreement. It drove you insane at times, because you would say to your boss, 'I have to go here and I have to get a cab, and then we would sit down and try to figure out how it fitted within the rules. If it did not then there were always mechanisms whereby you could go to the corporate department and figure it out. If necessary, you would change the rules, because in the Public Service there was such a high value placed on making sure things were done correctly, as the taxpayer expects. I spoke earlier about the complex mess and the lack of clarity. From my perspective, one of the most welcome things with this new Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority will be the ability to get frank, clear advice and rulings. Hurrah! No doubt the other new members. I see here have been frequent callers-the member for Mayo over there is nodding-to the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services folk in the Department of Finance. They are great people and they are there to help you understand the new administrative environment you are in. They are very helpful, they are very professional, but even they are not able, in the current system, to give clear rulings. They do their best. I have taken the advice to send queries in writing so I have a record of what was said, and generally they give you a lovely, polite reply into which have been cut and pasted the impenetrably unclear rules that you have just read. Everyone in the chamber is smiling and nodding because we have all been on the receiving end of those emails. The other issue that this will hopefully solve is that new MPs have been warned firmly and sternly by old hands that unfortunately, despite the best efforts, the department over many years is famous for contradictory advice. You ask an officer in one state, you will get an answer; you ask an officer in another state, you will get a slightly different answer; you ask someone in Canberra, and they say something that is particularly impenetrable but very wise. One MP asks for a view on something; another MP gets a slightly different situation. It is like consulting Yoda for wisdom: on one hand, you could do this; on the other hand, you could do the other. I am going to give you three Yoda quotes, because I do quite like the character of Yoda. I did not have time to Google and refresh my memory on how to do a Yoda voice, so please excuse me! Mr Broad: Oh, have a go! record my fantastic imitation of Yoda, even if I could do it! When you call the departments, trying to understand, they say: 'Do or do not. There is no ""try"".' IfI am worried I may get something wrong, then, as Yoda would say, 'The fear of loss is the path to the dark side.' The last person I spoke to told me that was okay: 'It happens to every guy sometimes this does.' But let us hope these reforms provide clarity. The final point I would like to make is that the world that I and many people here have come from-the world of corporate environments, government departments-is one where there is a priority placed on efficient and sensible systems. I have been stunned to discover",53,Bills
35,Mr Hill,"I know, I know! It would really be of no benefit because Hansard would notthat this area of government still runs on hard copy forms with tiny little columns that you cannot actually write in properly, and impenetrable codes that you cannot read properly on the bottom of forms, many of which say you have to fax them. I inherited an electorate office with a fax that no-one actually uses. We plugged it in, and I thought, 'We'll send off the fax.' Who uses a fax these days? But you had to fax the form back. The forms get faxed in and then lost, so we have started scanning them and emailing them. We unplugged the fax machine in the end, because some of the anti-marriage equality people were sending particularly horrid broadcasts around sodomy and all sorts of things. So we thought we had best unplug the fax in the end. We did not really need that. There is no online claims system. It is truly bizarre. I hope this is remedied quickly with the new authority as it wastes an incredible amount of time sitting there as a member of parliament-when you have got so many other things to dotrying to fill out these silly forms and fax them somewhere. Accountability and transparency are also important, and I firmly believe that transparency improves culture and behaviour. Quite simply, it is human nature that, if we know our actions will be watched, if we know that people will see and scrutinise them, then that positively influences them. We have certainly seen that in more tragic places-for instance, in the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, where a lack of transparency and accountability clearly drives unacceptable behaviours in all sorts of institutions. But I think it is true in any human collective endeavour. So it is good that, among other accountability measures, the authority will assume responsibility for the publishing of members and senators' expenses in a helpful format. That is currently done every six months in a weird sort of PDF format, but the authority will establish first quarterly and subsequently monthly reporting in a more accessible and searchable format, which our friends in the media will delight in, but I think that is actually an important part of holding us to account-that transparency in real time. There is also the requirement that, if an adjustment to certain travel plans is made or required, there will be a 25 per cent penalty. In summary, I look forward to the establishment of the authority and dearly hope, like others in this place, that it draws a line in the sand and that in coming months and years we can start to rebuild some public trust and perhaps have a little bit more capital to prosecute things which are of great importance and in the national interest. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (11:55): FirstlyI would like to congratulate the government on bringing forward this legislation, the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. It is always pleasing when the government adopts a Nick Xenophon Team policy and embraces it as its own. In 2015, following the helicopter scandal, Senator Nick Xenophon introduced a bill designed to provide greater accountability and transparency in the use of parliamentary entitlements. The bill provided for an independent watchdog to administer claims, with monthly disclosure of all MPs and senators' expenses published online and the right of the public to make a complaint to the watchdog. Back in 2015 the major parties did not support Senator Xenophon's bill, because they thought it was unnecessary at the time. It took yet another scandal, yet another time when we were all shamed by the inappropriate action of colleagues, yet another time when the community's trust in politicians was eroded, for them to change their minds. I believe we are in a precarious position with the public that we serve-and that is it: we serve them. They no longer trust us. They no longer respect us. We have had too many travel rort scandals for them to take us seriously. They look at their own lives, the rules they operate under, the way they work out their own work expenses and the way they are managed, if they are lucky enough to actually have access to work expenses, and they cannot believe the sense of entitlement that some of us have displayed. We all remember being lectured by the government, particularly by the former Treasurer, that the age of entitlement was over. Of course, they were referring to others, mainly to welfare recipients, and not particularly to members of parliament. So is it any wonder that the public rejects this message comprehensively? How do we regain the trust and respect of our communities? I believe that establishing an independent authority to administer claims for parliamentarians' entitlements is certainly a step in the right direction. If parliamentarians know that every travel claim they make will be made public then perhaps we will stop seeing attendances at sporting matches, particularly when they are interstate, or attendances at New Year's Eve parties or family holidays being billed to the taxpayer. Public scrutiny and potential embarrassment are powerful deterrents. The proposed authority has been modelled on the UK Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has operated successfully for a number of years. In a parallel situation to our own, the UK authority was established in response to a huge expenses scandal in 2009, primarily related to claims of a second residence. The UK scandal generated significant public anger and resulted in a large number of resignations, sackings and retirements. Several parliamentarians were prosecuted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. That makes my proposal of a 200 per cent penalty pale into insignificance. I want to focus on the composition of the board of the authority, which has been copied directly from the United Kingdom. My concern is that we do not have any representation from the community on the board. We have the President of the Remuneration Tribunal, a former MP, a former member of the judiciary and an auditor. I think, if a member of the public were looking at the composition of the board, they would be sceptical about them being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people. We are talking about elites, essentially, looking at elites. We know that there will be self-selection, and I firmly believe that within this parliament we could legislate to have a member of the community, an ordinary Australian, as part of that board. SoI intend to move an amendment in the consideration-in-detail stage, to change the composition of the board, to add an additional member who is a community representative. When I look around Australia, when I think of regional electorates like Indi and my electorate of Mayo, I am sure that we would have a community representative who would gladly put up their hand, somebody from regional Australia who would say, 'Yes, I would like to be on that board and I could provide great value to it.' I think it is very important that we involve the community in this process and that we open ourselves up to the community for that very reason. In closing, I do support this bill. I am very hopeful that the government and the opposition will consider opening up this authority to be real, to be part of the community and, hopefully, by doing so, we will start to claw back some of the confidence of our community. Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (12:00): Colleagues, it gives me pleasure to speak to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017 and also to give notice that I will be supporting the amendments from the member for Mayo. This entitlement issue is one of great concern in my community, and I am absolutely delighted that the government has brought on this particular bill to establish the authority. But, overarchingly, I want to say, 'Government, you haven't gone far enough. There's a lot more that needs to be done.' In setting the scene for what more needs to be done, I would like to go back in history a little bit and talk about the MP for Calare, Peter Andren, when he was an Independent in this House. He did a magnificent job, as an Independent, taking up the battle, on behalf of Independents at that stage, for much closer scrutiny of what was being given out to members of parliament under that entitlement. To Peter Andren-who has since passed-one of those very wonderful early members of parliament, I just want to acknowledge your work, Peter, and say, 'Up here, in the crossbench, we are flying the flag with real passion because we know there is a long way to go before this particular unpleasant part of how parliament works is addressed.' Up here, in the crossbench, we acknowledge this legislation, and we are going to basically vote for it, but we are going to move amendments to make it better. In moving those amendments, we are going to pick up some of the work that those us here, on the crossbench, have already done a lot of work on. The member for Denison, last year, moved a very strong motion. He absolutely called on the government to commit to meaningful reform of the entitlements act. That was back in October. I totally support his work there. Since then, the member for Denison has taken the lead for introducing a private member's motion, an act of parliament to actually do some work on this, to audit all members and senators travel claims during this and the previous parliament and for all of us to list substantive activity taken as part of official travel. In the process of making sure we do the work to clean up the past, we will move forward to making the future better. In making the future better there is no shortage of advice to the government. When you do the research for this particular bit of legislation you can see that there are numerous reports that the government has commissioned-but we still have not gone far enough. In 2015, there was the ANAO report; in 2011, there was the Review of the administration of parliamentary entitlement by the Department of Finance and Deregulation; and, in 2010, there was a report as well. So we have a lot of background telling us what to do. TodayI would like to concentrate on the latest report: An independent parliamentary entitlement system: Review: February 2016. In it there is a classic quote from these really wise people who did the review, and I would like to read it into parliament, because I know there are many people in my electorate who are watching this broadcast. The quote is from page 2, section 6 of the government's report. It goes: Broadly speaking, these reviews concluded that the system, having evolved piecemeal and without adequate rationalisation, is complex, confusing, incomplete, contradictory and immensely difficult to follow and administer. The problem has worsened as demands on, and external scrutiny of, parliamentarians has increased. It goes on: The complexity of the system’s rules and regulations imposes stress on parliamentarians and their staff, and on those who administer the system. Parliamentarians can too easily run foul of rule interpretations or eligibility requirements. This has undermined public confidence, not only in parliamentarians, but also in the system itself. That is true, and that is why it is really good to see that the government is taking some action. We agree. Then this review goes on to make some very practical recommendations, and I would like to take a few minutes of the parliament's time to read, again, into the Hansard. This is the major recommendation, and I fully support it: The system shouldThe new systemensure that the relationship between the public and their representatives is one of respect and mutual support. It should be understood by all and simple to use and administer. It should ensure expenses are appropriate, sufficient and fair, be in accordance with reasonable standards and the overarching principle of ‘value for money’. And section 12: We believe the best way to achieve this goal is a principles-based system allowing the parliamentarian flexibility to apply judgement, choice and personal responsibility when using it, but obliging him or her to report publicly and be subject to reasonable standards of auditing so as to provide transparency and public accountability. What wisdom! But how do we do that? Here is where I am really calling on the government to go to the next step. This report says: To provide clarity, the rules should, to the extent possible, be consolidated into a single Act of Parliament. One single act of parliament. So we end the piecemeal, complex, confusing, incomplete, contradictory and immensely difficult to follow and administer system and we replace it with an act of parliament. Colleagues, we have not quite got there yet. We have an authority being set up, which is this particular legislation that I support, and we have some changes made to how we administer it, but I am really calling on the Prime Minister and the government to do what his own report says and give us an act of parliament that is principle based, systemic, easy to read and well-followed. In bringing my comments to a close, I want to talk a little bit about trust and trust in the system. To do this I want to bring to the notice of the parliament a report that has been prepared by the Museum of Australian Democracy called Who Do You Trust to Run the Country? Democracy, Trust and Politics in Australia. I acknowledge the authors of that report and the institutions: the University of Canberra, the Museum of Australian Democracy, and the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis. It tells us what we have been talking about today in this parliament, in the previous debate: that Australians no longer trust their politicians. What an extraordinary thing to have to say in this House: that the research of these highly respected institutions tells us that our population no longer trust us. What we saw just a few minutes ago in this House was an effort by us crossbenchers, four of us, to say, 'We can do something to help restore trust and faith in our democracy. We saw this thing happen in this parliament, where there were 'four lonely voices'-as I think The Guardian said-against the might of all the political parties. SoI say to the people of Australia: 'It is not that you cannot trust parliamentarians; I think you need to pay particular attention to that last vote, because there are clearly some people in this House that you can trust.' The research shows us that in the 2016 election about a quarter of Australians gave their first preference vote to non-mainstream parties. The people of Australia are actually getting that the major parties are not doing a good job representing then and that, in fact, it is the crossbenchers and the minor parties that really have this sense of close relationship with our communities, a commitment to represent them and a great ability to stand up in this House, to think for ourselves and to be able to represent what our communities are saying. WhatI think is so special about our independence is that the people of Indi know that I am speaking forcefully, boldly and strongly directly for them. This opinion has not gone through any party machine. I am not putting it through any personal ambition to be a minister. I am not doing deals to make this happen. I am absolutely here speaking for my community, as I know my colleagues on the crossbench are. As to this sense that we do not have the trust of our community, I say to my colleagues in the major parties, 'Get a copy of this report and have a read of it and really and seriously pay some attention to what the parties need to do to follow the leadership being provided by the Independents on this entitlements bill.' WhatI think would make such a big difference is if we could actually do the work that needs to be done to have one act of parliament. In bringing my comments to a close, I speak in strong support of the amendment that is going to follow from the member for Mayo. Having the community voice on this authority is one small step to get this through the pub test-the ordinary Australian person who we represent getting their voice heard on this authority. I will bring my remarks to a close at this point and speak later when the amendment from the member for Mayo is introduced. Authority Bill 2017 and the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017, is part of a series of measures that the government is bringing into the parliament in response to criticism about the way members of parliament use their entitlements or allowances. It follows some legislation that was debated only this morning on a similar subject. The purpose of these bills is to establish the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority as an independent statutory authority. The bills provide that the authority's functions include advising parliamentarians on travel expenses, allowance and related expenses; monitoring parliamentarians' use of travel expenses, allowances and related expenses; administering travel expenses, allowances and related expenses, including processing of these claims; reporting on work expenses; auditing of work expenses claims; and making rulings about travel expenses and allowances where authorised by a law to do so. The authority will have up to five members, consisting of a chair, the president of the Remuneration Tribunal and at least two, but not more than three, others. I understand membership of the authority would also have to include a former judicial officer, a former member of parliament and a member with substantial experience in auditing. The advice, monitoring, processing and rulings given by the authority to MPs will be restricted to travel expenses. The authority will be able to recover overpayments, repayments and cost-recovery payments in relation to travel expenses. I also note that there will be financial implications of this bill, which are not quantified but which will be considered as part of the 2017-18 budget. Having said that, I want to make some general remarks about the entitlements, expenses or allowances-however one might wish to define them-of members of parliament. All members of parliament come into this place knowing full well what their remuneration is going to be and what is expected of them if elected to office. While some parliamentarians",55,Bills
36,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12:10,"This legislation, the Independent Parliamentary Expensescould earn better remuneration outside of parliament, it is my contention that the current remuneration is fair and reasonable. It is also my view that that has not always been the case. By 2004, MPs' remuneration had become an election issue. Mark Latham, then Labor leader, promised to make changes to MPs' entitlements if Labor won office at that time. Prime Minister John Howard responded in a similar vein and, for all MPs elected after 2004, the rules and benefits changed. Today, there are only nine senators and 22 House of Representatives members-a total of 31 parliamentarians of the 226 in this parliament-who are on the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and who will receive a lifetime pension on retirement. The other 195 MPs, having been elected after 2004, regardless of their length of service on leaving this place, will not receive a pension or generous travel allowances. I want to stress that-and other members have made the same point-because there is a very clear misunderstanding out there in the community about the entitlements or allowances that members of parliament receive and, quite often, it is a misunderstanding based on what previous members of parliament receive, not what the current ones are receiving. There have been changes, and those changes affect the absolute majority of the members of this place. In fact, if we use percentage figures, some 87 per cent of the current parliamentarians in this term of parliament will not receive many of the benefits which the public believe they do. Of course, I cannot speak for MPs elected to the six state and two Territory parliaments, who are all on different remuneration packages and whose allowances, at times, cause confusion with the allowances of federal MPs. For today's federal MPs, it is not the remuneration that I believe is wrong but the deliberate misuse of allowances through an unintended interpretation of the guidelines. It is that deliberate abuse of allowances which has led to the widespread mistrust of members of parliament, something which other members speaking in this debate have also alluded to. I believe that there is a mistrust of members of parliament, and there has been, without any question of a doubt, widespread criticism of MPs and the use of their entitlements. My view is that the intent of the current guidelines is clear-and I emphasise the word 'intent'-and that the allowances provided are reasonable if MPs are to conscientiously fulfil their role. The ramifications for abusing the allowances are already serious. In today's world, where public scrutiny is easy, and where media and other MPs are quick to discredit any parliamentarian who has abused or rorted the allowances, anyone rorting the system is likely to be caught out and to then pay a heavy price. That heavy price can include the loss of parliamentary positions, including perhaps a ministerial position, and then also jeopardises the future election of that person. Those are very strong deterrents, which I believe are more effective than the 25 per cent penalty provision proposed in the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 debated earlier, and more effective than provisions proposed by crossbench members earlier as well. If the public humiliation, loss of ministry or possible loss of office is not sufficient deterrent, then nothing more is likely to make a difference. I want to talk just for a moment about the authority itself. I welcome the establishment of the authority. If nothing else, I believe it will add some clarity to the definitions of what is an allowance or expense and what is not, and it will offer a reference point for MPs to go to. Time will tell how effective the authority will be. It is also my concern that the costs of oversight may well be higher than the savings made. But then that is the cost of transparency. However, I stress: my view is that the intent of the guidelines we have at the moment is fairly clear. Indeed, I believe the majority of members of parliament adhere to those guidelines in an honest way. Much has been made-both by the media and by those who wish to gain from it in one way or another-of the abuse of allowances. The truth of the matter is that members of parliament cannot fulfil their role as parliamentarians if they are not properly supported, and the allowances are intended to do just that-support the members of parliament in their role and in doing their work. In many cases, this is work that is done on behalf of their constituents and the people that they serve. It is a sad reflection that members of parliament are now held in such low regard by the community as a result of the actions of those members of parliament who have chosen to rort the system. And it is a choice that they make-because every member of parliament can make a decision about which expenses they claim and which they do not. Hopefully, as a result of the authority being established, there will be not only greater scrutiny but also the reference point that I referred to earlier-because it is also true that, at times, the definitions of what one can and cannot are not absolutely clear. Labor supports this legislation because, if nothing else, it will add to the transparency and the oversight that the public has been calling for for some time. I believe that will also go a long way towards restoring public confidence in the allowance system that is provided to members of parliament. say, it is a pleasure-after having called for an independent parliamentary expenses authority for years; after having said that there needs to be an independent umpire that MPs can go to to find out whether or not a future claim is within the rules or not-that finally the government and the opposition have listened to the Greens. This has been long standing Greens policy because the rules up till now have been vague. That has been no excuse for members of parliament or ministers who have deliberately done the wrong thing-when just any simple test would tell you it is not right to use entitlements for your own private benefit, as opposed to for the public good. But we have said that there is a case-and we have made this case for many years-that, before an expense is incurred, there should be someone that members of parliament can go to. We have said that for a couple of reasons. One is that-as I said in a speech earlier today-when I first came into this place, I wanted to get some guidance as to whether or not a flight that I was about to pay for was within entitlements. I went and asked the department, and the department said: 'We cannot tell you. You are going to have to make that assessment.' AndI said: 'Who determines whether I am right or wrong?' And they said: 'No-one.' That is not a situation that members of parliament should be in. There should be clear rules, and in most other workplaces that is the way it is. It is clear what is in and what is out. That should be the case here. It is not just from the perspective of members of parliament that this will make a difference; it will make a big difference for the public because, if the public knows that there is a place you can go to first, whenever anything is in doubt, to get advice or a ruling-if the public knows that, then there is absolutely no excuse for someone who then does the wrong thing afterwards. I bet that if former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop had gone to this body and asked, 'CanI get a chopper down to Geelong?' they would have said no. AndI bet that if some former members or ministers had asked, 'AmI allowed to do a trip to look at an investment property or go to a wedding?' they would have said no. So, if this new body does its job, it is not only going to be helpful",60,Bills
37,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (12:20,"Well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! I mustfor people here but, more importantly-and this is the reason that we have advocated this for so long-the public will know that there is no longer any excuse. What is concerning about this bill is that, as is often the way with these things, the government picks up an idea, picks up the concept of having an independent watchdog, and then defangs it. With this bill we see an advisory authority that, sadly, will not have the teeth that it should have. We should be doing more than giving advice to members of parliament, because if we want to do the second thing that I spoke about, regarding giving the public confidence, the public needs to know that the body that oversees the politicians has some teeth. Sadly, it does not at the moment. There is nothing in this bill about compliance and nothing about penalties. Without some muscle the authority might look good on paper, but, in terms of consequences, if there is misuse, it will be a failure. There needs to be a clear distinction drawn in the public mind between a slipup-and there would not be many excuses for a slipup after this body comes into place, but of course slipups will still happen; everyone accepts that-and intentional misuse of what is, at the end of the day, public money. Given the lack of oversight in how expenses are incurred in this job, there is a very strong case for this body having some teeth-not just having advisory and audit aspects but some teeth. When this comes to the Senate we will be making the case that the legislation needs to change so that the body has some teeth. The government may find, if all it does is the minimum it thinks is necessary to get the public off its back from its perspective, that is not going to be enough because people can smell whether what you are doing is genuine. People will know whether this is just a sop to try to get past the latest issue of parliamentary entitlements and scandals and there is hope that the media and the public debate will move on to something else or whether it is genuine reform. As I said, the idea is very good, because it has been a Greens' idea for some time, but we want it to have some teeth. SoI would urge the government, as this bill progresses through the parliament, to consider some sensible amendments to the bill to ensure that the body does have teeth and that it is a watchdog, not a lapdog. We have to make sure that the body has the power to not only do some investigations but do something if they find that there has been some wrongdoing. As I said at the start, when it comes to the Liberal government, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The time has come for them to pick up a Greens' idea. I am glad that they have seen the merit in something we have been arguing for for a very long time, and arguing for publicly, but do not just pick up half the idea; pick up the whole idea because then you will go a very long way to restoring the public's trust in all of us here as politicians. summing up the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017, I would firstly like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate. As noted previously, politicians must be held accountable for the use of taxpayers' dollars and the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017 is the first step in the biggest reforms to the management of parliamentarians' expenses in more than a generation. This new authority will provide clear and consistent guidance, advice and rulings for parliamentarians to ensure that our spending of public money meets the expectations of the Australian public.

I look forward to working with the opposition and other members and senators to ensure that these important and timely reforms are delivered. The consequential amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 contained in the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 will ensure that the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, which will be established under the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Bill 2017, will be able to provide confidential advice to parliamentarians and their staff with respect to travel expenses and allowances. This will ensure that parliamentarians and their staff engage early with the authority which will be able to provide frank and independent advice with respect to travel expenses and allowances. Once again, I thank all members for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House. speakers, I put the question that the bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to.

I am moving this amendment because I think that the proposed composition of the board of the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority sends the wrong message to the community. It tells them that the people we want to make decisions about our parliamentary expenses are in the top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia. We are talking about elites here. It is elites, essentially, making decisions about elites. Let's be honest-that is how the community would see it. If we proceed with the board as it is currently structured, I think we are saying collectively that we have a tin ear-we are saying that we are not aware of the growing discontent in the community of our perks and the frequent abuse of our entitlements; we are saying that we do not want to give the community a voice in determining what is a reasonable work expense for parliamentarians. We need to look for every opportunity to let the public know that we are prepared to listen, that we are prepared to implement structures",63,Bills
39,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Craig Kelly,"I thank the minister. There being no furtherthat ensure a lay person can have a say about our entitlements on behalf of our ordinary people. This is about engagement. This is about transparency. In discussions about this amendment I have been told by some that it is too hard to work out how to select a person to represent the community views. Really? There are many precedents that use a variety of procedures, including calls for expressions of interest and assessment against criteria that would enable the minister to be satisfied that the person to represent the community has ethical standards in the expenditure by parliamentarians of taxpayers' money. I do not believe that the implementation of a community member within this authority should be a problem. SoI urge both sides to support this amendment, to send a clear message to the community that we are prepared to listen, that we are prepared to seek guidance about acceptable practice in expenditure on our entitlements and that we realise we have had it wrong for too long. the member for Mayo for her contribution, both in the early debate and also in proposing the amendment. The government does not support the member for Mayo's proposed amendment to this bill. The government believes that, by setting up this independent authority, the government is moving swiftly to ensure that public confidence is restored. I do take the member for Mayo's caution in relation to public confidence very seriously, but the government is moving swiftly to ensure that public confidence is restored to the parliamentary work expenses framework by having an independent body that is able to give authoritative advice to parliamentarians about what is within the rules. This body will also have the ability to audit the travel expenses of parliamentarians and their staff and will have the ability to withhold or recover payments of expenses that have been claimed incorrectly. Most importantly, the significant increase in transparency, by moving to monthly reporting in a searchable database format, demonstrates the government's clear commitment to creating a system which the public can have that confidence in. In practical terms, this amendment contains a significant amount of ambiguity about what qualifications a community member who the minister is satisfied represents community expectations, about the ethical standards to be followed by members of parliament in the use of public money, would need to be appointed to that board, in contrast to the other positions specified by the Prime Minister, which are more clearly defined and are reflected in the bill before the House. I understand, and I pass on to the member for Mayo, that the Special Minister of State has advised the Nick Xenophon Team that he is willing to have further discussions regarding the composition of the board 12 months after the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority is up and running. At this point the government does not believe an increase in the size of the board is necessary. The abolition of the Life Gold Pass, the extra penalties for voluntary repayments and the establishment of the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority are the first steps in, as I described earlier, what are the biggest reforms to the management of parliamentarians' expenses in more than a generation, and the government is acting decisively in this matter.

45,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (12:40): byGrattan that the Prime Minister's Office warned the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Services against the timing of making the outrageous link between the cuts in the omnibus bill and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. So there is already all this finger-pointing going on within the government about who is to blame for the reprehensible decision to link the omnibus bill and all the cuts to some of the most disadvantaged people in Australia to the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In addition to the most reprehensible nature of that announcement, of course what this all demonstrates is the government's complete and utter incompetence. The one thing this week did confirm is that this new savings fund is just a transparent attempt to pretend, yet again by this government, that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is not fully funded. It is clear that the government has not created this special account for the purpose of good policy. No, they have created this account for political purposes. The Turnbull government wants to use the NDIS as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with the Senate crossbench to pass unfair cuts through the parliament. How did that go? We saw all of this on display this week in a press conference with the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Services. We saw the government emphasise the importance of giving big business a $50 billion handout. Then the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Services revealed their shameful plan. What they want to do is link the $5.6 billion in cuts to some of the most vulnerable Australians to the future funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This $5.6 billion of cuts include $2.7 billion in cuts to family tax benefits-money straight out of the pockets of some of the poorest families in Australia-and $1 billion of cuts to the energy supplement. That means cuts to pensioners, people with disability, carers and Newstart recipients. There are cuts to 70,000 new mothers and cuts to young people, including making young people wait five weeks to get access to Newstart, telling them that they will have absolutely nothing to live on for five weeks. The Turnbull government has decided to hold the National Disability Insurance Scheme hostage to its unfair cuts to family tax benefits, paid parental leave, the energy supplement and cuts to young people. That is what this government is doing. Linking the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme to a range of 2014 and 2015 budget cuts is just an appalling political trick by this government-nothing but an attempt to try to blackmail the Senate crossbench into accepting harsh cuts including from the 2014 budget. I want to say to this Prime Minister and to everybody opposite: this government has no right to pit one group of vulnerable Australians against another. As Laura Tingle, writing in The Australian Financial Review, said, 'The government's latest attempt to pass their savings playing off poor people against disabled people is just appalling,' and it is just appalling. The respected five-time Paralympian, Kurt Fearnley, said yesterday of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, 'I wish the Government would fight for it with as much vigour as fighting for its $50 billion business tax cut'. He went on to say that the government's attacks on the National Disability Insurance Scheme were 'just wrong'. Labor will oppose this bill today. But we do more than that. Today, we call on the Turnbull government to take these unfair cuts to families, pensioners and young people out of the parliament and out of the budget for good. We also call on this government to stop playing politics with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Be proud of it. Do not talk it down. Do not put fear into the hearts of people with disability. This legislation and the fund that it seeks to announce are a sham. The National Disability Insurance Scheme will be funded from consolidated revenue and the government knows that. The Minister for Social Services and the Treasurer have even said so. This legislation even makes that plain. The Turnbull government repeatedly fabricates the story that Labor did not fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and now they are wasting the parliament's time by establishing an account with no other purpose than to try to support this untruth. They are seeking to present a false choice between cutting payments like the disability support pension and properly funding the NDIS. It is a false choice. The former government's 2013 budget set out a 10-year funding plan for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This included but was not limited to an increase in the Medicare levy. A number of other budget measures were proposed and legislated, and these funds currently sit in consolidated revenue. Together, these measures provided sufficient funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme well past the transition to the full scheme. The figures underpinning these budget measures were, of course, developed by the Treasury, led at that time by Martin Parkinson, now the secretary of the Prime Minister's department, and yet the Turnbull government continues to say that the scheme is underfunded. This is nothing more than a sham. You do not have to go any further than the Treasurer himself. As The Australian newspaper reported last year, far from using its proposed National Disability Insurance Scheme savings fund for the NDIS, the Treasurer said that it could use the funds to spend money on anything it wants. It says, 'Scott Morrison told The Australian that the fund'-that is, the fund we are debating today-'while quarantined could be used by any future government for any of its spending whims.' That is what the Treasurer said. So what is this all about? Why are we debating this bill today? We have already seen the government use this special account as an excuse to play politics and engage in a disgraceful game of political brinkmanship. In the last 48 hours, this government has tried to link the delivery of the NDIS to their attack on families, pensioners, people with disability, carers and Newstart recipients. Now it is crystal clear that the Turnbull government is using this fund as a smokescreen for their 2014 budget cuts. Both the Treasurer and the Social Services Minister have now confirmed that this fund will be financed through cuts to payments for the most vulnerable Australians. What the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Services are saying is that this government wants to abolish the energy supplement for those on Newstart, the disability support pension and the age pension. They want to cut paid parental leave. They want to force young people into poverty with a five-week wait for Newstart and cut family payments to 1½ million Australians, many of whom, of course, live in Liberal and Nationals Party electorates. So is the government seriously saying that, if these unfair cuts are not passed through the Senate, the NDIS will not go ahead? Is that what those opposite are saying? This week the government has shown its true colours. What we cannot allow is for the government to use the NDIS as an excuse for more cuts to social security payments. That is not in the spirit of the NDIS and not in the spirit of the bipartisan and consultative approach committed to by both parties for the NDIS. The NDIS continues its full rollout across the country. It is a completely contradictory idea that we would use its implementation as a means to cut other sources of support for people with disability, but that is exactly what people opposite are trying to do. My good friend the member for Bruce helped shine a light on a terrible story of young man with a severe and permanent disability. Andrew Johnson has profound autism, bipolar disorder, attention deficit disorder and epilepsy, cannot talk and needs a stomach tube to help him eat. Yet Andrew's mother has been asked by Centrelink to prove Andrew's eligibility for the disability support pension, despite his being eligible for support for many years. Andrew is one of the thousands of disability support pensioners that the government is trying to make subject to medical reviews to test their eligibility for the DSP. However, someone like Andrew, who has no capacity to work and was granted the DSP on manifest grounds, was supposed to be exempt from these DSP reviews. The government must explain what it is doing to ensure that people like Andrew are not harassed by Centrelink about their eligibility for the DSP again. This is just one example-I must say a very moving one. Last year's budget papers make clear that the government wants to review the eligibility of 90,000 people who are currently on the disability support pension. The government expects that it will cut a number of people off the DSP through these reviews and then put whatever money it gets from this process into this National Disability Insurance Scheme savings fund. The government is doing the most horrible thing, robbing one group of people with disability to pay another group, robbing Peter to pay Paul, when it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and this bill. On top of this we see the appalling treatment of people with disability over the summer months by the government's Centrelink robo-debt debacle, a complete mess that has seen many vulnerable people with disability incorrectly issued with debt recovery notices. One example highlighted in The Guardian was of 21-year-old Jack Rogerson, who learned he had a $3,000 debt with Centrelink through a private debt collector. Jack is autistic. He was confused and unsure of how to explain himself. Fortunately for Jack, his mother, Nicole, intervened. Nicole is the head of Autism Awareness Australia, and she said, 'This hard line of the government is just heartless to the core.' Labor continues to be deeply worried by stories like this, and I again call on the government to suspend the Centrelink robo-debt program until the problems are fixed. Since the NDIS's inception, I am pleased to say it has had bipartisan support across the parliament. I see the assistant minister at the table, and she has been a great advocate. This has been an important feature of the scheme's success. So why are the Liberals holding the NDIS hostage to harsh cuts to vulnerable Australians? Why, I say to the assistant minister, are you trying to rob Peter to pay Paul? Because this government has never given up on the 2014 budget cuts. It has never given up on the whole idea that there are lifters and leaners in this society. It has never given up on the idea of depriving young jobseekers of access to Newstart for five weeks. It seems to think that children growing up in very low-income families who receive family tax benefits do not deserve support, because fundamentally, it seems from the legislation that is before us, the Liberals think that Australians that need support from our social security system are somehow less worthy. So they thought: 'Let's use the NDIS as a way of forcing these unfair cuts through the parliament. Let's try to blackmail the Senate crossbench. Let's threaten the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme by linking it to the fate of a series of unfair cuts.' That is what they thought, but of course it has backfired dramatically. In Australia we do not set up a special fund to allocate for schools, hospitals or our Defence Force. Peter Martin in The Sydney Morning Herald was right this week when he said, 'There are no locked boxes.' That is not how governing works. Governments fund their priorities through the Commonwealth budget. So why should the funding of disability services be treated any differently? That is the question that this government has been unable to answer. Departmental officials confirmed that consolidated revenue is used to fund government priorities, which is hardly surprising. What we also heard at the Senate hearing last October was a chorus of objections from stakeholders in the disability and community advocacy area who are very cynical and confused about the seeming lack of purpose in this bill, and I would like to quote some their observations. Peter Davidson from the Australian Council of Social Service stated: … it is not obvious why this new fund is needed. Its purpose, apart from the generic one of funding the NDIS, is not clear, and we do not believe it should be supported in its present form. The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance said: … the alliance does not support the savings fund as constructed in the bill … the notion of a funding shortfall, portrayed in the bill and the minister's speech is, actually, concerning and perplexing. Stephanie Gotlib from Children and Young People with Disability Australia said: It is believed that the creation of this special account … places essential disability services and support as non-core business of the Australian government, with their full funding being dependent on other budget-saving measures identified by the government of the day. Queensland Advocacy Incorporated, in their submission, crystallised this issue by saying: This is a political strategy that will be at the expense of the most vulnerable Australians. That really is what it is all about. This is a government that is neither consulting with the disability sector nor providing stability during a time of change and transition for people with disability. These organisations truly understand the difficulties people with disability face, and the financial pressures that they are under. They also understand the NDIS and the purpose it serves. Their testimony speaks volumes about the actions and motivations of this government. The community can see through the petty politics that lie at the heart of this proposal. It is time for the government to come clean with the Australian people and acknowledge that the NDIS is fully funded. Yes, it is true that Labor created a special account, the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, in 2013. But, unlike the government's special account, this was an investment account, credited with funding from the Medicare levy increase and used to assist the Commonwealth and the states in meeting their funding agreements under the NDIS. The increase to the Medicare levy was one of numerous funding arrangements and savings that the then Labor government introduced in order to pay for the NDIS over a 10-year period. I have to say I was very pleased at the time that we had bipartisan support. Everyone in the parliament voted for the NDIS, voted for the increase in the Medicare levy and, except for on one occasion, voted for all of these savings measures. So the then opposition, the Liberals, actually voted for these savings that of course went into consolidated revenue. They believed it was adequately funded then; why not now? This government has signed agreements with the states and territories for the full rollout of the NDIS, and I do congratulate the government for securing these agreements. In the documentation that the Prime Minister has signed, it sets out how much the Commonwealth and the states and territories will contribute to the cost of the full rollout of the NDIS. Of course the money for this is in the federal budget. Don't tell me or anyone on this side of the parliament-or, I would hope, even on the other side-that the Prime Minister signs agreements to spend billions of dollars that he does not have or that he has not accounted for. Such an idea is just not believable. Minister Porter needs to understand that people with disability actually need a minister who is committed to delivering the NDIS, not one who is asleep at the wheel, creating redundant, politically motivated accounts. This legislation does not make the NDIS more secure. It does not give it certainty. What happens to the NDIS if these cruel cuts contained in the omnibus bill before the parliament do not pass either the House or the Senate? Is the funding of the NDIS not guaranteed? This is a false choice as well as a terribly cynical one. This is a government with a very clear agenda to take money from the pockets of vulnerable Australians, and clearly they are prepared to use people with disability as blackmail to see these cuts passed. People with disability, and their families, deserve better. They need a government that puts them first and honours the spirit in which the NDIS was created: to create a fairer society where people with disability are valued participants, able to make their own choices about their care and future. Let's be clear. The NDIS is fully funded. Labor secured that funding over 10 years. This last week has proved that this legislation, more than anything, is a political stunt from a government with no agenda other than a political one. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is already transforming the lives of thousands of Australians right across the country. People's lives are being dramatically improved. Yes, there are problems-problems with the IT system, inadequate resourcing of the National Disability Insurance Scheme by the agency and so on. Today is not the day to go through the problems. Of course we are all aware of them, and we will continue to hold the government to account to make sure that we all get it right. But what we all want to do, I think, is make sure that people with disability get the best possible NDIS, the kind of NDIS that people with disability deserve. Accordingly, Labor moves the following amendment: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the bill a second reading because: (1) the National Disability Insurance Scheme was fully funded when Labor left office; (2) this bill is nothing more than an attempt by the Government to use the National Disability Insurance Scheme to justify further cruel cuts to the most vulnerable in our community; and (3) this Bill has unnecessarily caused significant concern in the disability community and threatened community confidence in the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme-a scheme that Labor created and which will help hundreds of thousands of people with a disability when fully rolled out."" Mr Snowdon: I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",66,Bills
46,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Irons,"Is the amendment seconded?time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to. (13:06): I rise today to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill. It is understandable if people listening in perhaps thought that this was about the omnibus bill from listening to the words of the previous speaker, the member for Jagajaga. However, this bill establishes the NDIS Savings Fund special account, which will help the government meet our financial obligations in relation to the NDIS and secure the funding future for NDIS. I need not explain the importance that this government places on the success of the NDIS. However, unlike those opposite, we recognise the criticality of making sure the scheme is appropriately funded. Let me make it very, very clear: the Prime Minister and the coalition government are completely committed to the full funding of the NDIS. This bill is testament to the government's commitment to establishing a sound basis for the fully funded scheme. Indeed, the Australian government is committed to ensuring the success of the NDIS. People with a permanent significant disability, their carers, their families and thousands of disability service providers and their staff are dependent on a properly funded scheme. As I have said before, the NDIS is a life changer for those eligible for the scheme. It will support a better life for around 460,000 Australians under the age of 65 with a permanent and significant disability through individualised and tailored packages of support of their choice. Since my appointment as the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, I have met with more than 300 disability sector stakeholders all around Australia. Through these meetings I hear first hand the opportunities and challenges facing people with a disability. As I move around Australia, speaking with stakeholder groups, I am regularly asked, 'What funding arrangements are in place for the NDIS and will those arrangements be good enough to support eligible people with disability?' More importantly, 'Is the NDIS sustainable, particularly as demands on the scheme increase?' By 2019-20 the Commonwealth, state and territory governments will be jointly spending around $21.4 billion, with the Commonwealth contributing just over half of this amount. In 2019-20, when the NDIS reaches full scheme, funding from the federal government will come from three main sources: existing programs, the DisabilityCare Australia Fund and the repayment of Commonwealth funding to the states and territories for their existing specialist disability services. This totals around $7 billion. Unfortunately, Labor failed to specifically set aside adequate funding, and any savings they said they were going use to support the NDIS went into consolidated revenue. Labor's actions have left us with a $4.1 billion funding gap each year. This will rise in future years. Once again, we see typically fiscally irresponsible Labor. That is why the passage of this bill is so important. It will help us identify savings and set those savings aside for the NDIS. The coalition is a responsible government. We are not want to fund this gap by increasing taxes. We do not want to fund this gap by borrowing more money. We do not want to fund this gap by charging a levy. Instead, we want to systematically and transparently identify savings and underspends to plug this gap and guarantee the future of the NDIS. I would also like to note",71,Bills
47,The Deputy Speaker,The original question was that this bill be now read a second,72,Bills
48,Mrs Prentice (Ryan,"Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services)that in November last year, the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee acknowledged the importance of this bill and subsequently recommended its passage. The passage of this bill will give me the ability to confidently respond to stakeholders and say 'Yes, the NDIS is sustainable, and yes, the NDIS is adequately funded.' I appreciate the opportunity to meet many people with disability and their service providers, and to hear the stories they have to tell. I continue to be impressed when I hear stories about how the NDIS is making a real difference to people's lives. For example, I heard from a young man with a disability who had previously required assistance every morning to get ready for work, and then required someone to drive him to work. Later in the day, he needed the same support in reverse to get home. For this young man, the NDIS meant that he was able to have his car modified so that he could drive himself. Now, with increased confidence, he no longer wants assistance every morning and every afternoon. Not only does he drive himself to work but he now has freedom on the weekends to drive wherever he likes. This new-found freedom empowered him even further, to the point where he no longer needs any assistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, leading an independent life is taken for granted by many people. It is not until you experience the hardships faced by people with disabilities that you appreciate the small things, like driving yourself unassisted to and from work. The return on a properly funded NDIS is invaluable, but that does not mean we do not need to take steps to ensure there are enough funds available to support it. It is true that the NDIS is having an impact on service providers. In some cases, it means a change to their business model. To me, this is a chance for innovation and a chance to do things better. I saw an example of this in Western Sydney, where a group of service providers banded together to establish a consortium, Disability MacArthur. They have thought outside the box and identified a more efficient and cost effective structure by cooperating together. They provide a range of services, all from the one location, sharing back-of-house overheads and expenses. Disability MacArthur has created a sort of menu of day plans and activities that NDIS participants can choose from according to their individual preferences. They can even include the transport to and from the activity. Not only is this an efficient way of maximizing the skills and qualifications of the staff but it also provides flexibility in balancing participants' needs and cost effectiveness of services. This is just one example of the innovation we are seeing across the sector. Another important point to mention is the jobs that the NDIS is creating. We estimate that the NDIS will create more than 180,000 new jobs across Australia. More jobs means a better economy. But for this to happen, the NDIS must be properly funded. Labor failed to properly fund the scheme when they had the opportunity. If they are serious about supporting the NDIS, they will support this bill now. Naturally, the growth of the NDIS and the growth of demands on its resources over time will be the greatest challenge to the scheme. As an advocate for this sector it concerns me that those opposite are unable to grasp even the most basic of economic principles: when the money runs out you cannot just keep spending. The savings fund is a fiscally responsible, forward-thinking strategy. However, this is not a revolutionary concept. The Howard government established the Future Fund with the initial objective of financing the superannuation obligations of Commonwealth public servants. The NDIS must provide a level of certainty to maintain public confidence in the capacity of the scheme to fulfil the requirements of those who are reliant on it. This government would be abandoning our duty if we failed to secure the possible sources of revenue for the scheme. The coalition acknowledges the significant financial commitment required for the scheme to reach its maximum potential, and we are taking necessary steps to achieve this. I have mentioned it before and I will mention it again: I am appalled at the economic havoc that drives the opposition-a drive to make a political point regardless of the factsdemonstrated by their failure to properly fund the NDIS when they left office in 2013. They produced a lovely, glossy 2013-14 budget document and they identified savings. Unfortunately, those savings were not specified. And, indeed, at the Senate estimates that year, when Treasury was asked whether these measures could be listed in detail, Treasury's response was no. So even Treasury could not identify where Labor had created these savings, and as I would suggest probably another one out of thin air-their magic pudding approach to economics. In fact, if you look back through their budget you will notice that supposedly they funded the NDIS from their surplus of $1.5 billion. Great, except that in the year they identified a $1.5 billion profit, or surplus, they actually delivered a deficit of $18.8 billionanother Swanny special. The bottom line is they did not provide for NDIS into the future. This is the problem we have now. This government is serious about funding for NDIS, for securing the future and once again we see Shorten using the scare tactics on the most vulnerable people in the community. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the coalition government are committed to funding the full scheme. Like my responsible colleagues, I am delighted to support this bill. By establishing a stable financial platform for the NDIS, we are demonstrating commitment to a scheme that is one of the most important social reforms seen for many years. I am particularly pleased that the fund will draw from underspends from the NDIS and other portfolio savings. As I demonstrated before with that young man with a car that was changed so that he could drive it, whilst that was an up-front expense, it has now over the longer term meant a lower cost to NDIS. Over the next 10 years the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account will be able to receive credits, which will be available to fund the continuing operations of the NDIS. These savings accounts provide a secure mechanism to isolate and preserve these funds so they can be specifically directed to the NDIS. This means that money designated originally to be spent on this sector will remain within it. I look forward to the successful passage of this bill and encourage those opposite to make the responsible choice to support it and to show their commitment to the full funding of NDIS. I commend this bill to the House. were filed in a bookshop, I think it would be in the science fiction/fantasy section-but nevertheless.

I note to the House and draw the House's attention to the fact that I wrote to the Minister for Human Services on 7 October regarding this tragic case and systemic issues arising.

The NDIS is one of the most significant social policy reforms of recent times. It is a remarkable initiative introduced and fully funded by Labor. It joins the list of social policy reforms that will stand the test of the ages. Indeed, it was first proposed through a major inquiry by the Whitlam government. But, unfortunately, as history records, that government was felled before reforms like an NDIS could be fully delivered through legislation. The Hawke and Keating governments instituted Medicare, which those opposite have done their best and continue to do their best to smash. AndI note that a Fraser government refused to back an NDIS or Medicare. This bill purports to allow the Commonwealth to meet its funding obligations in relation to the NDIS. Given Labor had that sewn up three years ago, the very purpose of this bill is redundant and it is a political stunt. It is one more pointless pieces of legislation by a government intent on incremental cuts to social security measures that hit the most vulnerable. If only they would put a fraction of this effort into budget repair that was fair. But, no, sadly, it is no surprise that the Senate inquiry by the government dominated Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended that this bill be passed despite the number of submissions calling every aspect of this bill into question. It built on ominous signs, under this government, of the first stages of the rollout: mounting government stuff ups, the failure to resource the rollout, stuffing the IT rollout, failing to reach agreement with the states on time-although they do seem to have eventually got there-and the outrageous report in the ACT of secret caps on government services. To summarise our concerns with the bill, the first one is the Liberal lie that we left government with the NDIS unfunded. The basis of the bill is deceptively simple. It seeks to establish a special account, and what can be credited to it to fund the operation of the NDIS, but it is a flawed starting point. In 2013 to 2014 Labor set out the funding arrangements for the first 10 years of operation-well past full implementation. There were various reformsand those opposite actually voted for most of them-to the private health insurance rebate; to retirement incomes; an increase in the Medicare levy, which all Australians pay; and a number of other long-term savings measures, most of which were supported by those opposite. They have been clearly outlined and there is no shortfall. Consolidated revenue is used to fund the NDIS in accordance with expenditure priorities. Clearly what is lacking is not the funding that was provided at the time but this government's commitment to the NDIS as a national priority. Listening to the previous speaker, the member for Ryan, I heard much talk of the economy. It is a separate debate to try and explain to those opposite that fiscal management of the budget is actually a separate thing from management of the economy, but that difference is lost on the small-minded bean counters that seemed to populate the ranks opposite. History shows they cannot manage the economy, much as they spend their time focusing solely on the budget. Really, the government's complete mismanagement of the budget is a separate issue and a debate for another day. It is true that the budget situation has deteriorated under this government, with outrageous spending commitments that they did not offset and did not fund. If only they had had the same fiscal discipline as the previous Labor government and the member for Lilley when he was Treasurer, we would not be in this situation. Mr Craig Kelly interjectingMs Ryan interjectingCommission, in its inquiry report Disability care and support, at page 85, recommended: … year to year through the NDIS should be viewed as a core funding responsibility of government and met from claims on general government revenue … That is from the Productivity Commission. In its submission to the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee into this bill, Children and Young People with Disability Australia said, 'This,'-that is, this piece of legislation-'puts funding for the NDIS in a precarious position.' There are two funds for the same purpose, because this bill would muddy rather than clarify funding arrangements for the operation of the NDIS. The Disability Care Australia Fund established by Labor is credited with funding from the 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare levy. So we will have two accounts for the same purpose, if this bill passes-to what end? It is worth noting that the NDIS special account will sit within the Consolidated Revenue Fund, according to the explanatory memoranda, so it is even more pointless. In its submission to the Senate inquiry, Children and Young People with Disability Australia said: … it is critical to recognise the Scheme as a core area of government spending. …… … The need for a 'special account' in addition to the DisabilityCare Australia Fund to hold funds for the NDIS is therefore unclear. Those on this side of the chamber know that the real reason for this legislation is as a further excuse to dismantle the Australian social safety net and to pick on the vulnerable, and to try and park those savings there. It is really no different from the pea-and-thimble trick that is the childcare reforms they introduced recently. It is an excuse to prosecute the 2014 budget which was roundly rejected by the Australian people. It is no surpriseMr Dick: In the back door. measures proposed thus far for possible credit to the special account include $1.5 billion of cuts to welfare recipients. This includes $62 million the government believes that it will get from the conduct of up to 90,000 eligibility reviews of disability support pension recipients as well as 30,000 medical reviews-something that I have raised once or twice before and that we will keep on about. The 2016-17 budget papers note: These measures demonstrate the Government’s ongoing commitment to ensure that those who need assistance receive that assistance, with savings from increased integrity contributing to the sustainability of important welfare programmes such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme …",74,Bills

51,Mr Hill,That is true; exactly. Let the Hansard not record laughter. The Productivity,76,Bills
52,Mr Hill,"That is right-through the back door. It is no surprise that the savingsIt sounds very reassuring, except that these measures relate to people with Down syndrome, the severely intellectually disabled, those with paraplegia and those with multiple diagnoses so impaired by their disability that it was accepted decades ago by the very agencies now conducting the reviews under government duress that they would never work again. This is an extraordinary and avoidable burden on the carers forced to adhere to ridiculous demands for specialists reports, IQ tests and documentation spanning diagnoses that will never change. I wonder whether that $62 million of supposed savings actually takes into account the cost to the budget in Medicare of running around and collecting multiple specialists reports-I would almost bet that they do not, but that is another matter which we are pursuing-or the cost of the staff required to implement this flawed policy. Really, you have to wonder what those opposite actually hope to achieve by linking the conduct of eligibility reviews for the most severely disabled in our society with their capacity to access the NDIS. If the government is serious about reducing welfare fraud it needs to take a much more sophisticated approach to undertaking these reviews and to the selection of targets for budget savings. We have all been talking about and will continue to highlight the matters of the robo-debt scandal. These kinds of measures demonstrate not only the government's commitment to disabled Australians-or lack thereof-but its commitment to the wholesale pillaging of their critical income support. I will quote from another submission to the Senate inquiry, that from Disabled People's Organisations Australia: Creating trade-offs between income support and disability support is counter-productive, short-sighted and does not promote the human rights objectives of the NDIS. It is unconscionable to shift people on low incomes, including people with disability, further into poverty in order to create savings for the NDIS. That is what this government is doing. I will turn to the issues of ministerial responsibility and the governance arrangements. One of the few things that this threeto four-page bill actually does is hand responsibility for determining what is credited to the account to the Minister for Social Services. The explanatory memorandum mentions that the minister: will be solely responsible for the day-to-day policy and management of the special accountand that credits might come from various areas, such as:  underspends and net savings from the NDIS and other portfolio savings, as determined by the Minister for Social Services;  discretionary decisions by the Prime Minister or the Cabinetor decisions by the Prime Minister or the Cabinet about identified savings from other Commonwealth portfolios. This is badly conceived. Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance said in its submission to the Senate inquiry: The fact that the Bill enables the Minister alone to decide ‘deposits’ to the fund; and the PM and Cabinet to make discretionary payments to the fund, make this a poorly designed long term funding mechanism for the scheme. A related problem … is that it casts the NDIS as a program of the Minster rather than a truly independent scheme … This is one of the key reasons the Productivity Commission recommended an insurance model that would be free of the budget related political tussles that plagued the old disability system: … … … … the NDIS needs a funding formula that is transparent, predictable, viable and sufficient. In the Productivity Commission's wide-ranging inquiry into disability care and support, it was noted: … the Insurance Council of Australia … identified four significant sources of managerial risk for a scheme ignorance, self-interest, ideology and political interference. Every single reason comes to pass with this construct and with the passage of this legislation. It is sadly prescient. Yet here is the government, so early into the implementation of the NDIS, proposing to build these very risks directly into the NDIA's external rules, the legislation and the governance model that frame the scheme's operation. This is exactly what the Productivity Commission and those inquiries which informed the scheme said they had to avoid. standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member for Bruce will be given an opportunity at that time. Lyons Electorate: Wombat Sarcoptic Mange outbreak of sarcoptic mange in the north of my electorate, which is affecting the wombat population in the Narawntapu National Park. Ninety four per cent of wombats in the national park have died since 2010, and I am now informed that fewer than 10 animals remain in this national park. These beasts are a wonderful tourism drawcard-many tourists go there to see them-and this a terrible disease. These animals die a slow and painful death. The West Tamar management authority group, a team of volunteers, have been trying to treat the wombats by attaching ice-cream lids with little bits of chemical to their backs, but they need permission from the government. The state government is being held up by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, which is under the remit of the Deputy Prime Minister. Perhaps if that authority spent less time worrying about its future and where it is going to be based over the next few years, it could spend more time on making sure that these animals are treated. There are some wonderful volunteers, like John Harris and Scott Carver, an academic from UTAS, who are trying their hearts out to save these animals. The wombat is a wonderful Australian icon. We need to do better, and we can do better. This government has to step up to the plate and get involved in saving these animals.

Australian Football Women's League sport and for the AFL. At Ikon Park in Carlton we had the very first AFL women's football match. I have to say that I never thought I would stand in this place and say, 'Go the Pies!' I never thought I would stand in this place and say, 'Go the Blues!' But I was one of the few people cheering-on both teams, and there is a very good reason why. Four Bendigo Thunder players took to the field: Jessica Kennedy, Sarah Last, Bella Ayre and Emma Grant. It was actually quite emotional, when the anthem started playing, to see our girls on the main stage of AFL and women's footy. AFL women's footy is growing: it is growing at a grassroots level; it is growing at a community level. There are hundreds of girls and hundreds of women now playing AFL. To think that five years ago we had neither this AFL women's competition nor the domestic competition that underpins it! There is an opportunity now for the federal government to get on board to help the AFL and help women's footy-help to fund the change rooms and the facilities that they need on the ground. We need to support women getting involved in this sport, and it is an opportunity for the Minister for Sport to help out. Goss, Mr Matthew on from the former member's remarks, particularly to encourage women's AFL and particularly to say, 'Go the mighty Dees!' It is, of course, also a great opportunity to get up and recognise one of Goldstein's most outstanding young achievers, Matty Goss. Due to the assistance of his recently awarded Local Sporting Champions grant, Matty was able to compete in the 2017 Australian and Open Optimist Championships in Adelaide this past January. Motivation, dedication and many nights of training at Albert Park after school in the cold and dark have paid off for this grade 6 student, as his campaign was very successful. Matty walked away from the championships qualifying for the Australian International Optimist Under 12s sailing team. That is by any measure a fantastic achievement, particularly at his age. Matty will be representing this great country in New Caledonia in October this year, along with five of Australia's best junior sailors. I am sure all members, regardless of their political affiliation, will join with me, as well as the Goldstein community, in congratulating Matty on his magnificent accomplishment and wishing him all the best in representing our great nation in October this year.",78,Statements By Members

57,Mr Tim Wilson (Goldstein) (13:34,"It is a wonderful opportunity to get up and followVocational Education and Training Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:36): TodayI had the great pleasure of joining the Leader of the Opposition at the ACTION Tuggeranong bus depot to discuss Labor's plans for apprentices and building the trade skills of the future. It was the second time that the opposition leader and I had been to the depot. The first was in 2015 with my dear friend and colleague the former shadow minister for vocational education, the member for Cunningham. Back then we discussed how Labor's trade training centres were providing a pathway to apprenticeships. One of the highlights of today was meeting 16-year-old Renee. Renee completed year 10 at St Mary MacKillop College last year and chose to do her work experience at the bus depot. She loved it so much she decided to become a heavy vehicle mechanic apprentice. Renee is one of 11 apprentices and three ASBAs at the bus depot, but she is the only female. She follows in the footsteps of another female bus depot apprentice who is now working in Darwin, which just goes to show you the options and choice offered by a trade. As the daughter of an electrician and as the former union president of the oldest worker's college in the world, the RMIT, I do not see a trade as something you do if you cannot get into university, and Labor also shares that view. At the National Press Club recently, the opposition leader underscored Labor's commitment to trades and vocational education. Labor has a plan for apprenticeships, skills and vocational education, unlike the Turnbull government, which has cut 130,000 apprenticeships and sees trade and vocational education as second class. Fall of Singapore: 75th Anniversary Commemorations we mark the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore in 1942. That fall marked the end of the Malayan campaign, which had lasted from 8 December 1941 until 15 February 1942. In that campaign some 1,800 Australians were killed or went missing in action, more than 1,300 were injured and wounded, and more than 15,000 Australians were held captive as prisoners of war. Those who surrendered were held at first in the infamous Changi prison at Singapore and were then held in other places throughout Asia, including in Japan itself. Of the 15,000 prisoners of war, more than 8,000 died in captivity through starvation, malnourishment and brutality. We honour their memory today, especially at Ballarat at the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial and the opening of the Garden of the Grieving Mother memorial. Today we recall the sacrifice of the men and women who died, who were injured and who were held as prisoners of war in the most terrible of conditions. We honour their memory and we commemorate their sacrifice. Lest we forget! Melbourne Electorate: Lunar New Year Celebrations 'Xinnian kuaile'.

An extra drawcard this year was summer's newest sport, the first ever pho-eating competition. Congratulations to Meca Ho, the Victoria Street Business Association and to all who contributed to the huge success of this year's festival. It was a pleasure to join the Australian Vietnamese Women's Association in their celebration. I was proud also to secure a grant through the Stronger Communities Program that allowed the AVWA to commission a mural celebrating Vietnamese culture that now has a pride of place in North Richmond. The Yarra Chinese friendship association celebrated the new year with dumplings and music, and many Yarra residents attended. Thanks to Xiao Yue Wang for her ongoing tireless work. I am looking forward to celebrating with the Indochinese Elderly Refugees Association at their annual celebration and lunch in Ascot Vale later this week. And later this month, Collingwood residents from all communities and cultural backgrounds will come together to celebrate the Year of the Rooster with performances and by sharing one of Kim Chua's famous banquets.

Chisholm Electorate: Australia Day Honours Ms BANKS (Chisholm) (13:41): On Australia Day, some very special people related to Chisholm were acknowledged as part of our nation's honours system for the following: Mrs Rosemary Brown for service to international relations through voluntary education roles; Mr Keith Irvine for service regarding community health; Mr Alexander Hehr for service regarding community radio; Mr Bernard Millane for service in local government and to the communities of Whitehorse and Timor Leste; Professor the Hon. Nahum Mushin, a former Family Court judge and professor at Monash University, for his significant service to the judiciary, to family law, to legal education and to the welfare of children; and Professor Evan Simpson of the Hudson Institute of Medical Research for significant service to medical science, particularly in the field of breast cancer. Professor Jane den Hollander, vicechancellor of Deakin University, was honoured for her distinguished service to tertiary education through a range of executive administration and advisory roles as a supporter of professional educational organisations. Mr Christopher Thorn was recognised for his service to the not-for-profit sector through advisory roles on philanthropic strategic planning, and to the community. Lastly, Mr Michael Wells was awarded a Public Service Medal for his outstanding public service through the protection of rights for disadvantaged and vulnerable people in Victoria. I join all Chisholm residents in congratulating these deserving award recipients, and I look forward to hosting them at a morning tea in their honour next week. Dobell Electorate: Gallery Precinct 2259 Love Lanes Festival Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (13:42): The Gallery Precinct 2259 Love Lanes Festival launched in my home town, Wyong, on Saturday, and it was an overwhelming success. Despite the heat, more than 4,500 people came out-including my mum, Barbie-to Bakers Lane, Alison Road and Robley Lane as the town centre transformed into a hub of sound, colour, food and entertainment. Visitors enjoyed performances by local artists including the talented Ella Powell, sampled produce from market stalls, scaled a rock-climbing wall and, as the evening cooled, enjoyed cinema under the stars. I would like to recognise the many local businesses and organisations who helped kickstart this outstanding community event: Coastwide First National real estate, Central Coast Holiday Parks, Design and Opinion communications, EAO Entertainment, Metro Cinemas, Wyong Baptist Church, the Oasis Centre, the chamber of commerce, the Grand Hotel, the Art House, Chapmans Old Store, Coastal Incidental, Allcott Hire, Wyong Neighbourhood Centre, Jendar Interior Design, Glee Coffee Roasters and CFM. I would particularly like to acknowledge Matt and Bronwyn Lusted and Nick Barrett and Cath Austen from the Common Ground cafe, Wyong, for their enthusiastic efforts in pursuing and promoting the festival. I want to give special thanks to Central Coast Council's Julie Vaughan for sharing the community's vision to celebrate our town's history, unique character and vibrant future. I look forward to Love Lanes becoming an annual event. I love Wyong. Mallee Electorate: Sir Winton Turnbull In four days time we will mark the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. Those in the House of Representatives may not know that in 1942, after this event, Hansard was closed and both houses prayed for wisdom. Such was the gravity of the situation. Sir Winton Turnbull, the first member for Mallee-I am the fourth member for Malleewas captured at the fall of Singapore and became a prisoner of war in Changi for 3½ years. He was elected to parliament after coming back from the war and served in the House of Representatives for 26 years as a member of parliament. He was a man of character. But what is interesting is that, as a prisoner of war and then a member of parliament, he was part of the government that formulated trading relationships with Japan. He moved beyond a position of conflict to a position of forgiveness. That trading relationship has cemented 70 years of peaceful relations with Japan. Trade and interaction with countries creates peace. It worries me that around the world some people are promoting agendas that are pushing others away rather than interacting with others. We need to have the character of Sir Winton Turnbull and look at forgiveness and interaction and, ultimately, we will have a more peaceful world as a result. Macquarie Electorate: Hawkesbury Heights Shared Bike Path and Walking Trail Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (13:45): When you live in Hawkesbury Heights, you live in one of the most bush surrounded suburbs in the Blue Mountains-on the escarpment above the Nepean River and overlooking the Hawkesbury and Penrith regions with a clear and quiet view to Sydney. But heaven forbid if you are a mum who wants to push a pram to the lookout or a Dad who wants to take the kids for a bike ride, or if you want to let your children ride to school, or if you are a person with a disability who uses a walking stick or frame for assistance-because, if that is the case, you cannot go anywhere in Hawkesbury Heights without walking on the road. There are only three streets and one happens to be the major north-south thoroughfare, Hawkesbury Road, which cars and trucks make their way along, which means people cannot. That is why the community is desperate for a shared bike path and walking trail to run parallel to Hawkesbury Road and link the community to its own",80,Statements By Members

It is a five-minute drive and a four-kilometre distance. While Labor at a state and federal level has backed the community on this issue, the Liberals have not. Requests for a path to be built were ignored by my predecessor. We are not talking about a major piece of engineering; it would be a crushed granite path, along a route that is still fairly clear from the 2013 fires. It would transform the lives of people who do not deserve to have to take their lives in their hands just to get to school. Young, Mrs Wilma rise to speak on Wilma Young, nursing sister and war hero. She was born in Glenorchy, Victoria on 17 August 1916 and died in Melbourne on 28 May 2001, aged 84. A Woman's War is the book written about Wilma Young. Wilma Young was a customer in my drapery store. She was a farmer's wife. To me, she was a woman who had cred around the community that I could not understand, but that was because of not only her war service but everything that she did after that time. This woman was an amazing activist, even after the tragedy of war that she went through. She was aboard the Vyner Brooke when it was bombed by the Japanese. Her best friend died beside her in the water. She survived that and survived the incarceration of the war. More than that, after she came back to her farm at Cardinia, she lost her 18-year-old daughter to a drunk driver. You would have thought that would have been the end of the story, but Wilma Young then campaigned to have the state laws changed with regard to drink-driving. She was the driving force behind the support of people emerging from the armed forces with post-traumatic disorders. She was one of the early pioneers to support our troops in those times. I was just reminded on the phone by Anne Metherall that, when she had her car accident and Wilma was campaigning for the women's war memorial, Wilma walked into Anne's hospital room and handed her the biggest bunch of flowers she had ever seen. For the whole of her life, Wilma Young protected and looked after other people. Sri Lanka formal diplomatic ties between Australia and Sri Lanka. On4 February, I attended the 69th anniversary of Sri Lanka's independence. Indeed, it is appropriate to remark that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister has been visiting the parliament this week. Australia has a long history of bilateral ties with Sri Lanka, linked as we are by our shared commitment to education, trade and investment, the security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, and one of the positive legacies of British colonialism-this institution of parliament. I was fortunate enough to visit Sri Lanka in January. My trip was a little more eventful than I would have wished because my daughter was hospitalised for much of the time there, but I did enjoy a tour of the parliament and lunch with the Speaker and also catching up and staying with the Muslim family of an exchange student from Sri Lanka whom my family had hosted and learning a little more about how things are in Sri Lanka. The strength of our bilateral ties has been enhanced through our cooperation in multilateral forums over many decades, from the Colombo Plan to the Indian Ocean Rim Association, but it is really the person-to-person contacts that have driven this relationship. From the first recorded migrants of the late 19th century to today's largely skilled intake, the composition of Sri Lankan migrants to Australia has changed over the years.

Skerman, Mr Allan tribute to a resident in my electorate who holds the distinction of being Mackay's last Rat of Tobruk. On hearing the call to arms in 1939, Allan Skerman was among the first Australian volunteers and served in Sierra Leone and Giarabub, where he was wounded, before he was sent to Tobruk. According to the Australian War Memorial, all that stopped the Germans' march on Egypt was the defiant garrison at Tobruk: For eight long months, surrounded by German and Italian forces, the men of the Tobruk garrison, mostly Australians, withstood tank attacks, artillery barrages, and daily bombings. They endured the desert's searing heat, the bitterly cold nights, and hellish dust storms. They lived in dug-outs, caves, and crevasses. Such defiance earned them the title of 'Rats', intended as a slur by the Germans but worn as a badge of honour. Allan Skerman returned to Australia and married Hilda, whom he had met before the war. He went to Cairns to work in the docks for the management of military cargo before joining the Air Force. He later worked for the repatriation department in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria until his later years, when he worked for the archives in Victoria. On Friday, Allan Skerman will celebrate his 100th birthday with his son, four grandchildren and one great-grandson. Family and friends will celebrate Allan's 100 years of golf, fossicking, gem cutting, orchid growing, gardening and writing-he is the author of seven books. But North Queensland will pay special tribute to Allan for his service and the very great honour of being a Rat of Tobruk. Lloyd, Ms Carol my electorate and a trailblazer for rock'n'roll, singer Carol Lloyd. Earlier this week, Carol lost her long-running battle with pulmonary fibrosis and passed away at the Wesley Hospital beside family and friends. Carol was an icon of the seventies rock era who toured with her band Railroad Gin, and supported the likes of AC/DC, Suzi Quatro, Billy Thorpe, Skyhooks, Daddy Cool and the Little River Band. Her first singles, A Matter of Time, Do Ya Love Me/Academy Rock and You Told the World, all charted at No. 1. Later, the Carol Lloyd Band made further Australian rock history by being the first rock band to play the Sydney Opera House. Her contribution to music and the lives of others should not be underestimated, as she became a long-time mentor to young musicians, encouraging the next generation to follow in her footsteps. I am pleased to inform the House that Carol's memory will be commemorated through the Carol Lloyd Award at the Queensland Music Festival. The award will be presented to an emerging female singer-songwriter from Queensland, providing them with the chance to receive funding to help them record an original album or an EP, with accompanying tour.",83,Statements By Members

St George Business Chamber Chamber on their great efforts in my local community. Previously, of course, we had the Hurstville Chamber of Commerce and the Kogarah Chamber of Commerce, but recently they have come together and, under the leadership of Allan Zreik, as the president of the St George Business Chamber, they are going from strength to strength. It is one of the largest business chambers in New South Wales now, and it incorporates not just those very large commercial areas in Hurstville and Kogarah CBDs-two of the largest centres anywhere in Sydney-but also a number of other industrial sites. In my own electorate of course there is the Peakhurst-Mortdale industrial area which employs hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of local residents. And the chamber's reach goes all the way across to Lugarno and the local shopping strip there. The chamber has won a number of awards. It won the Local Chamber of Commerce of the Year Award 2016, and it also shared, with Bondi, the South Eastern Sydney Business Award this year. I would like to congratulate the executive-Allan Zreik, Carlos Zeidan and Tony Baddour-and everyone who is involved in the St George Business Chamber. This is an organisation that is going forward at a great speed, and it is a great testament to all those involved. Workplace Relations confirmed it had abandoned any due process when it gagged debate on the ABCC legislation. They sought to rush the bill through this place-and, in the process, prevented local members like me from voicing legitimate concerns, on behalf of hard working people in Corio, about this legislation and the bad deal it represents for workers and businesses. Just today, the Geelong Advertiser reports that Victorian building regulators will be in the region doing inspections, noting that seven people died at work during 2016 across Geelong and the Colac-Otway region. Indeed, in the greater Geelong area more than 80 workplace incidents were being reported every month. Everyone in this place knows that workplace safety got worse under the ABCC. It hit a 10year high in 2007, when 51 people lost their lives at work. Indeed, the same story is true in relation to productivity: it did not go as fast as it had when the ABCC did not exist. This government would put Australian workers at risk for the sake of nothing other than ideology.

I would like to acknowledge the member for Corangamite and the members for Shortland, Newcastle, Gippsland and Petrie who played today.

Child Care on child care so that they can go to work. Those opposite have irresponsibly put at risk these families in Dunkley, and families across Australia who use child-care providers, by blocking the omnibus bill-savings that would have funded the coalition government's child-care reforms. These reforms would mean a subsidy of 85 per cent for families earning under $65,000, abolishing the rebate cap of $7,500 for families earning up to $185,000 as well as increasing to $10,000 the rebate cap for families above that amount. My office and I have been working with a local constituent Tamara, who is the primary carer for her grandson. Around Christmas time, Tamara was facing the prospect of losing her job if she could not place her grandson in child care. The government's legislation will give people like Tamara the chance to choose a high-quality child-care provider, to continue going to work and to increase their time at work.

It was a shattering moment. Australians had believed the might of the Royal Navy and the guns of Singapore's island fortress would keep it safe. Its fall began, as Curtin said, 'the battle for Australia'. Almost 1,800 Australians died and more than 1,300 were wounded in the fight for Malaya and the defence of Singapore. Just before Christmas, believing Singapore was impregnable, the Curtin government sent further reinforcements, including 1,900 virtually untrained recruits. Samuel Pond, commanding the 2/29th Battalion, learned to his horror that the men he received had been in uniform for only one month, and half of that time had been spent on the boat from Australia. Between8 and 15 February 1942, the 8th Division battled to hold back the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula. Eventually, fought back to Singapore and with water supplies cut and most of the island's defences overrun, at 8.30 pm, by order of their British commander, General Arthur Percival, 130,000 troops, including 15,000 Australians, surrendered to the Japanese. Just two days before the battle, John Gorton, posted to Singapore with 232 Squadron, RAF, had evacuated the city. Of course, most did not make it out. We remember the former members and senators who were prisoners of the Japanese, including Tom Uren, a minister in the Whitlam government, and Alexander Downer, a minister in the Menzies government. In total, more than 22,000 Australians captured in the defence of Malaya, Singapore and the Dutch East Indies between December '41 and March '42 became prisoners of war. More than 8,000 of them died in captivity. The cruelties inflicted on our prisoners of war were horrific: murders, beatings, starvation and neglect-war crimes that left a tragic toll and a bitter legacy. One of those prisoners of war was Norman Womersley, father of my stepmother, Judy. She was six when he died, just before the war's end, on the island of Ambon, starved and sick like so many others who had been flung into battle in January 1942 barely trained, only a few months after they had enlisted. I remember well another prisoner of war from Singapore who did return and was a big part of my young life, George Daldry. He was a bit of a legend, actually-captured at the age of 16 and imprisoned in Changi, where he saw his brother murdered by the guards. George returned to become the best sports fitness and conditioning expert in Australia, from his base at City Tattersalls Club training national teams and those athletically ambitious, like me and my father, who joined his runs and workouts in Centennial Park. George was always obsessive about cleanliness and fitness. I remember him telling me with a very deep intensity how that obsession kept him alive in those dark days of cruel captivity. Whole families were involved, like the Colenso family from Kingsford. Four brothers enlisted in the 2/18th Battalion on the same day, 1 July 1940, and sailed for Singapore the",86,Statements By Members

70,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:01): Seventy-five years ago,following year. When the Japanese landed, the Colenso brothers were stationed on the north-west coast. Of those four brave boys, 23-year-old Ray was killed in action on 9 February and his 31-year-old brother, Bill, died two days later. Their brothers Frank and Ted were both captured after the fall of Singapore and endured terrible miseries as prisoners of war. Thankfully, both returned home in 1945. Australians who died in Singapore and those buried at Changi and other prison camps now have their final resting place in Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore. This week also marks the sinking of the Vyner Brooke by Japanese bombers. It was carrying evacuees from Singapore, mostly women and children, as well as the last 65 Australian nurses on the island. Many of the survivors who landed on Radji Beach after the sinking were then massacred by the Japanese. Twenty-two Australian nurses were forced into the sea and shot in the back. The only nurse who survived was the South Australian Sister Vivian Bullwinkel. This was the single biggest loss of Australian nurses in wartime. Within days of Singapore's fall, the Japanese would bomb Darwin, bringing Australia under direct attack for the first time. On SundayI will join the Governor General and the people of Darwin to mark the 75th anniversary of the first of many air raids on Northern Australia during the war. For Australians at the time, it must have felt like the beginning of the end. But, just three months later, Australian and American forces were fighting together to halt Japan's momentum in the Coral Sea. Soon after that was the Battle of Midway, the turning point of the Pacific War. Fighting through the jungle of Kokoda, Japanese invincibility was exposed for the fraud that it was. American strategic power became the sheet anchor for what became a shared regional commitment to a rules based system which brought peace, relative tranquillity and the greatest burst of prosperity that the world has ever seen. The Republic of Singapore plays a crucial role in this shared effort, and Australia, Japan and Singapore work side by side as friends and partners in securing prosperity, peace and stability in our region. In an age where ancient enmities seem to re-emerge to stoke conflict around the world, it is remarkable that it was the generation who fought and suffered in the war against Japan who in 1957 entered into the Commerce Agreement with Japan, which has been the foundation of our strong and growing economic and strategic partnership. What a generation-fearless as they gave their all to fight against a cruel and overwhelming enemy and then, war won, foe vanquished, they were able to forgive. Lest we forget. Minister for his words then. The fall of Singapore changed Australia forever. Singapore had been a pillar of Australia's defence policy, our foreign policy, our sense of security. It was an invincible garrison. It was an impregnable fortress of British might and naval power. And yet it was swept aside within 10 weeks of the war in the Pacific. The unthinkable had happened. There are many dates which contribute, I think, to the formation of the identity of Australia, but there can be no doubt that 1942 was a very significant milestone in the identity of Australia. The fall of Singapore changed the way we saw ourselves, changed our sense of security in the region. A relatively new nation, we had worried about what might happen to the north of Australia, but in 1942 it became real. It did, as the Prime Minister eloquently said, scar the lives of a generation of Australians. Unimaginable numbers of Australians were",87,Statements On Indulgence
71,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (14:08): I thank the Primekilled-unimaginable in our modern concept. Many more were wounded. And 15,000 servicemen were taken prisoner, along with Army nurses. One in three of those who were captured would not survive the brutal nightmare of torture, starvation, cruelty, backbreaking labour, abuses and indignities great and small, and those who did came home marked forever by what they had endured. There were the ulcers and the amputations, the disease and the malnutrition, but then of course there were the wounds that did not show-the psychological trauma, the grief, the memory of a mate's pain. The BurmaThai Railway runs straight through the heart of this nation, and, even as the veterans pass, its shadow lingers still. Frankly, that anyone survived is a miracle of the human spirit. That so many of our men and women came home is a tribute to the resilience of their spirit and I think also the depth of loyalty they showed to their brothers. Far from home, and a world away from the war they had imagined, there was nevertheless a profound Australian quality to their solidarity. In the great Tom Uren's words, the fit looked after the sick, the young looked after the old, the rich looked after the poor. There was a greatness in those Australians-kindness in another's trouble, courage in their own. Seventy-five years ago John Curtin told the people of this nation, 'The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia.' He said that we would put aside the pangs as to the traditional links or kinship with Britain. Instead, in our darkest hour, Curtin declared that Australia would speak for ourselves, we would plan for our own defences and we would, in Curtin's words, fight and work as we had never worked and fought before. Whilst we sit here in this parliament, I think all of us do not underestimate the difficulty and the courage that that decision took, or the magnitude of the shift in the national mind set. Less than three years earlier, Robert Menzies had said, 'Great Britain is at war; therefore Australia is at war.' But now, with invasion on the doorstep, with Japanese bombs to rain on Darwin within the week, with Australia threatened in a way barely contemplated at the beginning of the war, Curtin spoke for an Australian identity that was more than an outpost of empire. He spoke for a proud and independent people determined to defend their continent. He stood up to Churchill. He dealt with Britain not as a colony talking to its mother country but in the honest language of equals. It was the forerunner of that significant decision to bring the 9th Division home in December 1942. 'We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces,' he said. 'We know the constant threat of invasion. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go.' Seventy-five years ago Australia faced its sternest test. Our people rose to it. The heroism of those times belongs to those who lost everything in the prison camps except their love for their fellow man. In a system designed to break the body and try the soul, they came through, not just fending for themselves but caring for each other. I think all of us, when we have read about or spoken to survivors, have wondered, 'How could they have got through?' In the face of cruelty beyond the realm of humanity, these men showed the very best of Australia. All of us salute their courage. All of us honour their memory.

Will the Prime Minister withdraw his $50 billion tax cut for big business instead of threatening to increase the taxes of every Australian? would be more persuasive in the case he puts if he had not been so eloquent in defending the case for cutting company tax. There has never been a better and more succinct case put for them than by the Leader of the Opposition when he said, 'Lowering company tax will increase productivity, investment and employment.' Well, we are all in favour of that. That is what he said, and he did not just say it once-he did not go as far as the member for McMahon, who wrote a book about it, I have to say-but the Leader of the Opposition, again and again, went out there talking about the importance of cutting company tax. He was very precise about that, but he has not been so precise on another matter today. Not even the indefatigable Sabra Lane of the ABC could get him to tell us what his Renewable Energy Target would cost. Four times she asked him, and he could not answer the question. He refused to answer the question. It was as though he was hit with a horror of having to face up to his own recklessness. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition this: the people of South Australia know what a 50 per cent renewable target would look like led by a Labor government. They have 40 per cent, and they cannot keep the lights on. That is the reality in South Australia. Business on a point of order. Mr Burke: On direct relevance: the question deals with taxation policy, it deals with the company tax policy and it deals with the government talking about putting higher taxes on other Australians.

But the subject of the question was on taxthat is correct. The Prime Minister has the call. advocate for cutting company tax. We all know he says one thing to one group and another thing to another. Mark Latham wrote about it. Privately, to Latham, as opposition leader, the Leader of the Opposition was all in favour of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, but he said, 'You can't say that to the workers.' So when he was talking to the members of the AWU he was all against it. You see, the problem is you never know what he stands for.",88,Statements On Indulgence

88,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:21): I thank the member for Dunkleybills, and what we have seen in South Australia-thanks to the Labor Party's crazy devotion to left ideology instead of practical planning and engineering-is the most expensive and the least reliable electricity in Australia. We know today that the Leader of the Opposition advocates a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, and he was asked four times today, on the ABC, what it would cost. He could not and would not answer the question. Again and again he ran away from the facts, but Sabra Lane pressed on. She was absolutely indefatigable, but he would not give her an answer, until finally she summed up with the attitude that most Australians have with the Leader of the Opposition: ' Mr Shorten, we're out of time.' That is all she could say. The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party are bumbling around in the dark, and leaving Australians in the dark, about the single biggest threat they are posing right now to jobs and households in Australia. They are proposing to inflict on the Australian people precisely what Jay Weatherill has done to South Australia and what he described as his 'great experiment'. He called it a 'great experiment'. We know what has happened. The experiment has failed. The lights went out. Electricity prices went up. Industries are threatened with closure. People are threatened with losing their jobs. The fact is that it was a trifecta of blunders by the Leader of the Opposition on the radio today. He was asked how he would pay for the NDIS, and he could not answer that question either. He was asked how he could ensure that outcomes in schools improve-because we know we have been spending more on education and the results are getting worse-and all he could say was, 'Spend more money.' He has no ability to answer these basic questions that are being put to him. How are you going to protect the jobs, the businesses, the households of Australia, when you are proposing to inflict debt and deficit and rising power bills and unreliable power? That is what comes from the Labor Party's ideological approach to economics. They failed in South Australia and they would fail Australia if they ever occupied this side of the House. Taxation reports today that the Treasurer is threatening to increase taxes on all Australians.

That is what they are saying. That is their policy prescription. But I note that, at the last election, despite the fact that the shadow Treasurer said that he was going to increase taxes on housing, that he was going to increase taxes more broadly and that all of these taxes that he was going to increase were going to balance the budget, well, he spent more, he taxed more and then the deficit was higher-$16½ billion more in debt. So he has the trifecta of higher taxes, higher debt and higher spending. It is no wonder that, when the Australian people heard that plan from the opposition at the last election, they rejected it-and so here we stand now. When the opposition sat on these benches, they set fire to the budget, drove it into deficit and drove us back into debt. They now have the opportunity to mend their ways and support the savings bills to ensure that our welfare system is affordable and that Australians do not have to pay a higher tax to pay for higher spending. SoI invite those opposite to mend their ways, to support the government, and ensure that the savings bills pass this parliament to ensure that the budget can return to balance, by getting expenditure under control, rather than the prescription of those opposite, which is always to just keep hitting the tax button.

99,The Speaker,"The member for Moreton will leave under 94(a).Treasurer-and he will remember these words; they were wise words. In 2010 at the National Press Club, he said in relation to the release of the Intergenerational report: Faced with these budget challenges, we essentially have three options. We can cut government services or increase taxes; we can allow budget pressures to build and leave the problem for future generations to deal with; or we can take steps now to grow our economy. We are actually following that advice-at least on this one occasion, when it comes to the member for Lilley-in ensuring that we deal with the challenge of fiscal consolidation and we grow our economy by supporting lower rates of tax for businesses so they can employ more Australians, so they can reinvest in their companies and so they can take themselves forward. But those opposite have a very different approach. What they are doing is standing in the way of getting the budget back into balance, by refusing to expect a government to be able to get expenditure under control. They refuse to acknowledge that our spending must be affordable and that you just cannot keep running up the bill and expecting others to pay for it. Those opposite are like a father and/or mother taking their kids out for a dinner, and they order up big and order everything they can-put it on the table; put it on the table-and then, before the bill comes, they walk out the door and they do a runner, leaving the kids to pay the bill. The Leader of the Opposition is used to people picking up the bill for him when it comes to his dining expenses, but our children should not have to pick up the bill for those opposite, who want to keep running up the bill. We think that spending should be affordable. We think we should be able to get that in order. We simply ask those opposite to not tax future generations of Australians because they, those opposite, cannot get control of expenditure. Pauline Hanson's One Nation Prime Minister. I refer to his earlier answers, where he has defended his industry minister describing One Nation as 'more sophisticated'. One Nation in Western Australia has now said the gay community across the world has developed a covert mind-control program to campaign for marriage equality, 'using many of the strategies developed for the Soviets and then the Nazis'.

It advocates de-industrialising Australia. AndI do not believe the Labor Party agrees with any of those policies. The fact of the matter is that in a preferential system, parties will reach preference deals in order to maximise their chances of success. The Labor Party has done that, and the coalition parties have done that, too. I might draw to the honourable member's attention, if he has not seen it, the extraordinary, threatening speech of Senator Kim Carr in the Senate today-where he threatens-directly-Senator Hinch over an alleged preference deal that the Labor Party did with Senator Hinch, in which he claims that Senator Hinch had agreed to certain untold matters on industrial law.

In regional areas when we have a bushfire, our power is often cut. No power in a few hours means no mobile phone network. There is no legislative requirement for telcos to provide extended battery backup in mobile towers. Does the Prime Minister agree that high-risk bushfire areas need such protection? And if so, what will the government do to help keep our regional communities' telecommunications safe? for her question. The issue of providing battery backup to mobile phone base stations is one that is well understood. Batteries are generally provided for all of that type of mobile equipment. The issue is, how long can the batteries run? And there are obviously limitations on the scale there. But I will ask the minister representing the Minister for Communicationswho managed the mobile phone blackspots program in the last parliament, when he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications. He managed that and did an outstanding job of it. An opposition member interjectingthat in the six years of Labor government, not one cent was spent on addressing mobile phone blackspots, whereas we are addressing hundreds and hundreds of them across Australia. member for Mayo for her question; she is absolutely right to make the point that it is very important that we have-to the maximum extent possible-redundancy in reliability in telecommunications networks, both fixed and mobile. And that includes robustness in the face of emergencies such as bushfires, which can, obviously, have an impact on the network and can also have an impact on individuals in their homes. So there are a number of principles that underpin the approach that the government is taking. One of those is to get the maximum degree of redundancy between fixed and mobile networks. If you are in a location which only has one network, you are more vulnerable than if you are in a location which has both a fixed network and a mobile network. That is the reason why the Turnbull government is committed to the Mobile Black Spot Program, with some 499 base stations to be delivered just under round 1 of that programMr Rob Mitchell interjectingpreviously. Now we on this side of the House regard that as a priority. We are strongly committed to improving mobile communications in rural and regional Australia. Labor is indifferent. Labor committed not one dollar in six years to improving mobile communications in regional and remote Australia, and that is because they are much more concerned about the inner city than they are about rural and regional and remote Australia.

We are finding dairy sheds now that have to go onto diesel generators. They are going off the grid because the policy of the Labor Party is so incomprehensible in being able to deliver an outcome in milking cows.

Today the Financial Review reports that the Treasurer said Labor needs to suggest alternative revenue measures. How can the Treasurer possibly not know that, for more than a year now, Labor has been calling for reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax, which deliver the budget more than $37 billion over the medium term? would be aware that was not in direct quotes. WhatI was saying yesterday is those opposite need to identify the other ways that this can be afforded. Those opposite, I am very well aware, have got lots of ideas about how to increase taxes, because that is what they are the party of. They are the party of higher taxes, higher spending, higher debt, higher deficit. That is the record. That is their record on every single location. What they failed to do in government when they set out their expenditure years into the future, well beyond the forward estimates, as we know, is to fund those increases in expenditure, and in particular when it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme they failed and left an open and empty promise to the people of Australia about how the NDIS would be funded. We know that the funding gap from 2019-20 rises from $4.1 billion up to, in 2024-25, $6 billion a year. But I note that those opposite said yesterday, 'Oh no, we had this funded by other savings'-unspecified savings. You will not find those savings specified anywhere at all on how that was to be funded. SoI ask a question: how the gap was to be funded, not by the Medicare levy or the NDIS levyJagajaga.

I cannot hear the minister answering the question when he is interjecting in some exchange across the chamber, probably with the member for Shortland, I suspect. It will cease or they will continue their conversation outside the chamber. I am being very clear about that. the crisis engulfing the South Australian energy supply. They described it as 'a hiccup' in the case of the member for Port Adelaide and as 'an experiment' in the case of the South Australian Premier. But the energy supply crisis in South Australia is hurting real people and real businesses. Last ThursdayI talked about the effect at Osborne South and North of the failure to be able to guarantee power and the fact that the Australian taxpayer is going to have to spend $20 million to supply power to build submarines and ships at Osborne South and Osborne North; so the Australian taxpayer is being impacted. Real businesses are desperately worried about their businesses and about their employees. Let me give you a couple of examples. Vili Milisits is very famous in South Australia and would be very well known to the member for Adelaide and others in this place as Vili from Vili's pies and cakes. He has been in business for decades, he has been an exporter for decades and he employs 300 people in Adelaide. He bought his own generator to supply diesel-generated power for Vili's pies and cakes. He said last week, 'I don't believe in anything anymore. We've got to be self-sufficient. I am an international business. I cannot have no power.' Haigh's Chocolates is another very famous South Australian business. It is still run by Alister Haigh and his family, who visited us here in Canberra yesterday, and they employ 500 South Australians. He said, 'We are seriously looking at putting in a generator, which is quite ironic because it will be diesel-powered, so when the wind generation stops we will be firing up dirty diesel generators to give us power.' He gets it, and Vili Milisits gets it. A man called John Konstandopoulos from Apex Steel Supplies, who was also here yesterday, said: 'We had plans to put in new machinery. Those plans have been put on hold.' He employs 100 people. These are real businesses employing real people who cannot make investment decisions in South Australia because our electricity prices are too high and the supply is not reliable. If the Labor Party will not listen to the government, will not listen to AEMO and will not listen to the experts, will they please listen to the businesses that are hurting in my great state, because we need all the help we can get in South Australia. We do not need to be saddled with high electricity prices and unreliable power because of Labor's ideological obsessions. (Time expired)",97,Questions Without Notice

When you look at what this government does, we are creating jobs for Australians, we are helping families and businesses; we are not pursuing an ideological policy such as the opposition leader is which is resulting in communities paying higher electricity prices and small businesses putting off people from those businesses, because they cannot be guaranteed an electricity supply, and Australians get this. They understand the difference between this dodgy Leader of the Opposition and this side of the House, which is undertaking public policy which is resulting in job growth. There is a program that we operate in this country, which is the 457 visa program, and it means that, if we cannot fill an Australian job with an Australian worker-and that is the absolute priority of this government. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition is walking off, because I am about to go to the time when he was issuing a record number of 457 visas. We want to put Australians first. We want Australians into jobs, and that is what the Labor Party says they want to do. That is what this Leader of the Opposition said he wanted to do when he was employment minister, but it was very different when he was employment minister because his actions do not match his words. We saw that, when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister, when the Labor Party was in government-and I reported this to the House yesterday-one of the most remarkable statistics was the number of electricians that were granted 457 visas under the Labor Party, an increase of 400 per cent, to fill jobs that surely could have been filled by Australians. On closer examination, it seems that there may have been some sense in the Leader of the Opposition's approach, because I presume that many of those electricians were trained in the use of generators. This was great foresight by the Leader of the Opposition to bring in a record number of electricians, because they are in hot demand-they are in hot demand in South Australia where the Labor Party there has turned off the lights and where other Labor Party administrations around the country are seeking to drive up electricity prices and punish pensioners because pensioners cannot afford to turn on the fans, let alone the air conditioners. But it was great foresight from the Leader of the Opposition to bring in these electricians because, if he becomes Prime Minister of this country, there will be many more electricians",99,Questions Without Notice

Mr Joyce interjectingMs Ryan interjecting Mr Gosling interjectingLalor and the member for Solomon are warned! The member for McMahon has the call. Welfare Reform confirm that in the last week he has introduced a bill with cuts to families, pensioners, carers and new mums; held child care and the National Disability Insurance Scheme to ransom; and threatened to increase taxes on all Australians or make further cuts-all while persisting with his $50 billion worth of big business tax cuts. Doesn't this show the Treasurer is incompetent and out of touch? given by the Reserve Bank governor last Thursday night when he made it very clear that what we need in this country is a competitive business tax system and ensure that we have fiscal consolidation. We need to do these things together, not instead of. They need to be done together, and that is what was in the budget we handed down in May, and these are the measures that we have brought into this House. These were the proposals that were indeed recommended by the member for Lilley. In that same speech I referred to before, he also said: Government spending that seemed affordable during the period of largesse prior to the global crisis may not be affordable over the longer term. So, those on this side of the House understand: when spending raises to a particular level which cannot be sustained into the future, then you need to get your spending under control. On this side of the House, we understand that the real commitments that we want to make to ensure that there is affordable child care for Australian families and that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is fully funded, not left by an empty promise by those opposite. We make no apologies for doing the hard work that is necessary to ensure that these things deliver these important impacts for Australian families, that makes these things affordable and gives them the reliance for the future are done. Those opposite think you can just keep running up the bill without ever having to pay for it. They think you can just keep putting the bill on your children, on the credit card and just let it run off forever. Those mock opposite every time. I raise the issue that they want to spend more money on welfare and send the bill to their kids. If you want to raise spending on welfare and keep it at higher levels, at least have the courage to insist that the generation that you say wants that higher welfare also pays for it and don't send the bill to the children of the future on their credit cards. What we should be doing is giving the next generation a platform to spring off, not a debt burden that hangs around their neck, because those opposite cannot get over their addiction to spending. What that means is: they are addicted to higher taxes, but even then their taxes can never keep up with their appetite for spending. That is why at the last election",100,Questions Without Notice

It is no surprise that the Australian people rejected this Leader of the Opposition and rejected that shadow Treasurer at the last election. Economy Investment. Will the minister please outline to the House the importance of investment to create jobs and ease cost-of-living pressures for all Australians. Is the minister aware of any threats to investment opportunities? the member for Petrie for his question. I know he is particularly concerned about jobs and easing the cost-of-living pressures in his community, as indeed we all are. He is a very good member, the member for Petrie. In fact he got a swing to him at the last election, which reinforces how in touch he is with his electorate. He has done an outstanding job, and I congratulate him. Investment is crucial to making sure that Australia continues to see improvement in terms of job opportunities and, of course, reduction in cost-of-living pressures. In fact, as a country, we have the sixth largest landmass in the world and the 13th biggest economy, and we rank only 52nd by population. As a large country with a small population, we are always going to be generating more opportunities for investment than we can personally fund as a country in our own right. Investment has played a critical role. For the last 25 years of Australia's uninterrupted economic growth-and we are into our 26th now-we have relied on investment, with a big chunk of that coming in the form of foreign investment. Thirty-seven per cent of Australia's top 2,000 companies are foreign owned, with some $1.1 trillion in assets and revenue of some $630 billion. And, of course, they pay a substantial amount of company tax. They employ more than 700,000 Australians, so they certainly play a very critical role. We know from modelling that every billion dollars of investment will generate around 1,000 jobs for Australians. Making sure that investment flows and that we keep downward pressure on the cost of living is crucial to making sure that we keep electricity prices down. We know that households are concerned about their bills. Households are concerned to know what the next bill is going to look like. There are a few on the other side of the House who would like to know what the next bill is going to look like as well-perhaps the member for Sydney and the member for Grayndler are wondering about the next bill-but we on this side of the chamber are concerned with making sure that we are dedicated to prudent economic management. What we know about the Labor side is that not just are they good at blackouts; Labor are also very good at black holes. It is blackouts and black holes that are Labor's specialties, and we saw it in their approach this morning. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked on radio how he was going to pay for the NDIS, he had no response. When he was asked four times how Labor were going to pay for their renewable energy target, he had no response. It seems the Labor Party think they can buy their way out of their financial problems with counterfeit bills, but counterfeit bills are not a strategy for government. The member opposite can sit there with his 'resting Bill face', pretending he is not paying attention, but we know the facts about what it is that Labor will do.",101,Questions Without Notice

Is the Prime Minister aware that the Perth Freight Link will not actually take freight to the port but instead stop three kilometres short of it? Why is this discredited project a priority for the Prime Minister, instead of expanding public transport in Perth through the the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because this is a government-the TurnbullJoyce government-which is getting on with the job of delivering right around Australia. We have a $50 billion infrastructure investment program right around Australia: in Perth, in Melbourne, in Sydney, in Brisbane and right throughout regional Australia through our regional highway programs, and in our small rural and remote towns as well. It is a $50 billion infrastructure investment program which is changing lives and saving lives. It changes lives, a project like Roe 8, the Perth Freight Link project. It will deliver freight in an efficient way to the port. It will improve safety for the community of Perth and the broader Western Australian community in terms of getting a number of heavy vehicles, which are a great cause of concern for the local community, off the suburban streets. The Australian government has committed in the order of $1.2 billion to the Perth Freight Link project.

Dementia and may I congratulate you, Ken, on your appointment and say that it is a privilege to ask you this first question. Will the minister update the House on action the government is taking to address the impact of dementia within our community? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? (15:07): I thank the member for Bennelong for his ongoing interest in this issue. As he is aware, over 350,000 Australians experience dementia, and I appreciate his commitment to the work that we are doing around this area. I was disappointed this morning to see a statement from Labor indicating that support for a national strategy delivering a coordinated approach to dementia has been missing under the Turnbull Liberal government and that the work that we are currently doing is just paper. I want to share with you that we are working very closely with the sector, including Alzheimer's Australia and, in particular, Marie McCabe, who now brings a wealth of experience to Alzheimer's Australia, to co-design solutions and responses in the way that we treat Australians living with dementia and those in residential care. In particular, I want to indicate that in 2015 our government announced the first national strategy for dementia. We have been in the process of implementing that, in concert with those who are committed to making a difference. It is anticipated that in early 2017 we will release the new National Strategic Framework for Chronic Conditions, which will move away from a disease-specific approach and provide a high level of guidance to facilitate a more effective and coordinated national response to chronic conditions, including dementia and its risk factors. We have continued with our work around research, with a $200 million grant and funding initiatives through the NHMRC to undertake further research into the underlying causes of dementia, in order to find a cure in the long term that will alleviate the pressure that individuals and, in particular, family members experience. This year, in 2016-17, we are spending $52.2 million on dementia-specific support programs. These include a suite of dementia consumer support services delivered by Alzheimer's Australia, which includes a helpline, information counselling, early intervention courses, career education and awareness-raising activities.

The Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service provides support to aged-care workers, health professionals and family carers who need help in caring for someone who is experiencing the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. In addition, I want to compliment previous health ministers on our side who have committed to the work that we are undertaking with dementia and to the work that we are doing to make sure that we provide a better future and better opportunity for those experiencing and living with dementia. Perth Freight Link see Mr Wyatt get to answer his first question. My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The government has punished Victorians for electing a Labor government by short-changing Victorians on infrastructure funding, with Victoria receiving eight per cent of federal infrastructure funding despite having 25 per cent of the nation's population. Why is the Prime Minister now holding West Australians hostage by threatening to withhold $1.2 billion of federal infrastructure funding because a future Labor government would not proceed with the discredited Perth Freight Link? Mr Craig Kelly interjectingclearly overlooked the fact that Western Australia is a great exporting state and that it needs the infrastructure to get its exports to the market and to the port, and the Perth Freight Link is doing that. The honourable member seems to overlook the fact that strong support for the Perth Freight Link is coming from the business community. The business leaders in Perth recognise that it is going to give the economic infrastructure that that state needs. The honourable member should remember too that Western Australia has carried an enormous part of the export burden for Australia. It is a state that has had the benefit of a big boom, but it is going through tough times. It needs strong investment in its economic infrastructure, and that is what we are delivering. Energy Security Environment and Energy. I again raise the issue of electricity, because South Australia is in such a state of crisis. Will the minister outline to the House the action the government is taking to responsibly integrate renewable energy into the market while still ensuring energy security and affordability for hard working Australians? How would an alternative approach jeopardise energy security and affordability? thank the member for Grey for his question and note that last night he made a very passionate speech in this place about the instability and the high prices in South Australia.

That is why we have charged Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, to come up with a blueprint for reform to tell us how we can do it better. In the Prime Minister's talk about pumped hydro, he said we have invested record amounts in storage, and we are also looking to create new markets for frequency control and ancillary services and for the inertia that is normally provided by baseload power, which the market needs to stabilise. I was also asked: am I aware of any alternative approaches? We know that this morning the Leader of the Opposition was embarrassed on AM when four times he could not answer the question of how much his renewable energy target would cost and what the burden would be on consumers. You would think that it was the first time he had heard that question, but if you go back to 22 July 2015, when he announced his policy, he was asked-four times as wellhow much his would policy cost. This is what he had to say: How are you going to pay for this? That was the question. Well… the rest of the world's already moving on renewable energy. The question came: Sure but how are you going to pay for it Mr Shorten? He said: I hear your question but I'm just going to the issue which is at the heart of it. Then he was asked again: 'But you complained about the carbon price. They said it would put up costs. What about your policy?' He said it would not do that at all. And then fourth: What sort of savings for households does your modelling show that this will bring forward? Mr Shorten replied: … we think it is important that a political party is up-front with the Australian people. That was the policy. But, of course, not everyone in the opposition got the memo not to talk about the cost. The poor member for Cowan got up in this place yesterday and said Labor's election policy of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 would require-wait for it-$48 billion. She belled the cat. She said what the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to say. She told the truth. It will cost every Australian household $5,000. It will cost every Australian man, woman and child $2,000.

Specifically, he asserted that an agreement reached by the AWU with Visy Industries took away the maternity rights of workers who had worked for that business. This is completely false. So far, I understand the Leader of the House has been unable to provide any evidence to journalists to support this falsehood. This is because, in 1999, unpaid maternity leave for 52 weeks was included for workers under the agreement and, in 2002, unpaid maternity leave for 52 weeks was included for workers under the agreement. There was no reduction in maternity leave arrangements. The Leader of the House has been caught out. I expect now that the facts are clear that the minister will withdraw. He has misled the House.

One is that they do not know that the Perth Freight Link project does not even go to the port. It stops three kilometres short. This is a $1.2 billion investment in freight transport infrastructure to a port, but it does not get there; it stops three kilometres short and vehicles will have to go through the suburbs of Fremantle in order to get the freight to the port. But it is worse than that because it is a road near a port that is at full capacity. We know that the port will be at full capacity in 2022, which is why the outer harbour is so important. The new port is what is critical if we are going to deal with exports and imports in the west. That is why during the election campaign we committed to fund the planning for that port project.

161,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (15:18,"We just saw, writ large in question time, theOf course, this is nothing new for the people of Western Australia. When we were in government, we engaged in the largest ever road project in Western Australia, the Gateway WA project. It was promised, funded and built on our watch, and yet those opposite came along at the end to the ribbon cutting, having opposed the nation-building program and the economic stimulus, and tried to suggest that they had something to do with it. It is not just that. When you land at Perth and leave the airport, the first road you go on is the Great Eastern Highway. It was widened and upgraded by Labor. If rather than east you go west, you will hit the work that is taking place on the Swan Valley Bypass, which is now called NorthLink under this government. Giving a road a new name does not make it a new road. It is the Swan Valley Bypass and it was funded by the former Labor government. We understand that to deal with urban congestion you do not just need roads; you need rail lines as well. We invested in the Perth City Link project. It was promised, funded, built and opened under federal Labor. Those opposite talk about value capture. This project is a great example of value capture in action. You use the area where the road has been built to build the railway underneath and then you develop on top, to reunite the Perth CBD with the Northbridge entertainment precinct. It is a great example of Labor vision, Labor being engaged in urban policy and Labor being engaged in making our cities more productive, more sustainable and more livable. We are not just engaged in cities, of course. We did the Great Northern Highway, the North West Coastal Highway, the work around Port Hedland, the work in Kalgoorlie, the Esperance port access road and the work around Bunbury-all delivered as part of the $6.9 billion that we put into Western Australia. We took investment from the Howard government's $92 per Western Australian to $261 per Western Australian-we tripled the infrastructure investment, because we understood that transport infrastructure was critical. But of course we also did the National Broadband Network. We also did the support for hospitals. We also did the support for every school in Western Australia, because we understood that that was important. At the last election there was a battle that will be played out on 11 March, which is: do you put money into a road to a port that is at full capacity, a road that does not even get to the port, or do you build rail infrastructure that will truly build on the legacy of Labor? That is the legacy that built the Mandurah rail link and the legacy that built the link up to the north, up towards Joondalup. Do you engage in that infrastructure investment? That is what is critical. WA Labor have made it clear that their commitment is to building the Morley-Ellenbrook line, building the Yanchep line, building the Byford line, commencing the circle line linking the suburbs, starting to fix level crossings and, of course, completing the Forrestfield to airport line. That is an example: $500 million was ripped out of the budget in 2014; two years later, in order to compensate for the GST, some funding is put back, and they pretend it is new! The fact is that what we have seen under this government in Western Australia is symptomatic of their approach everywhere. Yesterday, there was a report into the funding of WestConnex in Sydney that followed the funding of the East West Link in Melbourne. In all these cases, commitments had been made; money was taken away from public transport projects like the Melbourne metro and Cross River Rail in Brisbane, and taken away from projects like the M80 in Melbourne that had been approved by Infrastructure Australia, and forwarded as advanced payments for projects that had no business case and that were not ready to proceed. And we wonder why it is having a negative impact in terms of the economy! What we see from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are remarkable figures. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures in this graph, where the red is Labor and the blue is the coalition, show that, for every single one of the 12 quarters that the coalition has been in office, public sector infrastructure investment has been less than in any single one of the 21 quarters where Labor was in government, from the time of our first budget in the June 2008 quarter right through to September 2013. Indeed, in their first two years in office, what we saw was a drop in infrastructure investment of some 20 per cent. And they stand up and speak about the $50 billion fantasy that they have; they stood up at the 2014 budget and said: 'Going forward, we have a $50 billion plan.' There is just one problem there, which is that budget papers get produced and show how much investment is actually occurring. And what we know is that up to 2019-20 the investment is $34 billion, and beyond that it is $8 billion at some unforeseen time, booked into the future. What we know is that there have actually been cuts each and every year to projects like the Pacific Highway and the Bruce Highway. When you compare what they themselves said they would spend with what actual spend is, last financial year the underspend was something like $1.2 billion. This comes at a time when the resources sector is moving from the investment phase to the production phase. The Reserve Bank governor, last Thursday night, warned again on, and called for, investment in infrastructure. We have record low interest rates. We have a demand that is there, with a massive need for infrastructure, particularly in dealing with the challenges of urban congestion, and in dealing with the challenges of freight-projects like finishing off the freight line from Mascot to Port Botany; that is an absolute no-brainer, but they will not even proceed with that. What we see from this government is all politics and no substance. They have abandoned the processes of Infrastructure Australia, they have cut funding for Infrastructure Australia, and they have not listened to what Infrastructure Australia has had to say. They have ministers who cannot even agree on who is in charge of what particular issue or project. This failure comes at a time where infrastructure is one of the keys to growth and to future jobs. If it is in the right projects, it boosts productivity and returns to government. That is why this government stands condemned, whether it be in Western Australia or any other state or territory in the nation, for simply failing when it comes to infrastructure.

Backroom Bill had the numbers in the party room, in the caucus, and unfortunately being the people's choice just did not cut it. What you soon learn in dealing with the member for Grayndler is: you would go mad looking for internal consistency in what the member for Grayndler has to say.

162,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (15:28): Look, it is toughgovernment. I was at the sod-turning myself with the Premier and with the state minister just a few months ago. So we hear from the shadow minister that somehow this side of politics is claiming credit for things that Labor has done, but it seems the shadow minister is not at all above doing that. And then he waxes indignant that we will not immediately sign on to before they have been approved by Infrastructure Australia. Where is the Infrastructure Australia approval of METRONET? Shrieks of silence from the shadow minister on that particular issue. You would go mad looking for consistency from this man. Let us have a look at what he has had to say on WestConnex. Let us have a look at his inglorious record of inconsistency on WestConnex. What did we see from the shadow minister on WestConnex when he was in government? I will read you a media release issued by the then minister in 2013: The Federal Government has committed to providing funds towards the Westconnex road project … …… … This infrastructure commitment is also helping western and south-western Sydney residents to cut back on travel times and improve the quality of life they can enjoy with their families. WestConnex was terrific! In fact, Labor committed $1.8 billion to WestConnex at the 2013 election, as yesterday's Auditor-General's report found. Labor committed $1.8 billion to WestConnex, and in 2014 the shadow minister was on the radio, on Ellen Fanning's show, proudly trumpeting Labor's contribution to WestConnex. Here is what he had to say: Take WestConnex for example. We funded the work in terms of planning. $25 million was already spent from us and $1.8 billion was included in last year's budget for the WestConnex project. There was the shadow minister proudly beating his chest, claiming credit for WestConnex: $1.8 billion! But then something very mysterious happened. In 2016, the very same shadow minister, discussing the very same project, was on ABC Radio with Fran Kelly. Fran Kelly asked him, 'Did you provide that money?' And here is what he said-listen very carefully: 'We provided $25 million for planning, Fran. That's the whole point. They say they support planning. We provided $25 million. Not for construction; not a dollar did we provide for construction.' In 2014 it was: 'We provided $1.8 billion. What heroes we are!' In 2016 it was: 'No, no, no. I was nowhere near it.' Why did that happen? Why that inconsistency? I will tell you why that inconsistencybecause he was running scared from the Greens. The Greens threatened the member for Grayndler. The Greens hate roads; the Greens hate road projects. Of course, all of a sudden for the member for Grayndler it was a 180-degree turn with reverse pike in degree of difficulty. He had nothing to do with WestConnex. 'Not me!' he said. He tells a community meeting in his electorate that if he is the minister there will be not a dollar more for WestConnex. This architect of rank hypocrisy stands up and criticises this government on its infrastructure spending because it rankles with him that we are spending more on infrastructure than occurred under the Labor government. These are the facts. There is more spending from this government on infrastructure. We hear this standard run of criticisms from the shadow minister. In a speech in 2015-one of his best-he criticised this government for continuing with Labor projects like WestConnex and NorthLink and then criticised us because we had cancelled Labor projects. The shadow minister runs this ridiculous argument, this factually incorrect argument, that there have been no new projects under a coalition government. Let's just go through some of them: the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, 41 kilometres and $1.137 billion; the Northern Connector in Adelaide, 15 kilometres and $788 million. What about the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan: the Northern Road, which is being upgraded to four lanes all the way; and the M12, which will connect Western Sydney Airport to the M7? We have committed $2.87 billion of Commonwealth money to the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan. Then, of course, there is Western Sydney Airport. This government has committed to itsomething that Labor never achieved. The Perth Freight Link is a commitment of nearly $1.2 billion. Mr Keogh: Zero dollars for rail! It's in your budget! are no rail projects that this government is committing to. That is not true either. With this shadow minister you have to check the facts. For the Perth-Forrestfield Airport rail link $490 million was committed by this government. Those opposite claim that we are not spending any money on rail, but we are. There is the Flinders Link, the connection between the Flinders Medical Centre and the Adelaide metropolitan rail line: $43 million. There is the Sydney Metro, a transformative rail project in Sydney: $1.7 billion committed by this government. There are the Gold Coast Light Rail, $95 million; Canberra light rail, $67 million; and inland rail, $894 million. The claim that there are no new projects is completely wrong. The claim that there are no rail projects is completely wrong. Do not trust what you hear from this shadow minister, because the reality is that this government is delivering on a $50 billion infrastructure program. Announced in 2014, our commitment was that the package we announced that night would take the government's total investment to $50 billion by the end of the decade, spending between 2013-14 and 2019-20, and we are precisely on track towards delivering that. Then, of course, we hear the claim from the shadow minister that in some way the coalition government is spending less on infrastructure than Labor did, and that is simply not true. Here is a simple comparison, which I encourage anybody who has got the budget papers to engage in. Take the four-year forward estimates in Labor's last three budgets and the four-year forward estimates spending on infrastructure in the coalition's first three budgets. The average under the coalition is $27.9 billion, 54 per cent more than under Labor in the last three years. Mr Hartsuyker: How much more? more on infrastructure and we are delivering on infrastructure projects all around the country, because infrastructure is vitally important to productivity, to efficiency, to getting people moving to and from work quickly and to getting freight moving around quickly, and it requires careful planning and careful distribution of projects. So the premise of the matter of public importance debate this afternoon is completely incorrect. This government has a comprehensive plan for infrastructure all around the country. There are an enormous range of projects underway. Let me just remind you of some of the projects that have been announced and/or commenced since this government began: the North-South Corridor in Adelaide, the Northern",109,Matters Of Public Importance
163,Mr Fletcher,And then of course there is the other standard claim we hear that there,111,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects
164,Mr Fletcher,"Fifty-four per cent more. The fact is that this government is spendingConnector, $788 million; the East West Link-$3 billion is available for any Victorian government that stands ready to build the East West Link; the Western Sydney infrastructure package, $2.87 billion; the M80 Ring Road upgrade, $350 million; the Monash Freeway upgrade, $500 million; the Murray Basin Freight Rail, $220 million; the Capital Metro in the ACT, $67 million. The projects go on and on. This government has a strong infrastructure(Time expired) vital because it removes capacity constraints, it boosts productivity and it supports jobs in the short, medium and long term. It is particularly important in Western Australia at the moment because of the prevailing economic conditions. We are in recession in Western Australia. We have very, very high unemployment, and the unemployment is getting worse month by month. We need investment in infrastructure-any investment in infrastructure. Frankly, a bit of improper investment in infrastructure would not be too bad! We are getting nothing. Seventy-three out of the 78 road and rail projects promised by the coalition at the last election went elsewhere. Five came to WA. Four per cent came to Western Australia. The Regional Jobs and Investment Package, announced last week, is specifically intended to deal with areas facing economic transition and unemployment. There is $220 million for 10 projects-not a single one for Western Australia, even though parts of Western Australia that would be eligible under that program have three times the unemployment of some of the areas that received funding. What makes this all the more bitter if you are from Western Australia is that we were told by the member for Warringah, when he was the Prime Minister, that he would be the 'Infrastructure Prime Minister'. That was to be his epithet. That was what would ring down the ages. An opposition member: 'Good government starts today'! and good state government there will not start until 11 March, at the earliest. But, as the member for Grayndler pointed out, the infrastructure spend under this federal government, in its best quarter, is lower than the lowest quarter of infrastructure spending under the former Labor government. It is meant to be a government for jobs and growth. Unemployment is higher under this government. Growth has been lower under this government. In Western Australia we have had 23 months of falling full-time employment. We are in recession, and inequality is at a 75-year high. The Prime Minister might not be aware-his answer at the dispatch box today gave every impression that he is not aware-of what is going on in Western Australia. He has not been to WA in six months. So we get the double whammy. We get the invisible gifts of the 'Infrastructure Prime Minister' and we get the incredible dissolving promises of the 'Public Transport Premier', a Premier who went to the ballot box in the past promising the Ellenbrook rail extension, which has not been delivered, and promising MAX Light Rail, which has not been delivered. So for us in Western Australia, as I said at the beginning, it is not really about whether or not you invest properly in infrastructure; it is about whether you invest at all. There has been two-fifths of nothing for the people of Western Australia-no public transport, no congestionbusting projects like Community Connect South, no properly delivered broadband, no",111,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects

166,Mr Josh Wilson,"Well, good government has not started yet in Western Australia,investment in projects like the second stage of the floating dock. The only prospect of funding we have is in the horrible, ridiculous, monstrous shape of the Perth Freight Link, and you would struggle to find a better example of improperly planned and provided infrastructure funding than that ridiculous road. An opposition member: Maybe the East West Link! history, a privately operated toll road that does not even reach the port, a road that goes nowhere, a road that came out of nowhere. When it was announced in the 2014 federal budget, the parliamentary secretary for transport in Western Australia said: The commonwealth has a propensity to make these announcements, as you well know, but the reality is that the Main Roads department and this government will be implementing and designing the Roe8 extension, and at this stage we have not actually got design plans that are worthy of public scrutiny … When the then Labor spokesperson, the wonderful Ken Travers, asked whether the Commonwealth had had any conversations about the Perth Freight Link with the WA government, the Western Australian spokesman said: Maybe that is a question you should be asking a Commonwealth government representative. Today the Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport came to the dispatch box, and what did they know about the Perth Freight Link? They knew two things: they knew the dollar figure and they knew the name-and some of the time they did not even get the name right. That is all they know about the most expensive road project in Western Australia's history, the only project that has any Commonwealth infrastructure funds attached to it. We have copped, for too long, state and federal coalition governments that have failed to invest in infrastructure in WA properly or at all. We have copped state and federal coalition governments that take Western Australia for granted. This week we are seeking long-overdue reform to so-called parliamentary entitlements. We desperately need reform to the sense of entitlement the coalition has in relation to Western Australia(Time expired) Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne-Assistant Minister for Health) (15:43): There is a lot of argument going over here. Everyone knows that infrastructure drives economic growth, connects communities, leads employment and in many cases, particularly in road infrastructure, leads to safer, more efficient transport and saves lives. But the difference is that we are actually delivering things, whether it is roads, rail, bridges, airports, connectivity-in the form of fixing mobile phone black spots and actually delivering the much-waited-for NBN-or social infrastructure like increased aged-care building. In my area, in the electorate of Lyne, on the North Coast of New South Wales, you only have to look outside the metropolis of Wauchope to nearby east Wauchope, called Port Macquarie, and you will see an extra $2 billion being spent on the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway has an extra $2 billion put back in and it is actually being built. There is $1 billion being spent just between the Oxley Highway and Kempsey, creating over 900 direct jobs and 2,000 indirect jobs-really driving economic growth. Then there is the Bucketts Way between Gloucester and Taree, extra Roads to Recovery funding, extra Black Spot funding and bridges to recovery. You only have to look at other states, for example the northern Australia roads-beef roads. You only have to look at the Bruce Highway: there is an extra $2 billion being put into the Bruce Highway. And there is the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing-the list goes on and on.",112,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects
167,Mr Josh Wilson,"Maybe the East West Link. It is the most expensive road in WA'sFor rail infrastructure, as I mentioned, we have Inland Rail that is finally having serious amounts of capital put in by the coalition government. That is $893 million from Melbourne to Brisbane. It is going to be game changing for freight and all the economy that drives from it. There is the Moreton Bay Rail, the Gold Coast Light Rail and the Murray Basin Rail Project. Dams have driven communities and civilisations since ancient Egyptian times. Australia has not had anything done on dams until this coalition government committedAn opposition member interjectingturn. Dr GILLESPIE: Chaffey Dam has an extra 38 gigalitres. And there are the Tasmanian Irrigation Schemes, whether it is the Southern Field dam and the irrigation associated with that or the Swan Valley Irrigation Scheme with the Melrose Dam, or the Duck Irrigation Scheme at the Mill Creek Dam. In Victoria there is the MacAlister irrigation system, and there is the South West Queensland Pipeline. In my area on the mid-North Coast there is $34 million of infrastructure being built by MidCoast Water and $10 million from the federal government building hard infrastructure, for water, for Taree and Forster and the mid-coast. Our airport commitment means that, in my area, the regional airport for Hastings and Macleay at Port Macquarie have $1¼ million committed from this coalition government. We finally made a decision on the Western Sydney Airport, and the planning and all the logistics that will lead to it are actually being done. The NBN: that is another $30 billion. The trouble with the members on the other side is that they talked about it for six years and they spent $6 billion but there were only 50,000 customers. Now there are 1.75 million people who can connect to it. That is a lot better. Just look at the figures for last month: there were 50,000 premises passed. There are rubbery figures all over the place from the other side, so do not believe what they say; look what they do. In their last budget, in 2013-14, they promised $3.9 billion for this current year, but we are delivering $9.18 billion. In 2011-12, they promised $6.1 billion, but they only delivered $3.6 billion. So do not go on what they talk about or what they say, just look at what they do. We are actually delivering on infrastructure. For aged-care infrastructure in my electorate we are getting extra nursing homes in Foster, Gloucester and down at Tea Gardens. We are actually building stuff and matching our rhetoric with delivering results. remind the members that we are getting into a free-for-all here and I will be evicting people if this continues. I call the member for Brand. Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (15:48): I am very pleased today to get the opportunity to speak about this government's failure to properly invest in infrastructure. This government is failing to properly invest in infrastructure in Western Australia, and if the Prime Minister chose to visit Western Australia for once he would see this for himself. Should he consider coming out west to visit Perth, he could see for himself how this government is willing to waste $1.2 billion of government funds on a road to nowhere, a road that stops three",113,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects

I urge my colleagues opposite to take a tour one day if you are ever in Western AustraliaAn honourable member interjectingMs MADELEINE KING: The member over there would know Fremantle well. It is only three kilometres of road, yet there is the Swan River to cross and there is a major artery of the Stirling Highway. These are significant barriers in those short three kilometres, but nobody is looking to address that. In fact, I am finding it difficult to talk about the Perth Freight Link anymore. The whole project is just too dumb. It is $1.2 billion of funding for a flawed project made available to prop up a floundering state Liberal government. It is being made available only weeks out from the WA state election. It is not funding to secure the infrastructure needs of Western Australia; it is funding for a deal cobbled together by the former Prime Minister Abbott and WA Premier Colin Barnett. We have all seen in recent days the deals that Premier Barnett manages to negotiate. In fact, his most recent deal with One Nation, in his own words, is, 'Basically, a mathematical exercise to maximise the Liberal Party vote.' As a Western Australian I can tell you this is not a reassuring sentiment to hear from the Premier of my state. And this federal government still has the nerve to tell the people of WA, as they face a state election, that the $1.2 billion promised in federal infrastructure funding is only available for this flawed project. So the will of the WA electorate will count for nothing when it comes to infrastructure funding. Minister Cormann has said as much-he will not make the funding available for anything other than the ridiculous Perth Freight Link. This government, and Premier Barnett's Liberal government, has chosen not to invest in the outer harbour at Kwinana. They will not invest in the local, state and national economies. They will not invest in the creation of an estimated 25,000 new direct jobs. They will not invest in innovation through the application of modern technology to port operations. This government will not invest in a much needed public transport rail network across Perth. This government will not invest in linking the Mandurah Line, which takes the people of Brand either north to the city or south to Mandurah, to the Thornlie Line, which opens up many employment opportunities for people in my electorate. And this government, and Colin Barnett's government, will not invest in building a new train station at Karnup, again another much needed infrastructure project to enable people living in the fast-growing suburbs of the southern end of Brand to get to work without facing gridlock on the congested freeway. If he chose to visit Perth, the Prime Minister might see how badly communications infrastructure is needed. This government is failing to invest in the NBN and all sorts of communications infrastructure. They might try to lift thousands of residents in Baldivis out of the nightmare of the communications black hole they find themselves in. I am pleased to compare that record with that of Labor when we have been in government. In my electorate of Brand-this is but a small list, and I cannot repeat everything the member for Grayndler has said, but we know how much Labor have invested in WA-there has been more than $2.1 million to fix dangerous local roads; $5.4 million for the construction of a bridge over Mandurah Road; $6 million towards the Baldivis Library and Community Centre; $4 million for the Medina Town Centre Project; $3.3 million to construct the Community Resource and Knowledge Centre at Kwinana; $65 million for the Mandurah Entrance Road; and $160 million for the Perth-Bunbury Highway-fantastic projects that have all been delivered and which people of my electorate all enjoy. We know that the Libs and Nats have never really had their heart in WA; it is just a honeypot from which to extract political donations. You rarely see a senior Liberal in Brand. I am not sure I have seen a Liberal minister in the suburbs of Rockingham or Kwinana, unless they are blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to unseat that great Western Australia, the Hon. Gary Gray. I am proud of Labor's record in WA and in Brand. Labor ministers, Labor Prime Ministers and the Labor shadow minister for infrastructure have often visited Brand. Former Prime Minister Gillard would visit Rockingham, Brand, Kwinana and Calista twice every year. But you will not see Prime Minister Turnbull in Western Australia, and you certainly will not see him in Rockingham. As the local daily observed, 'Where is Malcolm?' Sucked into a vacuum of irrelevance, is what I would suggest. When in government, Labor invested in roads, invested in rail and invested in public transport. In government, Labor invested in the infrastructure necessary for the future of this country. And, now, WA Labor is committed to invest in the future of Western Australia. In WA, only Labor and Mark McGowan are committed to the much-needed METRONET commuter rail plan and the future of a Kwinana outer harbour. about this government's infrastructure spending and to compare it to that of our political opponents. I spent a short time in Western Australia, and it is interesting that now, with an election looming, all of a sudden the Labor Party have got themselves all excited and all the Western Australians that you never hear from have finally taken to their feet to make a bit of a statement. It is great to see all of them finally having something to say when it comes to infrastructure. I am going through my check list to actually find out who these members are who have been so silent for all of this time and who now have actually found their voices with an election in Western Australia coming up next month. Previous speakers have been talking about this $1.2 billion project in the west that somehow or other is a little bit incomplete. WhereI come from in Victoria, we have a Labor Premier down there and he actually spent $1.1 billion to do nothing. He had a program on the books-and I am sure the shadow minister would be aware of this project. His good mate Daniel Andrews actually spent $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money in Victoria to scrap a road-a road that Infrastructure Australia and Infrastructure Victoria have now identified as an essential part of the infrastructure needs of the Melbourne network. It has to be built by a future government, but Mr Albanese's friend Daniel Andrews has actually spent $1.1 billion of Victorian money to not build a road at all. Mr Hill: What's Victoria's share? interesting how someone would say that Victoria is not getting a fair share of the federal funds because they have 24 per cent of the Australian population. It is interesting when you get into Victoria and you see the spend between Melbourne and regional Victoria. Twentyfour per cent of Victorians actually live in the regions; yet, when they have a big windfall,",114,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects
171,Mr Drum (Murray) (15:53,This MPI gives me a great opportunity to stand up and talk,116,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects
172,Mr Drum,"I am not quite sure what that shout-out is actually supposed to mean. It is alsothey are prepared to spend three per cent of their money in regional Victoria. We have a Labor Party in Victoria that get a windfall by selling the Port of Melbourne for $8 billion and, out of that $8 billion, they are prepared to spend 97 per cent of it in Melbourne and they will spend three per cent in regional Victoria. The Labor Party are very, very selective when it comes to who they want to criticise when talking about certain jurisdictions not getting their fair share. WhatI can see here is a government that is truly committed to an infrastructure spend from 2013-14 right through to the end of the decade in 2019-20. It is a $50 billion spend. This is something that is going to be very well received by the people of Victoria and by the people of Australia. On the project to widen the Tullamarine Freeway-apart from the Labor Party absolutely botching the arrangement with the contractors; however, we have got what we have got-the Commonwealth is putting forward 80 per cent of that money. For the M80 Ring Road, there will be a $500 million contribution from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth contribution to the Monash Freeway upgrade is 50 per cent of the total cost, which is $500 million. Then we have the Murray Basin freight rail upgrade-a long-awaited project to standardise that line so that the freight can get to Portland, Geelong or into Melbourne. The Commonwealth is contributing $220 million to that $440 million project. This is just a short list of projects around Victoria which are being funded by this government, and they are making a huge difference. In my electorate alone, after 45 years, we have finally got the funding for the EchucaMoama bridge. Minister Chester was there to announce that project, with $97 million from the Commonwealth. We have $20 million going into two roundabouts to make the arterial roads around Shepparton safer. We have $20 million of water infrastructure pipelines for the west Loddon project. We also have further projects. Critically, we have this government's continued investment in communications and mobile black spots-something which the Labor Party did absolutely nothing about in six years. (Time expired) The West Australian, asking the question that has been on the lips of many Western Australians for months now: 'Where is Malcolm?' It has been 186 days since the Prime Minister deigned to cross the Nullarbor and set foot in Western Australia. As The West Australian's Shane Wright so perfectly described it, he 'has become the Prime Minister of eastern Australia'. It is the re-emergence of the Brisbane Line. In fact, the Prime Minister has spent more time in Peru and Micronesia in the last six months than in my home state! However, a bit deeper into The West Australian today, another story appears that would not come as news to many of my constituents. The RAC's Risky Roads survey has been released, and Western Australians have identified the Denny Avenue level crossing in my electorate as the most dangerous stretch of road in the state. There were 145 crashes at that rail crossing between 2011 and 2015, and the problem has only gotten worse since. Along with my fellow Labor members, I have been telling governments this for years, and so I was proud to secure a commitment from federal Labor during the Canning by-election to fund a solution at Denny Avenue; a commitment that was reaffirmed at the 2016 federal election-as was our commitment to a new Armadale Road bridge. Alas, those commitments were not matched by the Turnbull Liberal government, and they have not been considered worthy of the Barnett Liberals, either. Apparently WA's most dangerous road is not worthy of the attention of the",116,Metronet At The Same Time As Criticising This Government For Proceeding With Projects
173,Mr Keogh (Burt) (15:59,"My colleagues have already pointed out today's front page ofLiberals. But there is good news: Mark McGowan and WA Labor have made a commitment that, if elected, they will remove the Denny Avenue level crossing and replace it with either an underpass or an overpass, as one of the top priorities of METRONET. They will finally see a solution to this dangerous traffic snarl, and they will get it underway in the first term of a WA Labor government. I am glad that the member for Grayndler led off this matter of public importance debate today, because I distinctly recall standing with the member for Grayndler at Denny Avenue in September 2015, on the Prime Minister's first day on the job, calling on him to invest in new infrastructure that WA desperately needed-and still does. Needless to say, he has not. The great disappointment of the Turnbull government has utterly neglected the people of Western Australia, and nowhere is this more apparent than in his failure to invest in the infrastructure needed in my state. Perhaps this is why the Prime Minister has been avoiding WA. But I have a theory. Just days after the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, visited my region of WA during that by-election, he was knocked off by the current Prime Ministercould it be that this calls for neglect? Is the Prime Minister so afraid of his backbench that some superstitious fear of the West has overtaken him? Or is it just that the WA Liberal Party has realised that the Prime Minister is so on the nose that a visit during a state election campaign could do nothing but further hurt their cause? I compare this to the Leader of the Opposition, who has already visited our great state twice this year. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is welcome in WA. But-after today's front page-we have heard Colin Barnett will invite the Prime Minister to WA, and that he will grace us with his presence this weekend. SoI would like to extend an invitation to the Prime Minister: come on down to Denny Avenue in Kelmscott, WA's most dangerous stretch of road, and decide for yourself. And while you are in the neighbourhood, come on down and have a look at the chronic and growing congestion along Armadale Road-or come down to where Labor will extend the Thornlie rail line through Canning Vale to Cockburn Central. I will be able to tell you about the solution as well: the new Armadale Road bridge, which the Mark McGowan Labor government will start construction on in its first term-just as it will build lack of faith, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I doubt that the Prime Minister will take me up on my offer. I also doubt that we will see much of the Prime Minister in WA before the state electionbecause the truth is, the Liberal Party takes WA for granted. The Turnbull-Abbott governments have not committed a single infrastructure dollar to a rail project in WA since forming government. They like to bang on about the Forrestfield line, but let me be very clear: that funding was GST compensation, brought on because the Liberals here have done nothing to fix the woeful and unfair share of GST going to Western Australia. The Liberals' 2016 budget makes it clear-it is right here in Budget Paper No. 3 on page 51: zero dollars for rail in Western Australia; and in fact, in Budget Paper No. 1 on page 538: zero dollars nationally for rail in 2019-20. They have done it for too long. It is an insult to every Western Australian for a Prime Minister of Australia to ignore our state. Whether it is his refusal to visit, or the Liberals' neglect of infrastructure spending, on 11 March Western Australians have a chance to kick out the hopeless, arrogant, out-of-touch Barnett government and to send a strong message to Canberra. (Time expired) Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (16:04): I am quite amused by the member for Burt's contribution today. He spoke of the Canning by-election. He seems to have forgotten that we actually have the member for Canning, who defeated him in that by-election, here on our side of the chamber. Clearly, he has not done a very good job in that by-election, and he has missed the point completely. AndI have a message for the people of Western Australia: you vote a Labor government in at your peril-a $48-billion Renewable Energy Target-50 per cent-from Labor is coming your way. A mining tax, a carbon tax and, as for communications infrastructure, in six sorry years under Labor, not one dollar was spent on one mobile base station-not in Western Australia; not anywhere in Australia-under Labor.

I am quite fond of the member for Grayndler but, unfortunately, in the six years that he was the infrastructure minister in a Labor government, he started off his time saying no to Avalon Airport. Avalon Airport is one of the wonderful regional infrastructure precincts in our country and in our region.

It is a Labor project. It is a Labor project and with the project it now takes longer for the people from Geelong to travel to Melbourne, and we now have an inferior rail connection between Geelong and Melbourne. I put on the table that we need a 30-minute fast-rail connection between the booming city of Geelong rather than the cumbersome and shocking Regional Rail Link, which is now taking longer. It is servicing the people of Western Melbourne, but it has completely failed the people of Geelong. We have heard some mention of the East West Link. My colleague here talked about the $1.1 billion that Daniel Andrews wasted. It has actually gone up to $1.24 billion. He said that scrapping that project would not cost a cent. That was absolutely untrue. Labor spent $1.24 billion not to build that road, supported by Infrastructure Australia, supported by Infrastructure Victoria and previously supported by the member for Maribyrnong(Time expired) Dr ALY (Cowan) (16:09): As my colleagues on this side from WA have said before me here today, Western Australia is in a recession. We are facing record debt and deficit at the hands of eight years of the LNP state government and record unemployment, and all of this is the result of consistent neglect by both the Turnbull and the Barnett governments. Western Australia has been ripped off by the Turnbull government with just three of 78 infrastructure projects promised during the election campaign being located to my state. Despite promising $860 million, which was announced during the federal election campaign-and, let me remind you, that was less than a year ago-for road and rail projects in Western Australia, the government will instead dedicate just over $40 million. That is just 4.6 per cent for those much needed projects. During the election campaign last year, the government came out with some very extraordinary promises in what can only be described as an unashamed and crude exercise in pork-barrelling, not just in Western Australia but all around Australia. Seventy-six out of their 78 projects were in seats held by the coalition before the 2 July election. In the marginal seat of Swan in Western Australia, the government pledged $20 million for an on ramp from Manning Road to the Kwinana Freeway in the seatMr Keogh: There's already one there. Dr ALY: There is one there. Make another one! Why not? In the seat of Hasluck, another marginal seat, $300,000 was promised to upgrade the Hale Road and Woolworths Drive intersection in Forrestfield. And in my seat of Cowan, previously held by the Liberals, they",119,Metronet One Day The Pm Can Even Come Take A Ride And Get A Selfie On It Forgive My
179,The Deputy Speaker,"That is not a point of order. The member for Grayndler willpromised $20 million for an overpass at Ocean Reef Road and Wannaroo Road. Wannaroo Road in my electorate-which the member for Grayndler is very familiar with, having visited me there, as is the WA leader, Mark McGowan-has been identified by Infrastructure Australia as one of the top 10 most congested roads in Australia by 2030. On 21 December, the WA Liberals announced $30 million to duplicate Wannaroo Road to deal with some of this congestion, and less than 24 hours later, on 22 December, the midyear review revealed that only $10 million was actually allocated to what they touted as a fully funded project. It took less than a day to break a fully funded promise to deliver key infrastructure in WA that would have created jobs and would have eased the strain on families. The government do not care about that. They do not care about families or jobs in Western Australia. They have some of their most senior politicians from WA, including some of their frontbenchers-Curtin, Pearce, Stirling, Hasluck, and more: Tagney, Canning and Swan. But where are they? Where are their voices when it comes to getting a fair share for the people who elected them-the people that they are elected to represent? Instead of speaking up and getting a better deal for them, the Liberals are too busy making deals with One Nation to keep their jobs and keep Barnett in power. Instead of standing up for the people of WA, they are too busy rubbing shoulders or, rather, rubbing tin hats with their wacko coalition candidates. Where are they? Where are the Western Australian members of this government? Where are they on that side? Where are they to speak up for Western Australians? They are nowhere to be found. Instead, they allow this government, their government, to continue to snub and rip off the very people who elected them. Where is their conscience as they allow their government to skew spending towards Liberaland Nationalheld seats in the eastern states? They are nowhere to be found. Instead, they are complicit in the great GST rip-off of Western Australia. The member for Canning is wondering where all his mates are. Where are all the Western Australians? They are not around you. They are not here. They do not care about Western Australia. All they care about is Barnett keeping his job. They are nowhere to be found.

182,Mr Ted O'brien,"In Wag the Dog, you might remember the comment being made thatQueensland are as daft as Labor in WA in this unbelievable pixies-from-the-garden vision of a 50 per cent renewable target. I have to say, as much as I think the Labor Party in Queensland are ludicrous in this regard, in WA they are even more foolish, especially when you consider the relative isolation of the West from the grid. But here we are again. Every good campaign deserves a song, and the only song I could think of when listening to the last couple of speakers is that classic Bee Gees song-remember that? It says-and I cannot sing-'It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away.' That is all it is from the Labor Party; it is just words. Nothing more. No delivery; absolutely zip. The member for Grayndler, and it could be part of his campaign to take the leadership of the Labor Party, loves to beat the chest and talk about how every piece of infrastructure in this country was done under his leadership. Being a good Queenslander and a very proud citizen of the Sunshine Coast, I will give us a look at that track record in the context of the seat of Fairfax and the Sunshine Coast. The member for Grayndler, in his opening remarks, tried to suggest that the government had cut funding to the Bruce Highway in Queensland. That was what he said. When he was at the last election-actually, no, it was in 2013-what he and Labor committed to the Bruce Highway in Queensland was $4.1 billion. The coalition committed $6.7 billion. At the end of the day there is only one party that is delivering on the Bruce Highway, and that is the coalition. In my patch alone on the Sunshine Coast we will see construction beginning this year on a $929 million spend on the Bruce Highway from north of the Caloundra Road turnoff to the Sunshine Motorway. Go up another seven kilometres and $187 million is being brought forward to be spent on the Maroochydore interchange. That is already over $1 billion. What is interesting about the member for Grayndler is that he is complaining about a cut. That first project I mentioned, the $929 million to be spent just north of the Caloundra Road turnoff and six-laning, is costing us $929 million instead of $1.1 billion-for better quality, faster delivery and cheaper delivery. It is only the Labor Party that starts complaining when less government money is needed to deliver a better job. But let's go away from roads and highways; let's look at the airport. The Sunshine Coast international airport announced their new private partner only last week, and we are very excited about this. What did Labor do for that project? Nothing. What has the coalition done? Delivered a $181 million concessional loan so that the airport can be upgraded. Of course, in my beautiful electorate I also have a hinterland. There are lots of black spots-three, possibly four-and we already have investments in mobile towers for three of those. How much did Labor give to mobile black spots? Zero. Not a cent. It is only words. That is all they have to take the hearts away, but the problem is that the Australian public are too smart to buy into that. They want to see outcomes and they want to see delivery, and I can tell you that, from my point of view, for the Bruce Highway, the airport and communications, it is the coalition that will do that.",121,Metronet One Day The Pm Can Even Come Take A Ride And Get A Selfie On It Forgive My

I call the member for Bruce in continuation. they were the four principles that Insurance Council Australia outlined in the Productivity Commission report that informed the disability scheme. They were the big risks, and they are exactly what this bill breathes life into. I will take independence-ACOSS. ACOSS said to the Senate inquiry that this arrangement: … gives greater control to the Commonwealth and removes independence from the management of part of the Scheme's funding base. This has rightly caused concern amongst the disability sector, as a core part of the NDIS is the independent management of Commonwealth and State government funds by the NDIA. The Disabled People's Organisations Australia also pointed to the concerns undermining the arrangements and the neutrality and the independence of the NDIA's structure. But do not worry-the government plans to review the operation of this special account by 30 June 2027. That is right-10 years on and seven years after the NDIS reaches full scheme, the government will finally get around to having a look at it to see whether it is working or not. At the start of my remarks I outlined a range of concerns: IT, the ACT rollout, the stuff-ups in the agreements with the states. I would also draw the House's attention to the Auditor General's report and, again, I quote: … there was no published overall work plan which sets out timeframes and deliverables. That: There is limited evidence of a strategic approach to the use of the Commonwealth’s $146 million Sector Development Fund… And: Within NDIS’ intergovernmental governance arrangements, the processes and timeframes for collective decision-making have been inconsistent with the timeframes for the rollout of the Scheme.",122,Metronet One Day The Pm Can Even Come Take A Ride And Get A Selfie On It Forgive My

185,Mr Hill (Bruce) (16:20,"Ignorance, self-interest, ideology and political interferenceSo, in summary, this bill is unnecessary. It is built on the lie that the NDIS was not fully funded. It is a distraction-a distraction from the failure of the government's own budget management and, listening to the speakers opposite, you would forget that they are actually in government. It is smokescreen and a charade. It is a charade to disguise welfare cuts which pick on the vulnerable, especially the disability support pension reviews. It is an excuse for more nastiness to come by setting up a fund and then pretending: 'Oh shock! Horror! We can't fund the NDIS. We've got to run over here and take a few more bucks off people who have nothing.' It undermines the key principles of the scheme: independence-funded from general revenue, free from political interference. This is what the Productivity Commission said was necessary for the scheme, and it is confused. How does it relate to the fund that Labor set up with the extra Medicare levy, the DisabilityCare Australia Fund? No-one knows. It is creeping politicisation of the scheme but it is consistent with this government and that side of the House's pattern of great social reforms: we build it; they stuff it up. Medicare-let's freeze it; let's cut it. Superannuation-let's stop the rises; let's protect the rich's tax rorts in the scheme and now the NDIS. smart policy. It is a clear example of the sensible, pragmatic approach to policymaking that characterises this government and another demonstration of our commitment to following through on our promises. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a noble idea and one close to my heart. As the parent of a daughter who lives with disability, I take a passionate interest in getting it right when it comes to delivering these services. I know that Australians with disability want security, excellence and choice in the support that they access. The NDIS should be a worldclass means of delivering that support. It should become an increasingly critical part of our nation's provision of health care, supporting hundreds of thousands of Australians with security and dignity. However, without urgent action, all of that is at risk from a funding black hole that threatens the sustainability of the entire system. While Labor sought to deny the problem, the coalition recognised this shortfall from the very beginning and we have consistently proposed common sense measures to meet the Commonwealth's NDIS obligations. The government is on record as committed to properly adequately and sustainably funding the scheme, and the present measure is an important part of following through on that commitment. Behind the technical terminology of this bill is a very straightforward idea: good governments listen to the people and they learn from the common sense ways that families adopt and by which they prosper. To any of us who have ever had to manage a household budget-or, as I have, operated a small business-the good sense of the measure before us today is immediately apparent. I think most families around the country would recognise this approach. How many of us have a jar on the kitchen bench at home, or an extra bank account-a place where we save what we find we have left over to pay for the big costs and investments? When we have a little spare money, when the water bill is not as we expected or there is some change left in a pocket at the end of the day, we all know what the best thing to do is: we drop it straight in the jar or we deposit it into that extra account.",123,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
186,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (16:23,"The bill before the House is a simple measure, but it isBut we also know that just having the jar is never enough. The other lesson we all learn early, hopefully, is how quickly that money, whatever our good intentions, can disappear unless we decide beforehand exactly what we are saving for and we stick to that resolution. It is these practical lessons and that pragmatic attitude that informs this bill. No forecast is ever exactly right, and few budgets are met to the dollar. In the course of the tens of billions each year, which will flow through the National Disability Insurance Scheme, some items of expenditure will not be as large as the department anticipates. With the economies of scale generated by the full national scheme, there will be other savings which the Department of Social Services will identify. As the minister announced in May last year, savings of $711.2 million over five years have already been achieved through the timely finalisation of transition arrangements with states and territories. There will be many more to come. By providing the ability to determine amounts to be credited to this savings fund special account, this measure will allow the minister to bank those savings and underspends, and make sure that they are locked in as major contributions to the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the future. However, we are going to need more than that. An investment as large and important as the NDIS will encourage all ministers and departments to work together and consider carefully whether any economies can be made in other portfolios. The bill therefore also provides for the minister to channel funds to this account deriving from savings in other departments. These savings would result from decisions by the Prime Minister or cabinet in other areas of government. For those times when banking day-to-day savings is not enough and to get the fund going, the bill also rightly allows for extra credits to be made based on discretionary investment decisions by the Prime Minister or cabinet. In May of last year, the Minister for Social Services laid out some of the specific discretionary savings and investments this government will make to start the account off on a healthy basis. The government has committed to allocating $1.3 billion over five years to the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account from closing carbon tax compensation for new welfare recipients. It further committed to another $67.2 million saved by closing that same compensation for single-income families not already in the system from July of this year and to another $62.1 million over five years from additional reviews for disability support pension recipients. All of these are in addition to the $711 million saved through the finalising of state and territory transitionary arrangements. The closing of compensation for a Labor carbon tax that has been abolished is exactly the kind of common sense saving that this bill will allow to be redirected to paying for the NDIS. And these savings continue. Just this week, the government announced a further $3 billion that will be allocated to the fund from the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017-that is, if the other side agree to its passing. But, like any household saving, we need to do more than find the money. We need to ensure that it is locked in to paying for the NDIS and nothing but the NDIS. We need the funds to be quarantined and protected as predictable forward contributions to the scheme; otherwise, there is a risk that additional funds may be announced one day but redirected for short-term political expediency the next. The NDIS Savings Fund Special Account is therefore necessary as an instrument to guarantee that money once committed is available only to the Minister for Social Services to spend on meeting funding shortfalls in the NDIS. This is also why the bill's provisions regarding the long-term commitment of credits to the account is so important. All credits to the saving fund will be publicly announced, calculated consistently with the Budget Process Operational Rules and committed for 10 years. With these provisions, we can ensure that the additional funding available to the NDIS is consistent, predictable and available when it is needed. Sadly, we know that this additional funding is going to be all too necessary. Members opposite like to claim the NDIS as their own, but the reality is that their version-your version-of the NDIS was half-baked, half-finished and fatally compromised from the beginning by a lack of funds. A report into the capabilities of the agency set up by Labor to run the scheme said in 2014 that it was 'like a plane that took off before it had been fully built'. It has been left to this government to complete it while it is in the air. In the first quarter of operation under Labor, the average cost of an NDIS package was a full 30 per cent higher than it was anticipated. If this situation had been allowed to continue, the total blowout in costs would have been immense and unmanageable. As it is, this government inherited from Labor a shortfall of $4.1 billion a year between the Commonwealth's NDIS commitment and the funding set aside for it in concrete dollars and cents. Over the next decade that funding gap is expected to grow to more than $7 billion a year. The need for a special fund was highlighted again this morning in stark terms. The Labor Party continue to this day to be wilfully blind to the disaster they left behind. The Leader of the Opposition said this morning on the radio that Labor had funded the NDIS and that their plan to do so was 'to find other savings'. What other savings? We were never told. In fact, what we do know is that any savings that the Leader of the Opposition did identify he had already promised to other projects not once but repeatedly. The Labor budget that supposedly funded the NDIS predicted a surplus of $1.5 billion but in reality delivered a deficit of $18.8 billion. The need for a special account could not be clearer. The money needed for the NDIS must be clearly and irreversibly committed to be spent only on paying for the NDIS. One wonders why those opposite would challenge such a view. This dire funding situation could not be allowed to continue, and this government has taken a series of practical and decisive steps to repair Labor's NDIS black hole. The government committed immediately to properly, adequately and sustainably funding the NDIS without yet more of Labor's deficit borrowings or increased taxes. We have maintained that commitment ever since. Before the last election, we made it clear that we intended to establish this Savings Fund Special Account. As I have suggested, in the 2016 budget, the government even laid out some $2.1 billion of additional funds that would be channelled into the fund. We took that plan to the Australian people last year, and we are now seeking to make that plan into a reality through this bill. As we have seen, this plan has been diligently worked through and planned for by the government. It has been discussed with stakeholders and put to the Australian people, but it has also been considered at another place. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee produced a detailed report on this bill, with a single recommendation. What was that single recommendation? That the bill be passed. That was a Senate recommendation. The NDIS Savings Fund Special Account will allow the government to lock in underspends and savings from across all departments across future years and reserve them for the NDIS alone. With the 10-year commitment of funds, it will also grow consistently over future budgets, moving us forward in a transparent, predictable and responsible way to meeting the Commonwealth's NDIS contribution. When it is fully operating in 2019-20, the NDIS will be injecting more than $24 billion each year into the Australian economy and making a difference in the lives of around 460,000 Australians with disability. The NDIS is not due to roll out until 2019 in the seat of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast, and it will not be before time. Many families I speak to that have a family member living with a disability are eagerly awaiting its implementation. I only found out this morning that the decision on when to roll out the NDIS on the Sunshine Coast was a decision made by the Palaszczuk Labor state government-not this government but the Palaszczuk Labor government, another example of them penalising a loyal conservative area of the Sunshine Coast. Mr Dick: Oh, you're making that up. people dignity and choice as to how they are given assistance and by whom. It is an exciting initiative and the assistant minister, my friend the member for Ryan, should be congratulated for her tireless work in this space. I look forward to hearing many more stories from participants in the NDIS as the transition gets underway. The government is committed to properly, adequately and sustainably funding the NDIS, and this measure is an important way in which we are following through on that commitment. Ms SWANSON (Paterson) (16:38): I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. I oppose the creation of an NDIS Savings Fund Special Account for three main reasons: (1) it suggests that Labor did not adequately fund the NDIS, and nothing could be further from the truth; (2) it suggests the need for a special account for the NDIS, and the government has not made a case for that; and (3) this special account, this savings fund, is most likely a euphemism for further savage budget cuts by this ruthless government that does not give a hoot about our most vulnerable people. This so-called savings fund is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The fund proposed in this legislation will not protect the Commonwealth's full contribution to the NDIS. The fund proposed in this legislation will be used as an excuse for further cuts to the Social Services portfolio. Let's consider some of the submissions from non-government organisations to the inquiry that the member for Fisher spoke about, by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, and the concerns they consistently raised about this bill. These concerns included: that the NDIS should not be used as an excuse for cuts to payments for the most vulnerable; that, contrary to what the government says, the establishment of this new account means funding for the NDIS is potentially less certain, given it is tied to cuts that may not pass this parliament, and that it may represent a cap on NDIS funding; that these groups could not see a purpose or a need for the account; and that this government has failed to establish evidence of the need for this fund, proving it is merely a political stunt in an attempt to use the NDIS to justify further cuts. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing.",124,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
187,Mr Wallace,"You should have been at the NDIS meeting. The NDIS will help giveHow this government could suggest that Labor did not adequately fund the NDIS is beyond comprehension. In the 2013-14 budget, Labor clearly set out how the NDIS would be funded for 10 years, well past the transition to the full scheme. This included reforms to the private health insurance rebate, reforms to retirement incomes, the phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset, and other long-term savings proposals. The Medicare levy was also increased by half a percentage point to two per cent. Together with the contributions from state and territory governments, these measures covered the cost of the NDIS for 10 years. It was fully and adequately funded by Labor. There was no NDIS funding shortfall left by Labor. There is no need for an NDIS special fund, and this government knows it. My electorate of Paterson, in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, included some of the trial sites for the rollout of the NDIS. We were among the guinea pigs, and I will not pretend that there were not problems, but on the whole the trials went very well. It has only been since the full rollout of the NDIS, and the technology debacles around the online computer portal, that we have heard any negativity about the NDIS. I do not intend to underplay the problems. In fact, I have been vocal on behalf of people in my electorate, the electorate of Paterson, who have had problems-both people who are NDIS participants and those who are disability service providers, who are also struggling with this payments portal. It was terribly organised. I organised for those people to speak with Labor's shadow minister Jenny Macklin, and she has taken their concerns straight to the minister, Minister Porter. There have been teething problems, but Labor as the author and the instigator of the NDIS, and the guaranteed funder of the NDIS, will continue to work with this government to ensure the future of the NDIS. We created the NDIS, and we will care for it. We will tend to it. Labor will not work with this government to undermine the NDIS. It is too important to too many people. I would like to share just one story with you, about how important the NDIS has been to just one family in my electorate. The mother of a boy with disabilities wrote this letter to one of my staffers, thanking him for steering her in the right direction, and I will read it to you: Dear Giacomo, I just wanted to let you know we finally got an NDIS review today for Bailey. I wanted to thank you so much for the direction you pointed me in and the people you put me in touch with. I had only left the review meeting 30 minutes earlier, and I received an email with an amazing amount of new funding for Bailey. This new plan is going to make Bailey's life much easier, with all the new services we can get with the increased funding amount. Thank you so much for helping us. Kids like Bailey need a strong voice to echo their needs. Signed Leesa Morris. This is only one family, but it is clear how, for that one family, the NDIS has been completely life-changing. This family lives in Metford, in my electorate of Paterson. Bailey, who is seven, has level 2 autism, sensory perception disorder and high anxiety disorder. He attends Maitland East Public School and, after some initial settling in issues, he now considers school to be the most important part of his routine. In fact, school holidays now pose more of a challenge than school, as Bailey wants to go to school even when he does not have to, and even when he cannot. It is all about the routine. In the first year of the NDIS, Bailey's package of support allowed him to be funded for speech pathology, occupational therapy and psychology services. This year his package was increased threefold, and, as well as extending those speech, OT and psychology services, he now has a designated behaviour management consultant and a support worker, and both of these new services are working to improve his social skills. The support worker is particularly important in school holidays, when Bailey does not want to even leave his room unless he gets to go to school. It can take four to five hours to get him ready to leave the house, and having a support worker to do that means his mum, Leesa, is able to devote more time to five year-old Sieanna, the sibling that is so often, in Leesa's words, 'on the backburner'. Leesa told us this week that the NDIS package had really lightened her load. She said: It has made a huge difference … Not just financially, but emotionally. And for the whole family unit. This support gives me more time to spend with Sieanna and it helps the whole family. It makes us more like a normal family. There is no doubt the NDIS is life-changing. It is vitally important to so many in my community and in communities everywhere across Australia. It is too important to be undermined, attacked or whittled away by measures such as this savings fund special account-this wolf in sheep's clothing that is nothing but a smokescreen behind which the government intends to make further cuts to social services. Do not think further cuts to social services are going to help anyone. Cuts to social services are certainly not going to help the many, many Australians who rely on government services and government benefits to live their lives. We have seen such savage cuts to social services by this Abbott-Turnbull government, cuts that have driven staff in these departments, not to mention the clients of these services, to the brink-people who are really on the edge. My electorate office in Raymond Terrace constantly receives calls from people who are struggling in their dealings with government departments that have been slashed and burned by savage Abbott-Turnbull government cuts since 2014. Their list of complaints is long, and they are repeated over and over: long waiting times, whether it is on the phone or in the physical queue for services such as Centrelink; having to use the internet to process claims and accounts, but without technology; documents being lost; documents being provided over and over again and still being lost; and incorrect information being recorded on official documents and it being nigh on impossible to have it corrected. One staffer took a call from a fellow so frustrated with Centrelink that he did not know where to turn. He said he had called Human Services regarding his mother-in-law's aged-care fees about 20 times in the past year. Not only was there an issue with her fees being, in his words, 'stuffed up' but also, almost every time he called, he was told his mother-in-law's file could not be accessed because the computer was down. That is maybe 20 times in one year when this one fellow called that the computer was down. How much time is the Human Services computer actually up? This poor fellow was so infuriated he called my office and said, 'Ask Meryl to do something about it.' Short of going round and trying to sort out the Human Services computer, I am trying to do something about it here. To add insult to injury, on two occasions, when the long-suffering staff who answered the phone could access his mother-in-law's file, he was told he was not authorised to speak about his mother-in-law's file, despite his wife sending two separate documents authorising him to speak about his motherin-law's file. Seriously! It is a tragedy, but it is just farcical. That is the story before we even get to the actual cuts to pensions, meaning our most vulnerable and elderly cannot cover their costs for rent, utilities and transport; and to cuts to medical services, meaning our most vulnerable and elderly cannot get access to medical services, to doctors that are prepared to bulk-bill, to specialists who make it very difficult for public patients to see them or to services outside major cities that are prepared to look after our rural and regional communities. These cuts have hit all our communities, particularly the most vulnerable. They cannot afford any more savage cuts to pensions or to services. And Labor will not allow any savage cuts, particularly to the NDIS-because that is what this National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund is. It is a cut disguised as a fund. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and we will not have the wool pulled over our eyes. Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. This bill legislates for the establishment of a savings fund to allow the government of the day to properly manage what will be the biggest effort ever attempted to provide the kind of living support necessary to allow those among us who have a permanent and debilitating disability to live full lives, to their best capacity. It will provide the kind of help that we would hope would be available to any of our children if they were in that unfortunate position. The NDIS of course has bipartisan support, and we all want it to be an enormous success. But it offers great challenges, such as ensuring skills are available to meet the funding increases. That will be a great challenge. If anyone places a pile of money into a space where it has not existed before, there will have to be a huge ramp-up of services, and there are risks around how people will qualify and register to deliver those services. But it is this government's duty to get that right. We will make sure that those who choose to manage their own funding have the assistance available that they need, and that others have the right mix of funding. It will also be a great challenge to get the administration right, making sure there are sufficient people with the skills, as I said. But the NDIS cannot work unless we get the budget right, unless it is properly and fully funded, and that is what this bill is about. The previous, Labor government revelled in announcing the program, but, as in so many other cases, they did not work out how to fund it. They left that to the coalition. The shortfall has a number, a very scary number: $4.1 billion in the first year of full operation and rising year-on-year after that. Just think of that-$4 billion a year short and then eventually rising to $7 billion a year. This is just so typical of Labor. They promise the rivers of gold, say they have delivered the rivers of gold, and then never deliver. Ms Husar: Rubbish! WestConnex, which we just heard about in this chamber during the MPI debate a few minutes ago raised by the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. For WestConnex $1.8 billion was promised and $1.6 million was delivered-a rounding error of just a tad over a thousand per cent. Unbelievable!",127,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes

189,Mr Ramsey,"Like the four years of surpluses-was that rubbish as well? LikeThen we had their long-term projections on education and their so-called Gonski reforms. They promised the world and promised rivers of gold, and then put it on the never-neverwell beyond the forward estimates and well beyond any possibility of the Labor Party still being in government. They provided no hint of how they thought the nation might pay for it because they knew they did not need to because they knew that they too were goneski. It is a pretty regular modus operandi: make the announcement, build up expectation, tell everyone how lucky they are and how fortunate they are to have such a munificent government, and then push it out a few years beyond the forward estimates, do not fund it and then blame someone else. What a hollow empty shell they are! In fact, the budget papers of 2013 indicate that Labor have developed yet another skill when it comes to money management. They can spend the same wad of notes not once, not twice, but three times. Savings from the private health insurance rebate of $1.1 billion were allocated to the NDIS by the then-Treasurer, the Member for Lilley, in October 2012. A few months later, when the MYEFO was announced, the same money had been allocated to the dental health reform package. Later, in the same document, the same savings were allocated to deficit reduction. At least, if they believe in nothing else they believe in magic puddings. The Labor Party is indebted to the economic theories of Bunyip Bluegum, Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff as depicted by Norman Lindsay. I would think the member for McMahon has probably got a copy of that fabulous book by his bed at night. He must be re-reading it nightly as he seeks to justify his abandonment of support for reducing taxes for business, for instance-something he had championed previously. So when it comes to the NDIS it is the coalition that has to do the heavy lifting, and we will. We will ensure the NDIS is funded completely and sustainably, and we will meet that challenge. All Labor can do is oppose, oppose, oppose-or, as the then-manager of government business, the member for Grayndler, used to say on such a regular basis, as you would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, when he sat on this side of the chamber: 'Nah, nah, nah.' That is what the Labor Party tell us about funding the NDIS. That is what the Labor Party tell us about funding child care in Australia: nah, nah, nah. Labor should wake up. They should know Australia expects us to fund this scheme properly. They oppose on the strength that Australia is so rolling in cash that we can afford to send a Christmas bonus to welfare recipients. Really? Is that what they really think? The special fund account ensures that the savings and efficiencies made within the scheme are not lost to the scheme, and that the government is able to direct savings from other portfolios to the scheme where there is a mechanism to receive the support. This bill also gives me an opportunity to talk about some of the positive stories I am starting to receive from families. Just recently a father of a very high-needs son high on the autism spectrum spoke to me about the enormous change support from the NDIS has made to his family. Both he and his wife work. They are both very talented people and certainly they have needed two incomes to provide the care they have had to fund for their child. Like many in the same boat, with the support of their employers, they stagger working hours and juggle school holidays. The father informed me their support package was in excess of $50,000 a year and that they were now able to access all the services and not just those they could afford. He is blown away by the difference it has made to all their lives. Another who contacted me is a single mother with two autistic children. She says she has a life again-just a chance every now and then to not to be a 24/7 mother and a 24/7 carer. She even had the opportunity to have a short holiday by taking her children and a carer with her, which is something she says she could have never attempted before. So many times we stand in this place and thank the volunteers of Australia for the great work they do helping those around them. It is difficult to say whether parents and caregivers are volunteers or whether they are conscripts accepting the extra responsibilities that life has thrust their way. Whatever it is, whether they are volunteers or conscripts, they work to help their loved ones. The effort they give without being asked saves the nation billions of dollars. That is why at the end of the day the NDIS fulfils its primary role, with as best as money and services can provide in maximising the life experiences of the individuals. However, despite its cost it is also the best value for money, assisting parents to do what comes naturally to maximise the period in which they can be the primary caregivers for their children, and it provides in the national interest. I commend the legislation to the House. how nasty and cruel this government is this issue. This government yet again has shown how cruel they are and how they are the masters of wedge politics. To go out there and say, 'How we are going to fund the NDIS is by cutting welfare payments, cutting family tax benefit payments, cutting pensions and cutting Newstart allowance,' is only designed to do one thing and that is to wedge families and to wedge our community. It demonstrates how cynical every member of this government is if they vote for this bill and vote for the omnibus bill, which is being listed for debate later. The problem that the government has with this political stunt is that it is ignoring what is in the budget papers. As people on my side of the House have argued, in the 2013 and 2014 budget Labor clearly outlined how it would pay for the NDIS. I can remember, because it was before I was in parliament, the way in which people in our community embraced the idea of increasing the Medicare levy to help fund the NDIS. It is rare to find somebody who does not have a family member, who does not have a friend or who is not caring for somebody with a disability. So Australians welcomed the idea of increasing the Medicare levy, and that is what happened. That funding is to go towards the NDIS. There were also a number of other measures that the former Labor government introduced: reforms around the private health insurance rebate, reforms around retirement income and reforms around the phase out of the net medicine expenses tax offset and other long-term savings. In government, Labor was responsible to make sure that the money was there. In trying to establish this fund, the government is purely trying to use it as a smokescreen for their welfare cuts. Having struggled to get these zombie cuts through in 2014, 2015 and 2016, now in a desperate attempt they have attached it not only to NDIS but also to child care reforms. This is how desperate they are to cut welfare payments and attack some of the most vulnerable in our community. It is such a shame that they would seek to divide people with a disability and their families against their neighbours, against young people who might be looking for work, against older pensioners by cutting their pensions and against families, the next-door neighbours who will",130,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
190,Ms Chesters (Bendigo) (16:59,"The issue this week that has really demonstrated justhave their family tax benefits cut. This is how cynical, this is how opportunistic and this is how mean this government is. The NDIS is something that many in our community are looking forward to. In my own part of the world, in Bendigo, we are getting ready for the rollout. Across the Bendigo electorate-in Loddon, in Macedon, in Mount Alexander and in the City of Greater Bendigo-we formally come online with the NDIS this year, 1 May 2017. There is lots of hope that families have, but they are starting to get really concerned by the way in which this government is managing the rollout. We all know the facts prior to the rollout. Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics backed up what we were hearing in the community. About half the people with disabilities are not receiving the help that they require. AndI have heard this from local organisations in my part of the world, including Scope Loddon Mallee. A customer as well as a service delivery manager, Mary, said, 'The rollout of the NDIS would ease the burden of unmet need for local people with a disability.' She said from her knowledge, 'There were a lot of people in Bendigo getting insufficient support.' She talked about parents in their 70s and 80s still providing full time care for their adult sons and adult daughters. Mary is not alone. We have had a number of organisations like Amicus, Access Employment and Access Australia Group all providing support and saying there simply is not enough support for the people that need it. Another young woman spoke up about what it would mean for her. Emma Johnson was looking forward to the incoming NDIS because she was looking forward to moving out of home and starting a job in hospitality. NDIS and the funding that she would receive would help her with the training and skills that she needs for employment. It would also help her find accommodation. There is a growing problem in our community with the need for accommodation for people with a disability and, in particular, people with a profound disability. There simply is not enough suitable accommodation available in regional areas. Wood Street, which does provide some respite care, has had to wind back its hours because it simply does not have the funding it requires to have all of its rooms available to local families. All of us, if we are good MPs, know that for carers respite is so vital. If a family can have a week off, if they can have an afternoon off or if they can have a couple of nights off, that time gives them a chance to reset and refresh. The cost on our community, the cost on our government if we do not have quality respite care options is enormous. One of the great moments that I had last year was being able to attend the opening of the Mount Alexander respite facility between Maldon and Castlemaine. This project has been community funded. There has been some federal government funding and there has been some state government funding, but the bulk of the funding has come from the local community. It has come from the Lions Club, from all the raffles that the parents organised, from donations and from very, very kind gestures of people in the community. This particular service is offering those families that respite support. But communities should not have to fight so hard. It took them over a decade to get the resources to build this respite facility. We need our government to be doing a lot more when it comes to the NDIS, the rollout of the NDIS and, in particular, when we look at accommodation. There are some very good stories in our part of the world about people looking forward to the NDIS. But, as others have said, there also are some worrying stories. I hope that the government is listening to all of these stories, taking them on board and fixing the problems in the system where they exist. Last year, on 22 November, a constituent contacted my office about his NDIS assessment. As people probably know, when it looks like they are about to hit the start button for the NDIS in your area, they offer early packages to people, which is what was happening here. For this constituent it related to his 10-year-old son. He was being given early access to the NDIS. Under the old DHS plan, Joshua, his son, was receiving $34,500 per year for services. The original NDIS assessment was for only $14,500, with an extra $4,500 being allocated to the management of the plan. The family was very concerned because it was a reduction of at least $10,000 for their son's package, which caused a lot of distress in the family. They were really anxious about how they would be able to meet their son's needs. We were able to assist. The NDIA did a reassessment, and the good news for this family-after all the anxiety-was that the final figure was much higher. The figure after the reassessment was $47,381. It was a very anxious time for the family when they thought they had lost funding, only to have it come back and increased after it was reviewed through the appeal process. The volume of work that we are now doing to support people who are concerned or upset about their NDIA assessments is growing. We are expecting about 3,400 people in the region across the city of Greater Bendigo to have an NDIS package, so there is lots of work and support that our electorate office is providing to people. It leads me to ask the government: How are you managing this role? Are there enough people employed by the NDIA? Are there enough public servants there to support people? What training do they have to make sure they are supporting these families, who are just trying to make sure that their loved ones get the best support that they can? People have raised questions about payments. If they choose to manage the package themselves, how do they pay the providers? There are lots of questions coming up day to day. The other problem that the government is not addressing in relation to the NDIS is workforce. It has no workforce strategy. We all know the statistics that in all of our states it is expected that the workforce will increase by 90 per cent-almost doubling-to make sure that we have enough people working in the sector for all of these packages. Yet despite report after report saying this and despite the agency saying this the government does not have, or has not released, a workforce development strategy. These are the issues that the government needs to be focused on rather than on its smokescreen and game playing. What about quality and safeguards? With any new system we need to ensure that we have quality and safeguards in place. Currently, the NDIA and DSS are working to develop a quality and safeguards framework, but what is it? What role is the government playing to ensure that we have safeguards within the system. It is a new system. It is expensive. We are providing support to the most vulnerable in our community to give them the same opportunities that the rest of us have. Quite frankly, if the government does not start to take on board the issues of workforce and the issues of quality and safeguards the system might fall over, and it will be this government's fault for its inability to roll out the program properly and effectively, as planned by Labor. Finally, I would like to reinforce that the government has used this issue to try and wedge our community. It is pure politics. It is saying to families who have a disability, who have been waiting for the NDIS to come: 'We're going to find you but not your neighbour.' It is wedging neighbourhoods and communities by saying, 'We will cut family tax benefit, we will cut pensions, we will cut Newstart and we will cut youth allowance to fund child care and to fund the NDIS.' That demonstrates just how cynical the government is. It demonstrates the disrespect that it has for Australians. People do not like to be treated this way. They do not like to know that a reform that they have been waiting for for many years will come at the expense of the pensioners living across the road. People do not like that. They do not expect that. It comes back to government priorities. This government's priorities are wrong. It should be funding the NDIS. It should be looking at the issues that have been raised by the sector. It should be supporting pensioners. It should be supporting people into work. It should not be proceeding with big multinational tax cuts, cuts that we know will deliver more profits for the banks. Government has always been about priorities, and the priorities of this government are wrong. Its behaviour this week in attaching NDIS funding to welfare cuts demonstrates again just how wrong it is. Labor opposes this bill again. This is the second time that I have spoken on this bill, so it does feel like a bit of deja vu, but when the omnibus bill comes up it will have been the sixth time that I have spoken against those cuts, those zombie cuts that the government seems determined to ram through the parliament. It is unfair. Labor had a plan to fund the NDIS. Labor had a plan for the safe rollout of the NDIS. I call upon the government to look at those plans, to make sure that the people who most need our support and need opportunity-people with disability and their families-get the support they need. Stop the politicking, stop the division and do what is right. admit that I am looking forward to his contribution, because of the life that he has lived with his child. speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are right: I declare a special interest in this debate. Twenty-one years ago, next month, my son Trent was born. He was born with Down syndrome. A couple of years later, he was diagnosed also with autism-a double whammy. We will celebrate his birthday next month. Although he is 21 years of age, he has the mental age of a 2½-year-old. He will be unable to understand the concept of what turning 21 is. He will be unable to understand the concept of what it means to blow out a set of candles. But we will celebrate, because he will understand what the cake tastes like. I have seen first hand the difficulties of families with disabled children, because I have experienced it myself. But I have been lucky, because it is the wives who experience it most. Many of us get to carry on with our jobs and get up and go to work, whereas our wives are stuck looking after our disabled children. I commend my wife for the brilliant way that she has looked after and raised my son for 21 years. The importance of the national disability fund means as much to anyone in this parliament as it does to me, but we must ensure that we can fund it on a sustainable model. We cannot do",132,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes

192,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (17:14,"It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to it through borrowing more money. The government does not have a money tree that this can be financed from. The only way that we can finance this is by the wealth created in our nation. That is one of the reasons why I came to parliament: to ensure that we give the entrepreneurs of this country every opportunity to get out there and make a rich and prosperous country that can afford a national disability insurance scheme. I would like to address claims by Labor members in this debate that the NDIS was fully funded by Labor. They are nothing more than a cynical attempt to rewrite history. Let's go over some of the facts. It is estimated that in 2019-20, which is a little over two years away, the NDIS is going to cost the government $22 billion-that is, $22,000 million for one year. That amount will increase year after year and is likely to be greater than the taxation revenue that we can possibly get. Of that $22 billion, about 52 per cent-$1.1 billion-will come from the Commonwealth and the rest from the states. Let's start where Labor say this funding comes from. Firstly, I go back to the then Treasurer's speech on 8 May 2012: The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy … …… … This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time … …… … The surplus years are here. Mr Drum: You said 'promised'! what happened to that promise about the surplus. They cooked the books by bringing expenditure out of that 2012-13 year, bringing some forward into the year before and pushing some out to the next year, so they could create this false claim of a false surplus-a faux surplus-in that year. But we know what happened. They were that hopelessly incompetent that they could not even cook the books right, and the so-called surplus of $1.1 billion that they promised turned into an $18 billion deficit, even though they cooked the books. If we read further from that same budget speech we see it said that it 'finances bold new policies to help Australians with a disability'. There was no financing of it, because they could not even get the budget into balance. They ran an $18 billion deficit that year. The then Treasurer, the member for Lilley, went on: TonightI am proud to announce funding for the historic first stage of a national disability insurance scheme … …… … This budget commits $1 billion over four years to roll out the first stage of a national disability insurance scheme … So it was $1 billion over four years. They put in $250 million for each year-remembering that we need $22,000 million to fund this. Secondly, I will speak about Labor's so-called promises to fund this. We had the increase in the Medicare levy from 1½ per cent to two per cent. It was said at the time that that would raise $3.3 billion. But, going back to when that funding and changes to the Medicare levy",135,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
193,Mr Craig Kelly,"They promised. That is how Labor were going to fund it. We knowwere announced, the NDIS was estimated to cost $8 billion. We now know it is $22 billion. Whereas the Gillard government said increasing the Medicare levy by half a per cent would fund 40 per cent of the NDIS, it funds but a mere fraction of it. When we get to 2019-20 we will have $4.1 billion out of a $22 billion cost. It will not fund 40 per cent; it will fund less than 20 per cent. At the moment we have existing funding from the budgets at $1.1 billion. We have a Medicare levy at $4.1 billion. We also have further funding, from redirecting state funding from the existing special disability services that we provide, of another $1.8 billion. Adding all those numbers up takes us to $7 billion out of the $22 billion, or $7 billion out of the Commonwealth's total of $11.1 billion. So we have a $4.1 billion shortfall to fund the NDIS. In some type of game of magic pudding, Labor comes in and pretends that they have all these savings that they say they have announced, but they have previously stated that they have allocated those savings to reducing the deficit or to financing other things. Now they want to say that those savings are to be allocated for the NDIS. We know that Senate estimates asked whether those so-called other long-term savings measures that Labor said would fund this could be listed in detail. The Treasurer's response was: 'The short answer is ""no"".' In other words they do not have a single clue about where that $4.1 billion will come from. Even at the last election it was Labor's plan to increase the deficits further. If we are going to fund this NDIS, it must be on a sustainable basis. We need to set out where every single dollar of the money will come from. That is what we in the coalition are trying to do. We are trying to ensure that the NDIS is fully and properly funded on a sustainable basis to pay that $11.1 billion. And here is the great tragedy: as a nation this year we will pay $12 billion in interest on the previous Labor government's debt. If it were not for their recklessMr Neumann interjectingit were not for your reckless, wasteful and politically motivated spending, we would not have that $12 billion interest bill that we have to pay. The interest bill that we have now could fund the NDIS from the federal level in full and with spare change left over. But we have to pay that interest bill on the debt of the previous Labor government. The member for Jagajaga and other members talked about this so-called $50 billion handout to large companies. This shows the economic ignorance of those who sit on that side. They think that it is like a fixed pie: if you take the money and you give it to big companies here, then you are taking it away from other people. What complete and utter incompetence! If you want to know how this Labor Party has diverted so far from what they traditionally believed about supporting workers, just go and have a look at the member for McMahon's own special book. On page 63 of his book he actually has a separate subheading called 'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'. I will quote directly from the member for McMahon's book. He says: One of the more controversial reforms by Paul Keating as Treasurer was slashing the corporate tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent … Going from 49 per cent to 39 per cent-that is what the previous Labor Treasurer did. The member for McMahon writes:",136,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
194,Mr Craig Kelly,"You are responsible as well; you were in that other government. IfI was a fresh-faced Labor Party branch member at the time, and I recall the party as a whole being incredulous that a Labor government would cut the tax rate for 'fat-cat companies'. I remember a motion Young Labor conference calling for the corporate tax rate to be lifted to 60 per cent to pay for a program of social reform. But Keating knew that the corporate tax rate needed to be cut to make Australia competitive, that capital and investment would flow to tax-competitive nations and that this was an important job-creation move. I ask the question to the members on the other side: when Paul Keating cut the corporate tax rateMs Husar: He is not here. This is 2017. something. When he cut the corporate tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent, how much did that cost the budget? Let's go through it. How much did that drop from 49 per cent to 39 per cent cost the budget? The answer is that it cost the budget nothing-and that is why none of the Labor members would probably even know it. In 1987-88 we were getting $8.8 billion in company tax at 49 per cent. When it was lowered to 39 per cent, guess what happened? Corporate tax receipts increased. In 1988-89 they went up 16 per cent. The following year, they went up another 29 per cent, and the year after that they went up another nine per cent. So three years after the corporate tax rate was reduced the budget was not worse off. In fact, it was actually better off in company tax receipts to the tune of 60 per cent. That is the lesson from Paul Keating. That is the lesson that today's Labor Party does not have a clue about. The other comments that the member for Jagajaga made referred to the energy supplement. I think it is worthwhile quoting from Graham Richardson, a Labor stalwart, someone who is Labor to the bootstraps. In his piece in The Australian today, he said: Watching Question Time in the House of Representatives on Tuesday was, for me, as alarming as it was tragic. Mark Butler, Labor's Shadow Minister for the Environment, asked the PM a question on the supply of electricity in NSW. Butler's point was that power was cut to homes and to the Tomago aluminium smelter in a state which overwhelmingly relied on coal power and not renewables. The Opposition, front and back bench alike, roared their encouragement and support. I was alarmed because this open display of ignorance and stupidity by Labor paves the way for electoral massacre … That is a former member of this House, a former member of government. He continued: … it would indeed be a travesty if dumb ideological adherence to a renewables policy doomed to fail brought Labor undone. (Time expired) Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (17:29): As a pharmacist, a carer and someone who has dedicated most of their life to working with those with mental ill health, the NDIS means much to me. Labor had the vision to design, fund and implement the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Labor, working with people with disability, their families and carers, brought in the NDIS so that they can have the certainty, security and support needed to live full and independent lives. Labor in government successfully developed, introduced and implemented the NDIS, on time and on budget. During this time, the NDIS received bipartisan support, something the coalition now seems to have forgotten. Since the coalition came to government, the NDIS has been systematically undermined and neglected. Disability service providers have gone unpaid while people with disability and their families have been forced to cancel appointments because of system failures, with paperwork and waiting times blowing out.

195,Mr Craig Kelly,"This is a question to you, member for Lindsay. You may learncommunity are rightly frustrated and concerned about the rollout and the problems they are experiencing with the NDIS in my community and across Australia. Instead of taking responsibility, the Turnbull government is passing the buck and holding the NDIS and our community to ransom. The NDIS is the biggest social policy reform since Medicare. It is too important to be a plaything for this government. Many people with disability have waited their whole lives for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and now this government is threatening to take it away. Yesterday's behaviour was disgraceful. The Turnbull government is attempting to rip billions of dollars from the pockets of ordinary Australians with its omnibus bill and is trying to force these measures through the Senate by holding the NDIS hostage. Linking the delivery of the NDIS to massive cuts to families, pensioners, people with disability, carers and Newstart recipients is appalling. How far gone do a government and a minister have to be to pit one group of vulnerable Australians against another for funding? The Liberals' position in government is a long way from their so-called support of the NDIS in opposition. It appears that they were paying lip service to people with disability and those who care for them and love them, and are now threatening to take away funding if senators in the other place do not make cruel cuts to families, young people, older Australians and new migrants to this country. Is the Turnbull government really saying that, if these unfair cuts are not passed through the Senate, the NDIS will not go ahead? People with disability do not deserve to be treated with such contempt by the Turnbull government. This is just another attempt by the government to bring in the cruel cuts it has been trying to get through the parliament since the 2014 budget. The attacks on the NDIS continue with the bill before us today, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016, the purpose of which is to establish an account, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account, to pay for the NDIS. Labor had funded the NDIS in establishing the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, while this government continues to claim that the NDIS was not funded. We increased the Medicare Levy by 0.5 per cent to contribute. We increased Commonwealth expenditure on disability. We made sensible and sustainable savings to the budget. Labor's 2013-14 budget clearly set out how the NDIS would be funded for 10 years, well beyond full implementation. But now the minister is saying that all the work Labor did to fund the NDIS has been undone-not through purposeful spending but to fund cuts in other areas or to give tax breaks to big business. The government are prepared to hold the NDIS to ransom and play politics so they can push through more of their devastating cuts to shore up their fragile budget bottom line. This is playing politics with the well-being and future of some of the most vulnerable people in Australia and those who love them. Yet, when they were in opposition, the coalition supported all but one of the revenue and savings measures proposed by Labor. Some of these measures were even passed in the parliament after the election, when the coalition formed government. Minister Porter argues that, because these savings were not specifically set aside for the NDIS, they were 'effectively lost for NDIS purposes', yet this proposed fund will not protect the Commonwealth's contribution to the NDIS. If the DisabilityCare Australia Fund was pilfered by this government, then so might this new account be. It will be used as yet another excuse for further cuts to social services. These cuts are already making the NDIS harder to access for people in my community. At a mobile office in Lake Haven shopping centre, I met Carolyn. Her five-year-old son, Sebastian, has global development delay with autistic traits. He is non-verbal, is limited in movement and has constant, high-care needs. Carolyn is full of praise for the staff at Northlakes Public School, who attend to Sebastian's needs with constant care and supervision. He is also supported by the Cerebral Palsy Alliance for occupational and speech therapies. Carolyn and Sebastian are new to the Central Coast. Having fled a violent relationship, they are now making a new life in our community. They have no family nearby. Tragically, Carolyn was diagnosed with breast cancer late last year. She is now preparing to undergo chemotherapy, which she will start in the next week. She is desperately concerned about who will care for Sebastian when she is too sick to do so. She says: Sebastian will need a Local Area Coordinator, to ensure he is getting the best options available to him when I can't lift my head off the pillow. He will need someone to help him get to and from his therapy appointments when I am unable to drive. He will need someone to take him swimming with his school group when I am considered too toxic to swim in a public pool. He will need someone to take him to the park, or the beach, or the movies on weekends or after school so he's not isolated in the house with me when the chemotherapy makes me ill. He will need someone who can keep an eye on him if we go out on a Central Coast Aspect fun day when I may not be able to run to catch him when he takes off. When circumstances change, NDIS packages are able to be amended. Carolyn submitted the appropriate paperwork as soon as she was diagnosed, but this process is taking far too long. Time is a luxury she and Sebastian do not have. It is critical that the NDIS has the resources to provide reviews in a timely manner. But, as long as this government is opposed to adequately resourcing the Public Service, including the National Disability Insurance Agency, people will suffer from the lack of frontline public services. While the government is in this place playing games with funding, people in my community are waiting for the care and support that they urgently and desperately needpeople like Diane, who made contact with my office when her son Hayden entered the NDIS. Hayden has Down syndrome, and he suffers from a heart condition related to his disability. Hayden's plan is in the process of being approved, but, as is the case with too many people, it can be difficult to separate Hayden's health conditions from his disability-nonetheless, that is a job that must be done. It is a source of great stress for Hayden and his family as they move through this process. Their questions about essential medical equipment-such as a wheelchair, VPAP machine, and oxygen concentrator-and how this equipment will be provided for him are met with conflicting information from the health service and the NDIS. It would be devastating to think that, while those necessary decisions around which agency is responsible for which services take place, people like Hayden are caught in the middle. The New South Wales government embraced the NDIS, and I applaud them for that, but as it rolls out on the Central CoastI will work to ensure that all levels of government work to achieve the best outcome for those people living with disability-not the best outcome for the budget bottom line. The money to fund the NDIS is there. It is in consolidated revenue. But the coalition would rather spend it on their pet projects than on people for whom it could make a real difference in their lives. Labor will keep fighting to protect the National Disability Insurance Scheme from the Turnbull government's attacks. Labor will and does oppose this bill. There are still many questions that must be answered by the minister about just what is going on with the NDIS funding which he claims is now gone. The minister has not consulted the sector. He has not consulted people with disability. Yet he is frightening people with disability, their families and carers by telling them that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is not funded, or that funding will be taken away if the government's omnibus savings bill is not passed. People in my community know how beneficial the NDIS is, but this government is undermining the success of the scheme and its future. The Central Coast is already underserviced for disability support, and, without a strong and well-funded NDIS, local people will miss out. There are reasons for the lack of services on the coast, but it is imperative that governments, including the state Liberal government, address this as the roll-out continues. My constituent Lexanne suffered a massive stroke six months ago which left her with limited movement in her right side, blind in one eye and confined mostly to a wheelchair, with leg braces for walking in limited environments. She cannot push her own wheelchair, but, due to her limited vision, an electric wheelchair is not an option. Lexanne's NDIS experience is a mostly positive one: she is happy with the support of her coordinator, and the funding levels allow her to consider home modifications and care options that otherwise would not have been possible. However, she says the biggest problem is that there are not enough service providers on the Central Coast and the delay in accessing care is worrying. Lexanne, after her stroke, moved in with her sister Joanne. Joanne is juggling full-time work with caring for her sister and their elderly parents, who also live with her. When I spoke with Joanne last week, she was at work, at the train station. Recently, she had to work late unexpectedly and got home at around 11 pm. With no night care for Lexanne, she began the night-time routine, preparing her for bed, several hours later than would ordinarily have occurred. Part of this includes medication to help Lexanne sleep, and the delay in administering this meant Lexanne was overtired and lethargic the following day, making it much more difficult to provide her usual care routine. The local health service provided a six-week in-home-care program following Lexanne's discharge, but there was a period of several months between this and the availability of services through the NDIS. The only option during this time was for Lexanne to directly fund her care. She can only afford one hour per day, yet her NDIS package provides for more than six hours a day. Of course, the bulk of the caring and financial support currently falls to her sister Joanne. This is precisely the situation that the NDIS was designed to change-to help relieve the stress of care, to return autonomy and independence to people's lives, and to ensure that people with disability, their families and carers live with dignity and independence. People with disability know that Labor will always stand with them. We built the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and we will never let the coalition tear it down. towards the budget, so let us put this in clear terms. The budget is the document that outlines how the government spends your money-not your money, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, but",138,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
196,Mrs Sudmalis (Gilmore) (17:42,"A lot of the discussion around the NDIS goesthat of the public out there, who may or not be listening but who certainly would love to hear about it. That is their money-it is their money if they pay tax. No-one in Gilmore will ever begrudge funding that can assist people with a disability. But I have heard in this chamber some members of the opposition describing the process of trying to get a balanced budget as like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Well, I would say: we in this House have an absolute responsibility to make changes to a whole-of-country support system that works well now, to make sure it works well into the future. Labor says we are taking funding, like robbing Peter to pay Paul, but, in reality, their proposals are taking money and benefits away from our children and our grandchildren. So this is, in effect, robbing our children's future of stability-actually robbing Australia's future. The NDIS was originally framed to be of assistance to those born with a disability and those injured who then, due to those injuries, were said to have a significant disability. That has since been expanded, and it was never originally budgeted for but we need to take care of those people as well. The original work was inspired because there is a hodgepodge of service provision that has different levels of care from state to state across Australia. I recall the numerous bi-party briefings that were held during 2012 and 2013; at that time, I was a staffer and I was asked to attend those briefings in place of Joanna Gash. I knew that there were many people in our region who were struggling to get through the system, and at that time. I was alerted to the needs, particularly, of custodial grandparents where the child was affected with a disability. I still have that issue as one of paramount concern. However, I will return to that issue and others later. There is no doubt that all members in this parliament-and I mean all of us-will be 110 per cent in support of having an effective NDIS funding strategy. But I hesitate and take a breath. When Labor was in government, this NDIS was one of their signature policies. It was legislated in the House in 2013 with total bipartisan support, and, as the member for Jagajaga mentioned earlier today, their budget projections included an increased Medicare levy to pay for the NDIS. Some would say that that is a reasonable plan; many would be concerned with the cost implications for families at the lower socio-economic level. Labor failed-yes, I said 'failed'-to legislate this additional levy, yet they counted the extra revenue into their funding estimates for the NDIS over the forward estimates. This was a deceitful way of saying the NDIS was funded when really it was not. I need to put this in clear and understandable terms. In May 2013, the then Labor government had a fully funded NDIS based on an increased Medicare levy and other actions that they actually never legislated. The election was in September, so they had more than three months to get that legislation through before they called the election. Remember that federal elections are called by the sitting Prime Minister. I think at that time it was Kevin. It may have been Julia, but I am pretty sure it was Kevin. We are workingMr Dick: Was it Malcolm? Was it Tony? could have a fast election and possibly save Labor. Instead of saving the future of the NDIS, they callously called an election before passing that very, very important legislation to make the funding possible.",141,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
197,Mrs Sudmalis,"No, my dear, it was not. This was back in 2013. The theory was that heNow in this House we hear, 'We're funding the NDIS and there's no shortfall!'. Good grief! Do the maths. If you do not pass legislation to generate the income, there is a funding shortfall. The facts are that there is a $4.1 billion annual shortfall in the NDIS funding, but we are all committed to making sure this is filled. The shortfall has been recognised by disability groups and independent commentators throughout this whole debate. By 2019-2020, the Commonwealth, states and territories will jointly be spending around $21.4 billion to implement the NDIS. Not one of us resents one cent of that amount, because we know how critically important this is. We have heard stories throughout this House where we know this is essential. The Commonwealth will fund approximately 52 per cent of the scheme, which will be about $11.1 billion in the 2019-2020 year. Labor claims it clearly identified enough savings specifically assigned to pay the other half of the Commonwealth funding requirements, which will be $4.1 billion in 2019-2020. As I have explained, this is untrue. Labor's actual budget papers did not link the savings to the NDIS, and that proposition only appeared in a 20132014 budget glossy. When savings measures were announced, Labor was still committed to a surplus, and it committed the funds to reducing the deficit, not merely to more spending. When the savings were announced, Labor did not mention the NDIS at all. Savings Labor now claims it made to help fund the NDIS went into consolidated revenue and were never set aside to fund the NDIS. Any serious allocation of savings in an area of such significant social need, and such a large part of the budget spend in regard to the NDIS, requires a specific fund to be created to protect any savings from other uses, such as deficit reduction. This protects the funds from being washed away in growing deficits that were not predicted at the time the savings were made. In other words, a different government at any future time cannot take the funds and use them to pay off the 'government mortgage', rather than saving them for the needs of the people who the NDIS will cover. On this point, it is notable that at the time the NDIS first appeared in the federal budget, in 2012-13, the Treasurer of the day, Wayne Swan, predicted a surplus of $1.5 billion in 2012-2013 and that actually turned into a deficit of $18.8 billion. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016 will establish a new, ongoing special account known as the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account. My gosh; I am sure they are going to get a smaller title eventually! We have to meet our future spending. It is so important. The new NDIS Savings Fund Special Account-hopefully they are going to limit that to 'savings fund'-will collect underspends and savings to help meet the Commonwealth's contribution to the scheme. We will be able to pool these underspends and savings from across government over future years and lock them in as major contributions to the NDIS. The NDIS is due to become the full scheme in 2019-2020, which will inject $21.4 billion each year into the Australian economy and improve the lives of around 460,000 Australians with a disability. In Gilmore we have showcase organisations that either are working within the NDIS rollout right now or will be initiating such connections after July this year. One of those showcase organisations is Yumaro. Yumaro employs people with disabilities and is located in Moruya. Mark Brantingham, who has been a fabulous CEO, has put together amazing projects in that organisation, and you could not wish to meet happier people than the people who are working there. So far we have committed a small amount, $20,000, to help Yumaro expand and provide new opportunities for their ongoing business directions, but they also have part funding for some disability respite accommodation. I have to applaud Yumaro. They are doing a fabulous job. They employ over 100 people who have a permanent disability. They have secured a major contract to manufacture and supply cleaning cloths to Bunnings Warehouse stores all around Australia. Next time you see those white packs in the painting section, you will know that they contain torn-up towels from hotels, overlocked by young people with a disability, packed into bags and shot out to Bunnings all over Australia. The $20,000 funded part of an extension valued at over $100,000 and it will deliver an additional 65 jobs, both during construction and for people with a disability. Jindelara is one of my favourite disability projects in the seat of Gilmore. Last week I turned first sod for the project, which had been a promise during the election. There were tears that day, because the Lions Club, the Rotary club and all the people in the community had tried to fundraise for this enterprise-they had scraped together money; we had had a gala ball put on by the mayor of the day; and they had had a special grant of about $358,000 from America-but they could not get to what they needed, which was well over $700,000. The government matched them dollar-for-dollar, and we have now turned the sod on that cottage. Ultimately, it will have accommodation for six young people or children who need respite care so their carers can have a bit of a break. Last FridayI joined that community again, after we had announced Jindelara Cottage way back in June last year, and the Ulladulla Milton Lions Club President, Brian Thompson, and I turned the sod. Uncle Fred Carriage did a wonderful welcome to country, effectively a blessing for the site. Jindelara Cottage will be a purpose-built fiveto six-bedroom cottage with lots of modern facilities to accommodate young people living with a disability in our local community. It will enable families to access vital services in our region without the expense of travelling long distances, which stresses the families and means that children may be taken away from Budawang, which is the school that is based just two blocks from this respite place. The cottage is expected to be able to be accessed by over 60 children and young adults staying there over the year. The cottage was inspired by a meeting at the Dunn Lewis Centre in Ulladulla, where the whole community gathered together and said: 'We need to have this respite facility. We do not want to take our young people out of school.' A young man, Eric, who had quite significant disabilities, was quite vocal at this gathering. He was being looked after by his custodial grandparents, so he is one of these special young people. He needed to not have to be taken to Batemans Bay or to Wollongong to give some respite, because that took him away from his school and his whole behaviour pattern changed because he was out of sync with his daily pattern. The appeal from his grandmother on the day was, 'This has to happen, but I don't believe it will happen in my time.' Well, I am happy to say that Eric's grandmother is still alive, although Eric will not be accessing this as much as he might have, because he is now mature enough to go to a group home. I was told that on Friday, so there were smiles all round. Another organisation in my region which has done spectacular work for people with disabilities is Slice of Life Australia, or SOLA. It is a Shoalhaven based not-for-profit organisation that supports employment for people with disabilities in the hospitality, retail and horticultural industries. It also takes on young Indigenous people with disabilities. On this day after the Closing the gap report, it is actually achieving that-closing the gap-bringing in young Indigenous people with a disability, mentoring them and helping them to move into part-employment. It operates a general store and a sustainable garden, which is now under the auspices of a fabulous Indigenous group called Waminda, who are doing an outstanding job as well. SOLA also runs Reflections Cafe at the local crematorium and it has a second-hand clothing store which is a bit better than normal, in the main street. SOLA is a sustainable company and it has been going for quite some time. It employs eight dedicated volunteers and over 30 full-time and casual employees, about a third of whom have a disability. SOLA has done some amazing things. It has even run a certificate II course in food handling, in conjunction with TAFE, in its preparation kitchen. So it really is achieving well. All these organisations are disability providers. They are part of the NDIS system of right now and of the future. As we see the potential of the NDIS, there are increasing numbers of organisations that are changing the lives of so many people who have a disability, and these people are now able to choose the provider that best suits their needs. The NDIS is welcomed. It should be a great outcome for those with a disability, their carers and their families, not an unfunded brilliant program that can only partially deliver on its potential. Our plan will have a funding model that works not just now but well into the future so, when those amazing custodial grandparents who are looking after the children of their children pass, they will know that those children or young people with a disability will have a place to go; they will have a system of care; they will have people who are there to support them and surround them as they move on for the rest of their lives, even if their grandparents have passed. I am proud of the system that has been brought in. It has, to date, been well supported by both sides. We really need to get on board with this, make sure we get it through, get the funding sorted and make sure these people with a disability are looked after. Ms HUSAR (Lindsay) (17:57): I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016, and I do so because I feel this government is shamefully using the NDIS as a political tool rather than a tool for increased care and equality for Australians with a disability. Do not mind me saying so, because I have got one of my own that I have been raising for quite some time. It was lovely to see the member for Dobell in here giving her very tempered response, after that very 'tempered', outrageous statement from the member for Hughes, who proceeded to give us an illuminating lecture about government spending but forgot that his own government is currently in deficit to the tune of $447 billion. Mr Dick: Minor detail! Ms HUSAR: Just 'alternative facts'! We see contained in this bill and the accompanying talking points from those opposite a multitude of mistruths and misdirections. Foremost is the government's assertion that the NDIS was not fully funded by the previous Labor government. That is trotted out from the mouths of everybody sitting over there. This is an 'alternative fact'-which I thought were just reserved for President Trump. And the government now asserts that the creation of this special fund signifies the beginning of the NDIS being fully funded. Of course, this is complete rubbish. The government knows it is complete rubbish, and I can only surmise that the time and energy that has gone into building up this fallacy really bells the cat about where the true priorities of this government lie when it comes to the NDIS. Mr Keenan interjecting Mr Champion interjectingMs HUSAR: Here are the facts-and, if they stopped squabbling at the table there, they might actually learn somethingMs HUSAR: The previous Labor government's 2013-14 budget clearly set out how the NDIS would be funded for 10 years, far exceeding the transition period to the fully functioning scheme. The Labor government put forward a suite of savings and revenue measures which paid for the NDIS well beyond the transition phase. It surprises me that coalition members seem to have forgotten this fact. It might jog their memory to know that, at the time, they voted in support of every one of these measures, bar one. This is a new parliament, and there are new members on both sides, including me and my colleagues who join me here now-the member for Dobell, the member for Longman and the member for Oxley-so I think it is worthwhile stepping through some of the measures Labor put in place to fully fund the NDIS, just to jog those memories. The Medicare levy went to two per cent. There was a phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset. There were reforms to retirement income schemes. There were reforms to the private health insurance rebate. There were contributions from state and territory governments. And there were a bunch of other long-term savings measures, including changes to fringe benefits and changes to tobacco excise. All these sensible and measured changes added up to funding the NDIS. I read in The Australian Financial Review-irony-the Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, saying: 'Savings Labor now claims it made to help fund the NDIS went into consolidated revenue and were never set aside to fund the NDIS.' This statement is staggering. To claim that savings measures could not be related to the NDIS because they flowed into consolidated revenue is absurd and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of government revenue and section 81 of the Constitution. This is only made worse by the fact that the 2013-14 budget, brought down by the previous Labor government, actually specified the opposite of the minister's claim. I draw the House's attention to the second paragraph on page 1-20 of Budget Paper 1: The long-term savings made in this budget total $77 billion by 2020-21. These savings fully offset the expenditure needed for DisabilityCare Australia and the National Plan for School Improvement. Between 2013-14 and 2023-24 the long-term savings provide $121 billion. Indeed, the minister's own department has said that the NDIS is fully funded in their submission to the Senate inquiry looking into this bill. The idea that Labor has rewritten history, with respect to funding the NDIS, is completely false. It is a fabrication designed to distract from this government's NDIS bungles and their desperate desire to rip money out of the social services budget. And what better way to do that than an imaginary need for a separate funding account to strip money from other welfare programs to put into that account when the NDIS was already funded without the need to reduce welfare spending. There should be no doubt that this whole exercise is nonsense. It is completely unnecessary, and it raises serious questions about this government's intentions.",142,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
198,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Vasta,"Order! The member for Lindsay has the call.Respected and independent service providers and advocates have said so themselves. It is a shame that the member for Fisher is not in here because he will know now, from my speech, that it has been rejected by peak bodies. Peter Davidson from the Australian Council of Social Services has said: It is not obvious why this new fund is needed. Its purpose, apart from the generic one of funding the NDIS, is not clear and we don't believe it should be supported in its present form. Alan Blackwood from Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance has said: The Alliance does not support the Savings Fund as constructed in the bill…the notion of a funding shortfall portrayed in the bill and Ministers speech is actually concerning and perplexing. These are all the experts, the peak bodies. And Stephanie Gotlib from Children and Young People with Disability Australia has said: It is believed that the creation of this Special Account… places essential disability services and supports as non-core business of the Australian Government, with their full funding being dependent on other budget savings measures identified by the Government of the day. How has this government found itself in a position where NDIS funding on the ground becomes dependent on other budget-line items? This is a significant departure from ordinary practice. The question must be asked: why should this essential service for Australians with a disability be funded any differently from other expenditure programs of the federal government? The answer is simple: it should not. And the effort with which this government has pushed should be a cause for concern. The NDIS program is close to my heart. In fact, I think it is one of the greatest examples of government providing dignity and protection to its citizens. That is why I will defend it to the end. I know first hand the difference the NDIS can make to the lives of people with a disability and their families. Raising a child with special needs is the toughest job on earth, and there would not be a single parent out there who would say they do not need all the help they can get when it comes to their child with special needs, especially when it comes to allowing them the ability to receive life-changing early intervention. Through the NDIS, children who were previously ineligible for assistance under the patchwork model, which was broken-down, underfunded and chaotic, are finally able to be helped. This makes a real difference to their lives, and I know this, personally-having campaigned for it, having stood up for it, having gone to rallies and having made sure this becomes a reality for every single person in this country. The NDIS provides independence to people who have only ever known reliance, and that means something. It means something to the beneficiaries of the scheme, it means something to their families, it means something to carers and it means something our community as a whole. This is all because of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is a legacy of the last Labor government. Of course, that is not to say the NDIS is without creases that need to be ironed out. But, fundamentally, the NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform package that must be defended, and shifty moves like this one must be called out for what they are: a concerted effort to undermine our social safety net and attack the essential services that assist the most vulnerable people in our society. And the government has form in this regard. We are still hearing and seeing the impact of this government chasing innocent people for fake Centrelink debts, and, to date, they have shown that they just do not care. We have seen this week their plans to force unemployed young people to live off nothing, for five weeks, in what can only be described as a big-stick punishment for anyone who does not have rich parents. Seriously, how does this government expect these people to survive? The shiftiness of this special savings fund bill is evident as well in the government's plans to cut family tax benefits and cut paid parental leave. Everywhere we look we see this government undermining the support being given to the most vulnerable Australians. Three-time Paralympic gold medallist Kurt Fearnley was spoton when he called out this shameful government for pitting Australians with a disability against other vulnerable Australians. He said, 'To say the NDIS isn't important and we need to directly grab money from X to pay for it, it hurts our community and the country as a whole.' And that is so true. He went on to say that he wished the government would fight for the NDIS with as much vigour as they are fighting for their $50 billion big-business tax cut that is going to hand $7 billion straight to each of the four big banks. And that is all you need to know about this government and this disgusting bill. They are creating a problem that does not exist so they can use the NDIS as a battering ram against other crucial elements of our social safety net, and that is simply not on. This government should wake up to itself and concentrate on making the NDIS a success rather than taking every opportunity to undermine its future. That is what Australians voted for, and that is what they expect. to speak in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016, and to return to the focus to what it should be on, and that is the people that this fund will support and the opportunities it will provide, particularly into my region in Central Queensland. The NDIS is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australia's history, and we should continue to be focused on the people it will help. The scheme will support people with disabilities to meet the costs associated with their condition and, importantly, it will empower people with disabilities to make their own decisions about the support they receive. As of June 2016 there were around 30,000 people participating in trials of the scheme across the country. The NDIS Quarterly Report for July-September 2016, released in November last year, stated that $3.3 billion had been committed to help people with disability across the country and 37,721 participants now have plans under the scheme. By 2019-20, there will be an estimated 460,000 Australians with disability being supported by the NDIS. Queensland represents the third-largest market with around 91,000 participants living with disability and their families benefiting when the NDIS is fully rolled out by July 2019, up from approximately 48,000 people with disability currently receiving funded supports. In my electorate of Hinkler, the scheme will begin rolling out in Bundaberg from 1 October this year and the Fraser Coast from 1 July 2018. The rollout schedule was determined by the Queensland state Labor government, with the state divided into 13 service regions using existing Queensland disability sub-regional areas. The NDIS represents a significant change for people with disability and the disability services sector, and that is why we are introducing the scheme in stages to ensure that it is carefully managed. People living with disability, their families, their carers and their service providers will all benefit from the NDIS and from the certainty the full scheme provides. Support will go directly to each eligible person, which means the current supports and services will change as",146,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes
199,Mr Pitt (Hinkler,"Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (18:07): I riseparticipants demand new supports and services. Previously, people with a disability, their families and carers have not been able to exercise extensive choice and control over the supports that they receive. The NDIS will allow them to have that choice and have the services that they want. There is no doubt that the NDIS will change the landscape of the disability sector. Not only will there be new opportunities, there will also be a new source of demand within the wider economy for disability support services. Providers of disability support services will need to be prepared to be innovative and capitalise on job opportunity growth, because the NDIS ultimately means more jobs. Last year, a new analysis of the NDIS in Queensland, the Market Position Statement, was released by the National Disability Insurance Agency, NDIA. The Market Position Statement aimed to share information about the NDIS with the marketplace, helping providers to make business decisions about how they can best meet the needs of people living with disability. The report stated that the disability services market in Queensland will grow from around $1.8 billion currently to approximately $4.3 billion in 2020. The NDIS will inject $2.5 billion into the Queensland economy and double the disability services workforce, which will benefit the entire state. Across my electorate, more than 1,650 jobs are expected to be created when the NDIS is rolled out. The Bundaberg and Maryborough service regions are expected to require the largest proportional workforce increase, as the current estimated workforce is less than 40 per cent of the estimated NDIS workforce. More than 600 jobs are expected to be created in the Bundaberg region and 1,050 in the Maryborough region. The number of people receiving disability support in the Bundaberg region is forecast to grow from 1,500 to 3,300, which is 120 per cent, and in the Maryborough region from 2,200 to 5,100, which is an increase of 132 per cent. This growth will, in turn, generate jobs, fuel innovation and increase investment, and we need to be ready to capitalise and encourage these job opportunities. The Market Position Statement talks about these opportunities, and I quote: The NDIA values the role of providers and sees them as a critical part of the NDIS in terms of delivering high quality, person-centred supports to help participants achieve their aspirations. The NDIA would like to see a market with a diverse array of providers that maximises choice and control for participants but also enables strong links with mainstream services and family and community support to help achieve the overall NDIS aspirations of increased social and economic participation for people with disability. The report goes on to say: NDIS-generated growth presents significant opportunities for an expansion in service provision. With this opportunity comes the challenge to deliver high quality, capacity building, value-for-money supports. Some providers are already embracing this challenge and are looking at new business models and products and exploring new ideas, collaborations, technologies and services that are more responsive to individual choices. I would encourage all of those economic development agencies in my own electorate of Hinkler-whether they are working with local government or local chambers-to be on the front foot, encouraging people to invest in the region, where we have opportunities to not only increase our local economy but also improve our employment level. I am very supportive of anyone that can bring new business to our region-whether that is local businesses with innovative solutions for disability services or training providers, we need all of that support. This is a growth area in Central Queensland and it is a great opportunity to help people that need disability support and an opportunity for our region to strengthen its economy. In April last year, the Assistant Minister for Disability Services, my good friend and colleague Jane Prentice and I held a roundtable discussion with local service providers in my electorate. Representatives from service providers, including from Impact, Bridges, Steps and Endeavour, met to discuss the NDIS and what it will mean for Hinkler residents. It was a great opportunity to talk to people at the coalface of disability and mental health services and discuss what they need to be doing right now to capitalise on the opportunities that the NDIS will bring. All stakeholders will need time to build their understanding of their customer base and preferences and position their offerings. But they are already growing and diversifying to meet the new demand. There are around 2,300 registered providers in the NDIS, and about 130 organisations have applied to register as a provider of NDIS supports in Queensland. The coalition government is committed to adequately and sustainably funding the NDIS. That is why I am speaking on this bill. The Commonwealth will manage the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account in a way that is transparent and quantifiable. In addition to this special account, the Commonwealth is redirecting existing disability related spending and the DisabilityCare Australia Fund to the NDIS rollout. This will come from existing disability funding; the Commonwealth share of the increase in the Medicare levy through the DisabilityCare Australia Fund; and redirected funding which is currently provided to the states for specialist disability services. This will amount to about $6.8 billion. This does still leave a shortfall of $4.1 billion. It is this government's job to set aside the remainder needed for the full rollout by 2019-20. This special account is the mechanism for securing that funding shortfall. And it is smart policy. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, through a majority report, recommended that this bill be passed. The special account will be administered by the Department of Social Services, with its funding sitting within the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This will ensure that savings deposited into the special account are not returned to the Consolidated Revenue Fund itself and effectively lost for NDIS purposes. The special account will allow the government, over future budgets, to identify savings from existing programs and set aside those savings to assist in meeting the Commonwealth's future financial commitments to the NDIS. Effectively, the Commonwealth will, over successive years, put aside savings that are clearly identified, quantified and defined so that the annual funding gap from 2019-20 is met within existing funding. Further, there will be a review of the special savings fund before 1 July 2027. The coalition government is committed to properly, adequately and sustainably funding the NDIS. This measure follows through on that commitment, and I certainly recommend the bill to the House. Ms LAMB (Longman) (18:15): I would like to think that one of the important roles that we as members of this place have is to speak up for the silent, to stand up for injustice, and to provide hope. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is the embodiment of all of those things. It is the culmination of decades of work by disabled people, their families and their carers, and its passing in this place demonstrated our parliament's tradition of bipartisanship on the really important things. Unfortunately, it appears that the bipartisanship seen at the inception of the NDIS will not continue through to its delivery. The government's insistence on using this as a political stunt is really to muddy up the legacy of Labor in government. It is to muddy up that work, not just of that government but also of the people who worked really hard to see a better future for their kids; a future where they could be confident that their disabled children would continue to receive care. I fear that these attacks on that legacy are not just about scoring political points though; I think they disguise the government's new mechanism to make cuts to other parts of the social services portfolio, cuts that will have an impact on people's lives. The attempt of those opposite to argue the need to secure funding to the NDIS is patently false. The NDIS is fully funded. In the 2013-14 budget, Labor clearly indicated how the NDIS would be funded for the next decade. There was a raft of savings measures that we used to fully fund the NDIS. Almost all of these savings measures were supported by those opposite. They included reforms to the private health insurance rebate, reforms to retirement incomes, the phase-out of the net medical expenses tax offset, and other long-term savings proposals. In addition to this, the Medicare levy was increased to two per cent. The former Labor government actually set up its own special account, the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, just for this purpose. The source of the funding for this account is actually the increase to the Medicare levy. So if this legislation was to pass effectively, we would have two special accounts doing exactly the same thing-providing funds for the NDIS. That does not fit very well with the Liberal Party mantra of cutting red tape, though, does it? The National Disability Insurance Scheme is fully funded; suggestions to the contrary belong in the world of alternative facts. So where is the need for this legislation? There is no need to create a special savings account to fund a scheme that is already funded. We know how important the NDIS is for people living with a disability. But it also extends to those who are around them-to their supporters, to their carers, to the community and to a society as a whole. This is, after all, the biggest social reform since Medicare. There is genuine goodwill towards the NDIS in the community. So many of the people I have spoken to are willing it to succeed. They are so supportive of the NDIS because they know the transformative effect it will have on people's lives. We must ensure that we utilise this positivity in the community to deliver on a scheme that people living with disabilities and their families absolutely deserve. One of the positive things about this debate is that we know the NDIS is working-yes, there have been issues with the rollout of the NDIS, particularly around the speed and the quality of delivery. We on this side of the House will continue to hold the government to account on these matters, to ensure the rollout is as good as it can be. AndI make no apologies for that. However, it is undeniable that, when this scheme is delivered as designed, the positive effect it will have on the lives of those who use it will be immense. As the scheme gets rolled out across the country, we can already see the impact that it is having-like this heartening story I am going to share with you, Deputy Speaker, which the member for Braddon shared with me. She spoke to me about Lyn Leedham, a mother of three sons, including 23-year-old Mitchell. Mitchell has autism, he has floating-harbour syndrome and he has intellectual disabilities. The member for Braddon tells me that Lyn is an amazing woman. She is always smiling and always full of life. Mitchell joined the NDIS when it was first rolled out in Tasmania in 2013. The NDIS has transformed not only Mitchell's life but also that of Lyn and the rest of her family. Lyn says: There are so many positives with the NDIS. Mitchell has got a life now because of the NDIS. He's got one-on-one carers, he's learning to become more independent, he's becoming a real citizen in the community. He's learning how to cook, how to spell and how to do the shopping and manage his finances. But it is not just Mitchell's life that has been transformed for the better. Lyn has told the member for Braddon that one of the biggest positives in Mitchell's package is the provision of family respite, something that has not been available before. Mitchell has two host families who take him for weekends and other holidays. Lyn describes what this respite has meant to her and her husband by saying: Brian and I are a married couple again-we have never been able to go out as a couple because one of us would always stay home to be with Mitchell. We went out for a Chinese meal and it was very quiet and we thought of Mitchell the whole time, but it was the first time in 20 years we had been out as a couple. And Mitchell loves the host families and loves his own freedom. As he says, I can't be with you oldies all the time. Lyn's hope is that Mitchell will one day live in a supported home with others. She is full of praise for his service providers, especially for Tracey from Multicap in Burnie who manages Mitchell's plan. According to Lyn, Tracey is brilliant-she is just perfect. As well as receiving one-on-one care for Mitchell and respite for the family, Mitchell is also getting support from health professionals for his depression. Mitchell has advanced to the point where he is now working one day a week for his new local member of parliament. He loves it and he is doing well. There are so many positive NDIS stories like this in the country. In my very own electorate of Longman there are some fantastic organisations and individuals that support those living with a disability. One such organisation is the Caboolture Disability Support Network, founded and run by an amazing man by the name of Matt McCracken. Matt is a passionate advocate for people in my electorate living with disabilities. He is dedicated to the creation of an organisation that provides information and support groups for those living with a disability. The Caboolture Disability Support Network advocates in the community and beyond to voice issues relating to disability. The Caboolture Disability Support Network was set up with the aim of cultivating and nurturing a community of friends where long-term mutually beneficial friendships are established, leading to a sense of inclusion. The network aims to broaden community understanding about living with a disability. Matt is particularly focused on tackling the stigma that still surrounds disability. Matt tells me we are making progress on that front, but there is still a long, long way to go. Matt's tireless work and that of his organisation has made a real difference to the lives of people in our community. I have spoken to Matt many times about the NDIS and in particular its rollout in Longman. He is a passionate supporter of the scheme that aims to help people with a disability. Matt, like so many others in the sector, is excited about the possibilities of the scheme. As I mentioned, his organisation, the Caboolture Disability Support Network, is already working hard planning for the rollout of the NDIS. This is despite the fact that the scheme is not due in our area until January 2019. This is an example of the eagerness that is felt for the impending NDIS in my electorate. The organisations and individuals that support those with disability right across the electorate are wholly invested in the NDIS. They are committed to making the scheme work. Matt tells me that there is great anticipation for the scheme among the 12,000 people who are classed as disabled in the wider community area. The scheme obviously helps many more people than just those 12,000 when you take into account all of the people around them-all of their family members and their carers who support them living with a disability. So many lives will be transformed by the NDIS. However, Matt understands that this really is a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity for those he advocates for. It is an opportunity to do it right and do it once. He is quite anxious, though, when he hears about the type of legislation that we are speaking about today. He is quite fearful that the scheme will fall prey to politics. But Matt is a great guy, he is a great advocate and he is up for the fight to protect the NDIS. He is one of the fiercest advocates I know for the scheme. This is something the member for Sydney would attest to, I am sure. I distinctly remember Matt bailing up the deputy leader as she attempted to leave a function in my electorate in the dying days of the election campaign. As can sometimes happen in the business of an election campaign, Tanya was running a little behind schedule and needed to get to the next event. However, Matt, never known to miss an opportunity, grabbed Tanya and took the opportunity to advocate for the NDIS. He let her know that he was not going to go without a fight for this in our community. Matt knew he was preaching to the converted because the member for Sydney is just as passionate about supporting this scheme as Matt and I. Sadly, Matt has heard it all before. He has heard the promises of past governments to fix the system once and for all. He has seen good policies compromised to the point where they become ineffective, and he has seen when people living with disability, like those he represents, become a political football. Matt understands the disability support sector. Sitting on the advisory council for the Caboolture area, he is in touch with the feelings on the ground locally. There is disquiet from his colleagues and his counterparts because they are worried. They are worried that the scheme they fought so hard to implement will be weakened by legislation such as this. They are worried that this scheme will be undermined and knocked down one decision at a time. Seeing stunts like those pulled this week that tie the future of disabled Australians to the taking away of benefits from other Australians proves that they have the right to be worried. This level of uncertainty in the disability sector is unacceptable. There must be certainty for the funding. For those with NDIS packages, they must not live in fear of being defunded. For those in my electorate who are yet to be assessed and receive their funding, there must be certainty that they will get the funding they need and not be left with nothing. This bill provides no protection of the NDIS fund that Labor budgeted for in the 2013-14 budget to ensure that it could be rolled out and achieved. The NDIS was paid for by reforms which the coalition agreed to, mostly through measures we put up. We cannot let the NDIS scheme fall victim to politicisation and we must protect it at all cost. Labor will always fight for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We designed it, we implemented it and, of course, fully funded it. Dr ALY (Cowan) (18:27): Deputy Speaker Vasta, I seek to make a personal explanation. misrepresented? Dr ALY: I do. Dr ALY: Today in question time, the Minister for the Environment and Energy claimed that during debate on the matter of public importance yesterday, I had said that Labor's election policy of 50 per cent renewables by 2030 would cost $48 billion. That is untrue. Hansard records me as having said: ... Labor's election policy of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030, supported by an emissions intensity scheme, provides certainty to support new investments to the tune of $48 billion across the country. For the minister's benefit, this is based on a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report which finds the value of the investments in renewables encouraged by this policy framework will be up to $48 billion across the country. One more time for the minister: $48 billion is the value of private investment, which is not the same as public cost. In fact, the head of Australia at Bloomberg New Energy Finance tweeted the minister directly in January, stating: @BloombergNEF's research DOES NOT state that a 50% renewable target will ""cost $48bn"" as cited by @JoshFrydenberg ... The minister's answer was creative, amusing for some, and entirely wrong. National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. bequest from Labor was $274 billion of gross debt on a trajectory to $667 billion, by 2030, after Labor had inherited themselves a $20 billion surplus and another $45 billion in the bank. Labor's bitter bequest to every man, woman and child in the country after six years of waste and mismanagement also included $240 billion in consecutive big budget deficits-first $27 billion, followed by $54 billion, followed by $47 billion, then $43 billion, then $18 billion and finishing with yet another $48 billion. When you add it up, that is about $240 billion in deficits. That was the dismal case, even though, according to the member for Lilley, at some stage of the projection process every Labor budget was miraculously going to be in surplus. But when you are letting spending grow at an average of 4.5 per cent a year with revenues nowhere near that, Labor's claims to be perennially on the verge of surplus were always deliberate Mediscare-scale and style nonsense. This was the worse inheritance for any incoming Australian government in our history, even by the famously weak economic standards of the Labor Party which, sadly, Australians are now very used to.",148,Acoss Points Out That Waiting 10 Years Is Too Long And Will Lead To Perverse Outcomes

204,Mr Ted O'brien (Fairfax) (18:29,"When the coalition came to office in 2013, theLabor always spends us into trouble, and the coalition always comes in and has to sort out the mess. That has been the pattern practically since Federation, and that is what this bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill, is all about. Labor announced the NDIS in the same way it announced the also-hugely expensive Gonski education plan-with absolutely no idea about where the money was going to come fromwhich was the height of irresponsibility, and so typically the way of Labor governments, especially from 2007 right through to 2013, across all policy areas. Both ideas-Gonski and the NDIS, and especially the NDIS, I have to say-were morally sound. The case for a greater level of care for the almost one in five Australians with a disability and their carers is indisputable, just as was the conclusion that, as a country, we desperately need to do something about the tragic decline in the quality of education, especially for children. To Labor, as always, the solution was just more dollars, but they did not have the dollars and they had no real prospect of getting the dollars. They uttered vague, rhetorical ideas about where the dollars might come from, and when they did try to give some undertakings they were vague and, ultimately, I believe, misleading. Moneys they implied were tied to the NDIS were not. Billions in alleged NDIS funding were double-counted-a standard Labor trick. Labor was effectively just like Micawber, one of Charles Dickens' fictional characters, who always assumed that something would just turn up to solve a problem in due course and in the fullness of time, maybe on a time horizon so far into the future that it is just not really worth worrying about today. Sadly, that is the attitude Labor has taken on funding for the NDIS but, as we all know, nothing just turns up. Funding a program like the NDIS requires a lot of hard work and a lot of decisions of the sort put forward in this very bill. I have no doubt that the speaker who spoke before me, the member for Longman, is right in claiming that every stakeholder she speaks to wills the NDIS to succeed-they want it to succeed. I think she is probably right. However, wishing for something is not the same as planning for something. Wishing for something is no substitute for planning for it, and this is where Labor always goes so fundamentally wrong. Once again, therefore, it is left to the coalition to do the heavy lifting, to do the hard work, to clean up the mess and to plan ahead. Labor's funding gap for the NDIS in 2019-20, when it becomes fully operational as a program, is $4.1 billion, growing to $6 billion a year soon after. It was, and it is, a ridiculous and totally irresponsible black hole. The staggering $32 billion that the scheme is expected to cost within a decade of becoming fully operational was never on the Labor radar, but it is on our radar, and that is what the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account is indeed all about. This is the fund that will become the Fort Knox for the NDIS. It will start with a contribution of $2.1 billion from reforms to the disability support pension and other changes to the welfare system that aim to make it fairer, more finely targeted and, more importantly, accountable to the taxpayer. It will be augmented over the years by a new spending regime and savings from across government, including $3 billion via measures being put forward to this parliament in associated bills-that is money that will both take care of the short-term funding shortfall and set in train a process for guaranteeing funding into the future, when the scheme will be exponentially more expensive. Again, the previous speaker, the member for Longman, talked about the importance of certainty. It does not matter if you are running a profitable commercial business or a not-for-profit organisation or a charity; certainty is key, and there is no greater certainty that you can provide a player in any sector that is reliant on government funding than the certainty of funding. But the black hole created by Labor is the very thing that undermines confidence, and we cannot have this sector continuing to lack confidence because of a funding black hole. So here we are, yet again, in this 45th Parliament with all eyes on Labor and their allies, the Greens and the crossbenchers in the Senate. All eyes are on them yet again to see if maybejust maybe-this time they will do the right thing and work with us to protect the NDIS by supporting this bill and other associated measures. I commend the bill to the House. disability insurance model was explored by the Whitlam government in the 1970s. But let's be clear: since then, people with a disability and their families had to wait another 40 years and for another Labor government before they would finally get the support they deserve. Since being established under Labor in 2012, successive Liberal governments have been caught out, dragging their feet, to implement the NDIS. And this government is no different. Labor opposes this bill as the government, again, wastes the parliament's time on a political stunt. It is clear that it is just a transparent attempt to pretend that the NDIS is not fully funded. It is absolutely galling to listen to speaker after speaker on the other side making outrageous claims that the NDIS was not funded. Of course Labor absolutely funded the NDIS and, as we read in The Courier-Mail today, the editorial sums it all up: 'Brinkmanship the lazy route to Budget cuts'and this is the quote from the editorial in today's paper in my home state: Instead of rolling up their sleeves, Mr Morrison and Mr Porter decided to take a policy program with universal and overwhelming support and hold it hostage. On Monday the ministers made an indirect connection between future funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the proposed family benefit cuts. This was too clever by half, and simply not true in the short term. The NDIS is funded through the national budget for the forward estimates … … … … Firstly, no one should use funding for helping disabled Australians to make a case for spending cuts-it is stupid politics and skewed policy thinking. Second, the path to reform, including the never-ending work of finding savings and efficiencies in bigspending portfolios like social services, requires smart thinking and hard worktwo things which elude the Turnbull government. SoI was disappointed but, more importantly, I was angry that whoever the geniuses within the government came up with the idea of 'Well, you can support cuts to the elderly, the disabled, the most vulnerable Australians and we'll use that money to fund the NDIS' should hang their heads in shame. Pitting disabled Australians against vulnerable Australians-just once I would like someone from the government to get up and actually do the right thing and stand up for Australians who need support. I am sick and tired of members of this government coming after and attacking those Australians who need a hand. It happens day in, day out.",154,Bills
205,Mr Dick (Oxley) (18:37,"It has been a long time coming for the NDIS since the firstThose opposite in my opinion simply want to smash our safety net and they make no apology for it. In the 2013-14 budget, Labor clearly set out, as we have heard, how the NDIS would be funded for 10 years-well past the transition to the full scheme. This included reforms to the private health insurance rebate, reforms to retirement incomes, the phase-out of the net medical expense tax offset and other long-term saving proposals. This should not come as a shock to the minister at the table or the member for Flynn, who is in the chamber today, because they voted for them. They supported them. And they supported every single savings measure, and now the government, we know, has a $50 billion tax cut right up their sleeve to hand out-is it to the most vulnerable in the community? Is it to those who need a hand? Is it to the so-called hard working men and women whom we keep getting lectures about all the time? No. It is to large corporations, large banks and large multinational companies. As we have heard through speakers today, when you are in government, it is about priorities and that fact alone says volumes about this government. But we know that the government has stooped even lower to holding the NDIS to ransom over cuts to other programs for some of our most vulnerable Australians, as I said before. We know that this is a disgraceful political game of brinkmanship and we have seen community advocates, great Australians-Paralympians, like Kurt Fearnley, who said through the media that he was furious about the government's move, accusing it of using the NDIS 'as a political football'. It is mischief. It is political opportunism and it is just wrong. We know that the Australian Council of Social Service head Cassandra Goldie rejected the linking of social security cuts to disability funding. As we heard the member for Gilmore say about 20 times, she is right: this is robbing Peter to pay Paul-pitting people on low incomes against each other in an unfair way. We know that the NDIS has been funded, but that should not be at the expense of the poorest people in our community. I say that the minister should be condemned for this shameful linking of funding for the NDIS with cuts to those people who can least afford it. And we saw the walk back today a little bit through the media when, clearly, the Prime Minister's office briefed out and said, 'Well, we didn't think it was a good idea, but the Treasurer did.' So everyone we know we can see is slowly walking backwards from this ridiculous and shameful proposition. But, more importantly, we should have a member of the government get in and apologise for even putting it on the table in the first place. We have said from day one that the NDIS is a bipartisan reform that should be above politics-the largest social reform our nation has seen since the introduction of Medicare. We have heard from speakers today about the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Labor referred the bill for inquiry. We have seen in evidence provided to that Senate inquiry that disability organisations resoundingly reject this fund and the government's planned cuts that will go into it. Multiple submissions to the inquiry raised significant concerns about the fund, for which the government has failed to establish any evidence of the need to even establish the account. The disability sector, just like Labor, are onto this government and will not have the wool pulled over their eyes as to what is really going on here. But we know that cutting programs and funding for those who need them most is in the LNP's DNA. The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance said it best when they said: The Alliance recommends that the Committee finds the NDIS Savings Fund, as proposed, to be unfit for purpose. That is right: these are the advocates working in the disability sector. These are the experts. I pay tribute and give credit to people who give up their time, work long hours and make sacrifices to make a career of helping those Australians with disabilities. In my own electorate I am privileged to have visited and supported organisations like Youngcare, located in the south-west of Brisbane, and I have seen first hand the difference that a dedicated organisation like Youngcare can make to the lives of people living with a disability. The story of Youngcare began in my electorate when they opened their first residence, at Sinnamon Park, in 2007. We are celebrating 10 years of Youngcare. This is a wonderful facility which means young people with a disability do not have to go to nursing homes. They do not have to live in aged-care facilities. They live wonderful lives and they contribute greatly to the richness of my local community. The Youngcare Wesley Mission Apartments pioneered a new approach to independent living. When I was a candidate running for office, the first shadow minister that came to the Oxley electorate was Jenny Macklin. I deliberately wanted it to be Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga. She has long been a dedicated servant of our party, our great parliament and, of course, Australia. She is a person who has devoted her life to social justice and fighting for those people who need it. I wanted to learn first hand and speak to the people who live in this wonderful facility in their homes. They were able to share all of their experiences, and what a transformation that support is giving them. I want to be a strong voice for organisations like Youngcare that are based in the Oxley electorate. It is also an important part of my work to support the transformation that is happening in Darra in my electorate through the great work of Montrose in giving support to families and young kids with disabilities. Making sure we are fully resourcing an effective NDIS is a pledge I give to those residents and to the disabled families in my community. We know that this bill will serve only to throw more uncertainty into an already plagued NDIS rollout. It is bad enough that this government wanted to link cuts to those who can least afford it and put a hostage situation into the NDIS, as we have heard from speaker after speaker. I will not stand for that and the people in my electorate will not stand for it. All of Australia is opposed to what this government is planning to do. We know that the government has a pretty poor track record when it comes to delivering and rolling out the NDIS. We know that there were continual stuff-ups in Western Australia and that they led to the NDIS splintering, with the news that the Western Australian government will go it alone on their own version of the NDIS after a secret, last-minute deal between the Commonwealth and the Barnett Liberal government. We have seen similar issues in the ACT. We hear a lot from ministers on the other side saying, 'Don't listen to what they say; look at what they do.' We hear these lectures over and over again. Well, you need only look at this government's mistreatment of the Chair of the NDIA, the father of the NDIS, Bruce Bonyhady; at the disgraceful way, in my opinion, that a distinguished Australian was treated. There was no reason given. I have got my own theories as to why the government took action there. I do not think someone of Mr Bonyhady's standing should have been subjected to the disgraceful treatment we saw at the end of last year. For the minister to use him as a scapegoat for problems with the scheme, which ultimately should fall under his responsibility, is disgraceful. My understanding and my strong belief is that the NDIS board needs people with a deep understanding of the disability sector. It needs people with a lived experience of disability. That is what people with disability want as well. That is exactly what someone of the calibre of Bruce Bonyhady brought to the table, which the minister dismissed, in my opinion, in an attempt to blame anyone but himself for the problems in the NDIS rollout. It is clear from the outset-and this is supported by multiple disability advocacy groupsthat this bill is further proof of the government's failure to deliver the NDIS. From the secret deal with the Western Australian government and the blame-shifting in the ACT to the removal of the NDIS chair, there has been only confusion and frustration for thousands of Australians who deserve better. I do not want any more lectures from those opposite. I do not want any more platitudes from them about what happened 20 or 30 years ago. I want action. The people in the disability sector want action as well. More importantly, they deserve action. They deserve a parliament that is going to stand up, fight and make sure that it delivers the long-term care and support that they have earned. As I said in my opening remarks, we started this conversation under the Whitlam government, and it has now taken 40 years-more than my entire life-to make sure that we are finally seeing quality, dignified care given to some of the most frail and vulnerable people in our country. Australians will not accept more cruel cuts from the government under the guise of funding the NDIS. We know that the NDIS is already well funded. Why do we know that? We know that because Labor delivers on what it says, and Labor made sure that this transformational project not only was implemented and delivered but, more importantly, was funded. We will keep fighting to make sure that the NDIS is protected from any attacks by the Turnbull government. I will always stand up for those people who need a helping hand. That is what I was sent to this place to do. Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. What the government is perpetrating by this proposed legislation is an out-and-out lie. Do you know why that is? It stems from this: the Prime Minister walks into this chamber and he holds his head up high with a legacy to Australia of having lost a republic referendum and having delivered a failure of an NBN. Bill Shorten, the leader of the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition, walks into this chamber and he can hold his head up high because even before he has made it to being the Prime Minister, which he will, he has the legacy of having delivered for disabled people in Australia. People with disability can thank the Labor Party because we delivered on a fully funded NDIS, and the lie of this proposed legislation is writ large in its own wording because what it is doing is setting up a special fund which-wait for it-is part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. It is a fund within a fund. It sounds like a fund we do not need. And do you know why that is? It is because Labor had always fully funded and fully costed the NDIS, which is being delivered now for people of disability in this country. We recognised that the people who are the worse off, the people who need the most care, deserve to have the most assistance from",156,Bills
206,Mr Keogh (Burt) (18:52,"I rise today to speak on the National Disability Insurancethis government and from the nation, because not only is the NDIS about helping those who need our assistance, it is about making our entire country more productive. That is why it was recommended by the Productivity Commission. This entire legislation is effectively a fabrication. It is a political tool from the government to try to wedge Labor, to try to make Labor look bad. Well, have I got news for you, government. You have been in power for four years. All we hear in this chamber day after day, question time after question time, is the government getting up and complaining about its view on a Labor policy. Well, get on and government. I mean, do you even govern, bro? I come back to the NDIS itself. One of the things that the government has done now to make this travesty of a lie even worse is that it has tried to pit people with disability in this country against those with children who need child care and against those who have a need for the family tax benefit. It has said, 'We need to make these cuts to Australian families in order to pay for the NDIS.' Not only is that a lie, because Labor fully funded the NDIS, but it completely fails to take into account that this government has done a grubby deal with the Western Australian government that sees a substantial part of the cost-$140 million at least-transferred across to the Western Australia government. It has already made a huge saving on the administration of the NDIS by offshoring it to Western Australia, which is a complete dud of a national disability insurance scheme. This is one of the real travesties of the way in which the government has been operating the NDIS and trying to bring it to fruition. In Western Australia we have seen two trial areas established: one for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, another for what is called WA NDIS. I am a reasonably parochial Western Australian, so it makes sense to make sure that WA gets the best deal, and I could not really fault the idea of saying, 'Okay, WA has a pretty good disability service scheme with the Disability Services Commission. Let's make sure that we get the best deal in Western Australia.' However, after setting up these trials and, in fact, even expanding the area being covered by these trial sites, including expanding WA NDIS into the Armadale area in my seat of Burt, the government then almost immediately signed up a deal between the federal government and the Western Australia government to introduce it across the entire state before the trials of WA NDIS had been completed. What really troubles me about that-and what I think should trouble not only all Western Australians but all Australians, because this is a deal with the federal government-is that they set up these trials to do an evaluation and they have not shown us the result. Apparently, buried somewhere in the bowels of the Commonwealth and state governments is an evaluation report that nobody has seen. How are we in Western Australia-let alone across the nation-to know that this deal that is being done, which is going to cost Western Australians $140 million at least, is actually to the benefit of Western Australians. This is some secret, grubby deal. What makes it even worse and what just underlies the political nature of that agreement is that the agreement was signed the day before the Barnett government went into caretaker mode. They did not want any scrutiny of this. They did not want the opportunity for a Mark McGowan WA Labor government to come in and actually understand what has been going on. No, they were going to sign the deal up straight away to cover their own tracks. I have had disability advocates, people with disability and parents of children with disability coming to me in my office and meeting with me at community meetings, saying, 'Matt, we are very concerned about the differences between the WA NDIS and the national scheme.' I will accept that there could be some deficiencies in the national scheme. Under this government, I do not think that will come as any surprise to anybody. But what concerns me is that these people, whose children are some of the most vulnerable people in our community, want to know that their children will be cared for as they grow older and that they will have access to support, especially after the time has come when they, as parents, are no longer able to look after them. They are concerned about some of the differences that they are seeing in the schemes. In fact, that differences between the schemes is a critical point, because what we saw under the trials was that the Commonwealth government would not comment on the WA NDIS and the WA government would not comment on the national scheme. So we had this situation where no-one could ever really get to the bottom of the differences. Fortunately, the wonders of Facebook-you might have heard of the internet over there on the government side-have meant that there has been collaboration and discussion between service providers and those that receive these benefits under the NDIS, and they are very concerned about some of the differences they see. I will not run through them all now because part of the problem has been that, in trying to clarify what the differences are, how they operate and why they are there, we cannot get any information out of the WA government or the Commonwealth government. In fact, we even tried to use freedom of information to get access to the evaluation report to understand the differences and why one scheme is better or not better than the other, but we were told, 'No, that's subject to intergovernmental agreement now, so you can't have access to that report.' What are this government and the Barnett government trying to hide? Under the NDIS, there is supposed to be this concept that the user, the person with disability, is able to choose how their benefit is spent, what services they access and how they access them. The control is placed with the individual. Instead, under the WA NDIS they will go and meet with their local coordinator, who will say, 'This organisation can provide you with that service,' and sign them up for at least six months prepaid-done. If there is a problem with that service provider, it would appear there is no capacity for the individual to change service provider, find a better service provider or use someone who better meets their needs. It may be no fault of the service provider that, for whatever reason, they cannot meet the individual needs of that person-but, no. They are signed up for six months prepaid and cannot change it. With all of these issues, we do not know what sits behind it, but one of the interesting things under this agreement between the Commonwealth and the state government of Mr Colin Barnett is that Western Australia, unlike any other state in the Commonwealth, will now bear the administration costs of the NDIS in WA. It is supposed to be a national scheme, but instead Western Australians are now going to have to pay for the administration of the NDIS. If you accept a proposition that says, 'The WA government's going to provide more administration or better service or better access to local coordinators,' you might think, 'Okay, it makes sense that the WA government bears the additional cost,' but, no. It will not be just the additional cost; it is going to wear the whole cost. This is an absolute travesty. This is supposed to be a national scheme-and, again, we do not know what is better. The other part of this, of course, is that we are supposed to have national transferabilityportability around the country. If you are a person with disability in Western Australia and the opportunity arises for you to take up a job in the ACT or New South Wales, or your family needs to move and you are a child who is receiving benefits through the NDIS, you do not know what you are going to get now because they have changed the schemes and we do not know how. How will we have full portability if we have different schemes operating in different states? The other thing here is that, in addition to Western Australia wearing the administration costs, while the Commonwealth will pick up the cost of the actual scheme and the services provided-that seems fair-now 75 per cent of the cost overruns in Western Australia will be borne by the state of Western Australia. This is supposed to be a national, federally funded scheme. Those opposite say, 'Labor didn't fully fund the scheme,' but they do not even want to fully fund the scheme; they want to palm the costs off onto the state, which is exactly the opposite of what we are supposed to be doing. I raise these concerns because I am seriously concerned about what is going on for our national disability scheme. The key thing I want to emphasise in speaking on this is this: when it comes to those individuals-when it comes to people with disability and to the parents of children with disability-they need to know that as Western Australians they will be no worse off than anyone else in the Commonwealth under this scheme. They should know that; that should be a guarantee. That was part of the design of the NDIS as it was put in place by Labor. But now they do not know. They have uncertainty. They have fear. They are coming to people like me and saying, 'We just don't know, but all we want is to know that we'll be no worse off.' I think that is a very reasonable request-for people with disability and their parents to know that, by being in Western Australia, they will be no worse off. But, with the way in which this government is hiding and the way in which the Colin Barnett Liberal government is hiding, the results of that evaluation tell me that there is something rotten in the state of Western Australia and something rotten in the deal that the Barnett government has cut with Christian Porter and the Liberal government here in Canberra. When it comes to this piece of legislation, the government says, 'Oh, Labor didn't fund the NDIS.' We know from the wording of the legislation that that is a bunch of rot. Once again, the Turnbull government is all fluff and cluck on the NDIS and helping people with disability. That is why I have serious difficulty with this legislation. Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. As we have heard, this bill seeks to establish a new savings fund that would sit within consolidated revenue. The government claimed-and they have been claiming this a lot in the last few days-that, in order to meet the necessary funding obligations for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, they need to set up this ongoing special account. Let me make a few things clear from the beginning. Most of all, this legislation is not about the actual National Disability Insurance Scheme; it is not actually about helping and assisting those people with disabilities, their families or their carers. I want to make something else very clear from the outset. Let us always remember that Labor created the NDIS; Labor designed the NDIS; Labor fully funded the NDIS. As a result of our commitment and our design, now thousands of people across the country are having their lives transformed through the NDIS. I would like to take this opportunity to commend all those individuals and community groups who, for years, fought for the introduction of the",159,Bills
207,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (19:05,"I, too, rise to speak on the National DisabilityNational Disability Insurance Scheme. I have spoken to many of those people over the years and I admire and commend their dedication. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill is a not-sosubtle attempt by this government to pretend that the NDIS, as designed and developed by Labor, is not fully funded. It is, in fact, a political stunt, providing yet another poor excuse for this government to make further damaging cuts to the social services portfolio. It is indeed a shameless political stunt, at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people in our communities-in a sense, making them political pawns. It is disappointing on many levels. The government falsely claims-and, indeed, has falsely claimed on many occasions in the last few days-that the NDIS was left high and dry under the Labor government; they keep saying that at every chance. This is completely untrue, and the government's continued insistence on this fallacy will not make it any less of a political game at the expense of people with disabilities, their families and carers. The whole premise of this legislation is based on this blatant untruth-that Labor, in government, did not make the budget decisions required to fund the NDIS. It is indeed a falsehood we have seen trotted out again and again in the last few days by most of the people across the chamber. But, despite their commitment to this obvious duplicity, deep down members opposite will be very aware that the NDIS was indeed fully funded. In fact, many of those opposite were sitting in this chamber and voted for those savings measures when they were introduced. This government, in opposition, agreed to the decisions that were made to contribute to the cost of the scheme. Indeed, under Labor, in the 2013 budget, the NDIS had a clear plan, explicitly showing funding for 10 years and taking it even further than the transition to the fully-funded scheme. This included, but was not limited to, an increase to the Medicare levy, which was always intended to cover some-not all-of the cost of the NDIS. Labor made other responsible budget choices to help fund the NDIS over the 10 years, including private health insurance rebate reforms, retirement income reforms, amendments to tax concessions for fringe benefits, changes to tobacco excise indexation and changes to import processing charges-a whole range of changes to pay for the NDIS. Some of the legislation that gave effect to these measures even passed the parliament after the 2013 election, when the coalition had already formed government. In opposition, as in government, the coalition purported to bipartisanship for budget measures that were specifically intended to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. So, if the funding from these measures is no longer directed towards the NDIS-well, where is it being channelled to? That, of course, is the obvious question, based on what they are saying. If the government truly believes that the NDIS is unfunded, why has it signed bilateral agreements with state governments committing to the full rollout and the full funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme? In fact, in setting up this other account, the government is questioning their own supported budget savings measures. The real question should be: 'What has the government done with the money that they have agreed was already set aside for the NDIS?' That is the real query that many people have. The answer is that this is yet another opportunity for this government to pursue more unfair budget cuts-cuts that will affect the most vulnerable in our communities. And we have certainly seen over the past few years some very harsh cuts to those very, very vulnerable people in our communities. We have seen budget after budget with different measures-very cruel, many of them. But I think what we have seen this week from this government really does take the cake when it comes to their levels of cruelty, in terms of their omnibus bill and the fact that they really want to hold the NDIS hostage, if you like. It has been quite appalling to see what they are doing. They are in fact holding the NDIS hostage over their $5.6 billion in cuts to families, new mothers, pensioners, people with disability, carers and young jobseekers. What they are doing is playing a disgraceful political game of brinkmanship. People with a disability do not deserve to be treated with such absolute contempt by the Liberal and National parties, in holding them hostage for their cruel cuts. Make no mistake: linking the delivery of the NDIS to massive cuts to families, pensioners, people with disability, carers and Newstart recipients is not just appalling; it is also very cruel. And people in the community are telling me that. They are also very distressed and upset that the funding for the NDIS has been placed in this position by the government, with these threats, and holding them hostage. Is the government actually seriously saying that if these unfair cuts are not passed through the Senate then the NDIS will not go ahead? Is that what they are actually saying to the community? That is the fear the community has, and that is certainly what they are relaying to me. Many of these people with disability and their families have waited years and years and years for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and many people have fought hard for it. And this government should actually be getting on with the job of delivering the NDIS. They should stop telling these untruths to those people with disability and their families, and they should stop putting the future of the NDIS into doubt, because it is causing a huge amount of distress. I think what makes it worse is the way they are attacking so many vulnerable people in our community but have still got their $50 billion in tax cuts for big business-that is still there, whilst all of these other cruel measures are taking place and whilst the NDIS is being held hostage as well. I note today some very apt comments from Kurt Fearnley, the five-time Paralympian. He has reportedly accused the government of using the NDIS as a 'political football' and criticised the decision to fund it through cuts to other social services. Kurt Fearnley was a member of the NDIS advisory council, and an ABC News article reports that he: … criticised the Government for taking funding from services that benefit vulnerable members of the community as opposed to re-evaluating its negative gearing program or big business tax policies. In that article he is quoted as saying: To sit there and draw a direct line between funding for people with disabilities and the cuts to other vulnerable members of our community-to those on welfare, to those on pensions-you could draw that line across a thousand different parts of the budget. And he says that he wishes the government would fight for the NDIS with as much vigour as it is fighting for its $50 billion business tax cut. How true is that! The government will repeatedly go out there and fight for the top end of town, but for those with a disability or those on a whole range of pensions, we just see their constant cruel measures, and I think it really goes to the heart of what this government stands for. And with the government pursuing these more unfair budget cuts, yet again, as always, it hurts the most vulnerable in our communities. Labor committed the revenue from the increase I spoke about before-the increase to the Medicare levy-into the new DisabilityCare Australia Fund. That is a special account from which the states and territories are paid in accordance with their agreements. So there is already an account into which funding is placed to fund the NDIS. But this government wants to set up a special account that serves no genuine purpose in the budget. The money put into the account would still sit in the contingency reserve to be used as the government prioritises. So it is purely political. And all this to ostensibly fund the NDIS-a scheme that has already been fully funded by Labor. Furthermore, and most importantly, this political game that this government is playing comes at a real cost, because the National Disability Insurance Scheme is dedicated to ensuring that people with a disability, their families and their carers receive full access to the services and programs they need, affording them the respect and value that they deserve in our community. By 2019, the NDIS was designed to support over 460,000 Australians with disability, their carers and their families, and that support will take the form of personal care, access to community services, therapy services and essential equipment, because the former Labor government did all the work of designing and costing the NDIS. The 2013 budget under the Labor government set out-to be precise-a clear 10-year funding plan. The Minister for Human Services and the Treasurer, as I say, keep trying to convince everyone that that is not the case, but deep down they know that it is true. They will try to say the savings measures were not specifically allocated, but their arguments, as always, are incorrect and flawed. Labor set up that account, and it is very disturbing to hear the government keep peddling those untruths. The government claims bipartisan support for the NDIS but it is more than happy to use its scheme as a pretext for its budget cuts. It shows that that level of bipartisanship is not there. It is distressing to see that and hear the government's repeated untruths about that. Labor referred this bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry, and their recent report supported the overwhelming evidence against the establishment of this account. In the submissions to the inquiry there were a number of quite lengthy concerns from non-government organisations. It is interesting to note that among the concerns they had was the fear that the establishment of the account would lead to less certainty of NDIS funding, as it would be tied to savings measures that may not pass parliament, and the concern that it should not be used as an excuse for cuts to payments to the most vulnerable. That is exactly what the Senate inquiry found and it is now precisely what we are seeing. There are many reasons why what the government has done is wrong and why it is cruel. We should look at the reasons why the NDIS was first put in place. The NDIS was there to give all Australians the peace of mind that if their child or loved one was born with, or acquired, a permanent or significant disability they would get the support they needed. This new model is a significant move from the previous ad hoc system to one that encourages both participation and empowerment, providing people with choice in their own care, which is vitally important. In 2010, following discussion about the need for a major reform of disability services in Australia. I think it was widely recognised we needed that reform-the Labor government requested the Productivity Commission to carry out a public inquiry into the care and support of people with disabilities. The commission found that the disability support system was underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficient, and that people with disabilities had very little choice and absolutely no certainty of access to appropriate support. The stresses on the system were growing. Also growing were the costs for governments at every level with an increasingly ad hoc system. The Productivity Commission received over a thousand submissions from people with disabilities and other stakeholders in the disability sector. It was decided that what was needed was a disability care and support scheme that would determine services designed to meet the long-term needs of people with disabilities, their families and carers. The inquiry looked at the feasibility of such a scheme, the costs and benefits, as well as how the scheme could work with the sectors of health, aged care, informal care, income support and injury insurance. It included how the scheme should be introduced and the oversight of it, along with the protections and safeguards that would need to be a part of it. The then Prime Minister released the Productivity Commission's report in August 2011. In March 2013, the NDIS legislation was passed-a very proud day-and the NDIS Act 2013 was created, along with the NDIS and the National Disability Insurance Agency. Regional offices were established, and each of the first-year launch sites was put in place to manage implementation on the ground. We have heard a lot of feedback from those launch sites on how important this scheme is to Australians. Labor will keep fighting to protect the NDIS that we created, and we will certainly defend it, particularly from the attacks we are seeing. The NDIS should not have to suffer because of the political game playing that we are seeing at the moment from the government. This is too important for our country and too important for the future of those people with a disability and their families to have it be part of some political game that the government wants to play. Labor created the NDIS, we designed the NDIS and we fully funded it. We have made that very clear on many occasions and let's make it extremely clear again tonight. As a result of those initiatives, thousands of people across the country continue to have their lives transformed. In my electorate of RichmondI have spoken to many people who are eagerly awaiting the rollout of the scheme in our area in July. I have heard lots of positive feedback from other people around the country about what a difference it makes to them and how it will really empower them and change their lives. There may have been some small teething problems and changes as we moved to a new system, but I think overall there is strong community support for this scheme. I hear it all the time, not just from individuals and families but from community organisations and larger organisations who are all very keen to work together to get this great outcome. I will continue to fight to ensure that those in our community receive the full support that is afforded to them under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. People in my community and throughout the country should not have to worry about the future of the scheme. I cannot underestimate the level of distress that has been caused this week with the government holding the NDIS to ransom and with the language they have used and the upset they have caused. The fact is, people with disabilities, their families, their carers and their communities know that Labor has their best interests at heart. They know that Labor has fought for, designed and funded the NDIS. We continue to do that in this House, we will continue to do that in the community and we will continue to stand up for those people who need us. We have always fought to protect them and we always will, because we understand the importance of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) (19:20): I am delighted to speak today. I know much has been said about the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016, but for me this is personal. In my working life there have been very few major dramatic social advances. Medibank, now Medicare, was one. Most change, however, has been incremental, usually barely noticeable but sometimes bitterly fought. The most dramatic change in social policy since Medicare has had bipartisan support-I thought. It was fully funded by the Labor Party and has dramatically changed the lives of many of the families I have cared for over my many years working as a paediatrician. For many children with disabilities that I have seen, the NDIS has been truly dramatic. Almost universally, parents of children with disabilities worry about what will happen to their children as they themselves age and also how they can afford the ongoing costs in caring for someone who cannot ever support themselves or will need help to support themselves. Some felt forever chained to the role of supporting parent, never able to let go, even in very old age. I have seen parents in their 80s still wondering what will happen to their child with a severe disability. Many of the children I have seen can never feed or toilet themselves. Many had intractable seizures, severe cerebral palsy, visual impairment, hearing loss and multiple congenital abnormalities. They are human beings nevertheless and deserve to be treated with dignity, care and compassion. They have as much right to share in the wealth of this country as I do. The Labor Party and the Liberal-National Party gave bipartisan support to the NDIS. The NDIS gives these people support, where in the past they got none or very little. It gives them and their families certainty to plan their futures in the knowledge that we will all share in supporting their burden, that we will act as an inclusive society and, using the government's own language, we will all lift together. Of itself, this bill represents a very small cog within the grand design that is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. NDIS trials were completed in 2016, and there are now over 30,000 people participating. That number will ramp up very rapidly over the next three financial years, and the current estimates are that the annual cost of the scheme will hit $22 billion by the financial year 2019-20. The costs were factored in with the NDIS, and there was unanimous parliamentary agreement. Labor has consistently argued for full NDIS funding, and we will continue to work with the government to ensure this comes to fruition. The bill is planned to create a special account within the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund, required under the Constitution as the repository of all federal government moneys. The Treasurer, never one to undersell even the most unremarkable of this government's limited achievements, has lauded this proposal as a 'locked box', trying to safeguard the NDIS from the depredations of future governments. This has caused unending distress amongst people who are eligible for the NDIS and their families. Notwithstanding the Treasurer's and various ministers' confected anger about the NDIS funding arrangements, they are all aware that there are no 'locked boxes' in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As the journalist and ex-Treasury officer Peter Martin wrote only a few days ago, the locked-box analogy is not well made. The Constitution makes the Consolidated Revenue Fund a single fund which may include special accounts, but neither the Consolidated Revenue Fund nor the accounts within it can ever be seen as a locked box. That is the case whether the special account is created by legislation or administratively, as many special accounts are. This one could have been created administratively too, if that was what the government really wanted-and you wonder why it was not. It seems that the government cannot explain this properly either. Neither the minister's second reading speech nor the explanatory memorandum have assisted debate today on why the legislative path was selected. It is at this point that the government needs to be called out. What the government is doing is using the NDIS and people with disabilities as a pawn in its political game-playing. I remain totally mystified, as do others, by the minister's claim that money moved from any proposed special account to the CRF is somehow lost to the NDIS. That is like saying that money in a bank is lost to its customers if it is moved from one vault to another-totally mystifying. None of these arcane accounting niceties would amount to much if it were not for the fact that the Turnbull government seems to have allied this partitioning-off approach to sourcing money to fund the NDIS. The government's line-it is a bit ambitious, I think, to call it its thinking-seems to be that, apart from the funds raised from Labor's increase to the Medicare levy and the contributions from the states and territories, the only way you can add to the fund is by drawing off moneys earmarked for other forms of social and welfare spending. It is also ramping up its rhetoric by somehow trying to link the NDIS funding to its so-called omnibus bill. Overall, I strongly believe this is a shameful attempt to link cuts to supports for some other very vulnerable people to the NDIS funding. This, I reiterate, is causing unbelievable distress to people and families with disabilities. This is an attempt to politicise something that has previously had bipartisan support. I think this reflects that, for the Liberal Party, anyone who requires support or deals with Centrelink or the NDIS is seen as a liability and has to be compartmentalised, isolated and not seen to be as worthy as other people. This bill, as does the omnibus bill, sends a very bad message. The NDIS had bipartisan support. For example, the member for Warringah, in particular, was a strong advocate for the NDIS. Funding was agreed upon. It comes as something of a shock to see this government, for no particularly good reason, trying to segregate it. People with disabilities need to know that they are valuable members of our country, they are supported and they have as much right to the resources of this country as any other Australian. I want the Treasurer to stop his insincere rantings full of renal output and flatulence-that is piss and wind, to the uninitiated. It is just not right. It is insulting and it sends a very poor message. It is all the more pity then that the government has again sought to use this arguably unnecessary bill as a device to revive its spurious and unsubstantiated claim that the Labor Party failed to fund the scheme that we first legislated for what is heading up to four years ago. The government has been making this claim since it entered full election mode in late 2015 but without trying to substantiate it. When given the opportunity to do so by way of a Senate inquiry when this bill was last before the parliament, in May, it singularly failed to take up Labor's challenge. The government has made varying claims about the alleged size of the shortfall but never explains what it is down to, never explains what it is talking about and what the differences are. It will not even say if it arises from reasons such as previously unidentified demand for the NDIS now revealed through the trial and pilot programs the intergovernmental agreement established for that very purpose-of getting a better handle on costs. Nor does the government say if the alleged shortfall arises from a revenue gap related to the fact that the increased Medicare levy has not been as high as expected, because of fairly static incomes. If it is the latter, the government must take responsibility, as lower-than-budgeted tax receipts are due to the uninspiring levels of economic activity under this government, and it must take responsibility. That is something both Treasury and the RBA have pointed out, but the government's eloquent silence on this leaves us all guessing. As the member for Jagajaga, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, has made clear, the 2013-14 budget provided full funding for the NDIS for the first 10 years-that is seven years on top of the normal forward estimates horizon. The sources of that funding are well-known. They were not somehow spirited away like Shakespeare's princes in the tower during the last days of the Rudd governmentconclude his remarks when the debate resumes. That the House do now adjourn. Holt Electorate: Australia Day Awards that I had the privilege of honouring on Australia Day as part of the 13th Annual Holt Australia Day Awards. Twenty-eight outstanding individuals and seven local organisations were collectively commended for their contribution to our community at the Day of Nations celebration in Hampton Park. This great event was organised by Erica Maliki and Vanassa Gerdes from the Hampton Park Networking Group and supported by the City of Casey. We were also commemorating the 100th anniversary of Hampton Park on this day, so it was a very special day. Our area does not get a lot of positive publicity. One of the reasons I was so insistent on conducting these Australia Day awards-which have been tremendously well supported by the City of Casey and now the Hampton Park Networking Group-was to emphasis the amazing contributions made by so many people and so many organisations in my area that make our community a better place. And you do not read about them. They are not people who seek publicity in this age of instant celebrity, of instant fame through Instagram, Facebook, Google and Twitter. These are not the sorts of people who try to seek that recognition. These are the people who make the community work, people like Len from the Narre Warren Bowls Club. Len is, effectively, a blind bowler but he contributes enormously around the bowls club. He had to almost be physically dragged to this event to be publicly honoured, and that says a lot about the quality of the spirit of the people of my area. It is a microcosm of what is great about our community-the Australian community. Selflessly dedicating their lives to others without seeking recognition for it is an essential element of the Australian character. It is quintessentially Australian, and that is why I like to celebrate it on Australia Day. It is also why it gets such enormous support in my area. We had hundreds and hundreds of people there. It would have been an event that you would have enjoyed, Mr Speaker, and it is an event that has been increasingly well supported. The",162,Bills

Those people show the diversity of our community and the diversity of contributions made to our community. I spoke about Len from the Narre Warren Bowls Club. Amongst the award recipients was the Cranbourne library, which worked in partnership with the Casey Cardinia Library Corporation. They launched what is called a 'forgiving tree' that delivered muchneeded resources for local charities in the lead-up to Christmas. In its first year ever, the initiative of the library, which was to forgive book fines and other fees in exchange for a donation to the library's forgiving tree, raised more than $15,000 for local charities. Cranbourne Library partnered with the Cranbourne Information and Support Service to pass on these donations to the less fortunate so they could enjoy a decent Christmas. There it isjust one single initiative like that. Destanee Aiava, who I think we will see lighting up our TV screens in tennis, is a 12-yearold who became an international star by winning the Longines Future Tennis Aces Tournament at Roland Garros in Paris. She, and the 35 other recipients, are examples of the significant difference you can make when you contribute to the community. I was honoured to honour them on Australia Day. They signify the best of what it is to be an Australian and the best in terms of what people do for our community. Housing Affordability Maranoa all my life. Maranoa takes up 42 per cent of Queensland, predominantly Western Queensland, and it has provided me with the opportunity to have a career, to travel the world, to start a business but, above all, to raise a family. We hear a lot about housing affordability in metropolitan Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne-that is real; I take that for granted-and that is why I support the Deputy Prime Minister in his quest for decentralisation, particularly his commissioning of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the transitioning regional economies. In my electorate alone, in just my three major centres of Warwick, Dalby and Kingaroy, there are 400 homes available under $250,000. But couple that with the over 860 jobs available across those communities, ranging from truck driving to professionals in the health and education sectors, there are enormous opportunities to be grasped by those who want to venture to regions right across Australia, not just Maranoa.",169,Adjournment
211,Mr Littleproud (Maranoa) (19:35,"I am proud to say I have lived and worked inIt is important that we understand and appreciate that this government has already started that journey. We started that journey with the investment we made in regional and rural Australia. A federal government's responsibility is not to get involved in the daily lives of the citizens but to create the environment and the infrastructure around them, for them to create their own lives and to be able to innovate and create wealth in business investment. This government has done that through the three trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and China. They are having an enormous impact on the profits and losses of the businesses in my electorate right here, right now. They are putting real wealth into businesses and communities in regional Australia-wealth that is flowing into small businesses and allowing the growth of those small communities. One in seven people are employed in the retail sector across my electorate, and that is coming from the direct impact of the trade agreements that are putting money in primary producers' pockets. But it is also about the next step that we are trying to undertake with our tax cuts for small businesses. For the Labor Party to say that this is for big business is absolute nonsense. The first tranche of this goes to those businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. That is not a big business; that is a mum and dad operation. That will put real dollars back in their pockets and help them reinvest in their communities and employ more people in regional and remote Australia. That is a real economic lever that we are pulling that will create wealth and prosperity in regional and rural Australia. Then we move on to infrastructure. The key word in infrastructure for the people of Maranoa and regional and rural Australia is 'connectivity'-connectivity with the tools of the 21st century to take advantage of the trade agreements that we put in place. That is around the Mobile Phone Black Spot Program-for example, in my electorate alone, 35 new towers, and 16 of those are all up and going. The reality is that 68,000 households and businesses across Maranoa will have the NBN put into their premise before the end of 2018-long before a lot of metropolitan areas. I am proud to say that we have done that. But it is not just the economic benefits but also the social benefits. We have done this in consultation with the ICPA to ensure that those kids who are on distance education are able to have a designated distance education plan to ensure that they can stay in the regional communities and we keep that precious human capital that is out there. It is also about the roads-and it is good to see my good friend the member for Groom here. We are putting $1.6 billion into Second Range Crossing. There is $65 million going to the Warrego Highway, connecting our product to the world and allowing the effects of that trade agreement to flow into the pockets of the people of Maranoa. It is an enormous investment. Couple that with inland rail. I acknowledge Darren Chester, the minister, for the courageous and brave step of actually undertaking inland rail and making sure it will start and make the difference for all those who are connected to it. But it is also about our health-and it is good to see the regional health minister here today. I am proud to say that we as a government only recently committed to put in place a rural health commissioner. That ensures that the health of those people living in rural and regional Australia is protected, so that we in rural and regional Australia become a community of choice-to live and to be able to do commerce in. That is the advantage of living in regional and rural Australia. We have a lifestyle to celebrate and to excel in. We have put a framework around the environment and infrastructure that we should be proud of. We have done the hard work but now is the time to take it to the next level, because healthy regions mean a healthy Australia. We should be proud to invest in regional and rural Australia. We should be proud of the investment this government has made in three or four short years. It would never have been done under anyone else but this coalition government. Centrelink Centrelink robo-debt debacle and the impact it is having on everyday Australians, including many good people who live in my electorate. Over the course of this year my office and many other MPs' offices have received numerous calls from members of the community who are confused about the Turnbull government's intentions. They are confused at having received letters demanding payments for Centrelink debts that originate from many years ago. They are confused that the letters fail to properly outline the nature of the debt and often incorrectly calculate the debt. And they are confused that Prime Minister Turnbull and the Minister for Human Services would endorse a 'debt collector at the door' style shakedown of vulnerable Australians. I particularly want to refer to the experience of one of my constituents, Leah Haines. Leah has advised my office that she received a letter from Centrelink, dated 16 January this year, indicating that she had a debt of over $10,000 from the period 9 August 2011 to 13 June 2012. Of the $11,734.23 of disability support pension she received five years ago, Leah is now being told she needs to repay over 90 per cent of that. When Leah was receiving DSP, her husband worked for Startrak Express. Initially he was employed as a casual employee and then later as a permanent staff member. As a result, like many Australian families, their income changed from week to week, because they were trying to do the right thing by their family and by the economy. Each fortnight, as she needed to do, Leah faithfully reported the family income to Centrelink. As a result, her DSP payments were varied each fortnight. As I said before, five years later, Leah received a debt notice. Leah appealed Centrelink's claim that she has a debt, and early FebruaryI forwarded Leah's concerns to the minister and asked that he respond. Leah has since been advised by Centrelink that her appeal has been rejected. Subsequently, she has lodged an appeal with the AAT. Most concerning to me is the most recent advice Centrelink has given to Leah and which she has relayed to me. Leah has been advised that she had indeed reported her income at the time, as she was required to, but there was a processing mistake and, as a result, the debt still stands. This is Centrelink's story. So, even on their own accounting, the problem was not created by Leah but was created by Centrelink's processing error. Their position is that Leah should have second-guessed Centrelink's advice at the time. Because she trusted Centrelink to get it right, the government is now punishing her for their mistakes. This is having a terrible impact on Leah's family and on her health. Because of the debt that has been created against them, there is uncertainty. They are unable to get a loan to have their family car fixed, which means that they are not able to easily take their son, who requires special medical care, to his appointments. They also cannot buy a new fridge which they",170,Adjournment
212,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (19:40,"I rise today to speak about the government'sneed. They have been left in an unacceptable situation and a situation of uncertainty, and I call on the minister to work with Leah and her family to resolve their case. The minister must take a new approach to this matter. If the Commonwealth identify a debt from a long time ago they need to be more understanding in working through the circumstances with those involved and reaching a fair outcome. If there are debts, they should be repaid but this should be done through a mechanism that is fair for the family involved. It is unacceptable that someone who appears to have done the right thing, as in Leah's case, to have reported their income as required and to have trusted Centrelink to pay them correctly, has been left so exposed by the minister's robo-debt debacle. I note today that the minister has finally conceded that his debacle of a system is not working and he has announced changes. But the minister needs to go further and heed Labor's call to suspend the program until all of these issues can be worked out. And the minister must assist all of those people who have already been caught up in this debacle and help them navigate through this government's terrible mess. Postle, Mr Arthur Benjamin Dr McVEIGH (Groom) (19:45): The new Toowoomba Sport Hall of Fame committee has recently announced its first inductees, including rugby league players Tom Gorman and John 'Cracker' McDonald-of whom I have spoken about in this chamber previously, hockey legend Nikki Hudson, and professional runner Arthur Postle. This evening I would like to focus on one of those: Arthur Postle, 'The Crimson Flash'. Arthur was born on 8 March 1881 at Springside near Pittsworth on the Darling Downs, south-west of Toowoomba, and he was the second of nine children. On leaving school, Arthur worked on the family farm and, despite his father's disapproval, competed successfully at professional athletics meetings around the Darling Downs, including sweeping all events at a Toowoomba meet when he was just 14. He left the farm in 1899 to pursue his athletic career, and he quickly became well-recognised in his distinctive crimson costume, with victories in Charters Towers and Townsville against elite sprinting company. He later achieved world fame in that crimson costume as The Crimson Flash-as he became known-when, before a crowd of 20,000 people at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, on 5 December 1906 he defeated Irish world champion Bernard Day in a 75-yard race in the time of 7.2 seconds-a record which was not broken until the 1970s. He did not stay in Australia long, as he ventured overseas to race-and win-in England, Wales, Scotland, South Africa and New Zealand. It was during this period that The Crimson Flash became known as 'The Mighty Postle,' given his defeat of the English champion W Growcott in England in 1908 and his epic contests with South African champion Reg Walker. His greatest challenges on the track, though, came from back home in Australia, where he had a formidable rivalry with Jack Donaldson. Known for his explosive starts, Postle was virtually unbeatable over shorter distances, setting world records over 50, 60, 75 and 80 yards, whilst Donaldson won most of the races over 100 yards or longer. However, at a 1912 exhibition in Auckland, Postle turned the tables on his great rival-winning the 75-, 150and 200-yard events on the one day and, in so doing, setting a new world record for the 200 at 19 seconds. He retired the following year, but never lost his passion for athletics. He took up making running shoes for athletes, which was remarkable for the fact that he had spent most of his career running barefoot, often on very rough ground. Until his passing, Arthur was a familiar sight at Wynnum Memorial Park in Brisbane, giving advice to many youngsters who came along, during the week and on weekends, to attend his regular coaching sessions. As a local representative, I am very proud to say that today, Arthur still has direct descendants living on the Darling Downs. I am also particularly proud of the fact that local communities in our electorate of Groom continue-and have continued over all of those years since Arthur Postle's days-to encourage children to engage in sport-boys in rugby, girls in netball, athletics, swimming; you name it. For some, that can lead-as we all know-to local, state, national and international success. Most importantly, for most of us and most of our children, it means the reward of simply enjoying the satisfaction of having had a go, remaining active and, of course, having fun. I know that that is the case, not only in our electorate of Groom but right across our great nation. Today, just as we-quite rightlyrecognise our sporting heroes at a local, state, national and international level, so too should we continue to celebrate the successes of those from the past generations, such as The Mighty Postle-The Crimson Flash. Regional Australia Ms KEAY (Braddon) (19:49): Mr Speaker, I rise tonight to raise the issue of regional inequality. In so many areas-health, education, employment, telecommunications and supporting those doing it tough-the government appears to ignore the regions. Their single biggest plan for the nation is a $50-billion tax cut to big business. But how will this address regional inequality? For example, Braddon has some of the worse health indicators in Australia. A person living in Braddon has a life expectancy of 79 years, compared to someone living in urban Sydney of 84.5 years. The poorer health indicators in Braddon play out in admissions to public hospitals and visits to the GP. And what is the government's response? An attack on the very tool that supports preventative health outcomes-the Medicare rebate freeze. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners President, Dr Bastian Seidel, who practices in regional Tasmania, says this about the freeze: We know that financially vulnerable patients will delay seeing their GP if they are faced with increased out of pocket expenses, and they will eventually call an ambulance or present to emergency departments at a much greater cost to the taxpayer. When it comes to educational outcomes, the picture for young people in my electorate further demonstrates inequality. Full-time participation in secondary schools in Braddon sits at 67.4 per cent, compared to the Prime Minister's local area of Woollahara at 83.6 per cent, and yet this government is axing the needs-based Gonski funding-the very funding designed to support every young person to give them the skills to receive a quality long-term education. When it comes to employment, Braddon and Tasmania are suffering a jobs crisis, with a crash in full-time work. According to the ABS, Tasmania has lost 7,600 full-time jobs since November 2015, with part-time and casual work filling the gaps. Just recently, one local business changed ownership. While the employees kept their jobs, they have all gone from full-time to casual. As we look to the future in telecommunications, the digital divide between city and regions continues to grow-but again, how has the government responded? They are rolling out a second-class fibre-to-the-node NBN to our largest cities, Burnie and Devonport. Burnie Mayor, Anita Dow states: Access to a fibre-to-the-premises NBN connection is a key factor in driving innovation to the Burnie CBD. There is a need for infrastructure to support a city and region that needs to be clever and connected to the world. The government's program for mobile phone base stations that would allow people in my electorate to access digital services via their smart phones is equally a fiasco. Round1 locations are delayed and, despite the government promising work would start immediately in areas such as Sulphur Creek, these have now been deferred. Owner of Inglenook by the Sea B&B at Sulphur Creek, Ron Dennison, has said everyone is dependent on their mobile phone in today's day and age. While his guests are able to get internet access, they cannot make mobile phone calls and he offers them the use of his landline. He is frustrated by the long wait in getting the problem fixed and said he has noticed a decline in the number of corporate visits, which he attributes to the lack of mobile phone reception. This is 2017, not 1917. In nearly every indicator, people living in the regions face challenges, so you can imagine their disgust when the support networks established by successive governments are now under attack. This government wants to cut pensions and payments to families-cuts that will disproportionally affect the regions-and it wants to make the people of my electorate, who have worked in some of the most difficult circumstance you can find, work until they are 70 years of age. In December last year, I received an email from Ray and Trudi French of Turners Beach that best sums up this issue. They said: Dear Justine thanks for getting back to us and sending the information on our entitlements. After reading through it, it comes as no surprise to see what the present government is trying to do to people of our age. The one thing that gets under our skin is the changing of the retirement age. We think it is disgusting that people who have worked hard all of their lives may now be expected to work until they are 70. We may have voted them in last time, but it was a first and last time. They have made blunder after blunder and if what people that we know, are anything to go on, they will be out next time. This government's policies do not address regional inequality; they entrench it. SoI say to the Prime Minster: dump your $50 billion in tax cuts for big business and, instead, invest in the people from regional Australia. Perth Freight Link March will be one of the most important elections for decades. Western Australians will be able to decide whether Roe8 and Roe9 construction continues under the Liberal Party or whether the project is cancelled under the Labor Party. There is a lot at stake for our community south of the river. Our local roads are becoming more congested with cars and trucks. The Liberal Party is taking action to make our local roads safer and create up to 10, 000 jobs. The Liberal Party is building the long-awaited and desperately needed Roe8 and Roe9 as part of the Perth Freight Link. Labor has sided with the Greens and the protesters.",172,Adjournment
213,Mr Morton (Tangney) (19:54,"Elections are about choices. The WA state election inLabor will tear up the contracts and Labor will cancel up to 10,000 local jobs for Western Australians. Now more than ever, WA needs Roe8 and Roe9 and local jobs. Now is not the time for Labor to cut WA jobs. Roe8 and Roe9 are recognised by Infrastructure Australia as being part of one of the highest transport priorities in Australia. Roe8 and 9 will bypass 14 sets of traffic lights on Leach Highway and Stock Road. Roe8 and 9 will remove approximately 7,000 trucks and 74,000 cars each day from Leach Highway, Farrington Road, South Street, Stock Road, North Lake Road, Beeliar Drive and other local roads. And, despite the lies and misinformation from Labor and the protesters, cars will not pay any tolls to use Roe8 or Roe 9. Roe8 and 9 are also leading the way in environmental design. Construction of Roe8 impacts only 0.49 per cent of the entire Beeliar Wetlands. That is less than one per cent. Roe8 and 9 are expected to save 450,000 tons of CO2 by 2031. Construction is on land already partly cleared for overhead power lines. Wetlands Bridges over Roe Swamp and Horse Paddock Swamp will maintain ecological connections for native animals. More than $45 million has been invested in Roe8 alone to specifically accommodate environmental sensitivities and to provide better recreational access. In partnership, the federal Liberal government and state Liberal government are investing $1.9 billion in this critical infrastructure south of the river. But what is Labor's position? Labor has sided with the Greens and the protestors against the construction of Roe8 and Roe 9. Labor will tear up the contracts, cancel construction and Labor will cancel the up to 10,000 jobs the project will create. One point two billion dollars of the project's funding is being provided by the federal government. These funds are provided for this project and this project alone. Labor's reckless decision will deny Western Australians a $1.2 billion federal government investment in infrastructure. Labor's reckless decision will deny Western Australians jobs. Labor's reckless decision will make our south-of-the-river community less safe and more congested. But most concerning is that Labor has said that, if they had access to those infrastructure funds, they would move them out of our local south-of the-river community and divert them to their marginal seat promises, like those north of the river, including upgrades to Ocean Reef Road and Joondalup Drive. To be very clear: Labor wants to take away funds committed to our community south of the river to fund their marginal seat election commitments elsewhere. This election we can make a difference. We can take a stand for the southern suburbs. We can say that enough is enough and now is not the time to lose infrastructure investment in our southern suburbs. So this is your choice: you can vote for Labor or the Greens and you can stop the project, you can stop the jobs and you can keep the trucks and cars on our local roads or you can vote for your local Liberal candidate. By voting for your local Liberal candidate, you will be saying yes to making our streets safer and less congested; you will be saying yes to keeping the up to 10,000 jobs created by Roe8 and Roe 9; you will be saying yes to freeway access east and west across our city; and you will be saying, 'Yes, the south-of-theriver community does matter.' Only the Liberals will build Roe8 and Roe 9.

219,Mr Mccormack: To Move:,"Wednesday, 15 February 2017 Asylum Seekers Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (10:00): I represent one of the most multicultural communities in Australia, and we have benefited enormously from the many waves of refugees who have come to make their home in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I am also very lucky to represent a very wide community of people who are passionate about refugee and asylum seeker issues. One such family who through their church provide a lot of support to refugee families have approached me about a particular example that I want to share with the parliament because I think it is a good illustration of the perverse, nonsensical outcome of government policy and the way in which not just families but we as Australians are suffering from the consequences. The example family in question are originally from Iran. Some years ago, they became interested in the teachings of Christianity. Because of their friendships in that community, people within the family lost their jobs, and they began to be victimised, essentially, by the people around them. The family were able to escape to Malaysia in 2008, where they became fluent in English. Eventually one of the younger sons in the family was accepted to study at RMIT, and the family followed him here to Australia. The family applied for asylum in 2013, and they have spent the last 3½ years waiting, living a life in limbo, for the outcome of a decision about whether they will be allowed to stay in Australia. They have been on temporary visas and on bridging visas, and they are still unaware today as to whether they will be allowed to continue the life that they are beginning to build here. They are a family who want to make something of their lives. They are a family who care passionately about education, and they want their two sons to pursue university studies. Those boys are desperately keen to get into a course that will help them on track to a professional life, a life that was lived by their parents, but instead they have been forced into just manual labour, trying to make ends meet, because they really have no idea as to whether they will be allowed to stay in this country. They are being held back by government policy. I believe that the length of time that the family are being made to wait is intolerable. Three and a half years is simply too long to live in limbo. I said this matter was raised with me by a local family, and I said that through their church they support several families who are in this position. So it is not just this family. There are many around Australia who are living in these exact same circumstances. Three and a half years is an intolerable time to wait to have your future determined. I want to put on the record before this parliament that, on behalf of the people of Hotham, I do not support this approach, especially in a country like ours, where we have benefited so much-especially in the old days, where we actually had a refugee policy that was designed to help people set themselves up here, to help them learn English, to help them find a home and to help them find work. But those days are here no longer, it seems. These families have lived here for years. They feel",177,Notices

I think it is in the best interests of the country that those policies change. Gilmore Electorate: Agricultural Shows electorates like mine, we are overtaken by show society fever. Gilmore is in the lucky position of having six wonderful shows spread through the months. As I was standing at the gate on Saturday afternoon in the steaming heat, I reflected on the extraordinary efforts of all of those involved, because we were all suffering from the heat. From the eager competitors in the artworks, the photography and the amazing flowers to the bullock trains, showjumping and woodchopping, it is all a colourful, noisy, exciting medley of activities. However, it is the hundreds of volunteers on the committees; the stewards; the judges; the Lions and Rotary clubs, who look after the gates and help collect the ticketing money on those gates; and the St John Ambulance volunteers who all enable the show to actually take place. Congratulations to the dedicated committees of each and every one of our different shows for all the work that they have done. The shows are held in Kiama; Berry; Kangaroo Valley, whose show is this weekend; Nowra, whose show was last weekend; Milton, whose show is to come; and the Eurobodalla, whose show was a couple of weeks ago. They have regenerated interest in the show girls competition, which is not just about wearing a pretty sash over a great dress; it is about encouraging young women to embrace our local strengths in agriculture and raising awareness of the central importance of this industry to our local area, from dairy and vineyards to cattle. They do a great job as ambassadors for the agriculture industry. There are increasing numbers of young people getting into agriculture in many different ways. There are enterprises in our region that are just beginning to explore export and things like that, and some of them actually display their goods at the show, so it is a chance to have taste testing and all sorts of different things. I commend those businesses as well. However, the overwhelming entries in our shows are from dedicated amateurs like Vonnie Muller, a show winner in multiple categories at a number of shows. Last Friday, I was deeply honoured that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, accepted an invitation to visit Gilmore especially to see the activities of the show. He actually met Vonnie. She signed her recipe book for him. On a scorching hot day, Malcolm saw the great show that Nowra puts on and met the famous Vonnie. Special thanks go to the committee of the Nowra Show and especially Wendy Woodward, who kept us on the move with a very tight schedule. We went from meeting and greeting at the gate and talking to volunteers to the students at Nowra East Public School as we walked past. There were cameras everywhere and the young ones saying, 'Oh my goodness; what's going on?' But they were thrilled and shook the hands of the PM. We walked up there and met people enjoying the show. Then we went up into the pavilion and talked to them. We talked on our local radio station, 2ST Power FM. They were very pleased. We walked down and talked to the camels, went to the clydesdales, met Mulligan and a little lad with ribbons on a horse. It was just a great day for the PM to be in our region.",179,Constituency Statements
221,Mrs Sudmalis (Gilmore) (10:03,"During January, February and March in regionalSuperannuation level of unpaid and underpaid superannuation in Australia. At an industry briefing held in the parliament yesterday, members were told as many as one-third of eligible workers are being short-changed. Over 2013-14, more than 2.4 million Australians were robbed of more than $3.6 billion. In my electorate of Lyons, the cost to each worker is $2,137, higher than the national average. My office has been helping a shearer, John, who is concerned that several of his employers have failed to pay his super. John is nearing retirement after a lifetime of punishing physical work on the rail lines and in the shearing sheds, and he is worried about how he will survive in retirement. John is typical of many workers who give little thought to super till they get near retirement and then spend months chasing up accounts, only to find some payments have not been made, and then they spend more time chasing the money that is owed. Superannuation is not a gift that is paid at an employer's whim. It is a legislated right the same as wages, the same as workplace safety, and it is time it is treated as such. When employers do not pay it, they are robbing employees of a decent retirement income and they add to pressures on future pension payments. Any employer who fails to pay superannuation is a thief, and what is also thievery, if not illegal, is a loophole that allows some employers not to pay any super contributions at all. An ATO ruling from 2006 allows employers to reduce their own contribution when employees salary sacrifice into super. Essentially, the employee's payments do not add to the 9.5 per cent; they replace it-a cruel blow for employees who sacrifice weekly income, believing they are adding to their retirement nest egg. Sixty-one per cent of employees affected by this loophole earn less than $80,000 a year, with the average cost to them being $75 a week. That is a massive cost and it is essentially a direct payment from a worker back to their employer. This loophole is clearly an unintended consequence of legislation, and action should be taken immediately to close it. I note that a Senate inquiry is underway, with public submissions closing this week. I urge the Senate inquiry to consider these important matters as well as the feasibility of superannuation being paid as part of the pay schedule and not quarterly, with a view to modernising, streamlining and making more transparent Australia's great superannuation system. Sunshine Coast: Infrastructure the Sunshine Coast 23 years ago for a better quality of life, and that is what we found. I am pleased to say that we have not been alone. From a population in the tens of thousands in 1975, the latest data suggests that more than 340,000 now call Australia's 10th-largest city their home. This steady stream of new neighbours is set to become a flood in the coming years, with 100,000 more forecast to join us by 2026 and another 100,000 in the following decade. So many are coming that completely new cities like the Aura development, Palmview and Beerwah East will soon be springing up amongst us. The new development does not end there.

222,Mr Brian Mitchell (Lyons) (10:06,I rise today to talk about the unacceptable,181,Constituency Statements
223,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (10:09,"My wife, Leonie, our eldest daughter and I moved topart by a $181 million federal government concessional loan. We have new global businesses located in our community and new start-ups every year. We also have the new and exciting greenfield CBD SunCentral project having commenced. But a community cannot double in size without the transport infrastructure to service it. We need dramatic improvements, and we need to start today. The federal government is doing its bit. Last spring, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport joined me on the Sunshine Coast to see for himself. I was proud to be part of this government when in September we announced the $929.3 million Bruce Highway upgrade between Caloundra Road and the Sunshine Motorway. This government also provided 80 per cent of the funding needed for the $8 million Bruce Highway upgrade planning study south of Caloundra. We are doing our bit, and I will be working hard with the minister to do more. But I ask: what are the Queensland Labor state government doing? When it comes to infrastructure, they are doing what they have done on so many other occasions. They are avoiding making decisions, commissioning yet another report and making it somebody else's problem. In short, they are doing nothing to get the Sunshine Coast the infrastructure that it needs and deserves. The Bruce Highway study has been scheduled by the state government to conclude in mid2018, but it must happen much sooner than that. We have repeatedly called on them to fasttrack the study, and I call on them to do so again today. We need upgrades now to all of our many congested roads, not only the Bruce Highway but others like Kawana Way, which will be the main arterial to our world-class $1.8 billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital. There is not much point in having a world-class hospital if you cannot get there. Recent upgrades to Kawana Way fall a long way short of delivering appropriate access to and from the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. Care Leavers Australia Network Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (10:12): TodayI rise to acknowledge the work of Care Leavers Australia Network, CLAN, and offer them my full support for a national independent redress scheme for Australian care leavers. There are over half a million people in Australia who have spent some of their childhood in Australia's orphanages, children's homes, foster care and mental institutions. In my community of Albury-Wodonga such orphanages were a part of my childhood. Every year we so looked forward to Band Sunday-going to St John's Orphanage and listening to the bands planning. It was an annual event of great excitement, but little did I appreciate the human suffering that was behind such a-for me-happy event. TodayI would like to acknowledge the report of the Australian Catholic Church and the statistics they have released regarding sexual crimes of the priests working between 1950 and 2009. The church surveyed 10 religious institutions and 75 church authorities to uncover the abuse data on priests, non-ordained brothers and sisters, and other church personnel employed in that time. In my electorate of Indi the figures are shocking. They show that in the Diocese of Sandhurst, which covers Indi, Bendigo and the electorate of Murray, with Sale, which is in the Gippsland electorate, it was 15.1 per cent, but in my electorate of Indi a shocking 14.7 per cent of the clergy were involved in some form of abuse. That is a huge statistic, and it presents itself daily in my office when members of CLAN come and talk to me. They talk of their suffering, of their pain and of the impact that such stuff has had on their lives. These are the statistics, and we hear their story. I wanted, in my speech today, to say to the members of CLAN and all the others-your family and your friends-that we do take a collective responsibility for what has happened. I stand here with great humility to say how sorry I am, to offer you my compassion, to acknowledge your pain and hurt, to acknowledge and thank you for your courage, your persistence and your dedication, and to say that, with every bit of energy that I have, I will lobby the Prime Minister and ministers to take the action needed for a national scheme. I will also write to the Bishop of Bendigo, Andrew Curnow, asking him to make a formal apology. But I say here and now that the people in this parliament acknowledge your hurt; we say thank you for what you have done, and we give you our commitment that we will do everything we can to make sure that you get the redress that you so richly deserve. Dunkley Electorate: Sky Rail my electorate of Dunkley. I refer to an article in yesterday's Herald Sun which mentions that Premier Daniel Andrews of the Victorian government 'won't rule out sky rail on Frankston line'. He said that a decision will be made 'quite soon'. I am very concerned that the Labor state government is not listening to the people. I should not have to get up here, as the federal member, to talk about what is, primarily, a state issue, but the state government is just not listening. Let's look, for example, at what has happened at the Cranbourne-Dandenong line and the protests that continue around the state government's decisions on sky rail on that line. Even the local council have said they do not want to go ahead with rail over road at two level crossings at Frankston and Seaford, and they do not want one to go ahead because they want to remove the road that crosses the rail. During my campaign I went to a number of different community events and community meetings on sky rail where hundreds of people turned up. Labor tried to deceive people months ago at the state level in Victoria, noting that they would not be doing sky rail. But all they ruled out was continuous sky rail between level crossings. They did not rule out going up, which is the residents' main concern. Labor also deceived people regarding the watertable making rail under road impossible, whereas engineers say it is possible and it has been done elsewhere. Many concerns about sky rail have been raised with me by residents, in particular the privacy of their houses and their yards, particularly around their children. They also raised concerns about noise. There are Ramsar Convention concerns, which impact at a federal level as well, regarding the Seaford Wetlands. Inga Peulich, the state member for the South Eastern Metropolitan Region, has particularly raised these concerns. Other concerns include the loss of amenity and the ruining of the beauty of our bayside suburbs, particularly as, with cut and cover, you could even build a park or greater accessibility on top. The opposition leader in Victoria, Matthew Guy, said: We have this government that wants to put dirty great big sky rails-elevated railway-which you would never do anywhere else in the world on your most visually beautiful parts of your city. New York wouldn't do it on Long Island, the South of France wouldn't do it along the coast near Marseille.",181,Constituency Statements
224,Mr Crewther (Dunkley) (10:15,"I rise today to speak about a significant concern forOther issues have been raised, including the reduction in house prices, the harm to businesses and the economy, and the visual bulk, especially when you have the sky rail and then a train and then a gantry-the amount of metreage going up is atrocious. There is also the impact it would have on the service of freight trains and the impact to residents in terms of additional noise, as well as crime and graffiti. There is also a lack of future consideration, when, ideally, in the long run, like in most major cities around the world, we should be going underground. (Time expired) Bombing of Darwin: 75th Anniversary Territory story. As many would be aware, this week marks the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin, which was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Some 242 Japanese aircrafts targeted our city and harbour on 19 February 1942. A number of military and merchant vessels were in the harbour during the attack, and many were sunk by the raid. Following the war, the wreckages of the ships caused logistical problems for our harbour and severely hindered future development of the port. A salvage operation went to open tender, and, somewhat ironically and controversially, a Japanese group, the Fujita Salvage Company, won the contract to clear the wrecks. As it had been less than two decades since the bombing, initially the workers were not permitted to set foot on Australian soil. Instead, the first ship they raised became the base and living quarters for the Japanese workers. Slowly but surely, a relationship sprung up between the Darwin community, Mr Fujita and the workers employed by the Fujita Salvage Company. During the salvage operation, construction of a new United Anglican Church was underway and conversations between Mr Fujita, the architect, the Japanese ambassador and the church led to the brass from the ship SS Zealandia that was being salvaged to be used to cast 77 bronze crosses for the new church. One of these bronze crosses now has pride of place in my Parliament House office and will be on display tomorrow morning in the Reps alcove. It is crucial that we, as a nation, never forget the events of World War II and the sacrifice of ordinary Australians who went through that terrible time. It is heartening to know that despite the damage and suffering that occurred during the war, especially to families living in Darwin, that we were able to forgive and move on from what happened. There is now a very strong relationship between Japan and Australia, and I like to think that the actions of people like Mr Fujita played a big part in building these strong relationships. Tomorrow, I join with my fellow NT parliamentarians to host a bipartisan event here at Parliament House to mark the 75th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin and the more than 243 lives that were lost. But we will also tell this story of the story of the Fujita Salvage Company and the reconciliation that has occurred in the years since. I want to thank of the generous sponsorship of the Northern Territory government, and I hope that members can join us in this bipartisan and historic event tomorrow morning. We will have members from the Uniting Church of Darwin in attendance as well as consular representation from the US and Japan, and from the British High Commission.

226,Mr Rick Wilson (O'connor) (10:22,"I rise today to congratulate some of mygive more than they take for the betterment of their fellow citizens. In O'Connor, we saw three tireless contributors recognised for their years of community service. Alice Rule has been a pillar of the Albany community for more than six decades since she moved to the Great Southern from Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Perhaps the most notable of Mrs Rule's many contributions to the Great Southern is her role as a founding member of the Keep Albany Beautiful Committee in 1971. In a relationship with the committee that has spanned more than 40 years, she has held almost every executive position and earned life membership. Mrs Rule has been a long-serving supporter of the sporting community in Albany, most prominently with local hockey and football leagues. She has links to various charities from the Salvation Army to the Red Cross and has volunteered for Meals on Wheels. But those acknowledgements barely scratch the surface of Mrs Rule's community work. Mrs Rule was not the only recipient in Albany this year; the same honour was awarded to Mrs Marion Sewell. This was not the first Australia Day that saw an honour bestowed upon Mrs Sewell. Five years ago, she received the Premier's Active Citizenship Award. Mrs Sewell is a long-serving volunteer for the St Vincent de Paul Society and has devoted many years to the Albany Holy Family Catholic Church, as a member of the choir and in the teaching of scripture. She has also turned her attention to the preservation of local history, the importance of which cannot be understated. Since 2005, Mrs Sewell has been involved with the Albany Regional Family History Society, including stints as treasurer and family research officer. Her sense of community has been ever present and felt far beyond Albany. Mrs Sewell received the Tambellup Meritorious Award in 1990. Further north in the WA Goldfields, Mr Ian Kealley received a medal for his efforts in the preservation of our natural environment. Mr Kealley's name is well-known in KalgoorlieBoulder, where he worked for the Department of Parks and Wildlife for more than 30 years. He has managed the regional branch, under its various badges and titles, since 1987. Mr Kealley helped establish the framework for the joint management of Indigenous protected areas throughout the region. He has spent decades working in this field with the Spinifex people in the east, right through to the Martu traditional owners in the far northern Goldfields. Mr Kealley is a founding member of the Goldfields Speciality Timber Group and the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Urban Landcare Group. I would like to, once again, formally acknowledge the efforts of these outstanding citizens. The community is indebted to each of you for your service over many years and I am confident in saying your respective communities would not be the same without you. We thank you for your service. New South Wales North Coast New South Wales shadow minister for the prevention of domestic violence but also the New South Wales shadow minister for small business, visited my electorate on the New South Wales North Coast. First in her capacity as shadow minister for small business we attended the Murwillumbah District Business Chamber breakfast where the shadow minister addressed the group and she heard from many local businesses in the region about the challenges and the opportunities that they face. Jenny Aitchison, though now the state member for Maitland, had previously operated a small business with her husband, and she outlined the history of that business to the chamber.",184,Constituency Statements
227,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (10:24,"I was very pleased recently that Jenny Aitchison, theIt was very interesting and informative. The members of the chamber were so pleased that a shadow minister for small business not only had come to their chamber breakfast to listen to and talk with them but also had such extensive small business experience. That was very valued and we had a great roundtable with all of the participants there as well. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the executive of the Murwillumbah District Business Chamber, including, but not limited to, David Vincent, Natascha Wernick and Ilze Jaunberzins, for their very kind invitation. I pay tribute to the hard work they do in both the business and broader community. I will also make mention of Ilze's capacity as member and representative of Women's Watch. This is a group that was established in the aftermath of the very harsh closure of the Tweed Valley Women's Service. As I have told the House before, in Christmas 2015 the Tweed Valley Women's Service had their contract cancelled and their funding slashed by their lead agency, On Track. The subsequent complete inaction by the New South Wales government and the North Coast National Party MPs over the closure of this service was both shameful and irresponsible. As both state members showed they were unwilling or unable to do the job they were elected to do, I launched a petition demanding that the New South Wales government restore the funding to the service. The community worked very hard with Women's Watch and, in just over 12 months, we achieved our goal of reaching over 10,000 signatures-a great achievement. Reaching this threshold means that a debate on the closure of this vital service will now be triggered in the New South Wales parliament. Also as part of the shadow minister's visit to my electorate she met with Women's Watch for the handover and presentation of the petition. I would like to thank Jenny Aitchison for coming to the North Coast and for taking this important petition to the state parliament. I also want to thank the community and applaud everyone for their victory in achieving more than 10,000 signatures. Further to the handover of this petition, the shadow minister hosted a roundtable on domestic violence. I thank all the local stakeholders from around the region who attended and contributed to the discussion on how we can continue to work together to stop domestic violence and improve support for all those affected. We discussed a whole range of issues, including support services, policing, health, housing, education and also legislative reform. It was great to have the input, experience and real commitment to working together that was shown by all the stakeholders who attended. I would again like to thank Jenny Aitchison for her visit the New South Wales North Coast and for meeting with so many local groups. I would also like to commend her on the great work she is doing right throughout New South Wales. Fadden Electorate: Schools wonderful work that my state schools do on the northern Gold Coast and to support the principals of those schools as they seek to make a difference. It is great to see the member for Lalor in the House, who I believe is a former state school principal. It has been a real privilege to support so many of the fetes of our state schools on the Gold Coast. It is great to be able to be the major sponsor for the Biggera Waters State School fete and the Coombabah State School fete. Our office will provide a range of free equipment-including marquees,",185,Constituency Statements
228,Mr Robert (Fadden) (10:27,"It is great to be able to rise here and acknowledge thetables, chairs and, in fact, anything we have-to support those schools to achieve their funding targets. All funds raised by our great school fetes go back to P&Cs, which are all about supporting their schools. The communities are stumping up. We are seeing some really great changes. Biggera Waters State School, in their biannual fetes, made $43,000 this year, which is an absolute and utter record. Coombabah State School likewise had a great result. The next fete we are going to support will be the Pacific Pines State High School 'Fiesta', which I think is a wonderful initiative by the new principal at that high school. They are looking to raise a whole swag of money to upgrade a bus. It is a great pleasure of mine to be the major sponsor for that. They are engaging the school and the broader community in the work that they are doing with market stalls, food trucks, tray displays, old McDonald's farm, a cake-decorating competition-which I will not be involved in but may well judge-and sports training sessions. It is on Sunday, 12 March from 9 am. I think it is going to be a great event. Pacific Pines State High School is a tremendous school. I recently spoke to the year 12s as they had their leadership commencement. It is an activity I have been involved in for almost a decade. It is one of the great priorities I put in my diary. I have not missed a single one. I spoke to their year 12s at Pacific Pine State High School and I encouraged them with three words: be, big, culture. To be big people, to be kind hearted and to be compassionate. Before we can have, we have got to do and before we do, we have to be. Let us be the types of people we want to be. I encouraged them to be big, to be big hearted, to be big dreamers, to the big thinkers, to be big in example, to rise above any circumstance and to be big people. Lastly, I encouraged that great bunch of year 12s to understand the importance of the culture that they are going to develop in their school and amongst their cohort-likes those they seek to lead. Drucker said, 'culture eats strategy for breakfast'. I think Drucker is right: If we get our culture right then strategy will follow seamlessly and easily, as will achievement. I am looking forward this year to see what Pacific Pines State High School can do. I am looking forward to their fiesta and I am looking forward to their year 12 leaders being, being big and being big in culture. statements has expired; however, if no member present objects, I will allow the period for statements to continue for another 30 minutes.

Dobell Electorate: Pearson, Mr Lester Dobell Electorate: Rotary Club of Gosford North Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (10:31): I rise today to recognise a life changing program running on the Central Coast: Save Our Kids. It was created by Lester Pearson, who was named 2017 Central Coast Citizen of the Year for his work with the program and another passion project, Coats for Kids, which provides warm clothing for children sleeping rough or in refuges. Lester has dedicated himself to supporting some of the most vulnerable young people on the coast. Save Our Kids began in 2011 at the Rotary Club of Gosford North and was founded as a youth suicide prevention program, which filled a gap that saw Rotary Club supporting young achievers but not doing as much as they would like to support those struggling with mental health issues.

SOKS was instrumental in delivering training for ASIST-Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training-to senior teachers and counsellors supporting youth in crisis. The program provides participants with the skills and understanding to identify at-risk students, make appropriate suicide interventions and provide suitable referrals. In addition to ASIST and safeTALK, SOKS has conducted a number of other programs with outstanding results: 14 LivingWorks safeTALK programs, seven LivingWorks ASIST, Five youth mental health first aid, 15 self-harming behaviours awareness, three accidental counsellor foundations and domestic violence awareness. Overall, 45 programs were conducted with 738 local participants. All these programs are delivered solely through donations. The club has raised over $250,000 to continue and expand SOKS, of which over $150,000 has been donated to Lifeline to continue the partnership and build capacity in the organisation locally. But behind the success of these programs and Lester's work and dedication is his own personal battle with his daughter's mental illness and depression. Lester and his wife Sue are holding it together, with some days better than others, but their work in supporting so many young people with mental health issues never prepared them for the impact their adult daughter's diagnosis and her subsequent experience would have on their family. I commend Lester and Sue as well is all at Gosford North Rotary for their work to give a life back to young people who may be close to losing it all. Without Save Our Kids and the programs that their funding has delivered, the lives of too many Central Coast kids could have been tragically cut short. I look forward to honouring you, Lester, at your annual benefactors and beneficiaries night coming up on 6 March and meeting some of those in whose lives you have made such a difference. Forrest Electorate: Val Lishman Health Research Foundation Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (10:34): The Val Lishman Health Research Foundation, based in Bunbury in the South West of WA, is the only regional based charity in Australia dedicated to advocating for and promoting local health research. This research will have significant health gains for regional Australia. The foundation is an independent organisation owned and run by the community with a very focused volunteer board. It is unique in Australia. The foundation only endorses high-quality projects, and a volunteer research management committee working with local community stakeholders advises the board on research priorities and assesses individual projects. People living in the South West and those around regional Australia will continue to benefit from the work of the foundation. Some of the current projects include mental health and improving quality of life for autistic children and their families in rural communities. The methamphetamine and alcohol project is another project. Previous projects include the professional development for suicide prevention, several cancer projects, health of the ageing workforce, Ross River virus research-just to name a few. The foundation was named after a truly inspirational and great man, Dr Val Lishman, AM. Dr Lishman died last year. I would like to read excerpts from The Man in the Surgical Mask; Val Lishman. A Life Well Lived, compiled by Margaret Mardon. In 1965 Dr Val Lishman, a surgeon, was the first specialist to work away from the city, in … Western Australia. We are inspired by his example of selfless community service, kindness and concern for holistic health. The Foundation, established at his retirement, celebrates his extraordinary career. [He] arrived here from the UK in the mid 60s to work at the hospital [in Bunbury] only to find that it hadn't been built. The first surgeon to practice outside of Perth, he was pioneering in many ways. Dr Lishman had great humility and was much loved and respected both for his work and for his personal kindness. In 1992, Val Lishman became a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to medicine through the establishment of a surgical practice in the South West of Western Australia. Given his outstanding contribution to medicine Val has been recognised by many awards. These are surpassed by the regard in which he is held by his patients and venerated by his profession. …… … In 1997, when Dr Lishman announced his retirement, the inaugural board asked his permission to name the Foundation in recognition of his service and contributions to medicine in the South West. Val was stunned and honoured by the establishment of the Foundation. He said, ""Every hospital or group of doctors should have research. Research directly benefits hospitals. Young doctors, registrars, and interns should be encouraged to work on projects. Advancement results from everyone looking at their work critically, following up ideas and sharing them with other people"". Vale, Dr Lishman. The work of the Lishman Foundation will endure in the same way that his personal legacy will endure. Climate Change report-a report that confirmed that carbon pollution levels under this government were not only rising, but that they would continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Bizarrely, pollution results under Mr Malco the rest of the world is investing in renewable energy. We have seen renewable energy under this government go backwards at an alarming rate. Some 3,000 jobs have been lost, while in the rest of the world this industry has continued to grow. The energy industry, broader Australian industry as well as energy experts have made it clear: new coal-fired power stations are more expensive, dirtier and less flexible than all of the other alternatives. One of the world's most respected energy analysts, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, have stated that these proposed new coal-fired power stations would increase energy prices. Such is the state of the international market that coal-fired power stations struggle to get the investment required to make them viable. It is a damning indictment of the government's clean coal debacle that Professor Clive Hamilton from Charles Sturt University tendered his resignation from the Climate Change Authority in disgust-and, I might say, his resignation letter is a searing read. This new thought bubble by the Turnbull government is just a right-wing-approved distraction from the fact that those opposite have no plan to deal with the challenges confronting the electricity sector and that they lack the courage and vision to develop one. This week we saw the Turn the required available reserve energy meant that increased demand in South Australia brought about a collapse and a blackout. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the energy mix. Yet this remarkable untruth is being propagated with such force by this government, because it wants to make sure that the people of Australia are not looking at the true causes-the true causes being a government that has no answers to the great questions of our time.",187,Constituency Statements

(Time expired) Food Lab (10:40): Who thought science could be so delicious? TodayI rise to speak about the delights, tastes, smells and scientific principles of Ben Milbourne's Food Lab series. I recently attended the launch of Food Lab and was impressed to see the science behind the food we eat. And while I do not profess to be a scientist, this new television series will serve a degustation of education through cooking. Ben's partnership with the University of Queensland will take viewers on a culinary journey through the world of food. Members here in the chamber might know Ben a little better from his involvement as a finalist in the hit TV show MasterChef. Prior to his foray into television, Ben was the head of science at two Queensland high schools-and, of course, some knew him as a Brisbane Lions AFL player. Food Lab is a show believed to be the first of its kind in Australia. It demonstrates different scientific aspects and principles in a fun and entertaining way through cooking. In each episode, Ben explores science and how it is applied to kitchens and restaurants Australia wide. Viewers will learn a little about the underlying scientific principles they themselves apply in the kitchen each day. Each episode of the series will open with some of the University of Queensland's most engaging teachers and researchers, with more than two-thirds of each episode filmed across UQ's stunning campuses, from St Lucia and Herston to its Gatton rural setting. Food Lab can, and I believe will, play a significant role in addressing Australia's engagement with science, technology, engineering and maths-STEM. It will also highlight the excellence that Queensland demonstrates in these fields. Through this partnership, I hope younger Australians will be inspired to pursue careers in science and promote Australia's research excellence to the world. Also in the planning stages is an online series, which will be produced along with the television series, aligned with the high school science curriculum. Each episode of the online series will encompass a lesson plan and other resources for teachers. I think it is safe to say that the old classroom science experiment of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda is a memory of the distant past. Food Lab will provide yet another avenue of highly engaging content for teachers and students alike. In essence, it will bring science to real life, especially for those hungry teenagers in classrooms across Australia. I urge members today to look out for the 13-episode series of Food Lab, which began airing on Channel 10 this month on Saturdays at 3 pm. This very modern approach to science and learning is exciting, to say the least. Even more interesting is the fact that this is yet again another home-grown inspiration supported by the University of Queensland, which continues to excel in all fields. Who would have thought that enjoying food could 'stem' from the kitchen into more than just cooking. As The Big Bang Theory created interest in studying physics, I expect Food Lab to do the same for STEM in Australia. Congratulations to the University of Queensland and Ben Milbourne on this new venture.",189,Constituency Statements
231,Mrs Prentice (Ryan,"Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services)Lalor Electorate: Werribee South Youth Justice Facility Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (10:43): I stand here today, as I did on Monday evening, as the very proud member for Lalor. I represent a passionate, proud, informed, active community. The city of Wyndham falls within the boundaries of the electorate of Lalor, and on Monday night I returned home and stood with 6½ thousand locals to say to our state government that we did not approve of the preferred site for a new youth justice precinct in my electorate. This is a legacy issue in more ways than one. It is a legacy issue that the Parkville facility is no longer fit for purpose, and everyone in my community agrees with the state government that that is the case. It is a legacy issue in that previous governments have also failed to act on in the past, and it has been left to our state government to take this action. The problems that locals in my community have with this preferred site are also about legacy; they are about the fact that this site is planned for a gateway to our community where 1.1 million visitors attend a tourist precinct. This will be situated right near that precinct, and my community would rather not have visitors coming into our city there. We have worked so hard over many years to get the planning right to ensure that this city will grow and provide jobs for our community. It is also a legacy issue in that I stand here, and Barry Jones of course preceded me and was a minister in the Hawke-Keating era. He worked closely with the Cain-Kirner governments to ensure that our technology precinct would be set aside to develop into a thriving, key area in our city. That is why we object to this site. I have to say that at that meeting I was appalled that I had to listen to Bernie Finn, the MLA for the Liberal Party, play politics in my community. I think it is only fair that Matthew Guy's opposition take some responsibility here, after having failed for four years to do something about finding another place. I think they should acknowledge that they failed to build a single school in the four years they were in government. I think they should acknowledge that they failed to address the needed upgrade to the Mercy hospital while they were in government. They failed to address the congestion of roads and have left that for this state Labor government to fix. We are now looking at two level crossings and $1.2 billion worth of roads funding from our state government. This site is the wrong site. My community thinks it is the wrong site. I think it is the wrong site. I call on the state government to find another site and get to a win-win position quickly.

This year, to honour his memory, the club organised an Australia Day paddle to help remember their lost friend and raise funds for his beloved club. Bruce loved the Red Rock-Corindi Surf Life Saving Club. In his time there he took on many roles. He was trainer, assessor, first aid officer and maintenance person and was always on call because he lived locally. He won many awards for the most patrol hours in the club",190,Constituency Statements
232,Mr Hogan (Page) (10:46,"TodayI would like to acknowledge the fantastic communityand performed many rescues himself. He was also known to perform rescues outside patrol hours, and the club's inflatable rescue boat-which Bruce worked tirelessly to get-is named in his honour. While the entire club played a part in making the day a success, I would like to make special mention of the event organiser, Karen Dallas; Rebecca Yager; Greg and Samantha Sunderland; Keiran Rea; Glynis Treuer; Wayne Scott; Maddy Apinall; Finn McIntyre; and club president Mitanne Doughney. Congratulations to all involved for your fundraising efforts and for your honouring of the memory of Red Rock-Corindi Surf Life Saving Club stalwart Bruce Green. Last week this House was talking about Queen Elizabeth's Sapphire Jubilee. In 1954, the Queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, visited Lismore. The anniversary is next week. It was a huge event with thousands lining the street as the royal company stood on the balcony of the Gollan Hotel, in the CBD, waving to the crowd. Such is the pride in the visit that the room she stayed in at the Gollan has been kept the same as it was that night, and pictures from the visit still hang on the pub walls. But there is more to the story. The night she was there-late on the night of 20 February, in the early hours of 21 February-as Her Majesty was leaving, a cyclone crossed the border from southern Queensland, bringing with it destructive and heavy rain. The Richmond River at Lismore peaked at 13.4 metres in the early hours of the morning, and the CBD was inundated as rescuers navigated boats through the streets. Such was the speed of the flooding that businesses had no time to prepare. There were, literally, dead horses floating down the street. It was a devastating flood that remains seared in the memory of the community, and it was not just Lismore. Further along the river, towns like Kyogle, Casino, Coraki, Woodburn, Broadwater, Wardell and Byron Bay were also devastated. Despite the best efforts of the Army and certain volunteer groups, tragically, 15 people died across the Northern Rivers that night. It will always be remembered by our community, not just because of the flood but for how our community got together to rebuild. Renewable Energy Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (10:49): Last Saturday, Richmond, in my electorate of Macquarie, came within 0.6 of a degree of being officially the hottest place on the planet, with a temperature of 47 degrees. Unofficially, our own thermometers hovered between 48 and 49 degrees, and mine hit that repeatedly as I drove along the base of the Blue Mountains from Bligh Park. The only thing on the minds of parents with young kids, the aged and the unwell was, 'How do we stay cool?' And no doubt being able to have air conditioners, fans and cool drinks was a big part of helping to stay cool-all of which, of course, require electricity. The combination of energy security and reducing the carbon emissions that will keep contributing to ever-increasing extreme days is the dual challenge that we face. So this week, as I watched the Prime Minister say on TV that he had never claimed renewable energy was to blame for the power crisis in South Australia, I was stunned. I sat directly opposite him in question time last week and watched the words come out of his mouth when he said that South Australia had: … pursued utterly unrealistic, unaffordable renewables targets without giving any thought to what their consequences will be for the grid, for households … The Prime Minister explained in 2010 that Australia needed to move to a 'situation where all or almost all of our energy comes from zeroor very near zero-emission sources' to avoid the risks, laid out in the science, of catastrophic climate change. But on 7.30 this man was now saying: These intermittent renewables do pose real challenges. The Prime Minister said these words, words that he has this week back-pedalled on in a pitiful way. He reminds me of the cheating boyfriend who has been caught out and says: 'No, I didn't do that. I didn't say that.' This is not Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four; the Prime Minister cannot just pretend he did not say these things. We know that renewables were not to blame for the South Australian blackouts. The Prime Minister's own department had a 5 am phone hook-up the morning of his comments on renewables, where it was stated that the blackout occurred because of miscalculations and the falling over of transmission towers. In New South Wales, we almost had a blackout last weekend, and we have the lowest percentage of renewable energy in the country. Really what the government is missing here is that this is an opportunity to harness the emerging technologies around things such as battery storage, which will allow us to have a more secure supply, be less dependent on coal in the future and be less subject to price spikes but also build an industry and could generate jobs, including in my electorate. But the government needs to accept that it must have a transition plan that provides investment certainty and that addresses the realities of the world in which we now live. Broadband Ms LEY (Farrer) (10:52): I am proud of our government's extraordinary progress with the NBN. As of this week, NBN broadband is available to one in three premises. That is around four million homes and businesses across the country. As a rural Liberal member in this parliament, I am also very proud that 70 per cent of those premises are in regional and nonmetropolitan areas. Across my electorate, I can give you countless examples of where a coalition government is delivering the NBN faster and sooner. In my two biggest communities, Albury and Griffith, fibre to the node is already available or being rolled out. The build for the smaller town of Corowa is getting underway this week. Fixed wireless service is already available at Deniliquin, and fixed line services will be connected to over 3,000 homes and businesses in Deni by the end of this year. It is a similar story in numerous other towns and communities across Farrer. In the more remote parts of the electorate there is the Sky Muster satellite. For remote areas in the west and far west of New South Wales, this improvement in satellite delivery is extremely welcome. Everywhere I go, my communities have lots of questions and, quite rightly, high expectations of the NBN. This was certainly not the case under Labor, because when Labor were in office and in charge of the NBN they passed just one in 50 premises. Again, under the coalition, the NBN now passes one in three premises. So it is sooner, cheaper and better. An opposition member interjectingMs LEY: Yes, it is, but there are always ways that we can improve the rollout experience in regional Australia, west of the Great Dividing Range. Technology being what it is, there will always be issues in delivering top-end broadband. Ironically, one of the biggest barriers curbing the rollout experience is actually communication. Some customers-not all-can experience a delay in being connected. Communication with the home or business owner between the NBN and the retail service provider is often not as good as it should be. If a community is getting fixed wireless or satellite instead of fixed line broadband, that community rightly has an expectation that NBN Co will fully communicate and discuss its planning with the local government authority or council. If a customer is not getting the speed they expected, does it really take that much for the NBN or telco to explain why this might be occurring and try, as any decent service provider should, to fix the problem? These are small issues at a corporate level, but I can assure everyone that, as end users, we are looking forward to the end experience. That communication makes all the difference. Whitlam Electorate: Employment delighted I am to have you in the chair when I advise the House that next week, on Tuesday, you and I are hosting a jobs forum in the Illawarra at 10.30 at the Illawarra Regional Airport. We will have with us the shadow minister, Brendan O'Connor. I also want to advise the House that shortly thereafter he will be in Nowra for a jobs forum. That is a region recently visited by the Prime Minister to run a political stunt, not a jobs forum, and I think you have there in a nutshell the different priorities of Labor versus the coalition. I am not surprised that the Prime Minister does not have unemployment and jobs on his agenda, because the world he lives in, Deputy Speaker, is very, very different to the world that you and I live in and the places that we represent. Unemployment is typically three times higher in our region than it is in the area that the Prime Minister is surrounded by. In some areas it is even worse. According to the Department of Employment, during the September quarter of 2016 there were some terrible unemployment hotspots in the Illawarra: 13.7 per cent in the Berkeley-Warrawong-Windang area; eight per cent in the Dapto-Avondale area; about 8.2 per cent in Albion Park; and 12.3 per cent in Warilla. Youth unemployment rates, tragically, were significantly worse. This parliament and this Prime Minister need to focus on policies which are going to turn this around. It is about equality. It is about ensuring that every Australian kid has the opportunity to get a start in life and to get a job which will help them meet their life potential. We need action, and we need a government that is going to do something about it. We understand that small business is always the engine room that is creating job opportunities. I want to say a few harsh words about some small businesses in our areas which are doing the wrong thing by their employees and thereby putting those small businesses that are doing the right thing by their employees at a competitive disadvantage. The Fairfax media outlets in New South Wales have been running an expose over the last few months which has shone a spotlight on the problem in the Illawarra. Young people are being exploited on unpaid internships, underpaid and treated atrociously at work. It is not the majority of small businesses but a minority, but, where they do it, they put the good",191,Constituency Statements
233,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (10:55,"Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, can I say howbusinesses at risk of going out the door because they cannot compete with those businesses that are exploiting their workers. We are all for jobs. We are all for small-business employers doing the right thing. But we have to ensure that we are creating opportunities in the right way for our young people, not exploiting them. Hinkler Electorate: Employment good to follow on from the previous member because I am here to talk about jobs and job creation. At the end of last year, after a very hard fought battle of more than three years, it came to a momentous end. Christmas came early for the Wide Bay Burnett region with news that the region was successful in its bid to secure the ex-HMAS Tobruk as a military dive wreck for the region. I first spoke about a military dive wreck in my maiden speech in 2013. Since then I have spoken about it on many occasions and to anyone who would listen. So, when the news came through that the region was successful, I and lots of people inside my electorate were absolutely over the moon. The No. 1 driver behind this campaign, the No. 1 driver to bring the Tobruk to the Wide Bay, has always been about the creation of jobs-much-needed, long-term, sustainable jobs which provide a future for the next generation of job seekers. This dive wreck will bring domestic and international visitors to the region and will no doubt become one of Australia's premier diving sites, potentially attracting thousands of divers each year, just as it attracted thousands of people to the port of Bundaberg when it arrived in mid-December. It was a stunning sight to see the Tobruk being towed up the Burnett River to its temporary home, while the work to prepare it for scuttling is carried out. I will take this opportunity to encourage everyone who is visiting the region to head out to Burnett Heads to have a look at ex-HMAS Tobruk. I believe that defence assets that are paid for by the Australian people can, and should, continue to serve the community long after they are no longer of use to the military. Tobruk will continue to serve the nation by providing local jobs in the tourism sector. Wide Bay will not only become the custodians of the ship's hull, but the rich history of this great ship and the stories of all those who have served in her. Tobruk had provided 34 years of service to Australia, sailing more than 947,000 nautical miles. She was a multipurpose, rollon roll-off heavy lift ship, capable of transporting soldiers, armoured personnel carriers and tanks, and delivering them to shore via landing craft or directly by beaching. Tobruk was deployed on 26 major operations, including the Sinai Peninsula, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Bougainville, the Middle East, East Timor and the Philippines. She was awarded battle honours for her East Timor service in 1999. Finally, I want to convey my sincere thanks to the people who helped the region secure Tobruk: Scott Rowe and the members of the regional advisory dive group-the knowledge, passion and persistence of this group played an enormous role in the successful outcome; Fraser Coast Regional Council and Bundaberg Regional Council, which committed $1 million each to the project-special thanks to Chris Loft and Jack Dempsey, the mayors; and, unusually, the Labor Queensland minister for tourism Kate Jones, who provided her support. AndI would like to mention Nikki Schulz, a man who calls himself a seed planter who told me four years ago this is a great project, and it has come fruition.",194,Constituency Statements
234,Mr Pitt (Hinkler,"Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (10:58): It isfor members' constituency statements has concluded. Closing the Gap Consideration resumed of the motion: That the House take note of the document. Ms SWANSON (Paterson) (11:02): I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of this land, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, and pay my respects to their elders past and present and future. It was incredible to stand in the Great Hall of Parliament House yesterday to witness the handing of the Redfern Statement to the Prime Minister. The statement was presented in a coolamon, used by Indigenous women to carry food and water, and precious babies. This, indeed, was a special and precious baby being delivered by Jackie Huggins and Rod Little, the co-chairs of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. The Redfern Statement was made last year by Indigenous leaders. It is a way forward for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And when the Indigenous community say, 'We have the solutions,' this government must listen. There was recognition this morning of Paul Keating's celebrated Redfern address in 1992. There was recognition of Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generation in 2008. There was recognition of Jenny Macklin's work in setting targets for improving the lives of Aboriginal people. And there was acknowledgement of our current Indigenous parliamentarians-Pat Dodson, Malarndirri McCarthy, Linda Burney, Jacqui Lambie and Ken Wyatt. There was hope, and inspiration. But the House itself delivered the reality check, and it came in the form of the ninth annual Closing the gap report. Australia is not on track to close the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians; in fact, the gap is widening and deaths are increasing when it comes to cancer and child mortality. State and federal governments are on track to meet just one of seven targets in this strategy, with setbacks in the areas of unemployment and child mortality. The only improvement that has been made, and thank goodness there is at least one, is an improvement in the number of Indigenous students finishing year 12. Yet, this government wants to slash $30 billion from our schools, much of it targeted at that very aim of improving outcomes for Aboriginal students. In fact, in my electorate of Paterson, where $43 million will be cut from school funding, one school-Kurri Kurri High School-has made incredible strides with Gonski funding in regard to its Aboriginal students. With the help of a specialist full-time teacher, Aboriginal students at Kurri Kurri High have improved their writing results by 200 per cent. It is simply an outstanding outcome. But, because this government has gone back on its word to deliver the full Gonski rollout, Kurri Kurri High stands to lose $1.1 million-simply astounding. During the Abbott reign of terror this government also slashed $500 million from Indigenous funding and instigated what it called the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, and what a disaster that has been. There has certainly been no advancement for Indigenous Australians, and this has been backed up by the Australian National Audit Office report into this strategy, which said it is quite simply a shameful indictment on the Liberal government. The ANAO says the strategy was botched from the beginning. Not only did the government rip more than $500 million from the Indigenous affairs budget; the entire process has been",195,Constituency Statements
235,The Deputy Speaker ( Mrs Wicks,"In accordance with standing order 193, the timecompletely shambolic, leading to widespread confusion among Indigenous organisations, who were not consulted or communicated with in any way. This is what happens when you impose solutions instead of working with communities. The Closing the gap report yesterday told us that the lives of Indigenous men are 10.6 years shorter than their non-Indigenous counterparts. For Indigenous women the gap is 9.5 years. There has been mixed progress across other target areas-child mortality, early education, school attendance, student reading and numeracy, employment and year-12 attainment-but by and by the news is not good. In my own electorate of Paterson, home of the Worimi, the Wonnarua and the Awabakal people, Aboriginal disadvantage is as great as anywhere. Probably the most telling statistic comes from an extensive report prepared by Maitland City Council in 2013. I thank Maitland City Council for that research, which sets out to identify that disadvantage and look for solutions. That statistic is the median age of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Maitland. That median age is just 18. In comparison, the median age of non-Indigenous people is 36. What does that really mean? It means that more than half of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Maitland in my electorate are under 19 and only six per cent are over 60. I find that so astounding and shameful. In this age when non-Indigenous Australians are living well into their nineties, we have very few Indigenous Australians living anywhere near that age and a tiny percentage living over 60. That report from Maitland council has a number of other telling statistics. The suburbs with the highest disadvantage were also the suburbs with the highest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Indigenous people in Maitland are 12.4 per cent less likely to complete high school and three times less likely to obtain a tertiary education. The unemployment rate is 11.7 per cent higher for Indigenous people, and the labour force participation is 4.6 per cent lower than for non-Indigenous people. Indigenous people earn 30 per cent less in weekly income and 12 per cent less in household income despite having bigger households. Indigenous people are twice as likely to rent their homes and almost half as likely to own their own homes outright. These sound like statistics just rolling off a page, but they are people. They are our first people. The one light shining in the report and one that reflects the closing the gap findings overall is that more people are staying on to year 12, and I find that so encouraging. I am very moved by this, and I am pleased that my colleague Linda Burney is with me. Thank you, Linda. In 2006, the percentage of Indigenous students completing their HSC was 17 per cent, and in 2011 that percentage had risen to 22 per cent. That is still well below the non-Indigenous percentage of 34 per cent, but it is improving. These are mostly economic indicators, but they result from health, education and employment disadvantage-indicators in which we are not closing the gap. I add my voice to the call to listen to Indigenous people and to actually hear what they have to say. The Redfern Statement tells us that Aboriginal people have the solutions. The $500 million cut to Indigenous programs and front-line services made by this Liberal government has had very real and damaging impacts, and that cut must be reversed. I want to point out an excellent piece that was written in today's Sydney Morning Herald by Michael Gordon. It sums up for me, very well, what happened yesterday: The Prime Minister is a glass-half-full politician and he chose to focus on the positives when he presented the report to Parliament on Tuesday… This reflects the idea that you make progress by celebrating success, but the self-congratulatory tone was out of order and it won't work if the deeper question of the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is not addressed. This, to me, is the critical point: yes, we must celebrate those successes; it is important that they are acknowledged. But getting back to what Michael Gordon said again: Each is important, but these are incremental steps when a paradigm shift is required. And that paradigm shift is truly what we talking about here. It is not the imposition of ideas by us, non-Aboriginal people, to Aboriginal people. It is the complete reversal of that idea: the idea that Aboriginal people are masters of their own destiny. They have the solutions. They have the ideas. And it is up to us to be humble enough to sit at their feet and hear their solutions and work with them to help us both create a better Australia that we will all benefit from. This is not just for the benefit of our first peoples; this is for the benefit of all people who live in this great country so that we can make it an even better country. Ms HUSAR (Lindsay) (11:11): I rise to reflect on the ninth Closing the gap report, which was handed down yesterday. I would like to note and put on the record that there are no government speakers to speak on this important topic-they are probably too busy supporting the cartoonists who choose to depict Aboriginal people in the wrong light. The 2017 report has, yet again, illustrated the need for a more concerted effort by government to address the areas of disadvantage that still shockingly befall Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and an issue that is close to my heart and close to the electorate of Lindsay. Western Sydney has the highest concentration of Aboriginal people than anywhere else in the country. We are privileged, and I say privileged, to be home to incredible communities of culture and history. During my inaugural address, I gave my commitment to work hard to close the gaps of inequity that exist amongst our Indigenous brothers and sisters. This report shows that progress is being made in one key area is on track: the target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020. This is such an essential target because we know that completing year 12 opens doors to university, employment and leads to greater opportunities to build a decent life for yourself. But that is where the list of successful targets being reached starts and ends and, as my colleague Meryl Swanson has just pointed out, that is not to be celebrated. The list of targets which are not on track should fill us all with a sense of deep shame because, simply, we are consistently falling short of the essential benchmarks we have set for ourselves. And we cannot fall into the trap of excusing our failures by amplifying our success because, at this stage and with these results, we have to be honest and hard on ourselves. We are not on track to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018. We are not on track to close the gap in life expectancy by 2031 and we are not on track to have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds in early education by 2025. In fact, the government has just made a sweeping cut to those Indigenous education centres. We are not on track to close the gap in school attendance by the end of 2018 and we are not on track to halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018. And we are not on track to halve the gap in employment by 2018. So that one thing that we have been celebrating seems pretty vacuous by now. These are heart breaking realities and each is a poor reflection on this parliament and the government of the last four years, but these hard truths illustrate why it is so important that the previous Labor government instituted the Closing the Gap strategy and it is why it is so important we have to update parliament every year so we cannot hide behind the ignorance or the indifference that exists. Our failures are there for all to see and I say they are our failures. As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, this is a time for humility and for action. Now is the time to truly commit to working with Indigenous communities and giving power back to the remarkable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are leading and achieving every single day. Labor's support for self-determination is clear. Putting Aboriginal people in control of their own lives and making sure they have every opportunity to fulfil their potential is essential to closing the gap. The incredible Aboriginal members of parliament-including Linda Burney, the member for Barton, who has joined me now-now make up two per cent of this parliament. Whilst it is a step in the right direction, I would prefer to see more Aboriginal people here. They are leading the way in inspiring an entire generation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We are privileged to serve beside them. I think it is important to recognise that this past Monday was also the ninth anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generation. I think most people in this chamber would acknowledge that the apology was long overdue and could never make up for the terrible atrocities committed against Australia's first peoples. I will just take a moment to reflect on part of my upbringing and going to school with a friend who I had known since I was two years old who was Indigenous. Because her family were terrified of her being removed, they did not disclose their Aboriginality until we were well into our late teens. It is something that has continued through the generations and affected people that I went to school with, which was not that long ago. That apology was a moment in time that we can all remember clearly when an Australian Prime Minister and his government had the humility and humanity to admit to the tragedies that were perpetrated against an innocent people and to apologise for the pain and suffering that was caused. The impact that had on people is still very clear today, as I just alluded to. But nine years later we still continue to struggle to get it right. In the past two years, we have seen hundreds of millions of dollars shamefully ripped from Indigenous programs by this government. We have seen a reluctance to deal with the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. We have seen a centralisation of funding, much of which has ended up in the hands of non-Indigenous organisations. So clearly there is a lot this parliament can do better, and there is an awful lot more this government could do better. First of all, we should push ahead and make sure constitutional recognition becomes a reality. It is ridiculous and absolutely outrageous that our founding document still does not recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as our first people. We are lucky to share a culture and a history which is more than 60,000 years old, and of course our Constitution should reflect that fact and celebrate it. I look forward to doing everything I can to achieve this important and well-overdue recognition. But I fear that these important debates are too often soft around the edges. There is a reluctance to truly shape up on the failings we see and an overreliance on highlighting an otherwise very small success. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:17 to 11:25 Ms HUSAR: It is very difficult to look at the results of this report and not reflect on the decisions this government have made and continue to make. If they are committed to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians and closing the gap, as they say they are, they should: restore the $500 million they cut from Indigenous programs; they should unwind the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which has been widely condemned by organisations on the ground as well by the National Audit Office; they should re-fund the National Congress of Australia's First People; and they should show respect to the Redfern Statement, which was co-signed by 50 Indigenous organisations and spelled out a range of reforms to address Indigenous health, education, justice and family violence. I truly hope the announcements the Prime Minister made yesterday will lead to a shift in direction for this government, as that is what is clearly needed. felt proud of the way the parliament came together with so many first nations representatives to do important business. I also felt proud as a member of the Labor caucus of the way the Australian Labor Party recognised our own institutional failings in recognising the contribution, original and ongoing, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It was a great privilege to share in the enormous generosity of spirit of my friends the member for Barton, Senator McCarthy and Senator Dodson as they welcomed and challenged the rest of us to rise to the challenges that we have so often failed to meet. I was proud to be with my colleagues and I was proud to be in the parliament for speeches that were good speeches, the speech of the Prime Minister-I will come back to that a bit later-and a wonderful speech by the member for Maribyrnong, the leader of the Labor Party. But I was also ashamed. I think we should all be ashamed that so little progress has been made nine years on and that the aspirations of closing the gap and the accountability to the parliament and to the Australian people-all Australian people but particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians-have not resulted in the progress that it should have done. That is a collective failing that we must redress. In part, it rests on failings of the present government. It rests on enormous cuts to vital programs. It rests on a programmatic approach to Indigenous affairs that has been shown to be a complete failure. The reports about the framework, its construction and its implementation, make devastating reading, and all of us should reflect on the lessons of that process as we seek to go forward and close the gap in those areas which are presently set out and in every aspect which separates Indigenous Australians from other Australians. I talked about pride at the start. I am proud, as an Australian and a member of the Australian Labor Party, that Prime Minister Rudd nine years ago stood up in our parliament and said sorry and committed, in doing so, to closing the gap. I am also proud that we have made some progress. We should celebrate progress where it is made and, in particular, we should celebrate the achievements of so many amazing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I think all of us in this place are very proud to serve in this parliament with five Australians of Indigenous background. We hope-and I certainly share the aspirations of my colleague the member for Lindsay-that five is the floor not the ceiling. There is more work for all",196,Ministerial Statements
236,Mr Giles (Scullin) (11:27,"Yesterday in this place I felt both proud and very ashamed. Iparties to do in this regard in opening up more public space for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. In looking at where there has been progress through the lens of closing the gap, I am proud that the target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment is on track and that the proportion of Indigenous 20to 24-year-olds who have achieved year 12 or equivalent has increased from approximately 45 per cent in 2008, when we started this journey, to over 60 per cent. In the same period it is important to note that the rates of non-Indigenous year 12 or equivalent attainment did not change. This is a success that we should note and we should learn from. But, of course, most of the targets-six out of seven-are not being achieved. There is so much more to be done. I think, in particular, the target to close to gap in life expectancy-surely the most profound of all of our failings-is not on track. The Indigenous mortality rate has declined, but the mortality rate from cancer is rising, and this gap is widening. The target to halve the gap in child mortality is also not on track. Indigenous lives are not starting on the same footing as non-Indigenous lives in Australia, and that is not good enough. More needs to be done, particularly in areas such as access to antenatal care. The target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018 is not on track, which is a failing. The target to halve the gap in employment by 2018 is also not on track. The Indigenous employment rate has increased since 1994, but it has declined since we started measuring this progress. It is shameful. The Prime Minister spoke affectingly and effectively about employment and put it in some context around educational attainment, and that is important. But this is a profound failing. There is more to be done. Big questions remain unanswered. Why are Indigenous children nearly 10 times more likely to be removed by child protection authorities than non-Indigenous children? This is the case so many years from the apology and 20 years after the landmark report on the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families. The Prime Minister acknowledges the steps that he has taken, and there are positive steps that have been taken. But he and his government have failed to adequately acknowledge this reality and, more so, looking forward, to explain to parliament and to the Australian people how the government plans to address this shameful national failing. In his speech the Prime Minister reiterated his commitment-and it clearly is a genuine personal commitment-to closing the gap and to meeting these targets. It was a good speech, but there were bits that were missing. In particular, we need more strategies to address the full extent of disadvantage facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. In this regard, Labor will continue to advocate for, as proposed by our opposition leader, Bill Shorten, a justice target to be incorporated into the framework. We cannot close the gap in education, health and employment disadvantage without meaningful strategies to address those factors causing incarceration. The report acknowledges that rates of incarceration amongst Indigenous Australians are disproportionately high-unacceptably high. Only by addressing this, or the complex factors leading to it, can we build safer communities and empower families and people right across those communities. I turn from an overall review of the closing the gap statement to a more local concern. The federal government has refused to support evidenced-based interventions supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families. I think it is tragic that the national partnership that supported 38 Aboriginal children in family centres has not been continued. It has effectively fallen over. In this regard, in particular the Bubup Wilam for Early Learning centre in my electorate in Thomastown is incredibly important to the Aboriginal communities in Melbourne's northern suburbs. It is playing a clear role in closing the gap in early childhood education and in supporting young families. The work it does is incredible as a hub for community, as a community controlled safe space and as a place which is delivering incredible results. It is, in our community, closing the gap, particularly in school attendance. We know those early years with quality, therapeutic care and education makes a difference. We know it makes the most powerful difference in enabling progression into education, which, of course, is also the foundation in so many ways for a good life. The fact that this community controlled service, which is delivering on all of its targets, is under threat causes me great disquiet as the federal member. I say here, as I did last year, that I will do everything I can to make sure that Bubup Wilam and the Aboriginal communities of Melbourne's northern suburbs are supported. I will not waste a moment in standing up for the future of Bubup Wilam, because, in standing up for the future of Bubup Wilam, I will be standing up for the future of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal families in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. In closing, I touch on the words of my colleague Senator Dodson. They are something that cause me and, I am sure, all of my colleagues on this side of the House and the Senate incredible pride to be able to call the father of reconciliation a colleague. He talks about marrying the symbolic and the practical. When it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in the federal government and when it comes to closing the gap, we must do both. We must complete our Constitution. We must look to treaties to do justice to Aboriginal people, but we must also combine that with listening to Aboriginal communities about the programs that make a difference. Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (11:37): I am delighted to be here as the federal member for Indi to acknowledge the traditional owners, the first people of this country, to thank them for the custody and care they have given this wonderful country of ours for so long, and to make a public commitment to be their effective and independent representative in this parliament. We have heard a lot already on this debate about national issues. We have seen the report and we know that there is a long way to go. Today, I want to allocate the amount of time. I have to talk in particular about Indi and some of the wonderful things that the people in my electorate are doing around closing the gap, around raising awareness of traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander first people and around my commitment to continue to work with them as we grow their impact in our community. So much is happening in Indi, so I would like to talk a little bit about the some of the activities we are taking to enable me to better represent the first peoples of Indi in parliament. I have regular meetings with local people. In DecemberI met with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community representatives Darren Moffitt from Aboriginal Victoria; Tammy Campbell, who at that time was working with Wodonga Institute of TAFE; Liz Heta from the Department of Health and Human Services; and Bangerang elders Aunty Betty Hood-Cherry and Uncle Freddie Dowling. We had a really good conversation about some of the activities that were happening in then planning for the new year. They told me about the proposed new home in Wangaratta for allied health outreach services and the study which is due to be completed in March or April 2017. They talked to me of the workplace activities that are happening in TAFE and DHS. Darren made the very warm invitation for me to travel with him as he does his work around the electorate, visiting the various network groups. So we have put some dates in the diary for me to go out and spend quality time with my Aboriginal communities. I had a wonderful visit hosted by David Noonan, the CEO of Albury Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service. I was delighted to learn about the services they operate cross-border and to understand what the board does-employing 50 staff, 20 of whom are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and looking after between 3,500 and 4,000 clients a year-and to bring a report of that visit to this House to make sure that they were being represented. Last year I also had the great pleasure of hosting Minister Ken Wyatt, who visited Benalla as a guest at the Central Hume Primary Care Partnership. He was able to talk about aged care. He then met with Aboriginal people and talked to them about some of the specific issues they have in the health area. A real highlight for me last year was a wonderful event that happens up in Bright, in the Ovens Valley: the Marngrook Family Footy Day event. There was a huge crowd. Aboriginal people from all over Victoria came, as well as our guests from the Northern Territory. There is a sister-town relationship between Wadeye, in the Northern Territory, and Bright. Young people from Wadeye come down to Bright; they attend school and they have a business operating in the main street. But the footy event is the big, big event of the day. Thanks to all the team for that; it was just fantastic. I was really proud to be able to come to this parliament, to make a speech and to acknowledge the work of our community. Particularly to JeanPrincipal of the Bright P-12 College-and all your partners in The Thathangathay Foundation there-thanks for the wonderful work you do. I would particularly like to talk about two incidents that happened last week that make me really proud and show that change is happening. Last week I had the great pleasure of having two of my community come and volunteer in Parliament House. Judith Ahmat and Tahlia Biggs came to Canberra and spent the week here. Among the many things that they did, they had the delightful pleasure of meeting Linda Burney, Ken Wyatt and other Aboriginal people in this House, and talking about their experiences. TodayI would like to talk a little about Judith. She is a very, very proud Gunditjmara woman who has lived and worked in north-east Victoria for the past 26 years. She is a mother of four daughters and has eight grandchildren. Judith has been a really active member of the Albury-Wodonga Aboriginal community since 1991. She is one of the co-founders of the Mungabareena Aboriginal Corporation, which was established in 1994. She has been a board director there, on an off, for the past 21 years-what a contribution!-and she has been on the board of the Albury Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service. She has been involved in several steering, reference, planning and advisory committees, both throughout north-east Victoria and also statewide. One of the things about Judith that I am so proud of is that in 2015 she was inducted into the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll for the important contribution she has made to community services, justice and education. Not only is she a respected leader she is also achieving the recognition that she deserves. And while busy doing all of that, she holds a Master of Social Work (By Research) degree from La Trobe University in Albury-Wodonga. It is fantastic, Judith, to have you up here, to have you get to know that this is our place. We welcome you anytime you want to come; we would love to have you back. Tahlia Biggs is one of our future young leaders. She is just a breath of delight and gorgeousness, representing the fantastic future that the Aboriginal people of Australia are going to bring to this parliament. Tahlia works as a mentor and facilitator, and as a volunteer. She mentors Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly young people from all around Victoria and, in some cases, around Australia. She tells me that she is engaged in areas of education, voting, health and well-being. What she is really keen about is to uplift and ensure that voices are heard. She says, 'I have found that my work has inspired the participants to be leaders in our community.' As a result of her visit here, Tahlia is now going to apply to be a participant in the National Indigenous Youth Parliament. I say to any young Aboriginal people that this is a fantastic opportunity: put your hands up for it. The National Indigenous Youth Parliament comes to this parliament for a week, giving you the opportunity to really learn how parliament works. I will look forward, Tahlia, to welcoming you back, as part of that. I also want to spend the few minutes that are left to me talking about what is happening in my electorate with Aboriginal people. I want to thank Senator Nigel Scullion for the brief he has prepared for me on Aboriginal people in Indi. Indi has an overall population of 136,000. Approximately 1.6 per cent of the population-that is 2,224 people-are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Their school attendance rates in 2015 in my electorate were 88.2 percent, and that is compared to an average for non-Indigenous students of 92.3 per cent. So clearly, in Indi, we have a long way to go with getting more Aboriginal kids in school. For schools publishing attendance rates by indigeneity, 60 per cent had an Indigenous attendance rate of at least 90 per cent. But we have 93.3 per cent of non-Indigenous attendance, so we have still got a way to go there. The employment rate in Indi was 48.2 per cent, compared with a nonIndigenous employment rate of 72.9 per cent across the electorate. We still have a long way to go with employment. The other statistic that I want to pay some attention to, and it was mentioned by the Prime Minister, is the large number of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care in my electorate. It is great to see that the Gateway Health service is doing some work here, and I really stress how important it is. When I had my meeting with my Aboriginal elders, they told me that this outof-home care is a real concern, and I am glad that the Prime Minister picked it up and gave it attention in his speech. It is something you would not think in north-east Victoria would be an issue we have to pay attention to. That is certainly something I will focus on and I will work with my community around those statistics and what we need to do. In closing, what I would really like to say to the people of my electorate is that we have a most magnificent tradition and history of first peoples and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's contributions to our community. They have been there forever, and I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what a fantastic job they have done looking after this wonderful country of ours. I want to make the commitment that in the future, my role, in my position of power being a member of parliament, is to shine a light on your work, to offer the support that I can and to make sure I am your representative here in parliament. I want to work very closely with all the groups to make sure that you come to parliament and that you can find your voice and use it here as you need to in this people's place. I am looking forward to continuing to do this work over the next three years, and I thank you for the assistance you have given me so far to enable me to represent you in this place. and Ngambri peoples, the traditional owners of the land on which we meet. I pay my respects to elders past and present, and I would also like to acknowledge the Dharug people, the traditional owners of the land that my electorate of Chifley sits upon. We are once again talking about the Closing the gap report, as we always do this time of year, highlighting how far we have to go within our nation to eliminate Indigenous disadvantage. The Closing the gap report, handed down by the government, showed that federal and state governments were missing the mark in six out of the seven targeted areas. I do not make that remark in any political sense; it just highlights the huge challenge that confronts us all in this space. Having said that, one bright spot was tracking the improvement of Indigenous people finishing year 12, which I was particularly happy to see. The report showed the target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment rates by 2020 was on track. According to the report, nationally, the proportion of Indigenous 20to 24-year-olds who had achieved year 12 or equivalent had increased from 45.4 per cent in 2008 to 61.5 per cent in 2014-15. In that regard, it is terrific. I also want to pay tribute to the member for Barton, given her presence in the chamber today. The member for Barton, prior to entering the world of politics, was an educator and helped many young people in our area teaching in Lethbridge Park, within electorate of Chifley. I want to take note of that and thank her for what she has done for young people in our part of Western Sydney. Fortunately, we have had some success in one regard, but in other areas the Closing the gap report show we have a long way to go. For example, in child mortality, over the longer term the child mortality rate declined and the gap narrowed. But while mortality rates have declined, we still have that gap persist. We need to do more. The goal of eliminating the life expectancy gap by 2031 is simply not on track. This needs to be addressed. The target to halve the gap in employment by 2018 is also not on track. While there has been an increase in Indigenous employment rates since 1994, there has, sadly, been a decline since 2008. To take a recent snapshot from 2014-15, the Indigenous employment rates are at about 48.4 per cent, compared with 72.6 per cent for non-Indigenous Australians. A new target aiming to close the gap in school attendance by 2018 has not improved between 2015 and 2016. The attendance rate for Indigenous students is 83.4 per cent compared to 93.1 per cent for non-Indigenous students. The target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy by 2018 is also not on track. According to the latest data, only year 9 numeracy is on track. Reading and numeracy across years 3, 5 and 7 are off track, and reading for year 9 is also off track. Labor is also calling for two more important targets to be included in the Closing the gap report in future years: justice and out-of-home care targets. According to the Deputy Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Robynne Quiggin,",200,Ministerial Statements
237,Mr Husic (Chifley) (11:47,"To begin with I would like to acknowledge the NgunnawalIndigenous adults are 13 times more likely to be incarcerated than the general population, and juveniles are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated. These are stunning figures. It is an appalling statistic that we have to work much harder to improve upon. High levels of incarceration just ruin communities and put unbearable stress on families. The quality of life of many Aboriginal people, especially young people, depends on improving that statistic. The second target Labor has proposed is reducing the number of Aboriginal kids in out-ofhome care. The Secretariat for National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care recently highlighted the shocking reality that one in three kids in statutory out-of-home care are Indigenous. Indigenous children are nearly 10 times more likely to be removed by child protection authorities than non-Indigenous kids. Frankly, we just cannot let that continue. While we are on the topic of justice, we also have to think about reparations in a very serious way. So many of the Stolen Generation are still living with real and burning pain, and the pain of having their history rejected and their families divided is very real. State governments have already been working towards reparations for families who are deeply hurt and the Leader of the Opposition yesterday called for a serious national discussion about what the Commonwealth can do in this area, because without reparations I frankly do not think that reconciliation is entirely complete. On a policy level and in local communities, how we go about reducing these gaps and pursuing equality is vitally important. We cannot view or treat these issues as merely another problem to be solved. This is not crude mass or just policy in theory; this is about fundamentally improving the lives of individuals-people who have their own goals and aspirations-which is why the approach to reducing disadvantage has to be collaborative. It must be led, not imposed upon those affected. Right now, the sad truth is that Aboriginal Australians are more likely to be incarcerated, less likely to attend preschool, less likely to own their own home and less likely to find full time work. Frankly, we do have a long way to go to improve on those differences and we do need to rely on the advice, perspective and leadership of people who have lived through that inequality and have ideas about how to fix it. The Blacktown city local government area, which covers large portions of the electorate of Chifley, has the largest urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in New South Wales; something I am hugely and profoundly proud of. The Indigenous population of just over 8,000 people makes up 2.7 per cent of our local population, compared to 1.2 per cent in greater Sydney and 2.5 per cent across New South Wales. Our population can be traced back to the 1960s, when large numbers of people were given government housing in Mount Druitt. Many who moved there were part of the Stolen Generation, and they had been removed from their families because they were Aboriginal. Others moved there after living on government controlled reserves. When it comes to how we address Aboriginal disadvantage in Australia, I think about the challenges as they are lived within our local community. Certainly there is a lot that is being done, and in the time that I have I want to congratulate lots of great community organisations. For example, Butucarbin Aboriginal Corporation, which is doing incredibly important work in helping local Indigenous people find their feet within our community. They have facilitated and coordinated community programs and activities that help families, children, young people, older people and other individuals to improve and develop their skills through inclusive activities-things such as family weekends that have been organised for up to 90 participants to build a sense of community. There is the Kuring homework club, where mentors and volunteers attend every Tuesday night and provide transport and tutoring for students-hugely important. There are communities barbeques at Nurragingy Reserveagain, building a sense of community by bringing in 350 local kids. There are mothers groups, disability support groups and formal training programs through TAFE-all things that are vitally important in giving a sense of self-determination and building community. They were also recipients of grants-for example, the Chifley stronger communities grant-but provide for themselves as well through other fundraising methods. The other group I want to pay tribute to is the Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation that is working hard to tackle disadvantage in our community. After the Closing the gap report came down, they said there was indeed a long way to go in achieving the targets. I want to just highlight some of their programs which include the health outreach program, where every month about 20 providers provide services to locals-services they would not normally have to access, including blood screening, an optometrist service, check-ups and other services. They also have a strong employment and training outreach program and a well established productivity boot camp. Other activities include the Doonside Koori Outreach, which includes a men's group for bringing people together, financial counselling and legal services, and women's legal help. I also give a shout out to the Mt Druitt Learning Ground that is helping young Aboriginal kids in our area get a fresh start and improve their education. There are many groups in my area that are making contributions and I hope they forgive me for any omissions, but I do want to congratulate the work that they are all doing in helping Aboriginal communities in Western Sydney to achieve all that they want. Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (11:57): I rise today to speak on Closing the Gap. I open by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, and their elders past, present and emerging, and by acknowledging the Wathaurong of the Kulin nation from the electorate of Lalor. We measure what we care about. We measure what is important. We measure what we want to prioritise. We set targets and we measure our performance to test the effectiveness of strategies. The Closing the Gap targets are there to remind us of how important this journey is and how important the welfare, the education and the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are as a people in Australia. The Closing the gap report is therefore a positive and yet, annually, it feels like a reminder of what we have not managed to do. It gives all sides of politics an opportunity to affirm our commitment to addressing the disadvantage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders face every day in our country. We cannot read this report and let taking action lull us into a false sense of accomplishment because, as the report says this year and as we have heard, there are many areas where the gap is simply not closing; there are some, tragically, where the gap is increasing. Infant mortality is one space where that is the case, and that is a tragedy. When we do our acknowledgements to country, it is not a tokenistic gesture; it is our sombre acknowledgement that these people were driven from their land, displaced, and since that time have been subordinated to non-Indigenous Australians. The disparity in opportunity manifests itself in what we call the gap. I grew up in Victoria in a small country town. I distinctly remember Paul Keating's Redfern speech and the awakening it gave me and brought to me. I know that in this place we are doing a lot of talking about the RECOGNISE campaign and we are doing a lot of talking about recognition around Australia. But, when I go back to that Redfern speech, I am starkly reminded of what our Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, said: … the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians. It begins, I think, with that act of recognitionAnd this, I think, is really importantRecognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us. I read that and I put it back on the record today, because it seems to me that we have moved from that notion that recognition is first about acknowledging the pain caused, before we move to recognition in the Constitution. We cannot have recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our Constitution until we recognise-across this nation-the journey to date. Ours is a dark history in so many ways. If you are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, that is an absolute certainty. We have failed and we continue to fail. Where we have made improvements they are modest ones. One of the improvements that I would like to talk about, which is not listed in Closing the Gap, is that there is no target around Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in this federal parliament. There has not been a target set for that, and it is a celebration, therefore, that we have exceeded what some would have imagined possible. It was a very proud day when we returned this year and welcomed the member for Barton, who is in the chamber today. Having given closing the gap speeches on several occasions, to have the member for Barton in the chamber while I speak today is incredibly meaningful, and I think it shows that we have travelled some distance. We welcomed, on the Labor side, two new senators, Malarndirri McCarthy and Pat Dodson. They have also shown us those things. One of the most poignant moments for me, as the member for Lalor, came towards the end of last year when I attended a constitutional convention at one of our high schools with several of our schools. We talked about recognition and about the potential for a treaty. I shared with the students that day a part of the member for Barton's maiden speech in this place, where she said, so compellingly, that when the Constitution was changed to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as Australian citizens-she put it so starkly-that that was not the case; what that did was to remove them from the list of flora and fauna. The power of that image for the young people in my community was astounding-real and very necessary. Looking at these annual targets takes us back to a place where we are prepared to shine a light on our dark history. If we are prepared to acknowledge, as Paul Keating called on us to do, that we need firstly to recognise that dark history before we can do the other things then I think that is a really important thing to do. The other area that I want to talk about is the area where we have seen improvement, and that is year 12 completion rates. I note the Prime Minister's words yesterday, during his celebration, that there is no employment gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, when it comes to finding employment, if they have a tertiary qualification. YetI must stand here as a former educator and say: those are fine words. We have had lots of aspiring rhetoric across the last decade around Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs but, in reality, it is the policies on the ground that make the difference. As an educator, I can draw on some of my very positive experiences in classrooms and in schools where I worked. I can call our Prime Minister to account and say: 'Don't cite that statistic while you're slashing Gonski funding. Don't cite that statistic while you're cutting the legs out from under the teachers who are making a difference on the ground.' I also note-and I want this on the record-that I hear many members from the other side talk about the Gonski review and clutch onto parental engagement as their one driver of improved student performance. I have to say that we cannot be standing here talking about parental engagement while actively cutting funding that provides, in Victorian schools, positive parental engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through their individual learning plans. This came from an era in Victoria where we had what was called the Wannik initiative. The Wannik initiative did lots of things, but one of the things it did was mandate an individual learning plan for every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student in a state school. It not only did that but also put in place the requirement to create around that a positive engagement with parents. It cannot go unsaid: when adults think about school, they reflect on their own experience and undoing the negative perceptions they have about school engagement is the first step in improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander's education outcomes. It needs to be done carefully, and it needs to be done in an incredibly positive way. It is not all bad news from those on the opposite side on educational outcomes. I give credit to former Prime Minister Howard for in his time as Prime Minister introducing funding for tutors in schools for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In Victoria, that turned into career education support officers, who did some fabulous work not just in tutoring students but also in acknowledging Aboriginality in our schools and raising pride in children for their Aboriginal heritage. I look forward to continuing the work with my colleagues on this side of the House and improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Ms BURNEY (Barton) (12:07): Like others, I recognise the fine and powerful words made by all my Labor colleagues and the independent member for Indi in this debate that I have listened to today. I feel very moved by what people have said, and I join with them in recognition of country. The happenings in this parliament yesterday were very important and very inspirational but, as many have said, at the same time very sobering. It was the release of the ninth Closing the gap report and also, of course, the ninth year of the recognition of Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generations. I am so pleased the member for Lalor mentioned that speech in Redfern Park by Paul Keating. I was actually there in the audience that day, and I just remember sitting there with hundreds and hundreds of Aboriginal people and our mouths dropping open at listening to the Prime Minister say those things. It was an astounding day and something that will always stay with me as well. There were two really significant points of the Leader of the Opposition's speech yesterday, which was a speech that was made in a very collaborative way with particularly the Indigenous members of this place but I am sure others as well. Firstly, there was the recognition of the number of Aboriginal children who are being removed as a result of statutory child protection measures. Barnaby Joyce was on the radio this morning saying: 'If kids are in danger they have to be removed, and that's that. It's not about what colour you are.' But there are different ways, and Labor committed yesterday to working with the national peak body, SNAICC, in finding what those different ways are. We know that it is state governments that basically run the child protection system, but the federal government also has a number of possible levers in this space as well. That number of children projected to be removed by 2020 is just horrendous. There are 15,000 Aboriginal children in out-of-home care now, and it is looking like that number done by the good work of people particularly in Victoria will double by the year 2020. The proportion, of course, we heard people speak about a little earlier. The other point that was made by Labor yesterday was in fact in relation to reparations. The point was made that of course reparations should be made to children who have been mistreated particularly by the state, and by that I mean governments as well as other institutions. We are seeing this writ large, of course, with the royal commission that is underway at the moment. A number of states have already entered into reparation schemes with members of the Stolen Generations, and we are signalling very strongly that Labor is also going to have a look at reparations. I think the point made by one of our earlier speakers was that this is really what reconciliation is about. Those two points are very important. Of course, the other thing that is really significant is that the things that we are talking about, particularly with the apology, are things in our lifetime. This is not ancient history. I will be 60 next birthday, and when I was a child the policies of removal were very real. For people in this chamber also those policies were very real. In fact, some of them did not finish until the early seventies. So we are talking about very recent history and we are talking about history, if not in our lifetimes, certainly in our parents' lifetimes. In the Labor caucus yesterday a wonderful ceremony was conducted by Malarndirri McCarthy. I had a very small role to play in that. But the speech that was given by Patrick Dodson really outlined and made us all proud, as Labor representatives, of the things that we had done under various prime ministers, including the great Gough Whitlam: the Gurindji walk-off from Wave Hill with Vincent Lingiari-his mob are the Gurindji people-and, of course, the hand-back of Uluru. There was the '67 referendum, of course, and native title. Those things were listed, but Pat also put a challenge in front of us as Labor but also in front of us as the parliament: the time for listening is here, but it is also a time for action. I think that very much centred on us. I will say something that maybe was not said yesterday and I think today is the day to say. When you have a look at this government's record under Prime Minister Howard, Prime Minister Abbott and now Prime Minister Turnbull in the Aboriginal space, it is important that we make the point that, under Prime Minister Howard, the refusal to acknowledge the Stolen Generations, the refusal to say sorry was not just something that hurt Aboriginal people; it hurt this country. It held this country back. I well remember the walk over the Sydney Harbour Bridge and that plane up in the sky, skywriting 'sorry'. I remember the way in which the Howard government turned in on itself and turned the Australian people in on themselves through the actions of Pauline Hanson and the white picket fence, revisionist view of history. We have got to remember those things. Of course, under Prime Minister Abbott we had the establishment of a hand-picked group of Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people that would provide advice without accountability, without any understanding from the broader community about what the agenda of that group was. It has been a very difficult exercise. Under the Prime Minister we also saw the abolition of ATSIC and the destruction of any Aboriginal national representation. We also saw under Prime Minister Abbott-continued, unfortunately, by Prime Minister Turnbull-a ripping out of millions and millions of dollars of the Aboriginal affairs budget, and the rearrangement of the way in which Aboriginal affairs would be administered and funded has seen advocacy bodies destroyed. It has seen Aboriginal organisations from right across the country, including Aboriginal children and families centres, defunded. And the government then has the nerve to blame Aboriginal people for what appear to be things going backwards. The other thing is that to address the issues that the Closing the gap report highlighted yesterday is actually an important economic imperative for Australia. If you have Aboriginal people graduating and taking up employment, and the issues of Aboriginal incarceration and a whole range of other issues are addressed, the saving for the budget would be substantial. It just astounds me that that cannot be understood by bureaucrats and by members of the government, because it is very much understood by Labor on this side of the House. The other thing that Labor made very clear yesterday, and will continue to make very clear and advocate for, is support for the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, the democratically elected representative body that should be the chief advisory, consultation and negotiation group with any sensible government. They are representative, they are experienced and they are there. It has been this government that has defunded that group. They are almost on their knees, and Labor's commitment is to being a partner with a representative, democratically elected group, and that group is congress. I will just finish up by saying that I am very touched and lifted up by my colleagues, and I think that the future of where we go in the Aboriginal space is very bright for Labor in this country. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (12:17): I begin by acknowledging that we meet on Ngunnawal country and pay my respects to the elders past, present and future. I welcome the opportunity to speak once again on the Closing the gap report, despite the fact that his report is a sober reminder that we have a long way to go before we achieve true equality for our First Australians. Nine years after the framework was agreed, only one of the seven Closing the Gap targets is on track to being met. While year 12 attainment by 2020 is on track, the education, employment, infant mortality and life expectancy targets are not. Our First Australians live with worse health and education outcomes, fewer employment opportunities, inadequate housing options and the lasting effects of intergenerational trauma. That is not helped by the $500 million in cuts to programs and frontline services that this government has implemented, despite a promise that there would be no jobs or services lost. The government has cut funding from local providers, which has not fostered any independence; in fact, it has undermined hope. I just want to turn to the impact of the targets on the ACT. An article yesterday in The Canberra Times yesterday found: … the report showed gains in education, but Aboriginal employment fell nearly 10 per cent to 62.9 per cent between 2008 and 2014-2015 … The ACT mirrored national success in improving year 12 attainment rates, one of the few bright spots in the yearly measure of progress. It had the second-highest increase in young Indigenous people reaching a year 12 or equivalent level of education, rising 26.1 per cent to 82.7 per cent in the six years to 2014-2015. … The ACT out performed other states and territories in NAPLAN measures, and was the only jurisdiction on track to meet a goal of improving the gap in numeracy and literacy for all tested school grades. Despite the achievements in the ACT, as I said, the report still makes for sober reading, with only one of the seven Closing the Gap targets on track to being met. In highlighting the contents of the report I also want to acknowledge the outstanding speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in the House yesterday that proposed a shift in focus. He said: I do not seek to present a balance sheet of the good and the bad-not a list of top-down programs imperfectly managed; not the same old story of reports written but not read. Instead, I believe in a new approach. We must forget the insulting fiction that the First Australians are a problem to be solved and, instead, have a new approach to listen to people who stand on the other side of the gap; a new approach that, from now on, the First Australians must have first say in the decisions that shape their lives; a new approach that means a stronger voice for the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples and the resourcesmost importantlyto make it happen; a new approach to extend ourselves beyond handpicked sources of advice; a new approach to be in the places where our First Australians live and work and play… Not treating local consultation as a box to be ticked but applying the wisdom of people who know. Understanding and recognising there are many Aboriginal nations across this country … And all of these nations have the right to have control of their future. As we know, many of the current targets are due to be renegotiated. Yesterday in his speech the opposition leader suggested the inclusion of some new targets, including a new national justice target that will be developed in cooperation with state and territory governments, law enforcement agencies, legal clinics and social services and, most importantly, guided by community leaders, elders and Aboriginal representative organisations. To address the appalling incarceration rates of Indigenous Australians and the tragedy that so many young Indigenous Australians are destined for jail over university, the opposition leader recommended a target for reducing the number of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care. We have also got a 440 per cent increase in Aboriginal children in out-ofhome care. That is shocking. It is a blight on our nation. Hence that recommendation. One in three children in statutory out-of-home care are Indigenous. Indigenous children are nearly 10 times more likely to be removed by child protection authorities than their non-Indigenous peers. Labor is also calling for the government to properly fund Aboriginal community controlled health organisations and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Implementation Plan. As I said, this was sobering reading, but I did welcome appendix A, which is at the back of the report, that shows Indigenous representation in Commonwealth public sector agencies. It shows agency by agency the targets they have for that representation as well as the reality of that representation as at 30 June. I went first to Defence because prior to entering politics I spent 10 years consulting in Defence and I had the great pleasure of working in the Australian Defence Force Cadets organisation. It is a youth development organisation. It gives young Australians-there were 22,000 at that stage-the opportunity to get a taste of the Australian Defence Force and, most importantly, to boost their self-esteem, self-confidence and selfdiscipline and to work in a team. There are a number of cadet units specifically targeted at young Indigenous Australians. I had the great pleasure of going to Bamaga, Nhulunbuy and Thursday Island to see those programs in operation up there. The young Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal cadets loved being cadets. They found it gave them so much in terms of those skills, self-esteem, confidence and self-discipline. It also gave them the opportunity to be with like-minded people and learn a whole lot of new skills. With that background in the defence organisation and also because I was involved in writing the first Defence Reconciliation Action Plan as well as the updates on its implementation, I was very keen to see how Defence is performing. Navy has a strong Indigenous presence, but I was quite disappointed to see that, for the Department of Defence-that is, in the civilian space-the target is 2.5 per cent Indigenous representation and yet by June 2016 it was just 1.8 per cent. The ADF-and this excludes ex-active reservists-aimed for 2.7 per cent and the reality was only 1.8 per cent representation. Active reservists had a target of 2.5 per cent and had 1.7 per cent representation. I was also surprised to see that the Australian National University, despite the fact that it had a target of 2.5 per cent, had zero representation as of 30 June 2016 as did the Australian Research Council. The Department of the Environment and Energy deserves a big tick because their target was 4.5 per cent and they had achieved 6.4 per cent. The Department of the Treasury is another disappointing one: 2.5 per cent and yet 0.2 per cent in terms of representation there. We do need to listen to Indigenous Australians. We do need to do more to be able to employ them in our public institutions, our cultural institutions, our bureaucracy and our places of democracy that shape and implement public policy. The Closing the gap report has a chapter on employment and there is a really lovely section I will quote from a young woman who was a Defence Indigenous Development Program participant. Her name is Kelly Curry and she said, 'I am very proud of the people we have become and the new outlook we have on life.' That is something we want for all Indigenous Australians. It comes from being born fighting fit. It comes from being safe. It comes from having a roof over your head-not a substandard housing option; a roof over your head. It comes from being healthy. It comes from being literate. It comes from being numerate. It comes from being educated. It comes from employment. It comes from economic development. It comes from being empowered. It comes from access to opportunity and equality. It comes from a new approach that listens to First Australians, gives them a stronger voice that they can control, and recognises that they have the solutions-a new approach that fosters hope, that builds on a sense of belonging and that builds on a sense of respect, recognition and resources. Debate adjourned. Report No. 38 of 2016-2017 Consideration resumed of the motion: That the House take note of the report. the WestConnex project and into the Commonwealth financing of that project. The report resulted from an investigation which I requested last year, both as the shadow transport minister and as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. This report that was tabled in the parliament yesterday represents the Auditor-General revealing an extraordinarily cavalier approach to the handling of literally billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. The objective of the audit was to determine whether the government had taken appropriate steps: …to protect the Australian Government's interests and obtain value for money in respect to the $3.5 billion in funding committed for the WestConnex project. On both accounts, the Auditor-General has delivered a scathing verdict. Desperate to appear to be doing something on infrastructure when they came to office, the Commonwealth government cut funds that had been allocated to projects that had been approved through Infrastructure Australia-such as the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane, the Melbourne Metro project in Melbourne, the M80 project and the Outer Ring Road in Melbourne-and cut $500 million which was for public transport projects in Perth and was then allocated to toll roads that simply had not been through appropriate processes. They did not have a business case, they had not been through Infrastructure Australia and they were not ready to receive funding. The Commonwealth coalition came to office saying that they would require all Commonwealth funded infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to have undergone a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia. The Auditor-General says this in the report: The WestConnex project had not proceeded fully through the established processes to assess the merits of nationally significant infrastructure investments prior to Australian Government funding being committed. They went further: they even ignored their own department. The report says: The May 2014 decision to make the $500 million advance payment led to the project being approved without there being any documented analysis and advice to Ministers that the statutory criteria for giving such approvals had been met. It also went through the processes of milestone payments. Milestone payments were established when I was the minister to ensure that the objectives for which money was allocated from the Commonwealth were actually being met-that is, you did not just forward an advance payment of money without there actually being construction. This arose because when I became the infrastructure minister it was clear to me that under the Howard government the only key performance indicator that it was ever looked at was, 'Has the money gone out the door?'-not whether anything had been built-and hence you had a whole range of advance payments being made every June.",205,Ministerial Statements
238,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (12:27,"I rise to speak to the Auditor-General's report intoWhat we had here was $500 million forwarded as an advanced payment for WestConnex at the same time as $1.5 billion was forwarded as an advance payment for the East West Link. That was all designed to bring forward expenditure into the 2013-14 financial year in which, of course, the Labor government had handed down the 2013 budget so that the deficit in 2013-14 would appear to be bigger and finances in future years would appear to be better. This was a manipulation based upon politics and nothing more. But it is even worse than that, because in the words of the Auditor-General in the report: … three milestone paymentsworth $1 billionwere designed and administered in a way that did not adequately protect the Australian Government’s financial interests. This was because, in order not to delay payments, milestones were agreed to after the respective event had already occurred or amended shortly before the payment was due to be made where New South Wales (NSW) had not met the milestone. Just think about that. Here you had the federal government and the federal minister working out criteria for payments to be forwarded not in advance saying, 'If you build this portion of road, we will forward further money to you', but working out criteria which had already been met. The exact opposite of what milestone payments are due for! It included the fact that the department, to quote the report: Advice provided prior to the first payment (of $500 million in June 2014) identified that a payment of that magnitude was not yet required. The report went on further, in terms of incurring unnecessary public debt, to criticise the concessional loan. It makes it very clear in the report: … Stage2 could have progressed towards construction as planned without the concessional loan. It goes on to say: There are relatively few features built into the loan contracts for the benefit of the Australian Government in its role as subordinated lender. This has been a farcical situation from the beginning. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12:34 to 12:43 for this fiasco is not theirs. Of course, it is. The fact is that page 22 of the report outlines: The Labor Government also attached the following preconditions to that commitment:  development of a full business case and its submission to and assessment by Infrastructure Australia;  that the design include suitable connections to the Sydney CBD and Port Botany; and  that no tolls be imposed on currently untolled existing roads. When people in Western Sydney who today are driving on the M4 untolled drive on exactly the same section of road later on once the toll is reintroduced for road they have already paid for I think there will be a great deal of frustration that the government of New South Wales and federally under the coalition have reimposed a toll on a road that has already been paid for. Also, when Infrastructure New South Wales recommended to the New South Wales government that this be a priority, they recommended it on the basis that it deal with freight to",214,Auditor General S Reports
239,Mr Albanese,"The coalition have somehow attempted to argue that the responsibilityand from the port. There was an issue with the M5 reaching capacity, and Infrastructure Australia even looked at a truck-only road from the M5 directly to the port. At the moment, what you have with this project is perhaps the only road project in global history where tunnelling began-at Strathfield where the M4 ends-without knowing where the tunnel would come up. After literally every single dollar of Commonwealth's $1.5 billion grant funding had been fully forwarded to the New South Wales government, they were still changing its final destination and, indeed, removing the exit point at Broadway and just maintaining the two exit points at St Peters and at Rozelle. Good infrastructure requires the planning to be done first and then the financing and construction. This report reaffirms that and reaffirms that this government continues to get it wrong. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 12:46",215,Auditor General S Reports
