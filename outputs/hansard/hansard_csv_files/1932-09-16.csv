0,"Recipient Of Such, Money; And So On. I F We Are To Be At Liberty To Move On The Motion For The Second Reading Of A Bill, An Amendment Involving The Introduction Of An Alternative Measure, A Tremendous Field Of Debate Is Opened Up. This Would He An Interference With The Proper Progress Of The Business Of The House, Because The Effect Of Permitting Such A Practice Would Be So Far Reaching That It Would Be Difficult Indeed To Confine Any Discussion To The Strict Purpose Of The Bill. I Submit, Therefore, That, According To The Standing Orders, The Amendment Is Out Of Order. Order The Attorney","General has referred to Standing Orders 160, 161 and 162. Standing Order 160 sets out the method of moving the motion for the second reading of a bill. Standing Order 161 makes certain provision for the moving of amendments to the motion for She second reading. For instance, it may be moved that certain words in the motion be left out or varied, and if such an amendment be agreed to, the bill is finally disposed of. But Standing Order 162 provides that certain other amendments may be moved to the motion provided that they are relevant to the bill. S oint of relevancy that the Attorneyeneral has based his objection. I submit that as during the course of the debate on this measure honourable members have been permitted to address themselves to various aspects of the subject, including unemployment, the Chair has already practically decided that unemployment is relevant. for instance, was not objected to as that any honourable member is of the opinion that unemployment is irrelevant to a bill which proposes that a grant of a certain sum of money shall be made to South Australia in consequence of certain disabilities of that State. imagination can it be held that unemployment is other than entirely relevant, not only to this measure, hut to practically every other subject that, in our present circumstances, is submitted to honourable members for consideration. Unemployment is at the root of all our troubles. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) has indicated that he would like to discuss the subject of tobacco on the motion before the Chair. cuss the subject of New States. such a discussion could be regarded as relevant, because our Constitution provides that the affairs of this country shall be governed in .a certain way. In any case the subject of new States is in no sense analogous to that of unemployment. I submit, however, that having allowed a discussion on the subject of unemployment in the debate on this bill, the Chair has already determined that that subject is relevant. The object of this bill is to make a grant to South Australia in consequence of certain disabilities under which that State is labouring. Unemployment is undoubtedly one of those disabilities, and honourable members would therefore be in order, I contend, in directing that any money voted to that State shall be spent specifically for the relief of unemployment. The reasoning of the Attorney General is, in my opinion, faulty. If the money proposed to be granted to SouthI t is on the Australia were devoted to the relief of unemployment, one of the main disabilities of the States would be relieved. The point of order, therefore, should not be sustained. -The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) gave me notice of his intention to raise My speech, this point of order on the amendment of the honourable member for ""West Sydney irrelevant. I cannot think ( Mr Beasley). The original question before the Chair was "" That the bill be now read a second time,"" and upon that question the honourable member for West Sydney has moved by way of amendment ""That all the words after ' T h a t ' be omitted with a view to the insertion of Surely by no stretch of the the following words in place thereof:' the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide that financial assistance shall be for the sole purpose of relief of unemployment'."" I do not think that the amendment is inconsistent with section 56 of the Constitution. Therefore, the only point to be considered is whether it is relevant to the bill, as is required by",22,Setup

4,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. H. Mackay).,"Standing Order 1'62. In this connection, I remind honorahle members of the terms of the Governor General's message on which the measure is founded. This appeared in Votes and Proceedings for Thursday, the 1st September, and reads as follows:Message No. 27 -In accordance with 'the reOnly the honourable member for Hunter's quirements of section 5(i of the Constitution of tlie Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor General recommends to the House of : .Representatives that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purpose of a bill for .an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Eevenue Fund a sum for the purpose of financial assistance to the State of South Australia. 1 rule that the amendment does not seek to increase, the appropriation proposed for the financial assistance of South Australia. The money proposed to be granted «an be spent by that State for the purpose of relieving unemployment, or for any other purpose considered to be necessary. There are many precedents in the practice of this House which support the validity of the amendment. I have available references to numerous cases in which similar amendments have been moved to motions for the second reading of bills, among them being one moved by the Attorney-General himself, to the Wheat Advances Bill, on the 16th December, 1930. The nearest case «f a like character to that under consideration occurred in the sessiou of 1923-24 during the debate on the motion for the second reading of tiro Defence Equipment Bill. In that instance, the amendment sought to limit any expenditure under the bill to Australia, although no area was defined in the measure. The amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney merely seeks to limit to a definite purpose the proposed financial assistance which the bill provides for general purposes, and is, therefore^ quite in order. adjourned.

The bills contain provisions ( Mr White). I do not propose at this for the operation of these exemptions on juncture to enter upon a general disand from the 2nd September, 1932. cussion upon the merits of the present form of taxation or of a turnover tax. The Government is at present unable to those announced in the budget speech, are make such a complete change as has been as follows:suggested; but it is our desire to give relief in certain directions. Prom the 1st August, 1930, to the 30tb June. 1932, a total revenue of nearly £12,000,000 has heen collected from this source, at a cost of approximately £325,000, or a little over 1 per cent, which compares fairly favourably with the cost of collecting other forms of taxation. Certain competitive anomalies and technical and other defects were inevitable, and the more important, of those that have come under notice have been made the subject of amendments contained in these bills. I , therefore, propose to give honourable members an indication of the effect of the proposed amendments, which can, if necessary, be explained more fully in committee. The object of these bills may broadly be stated as follows:1. To give effect to the exemptions, in aid of primary production, which were announced in detail in the budget speech, and to additional exemptions since decided upon with the same object in view -Claus e 8, Bill No. 1. tions and abatements, the main effect of which will be to bring the operation of the sales tax into line, on certain matters of principle, with the operation of cus3.

Dips aud washes for cattle or sheep. Agricultural, horticultural and viticultural spraying and dusting materials and preparations to be used in the checking of noxious weeds, plant and seed insect pests, and plant and seed diseases. These exemptions will also operate on and from the 2nd September, 1932. The hist four of the additional exemptions both qualify and extend the exemptions announced in the budget speech, and should be read in substitution for the exemptions so announced. It has also heen decided, with the object of aiding primary producersf i ) to extend the existing exemption of flotation re-agents to chemicals sold to or imported by a person engaged in the mining industry in the recovery of gold by eyaniding or similar processes (clause 8c, Bill No. 1) ; and (ii) to apply the exemption of imported chaff bags, which at present operates as from the l l t h July, 1931, retrospectively as from the 1st August, 1930 (clause 5 (5), Bill No. 5). The other exemptions and abatements provided for in the bills are the following :1. Cakes, not including block cakes Clause8 h, Bill No. tThis will remove difficulties which have arisen in the application of the exemption of pastry and be in line with the general principle of exempting common or basic foodstuffs. 2. Newspaper blocks -Claus e 8 g, Bill No. 1This exemption is considered desirable in view of the existing exemption of newspapers. 3. British films -Clause4 d. Bill No. 5These were intended to be exempted, together with foreign films, by last year's amending acts; hut, through an oversight, the exemption was limited, in effect, to non-British films. 4. Exchange publications consigned to international exchange centres in Australia and publications donated to a Commonwealth or State government department, or to an institution or society, and. not intended to be sold by the donee Clause4 c, Bill No. 5Although unable, in view of thesacrifice of income involved, to accede to the representations for the exemption of all imported books and journals, the Government has agreed toexempt importations of the publications described, in view of their non-commercial character. 5. Re-imported goodsI t was intended by last year's, amending acts to exempt re-imported goods admitted free of customs duty under tariff item 401, but, by an oversight, goods covered by paragraph B of that item were not included in the exemption -Claus e 4 h. Bill No. 5. 6. Posters (and other printed advertising matter) issued by overseas tourist bureaus, railway authorities or steamship companies advertising places beyond the Commonwealth -Claus e 4 h, Bill No. 5This exemption, which involves very little loss of revenue, and which has already been granted in respect of customs and primage duties, is the outcome of representations made on behalf of Canadian railway authorities. 7. Drawback of sales tax -Claus e 3, Bill No. 5By this provision, drawback of"" sales tax paid On the importation of any goods will be allowed wherever drawback of customs duty on those goods is allowed. This will provide a much needed relief from tax in. the class of case in which sales tax is paid on the importation of any goods which the importer is obliged to export, because he finds them defective or unsuitable. 8. Fish, smoked or dried, and lobsters and other Crustacea boiled, for the purpose of being marketed in a wholesome condition -Claus e 5, Bill No. 1Australian primary products are exempt from sales tax, but only in -their natural state, that is, before any process or treatment takes place v which alters their form, nature or condition. A large section of those engaged in the fishing industry has been d'e. prived of the benefit of the general exemption of primary products, because it is frequently impossible to market fish in a wholesome condition without submitting them to some process such as boiling, smoking or drying. This unexpected hardship will be removed by these bills. The proposed amendments, which have as their object the removal of defects and anomalies and the clarification of the law, may be briefly stated and explained as follows:(a) Extension of the definition of "" manufacture ""In consequence of a decision of the High Court, some doubt exists as to whether a person who imports or purchases fabricated parts and combines them into a distinct commercial article can be treated as a manufacturer. It is essential that the law should be clarified for the purpose of ensuring that the tax should fall, as intended, on the sale value of the completed article, and that the person who and lodgement of security to be enforced both fabricates and combines the parts of any commercial article should not be at a disadvantage in competition with persons who produce a similar article by a combination of purchased or imported parts. -Claus e 2 a, Bill No. 1. (b) A definition of "" wholesale sale ""The department has experienced many difficulties in determining what sales may bo classified as wholesale sales. No guidance has been available by way of decisions of the court on this point, but it is necessary to protect the revenue by expressing in the law certain principles to be followed in this connection -Claus e 2 b, Bill No. 1. (c) A provision to enable sales tax to be levied on manufacturers who dispose of their products to other persons otherwise than by saleThere are many classes of manufacturers who dispose of the whole or the greater part of their products Afr Lyons. in the course of contracts for work and labour, for example, contracts for the installation of lifts by a lift manufacturer. I i i such cases, the goods manufactured escape tax because they are not soldi It is proposed to remove this anomaly by providing that goods disposed of in such circumstances shall be deemed to have been soldi-Claus e 2 d, Bill No. 1. (d) A provision for the effective collection of sales tax from trustees,.ret!eivers and like persons who assume control of the businesses of registered personsWhere a trustee or receiver assumes control of the business of a manufacturer or wholesale merchant, and proceeds to wind up that business, it is not possible, under the existing law, to require him to be registered. The consequence is that goods which have been obtained free of tax by the wholesaler or manufacturer whose business is being wound up entirely escape tax. It is necessary to remedy this anomaly -Claus e 2 c, Bill No. 1. (c) A provision to enable registration in the case of persons who failed to comply with their obligation to renew registration and security prior to the commencement of last year's amending acts -Claus e 3 a, Bill No. 1. (/) A provision to ensure that where a registered person who has' furnished security enters into a deed of arrangement under Part XII . of the Bankruptcy Act, the Commissioner's assent to that deed shall not release the surety from his obligations under the securityThe practice of the department is not to assent to such deeds, but to submit a proof of debt for the tax due. The necessity for the amendment arises from implications, arising from a recent judicial decision, that proof of debt in such cases is tantamount ta assent to the deed of arrangement -Claus e 3 ?;, Bill No. 1. (ff) An amendment to simplify the ascertainment of the sale value of goods, in the case of manufacturers, where the required sale value is not the actual sale price of the goodsUnder the existing law the burden is placed on the department of establishing a wholesale or market value of goods iu such cases. Almost insuperable difficulties have arisen in administration of the law in this connection. To remove these difficulties it has relevant acts to impose the same liability been decided to prescribe for all such cases that the sale value of the goods shall be the price for which the manufacturer concerned could have purchased those goods from other manufacturers. This will also remove the undesirable implication, in the present form of the law, that the tax applies only to goods of a class which the taxpayer manufactures for sale -Claus e 4, Bill No. 1. (h) A provision to make fully effective ihe exemption from sales tax of goods 1 sold to, or imported by, Commonwealth and State Governments, departments and authorities in certain circumstancesSales to, and importations by, government departments are, in certain prescribed circumstances, ' exempt from tax. Where, however, tax has been paid on any goods before they are sold to a government department, the exemption is nullified because the vendor must recoup himself for the sales tax previously paid in respect of the goods. The typical case is that of the retailer who obtains government contracts, and whose goods have all borne tax at the time of their purchase by him. The effect of the amendment will be to enable a refund to be made to the retailer of the tax passed on to him where he can show that he has sold the goods to the government department at a tax-exclusive price Clause 6, Bill No. 1, and corresponding clauses in other bills. (i) A provision for the imposition of a penalty by way of additional tax in certain cases in which misleading returns are furnishedA penalty cannot at present he imposed on taxpayers who include taxable sales under non-taxable heads, hecause it cannot be said that they have omitted any taxable transactions from their returns. Such omissions, however, can only be discovered by an audit of a taxpayer's accounts, and are, therefore, just as prejudicial to the revenue as the complete omission of taxable sales from the returns -Claus e 7, Bill No. 1. ( j ) The inclusion of machinery in the for tax upon persons who have failed to comply with their obligations to become registered as that which is imposed on registered persons -Claus e 2, Bill No. 2, and corresponding clauses in other bills. (h) A provision to extend the benefit of certain rebates granted last year to certain classes of wholesale merchants to trustees and beneficiaries upon whom the estates of such merchants devolve by will, statute or operation of lawThis provision is necessary to effectuate the f u l l intention of last year's amendment of the law in this connection -Claus e 3, Bil l No. 2, and corresponding clauses in other bills. (I) A provision for the purpose of imposing tax on goods which a registered person imj>orts tax-free by quotation of certificate, and which are subsequently applied hy that person to his own useThis provision will remedy an oversight in the original Sales Tax Regulations by placing on the same basis all importers who apply goods imported by them to their own use Clause 3, Bill No. 6. (m) A provision to cause sales tax to be paid on the same basis in all cases in which registered persons purchase goods and apply them to their own useAt present, a registered person who refrains, as required by law, from quoting his certificate when purchasing goods to be applied to his own use, has to bear tax on the purchase price of those goods. On the other hand, a registered person who, whether erroneously or otherwise, obtains goods tax-free by quotation of his certificate, and subsequently applies them to his own use, is' taxable on what would be the fair market value of those goods if sold by him in the ordinary course of trade. The ascertainment of the f a ir acknowledge that MrH ill has been doing market value in the latter case gives his utmost to comply with the conditions rise to considerable difficulty, and of the Premiers plan, and to steer the constitutes, moreover, a differentiapolitical barque, of which he has comtion which has no justification in mand, through the troubled waters of deprinciple -Claus e 2, Bills No. 4 and pression to a safe harbour.

23,Mr Stacey,"Unfortunately , weis almost impossible for industrial enterprises to be carried on successfully in competition with the manufacturing concerns in the eastern States. Also, we lack natural forests. We have one of the finest deposits of iron ore in the world, but cannot work it satisfactorily owing to the lack of coal. Consequently, ore from Iron Knob has to be exported to New South Wales and other parts of the world. Another disability, and one so serious as to b6 a national calamity, is due directly to the action of that section of the community which supports the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I refer to the closing down some time ago of the Wallaroo and Moonta mines which, over a long period, gave remunerative employment to about 6,000 men. Many years ago, I worked in those mines, and therefore I sp'cak from first-hand knowledge of the position. At that time, they were not under trade union control. On two days of each week, the price of copper was posted at the offices of the mines, and the minors' wages were regulated by the market price. This proved a very satisfactory arrangement, not only to the company, but also to the employees. When the war broke out the market for copper was, for a time, restricted. Accordingly, the men were asked to accept a reduction of 10 per cent, in their wages. They readily agreed to the proposal, and work proceeded smoothly for about two months. As the market situation did not improve they were again approached and asked to accept a further reduction of 5 per cent., making the total reduction 15 per cent. Again they accepted the changed conditions and continued at work. Shortly afterwards the British Government made a contract to take all the copper that could he produced by the Wallaroo and Moonta mines for a period of five years, or the duration of the war, at £109 per ton. Following the arrangement which had always been in force of regulating wages by the price of copper, the miners' wages rose substantially. I happened to be in the pay office of Wallaroo mine one day about three months after the contract had been made with the British Government, and noticed that, as the men entered one door they received their pay envelopes, and as they left the office by the other were handed a second envelope containing tlie arrears of pay representing the 15 per cent, reduction to which they had agreed some months earlier. I mention this to show that, in all its relations with its employees, the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining Company had been most scrupulously fair. When the contract ceased, trouble arose in the mines, largely owing to the interference of trade union officials. These men told the miners that they were amongst the highest-paid miners in the world, and that, although the price of copper had fallen, they should sec that their wages did not fall also. I am, as I have said, speaking from first-hand knowledge because I was interested in the company at the time, and was supplying the mines with all the underground timber required. Although the price of copper fell steadily from £109 to as low as £75 per ton, the men, being influenced by trade union officials from Adelaide, declined to accept any reduction in wages. As all negotiations proved abortive, the mines finally were closed down, and, as they are what are described as "" wet"" mines, requiring powerful pumping machinery to keep clown the water, it is improbable that they will ever be re-opened Eventually, the company was compelled to go into liquidation, and machinery worth anything up to £1,000,000 has been sold piecemeal. As the direct result of interference by trade union officials from Adelaide, the copper-mining industry in the Wallaroo and Moonta districts has been extinguished, shareholders interests have been sacrificed and approximately 6,000 men have been forced into idleness. If the Premier of South Australia had not courageously adhered to the Premiers plan-ha d he continued in the leadership of the section which is now opposed to him in State politics-South Australia would have been in a much more desperate plight to-day than she is. We should have required, not £2,000,000, which was asked of the Commonwealth, and which should have been granted, but a very much larger sum. Because of the heroic measures adopted by the Premier of South Australia, the people of that State are taxed up to the hilt, but they are-bearing the burden manfully, secure in the belief that the legislation passed, and the steps taken by tbe State Government, will eventually bring South Australia through her difficulties. Some opponents of the measure, notably those representing New South ""Wales, have asked why the smaller States should look to the Commonwealth for financial assistance. I remind them that New South Wales, some little time ago, helped herself to much more than is now asked on behalf of the smaller States. As for the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), that the grant should be allocated for the relief of unemployment in Australia, I merely wish to say that we are going to get the amount provided in the bill, and we know how to spend it. One has no alternative but to support the bill, because the current financial year is Government is budgeting this year now fairly well advanced, and it is absolutely necessary that the States concerned should be in a position to carry on their activities. But I hope that, before the next budget is brought down, proposals to grant assistance to the smaller and primary-producing States of the Commonwealth will be put on a proper basis. 1 disapprove of the principle of year to year payments. If there are to be money payments by the Commonwealth to the necessitous States, a definite term of years monwealth will also have deficits at the should be provided. .During the regime of the"" Bruce-Page Government the arrangement with South Australia was for three years, and with Tasmania and Western Australia it was on a five years' basis, so that the State Treasurers were able to lay down a continuous policy. I have always felt that the policy of paying money to the States in this way is faulty, and one that should not be continued. It would be far better if we could find some means whereby the States could ""be assisted, either through an alteration of the national policy in several respects, notably in connection with the tariff, by special assistance to agricultural industries, or by allotting definite fields of taxation to the States. gation Act? past we have consistently advocated the total national income, involving the imrepeal of the Navigation Act in order to position of additional taxation, whether assist the far distant States. I think indirect in the form of customs duties the time has arrived when a new line of demarcation should be drawn which will ensure that the States will be able to carry out their functions, especially their developmental activities, without any fear for the future. At present, it is impossible for them to do so and it is our responsibility to see that the position is altered. The budget papers presented by the right honourable the Prime Minister show how necessary this is and how impossible it is for things to continue as they are for very much longer. During the last four years, the accumulated deficit steadily rose until it was over £17,000,000. Grants to various States were, during that period, paid, so to speak, out of that accumulated deficit. Although the Commonwealth for a deficit of £1,300,000, it will he offset by the surplus from the operations of last year, but if it is necessary to pay £4,100,000 owing to Great Britain for interest, the deficit for the current financial year will be_ over £5,000,000. The position in Australia today is that the States receiving grants from the Commonwealth will still have deficits in their accounts and the three States not receiving grants in the Comend of the current financial year. These particular payments to the States seem to be payments out of nothing or out of something which is less than nothing. That is a condition of affairs which surely must lead to a demand for the reorganization of our governmental system in order to give the States and the Commonwealth some definite financial future in which such a situation is not likely to arise again. The reductions in the cost, of administration, both Commonwealth and State, are in no way comparable with the reduction in the national income.

Such a reform is long overdue, and I suggest that at the next Premiers ""Conference the Commonwealth representatives should ask the various State Governments to call together committees representative of the local governing associations, to discuss means of abolishing duplication, and so reducing expenditure. Much avoidable cost is incurred through laws and regulations requiring the filling in of forms and returns, many of which are unnecessary, but have become part of the accepted routine. During the next four or five years we shall have to explore every avenue to discover where economy consistent with efficiency can be effected. We shall find it imperative to do what was done in the 'nineties, when, because of the continual drop in the national The railway stations in income, the cost of government in Victoria was reduced from approximately £9 10s. a head, to £5 14s.

I further urge the Government to extend, as far as possible, the system' I initiated in 1923 when I brought about the amalgamation of the Federal and State taxing authorities. By that step the cost of administering the Treasury was reduced from approximately £1,000,000, when I assumed office, to £650,000 when I left office, a definite saving of £350,000 with increased convenience to the taxpaying public. The essence of the arrangement was that although the Federal Parliament imposed its own taxation, the State should collect it for us. The result was that the Commonwealth saved upwards of £300,000 annually, and I understand that the economies in the States amounted to another £3.00,000. I believe that this effort at uniformity and the removal of duplication could be extended considerably, simplifying government, reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and leaving more people available for productive work. If we can carry out, as well, the subdivision of New South Wales into new States, .as is now proposed, a definite restraint will he placed upon both State taxation ' and borrowing.

I hope that before thiB grant comes up for revision next year, some definite period will be stipulated, or some permanent provision made for assisting the smaller States, which, I think, are entitled to the consideration that they are asking for to-day. I agree with the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) that the smaller States who have to approach this Government for assistance, are undoubtedly penalized under the tariff policy of the Commonwealth, and are, therefore, entitled to some consideration; but they should not have to depend upon a chance vote in this chamber for the assistance that theyneed.

I do not place much hope in the idea of turning over the affairs of the States to the Commonwealth. Our railway systems have been specifically mentioned, but I am inclined to think that if they were placed under Commonwealth control we should be changing from seven extravagant systems to one even more extravagant system. The right honourable member for Cowper referred to what he called co-ordination, but the only co-ordination that the Commonwealth Government seems to understand is a system under which the State Governments will"" hand over control to the Commonwealth. the experience of the past.

Unfortunately, that ideal is not likely to be accomplished so long as the people of the more popular States are able, hy means of their greater voting-power, to force on the people of Australia generally, a policy which protects the large communities at the expense of the small. We cannot bring about this ideal position, so we give some measure of compensation to the States which are adversely affected by federation. Provision for giving compensation to States was made in the Federal Constitution, and it is because of the existence of that provision that these proposals have been brought forward. member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has moved an amendment which is designed to change these grants to the States into a special grant for unemployment, but to confuse issues leads only to confusion of ideas. honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) was prepared to support this legislation provided that he could obtain from the Government some promise in connection with the establishment of new States. I have no doubt Mr Nairn. that many other honourable members have hobbies; but if they are willing to allow those hobbies to influence their votes in this chamber, we shall never come to any logical conclusion. The claims of the States should be dealt with on their merits. Several independent investigations have been made into the positiou of the smaller States, and those who have made the inquiries have all been unanibeginning of federation were in the best position have, since federation, been relegated to an inferior position. Their population has not increased, and their industries have to a large extent languished. It is, therefore, fair to conclude that the outer States are suffering disabilities as a result of tlieir associaI amtion with the Commonwealth. Take the position of Western Australia. An expert has recently calculated the amount of revenue which that State has lost by reason of the abolition of border duties. Taking the year 19.28, if horder duties had been levied to the extent that Commonwealth duties were levied on the quantity of goods imported into that State, it would have collected £2,300,000 in. customs revenue. That sum very nearly coincides with the estimate of £2,400,000 which was made by Mr Mills, a member of the Tariff Royal Commission in respect of the year 1924. That amount of revenue has been lost to Western Australia, and the loss is directly reflected in the state of the finances of the country. Since federation the surpluses that Australia once enjoyed have changed to deficits. That has been generally the experience of the three States that are now asking for assistance. The trouble has arisen chiefly because of the operation of the Australian policy of high The honourable protection. That policy raised the cost of production throughout this country. It rendered gold-mining unprofitable, and the people of Western Australia turned to agriculture. As that State is a country of wide spaces, railways and The other public works had to be constructed, and grants had to be made to farmers. As a result, large sums of money had to be borrowed mainly for the purpose of establishing public utilities, the like of which liad already been established under cheaper conditions in the older States. While agricultural products were realizing high prices, the outer States were ahle to carry on; but now that the price of wool and wheat has fallen 50 per cent., they are forced to seek assistance from the Commonwealth. Objection has been raised by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Parkhill), with some appearance of good reason, that Western Australia has not been prepared to tax its people sufficiently. It is true that the of Western Australia were to record a income tax levies in Western Australia are the lowest in the Commonwealth, but in considering this matter, we must haveregard to indirect as well as direct taxation. Customs duties are a form of indirect taxation which affects the people just as severely as does direct taxation. The Tariff Commission found in 1925 that protection was costing the people of Western Australia £2 4s. per head above the average for the whole of Australia. In addition, there is a further impost of £1 per head to provide the sugar bounty for Queensland. All these things reduce the ability of the people of Western Australia to pay taxes. In 1930, Professor Giblin made a calculation of the taxable capacity of the people of the different States of Australia. Taking the Australian average as 100, he showed that the taxable capacity of the people of Western Australia was 71. Savings bank deposits in Western Australia average £52 per head of the population, as against the Australian average of £100; while the value of private estates, on the basis of the sworn valuation in the several probate offices, was £1,714 in Western Australia, compared with £2,920, the average for the Commonwealth.

They argue-logically I think-that world has been robbed of such a large demand for goods and services by the unemployment of so many of its people, that it cannot carry on its business activities in anything like a normal way. Australia has still 30 per cent, of its people unemployed. made public by the Commonwealth Statistician ought to lead us to examine what we did last year, and the year before, with a view to seeing whether the results of our efforts have been successful or otherwise. If we conclude that they have not been successful, notwithstanding that they might have done some good, the only logical thing for us to do is to have the courage to try something else. Figures recently published in Geneva, show that 25,000,000 persons are totally unemployed in America, Australia, and European countries. The figures do not include Asiatic countries. On a conservative basis, that means that between 60,000,000 and 70,000,000 people are deprived of their purchasing power. The consequent falling off in the demand for goods and services has brought about the present depression. All the methods adopted under the Premiers plan have failed, and must continue to fail, to solve this problem. £1,000,000 to South Australia will not, and cannot, put that State on its feet, I shall vote to grant that amount to South Australia because there is nothing else offering. Logical though the amendment may be, I feel that! effect could not be given to it. Even if it were carried,. itr IJolloway. it would temporarily add to the army of unemployed' in that State rather than lessen their number, and for that reason I cannot vote for it. I agree with the country agree that it honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that if the people of South Australia, and indeed, of the Commonwealth as a whole, were to attack the problem of unemployment at its foundagroup tion they could not do better than spend every penny of the £.1,000,000 in setting the unemployed to work. to the conI n Australia we still have 30 per cent, of our population unemployed, and the basic wage is lower now than it has been for many years. The costs of production in every direction are lower than ever. The factors which most honourable memthe bers claim should put industry upon a normal footing are operating, yet the position grows worse instead of better. Because of that, I take a different view from that of a large number of othei honourable members of this House. Ji has been said repeatedly that with lower costs of production, and reduced overSurely the facts head expenses generally, Australia would be better able to compete with other countries in which a lower standard of living is enjoyed by the masses of the people. In that connection, I propose to quote an extract from the last copy to hand of the journal issued by the International Labor Office at Geneva. The paragraph refers to Japan, and I am always interested in the experience of other countries. I selected this quotation, because we regard the cost of production in Japan, China and India as being lower than that in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and some other countries. The statement should make even the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) again consider whether our remedy lies in lower costs, because the argument of the school of thought to which he belongs is that if we could cut down costs to a basis which would give us fair competition with countries that produce at lower costs than ourselves, all would be well.

In the budget speech I announced that the maximum pension payment would be reduced from 17s. 6d. to 15s. per week, that a system of inspection would be adopted with' a view to limiting pension payments to those for whom they are really intended, that future pension payments would be a charge against the pensioner's estate at death, and that should the pensioner become possessed of property cancelling the right to receive a pension, the pension would be a charge against such property. In considering the amendments necessary to give effect to the budget proposals, the Government has come to the conclusion that the necessary savings in the pension bill can be secured without reducing the pensions of those who are entirely dependent for their maintenance on their pension. It therefore proposes to maintain at 17s. 6d. the pensions of those who come within that category. At the same time, however, the Government proposes that, where the children of pensioners are in a position to eontribute towards the cost of the pension, they may be required to do so. Before explaining fully the proposals of the Government, I think it desirable to make quite clear the extraordinary growth of pensions, particularly within recent years. The estimated expenditure on old-age and invalid pensions for the present year is £10,500,000. pension remained at 17s. 6d. the expenditure would have heen £11,812,000. Had it remained at £1, the expenditure would have been £13,125,000. Last year the actual expenditure was £11,126,000. In the first ten years of the operation of the Pensions Act, the annual rate of increase in the number of pensions paid was 5,428. In the next ten years the average annual increase was 11,149. In the last three years the increases have been-1929-30 , 13,950; 1930-31, 22,020, 1931-32, 15,089. Last year the position wasv Number of old-age pensioners .. 183,317 Number of invalid pensioners .. 72,292 Total .. .. ... 255,009 The cost of these pensions was £11,126,000, representing 34s. Id. per head of population. The increase in the cost of pensions per head of the population serves to demonstrate, perhaps more than anything else, the impossibility of continuing this benefit on the existing scale of expenditure. The increase in the per capita cost from 8s. 4d. in 1910-11, to £1 14s. Id. in 1931-32 is little short of astounding. The per capita cost of eourse varies with the rate of pension, but the increase in the number of pensioners is a more important factor iu this direction. During the last six years the average annual increase in the number of pensioners was 13,000. That, this average was exceeded last financial year, during which more than 15,000 pensioners were added to the roll, demonstrates that, omitting the abnormal figures for 1930-31, the annual increase in the number of pensioners is still growing. It was in those circumstances that the Government was reluctantly compelled to seek a reduction in the rate of pension. It was in quite different circumstances that the rate of pension was fixed at 15s. per week in 1920. The Government at that time was favoured with buoyant revenues and the financial year preceding that in which the rate of pension was increased produced a surplus of £2,200,000, whilst the year in which the increase was made closed with a surplus of £893,000. The position facing the present Government is entirely different. Whereas in Had the 1920-21 there were 140,396 pensioners, the number to be provided for at the beginning of thia year was 255,609. We were faced with a prospective deficit of £2,781,000, and after allowing for the surplus brought forward from last financial year there still remained a deficit of £1,467,000, which compelled a reduction in the expenditure to bridge the gap. Even after reducing the rate of pension the scale of payment iu the Commonwealth compares more than favourably with those of Great Britain, and the 'Other components of the Empire.

67,Mr Lyons,"No, by the CommonUnder the existing law, if a pensioner directly or indirectly deprives himself of property or income in order to qualify for or obtain a pension, he is ineligible to receive a pension. In order to tighten up this provision it is now proposed to disqualify an applicant for a pension if, within a period of five years preceding his claim, he has transferred otherwise than bona fide for value, property exceeding in the' aggregate the sum of £100. At the same time a discretion is left to the perty to the pensions authority, in which' commissioner that, if he is satisfied that any such transfer of property, though not made for value, was a reasonable gift, the claimant shall not by reason of that transfer be ineligible for a pension. Upon the death of a pensioner the amount of pension paid to him after the commencement of the act shall be a debt due to the Commonwealth, and is charged upon his estate in priority to all other debts of the pensioner except encumbrances existing prior to such commencement upon real property of the pensioner. To give effect to this provision it is necessary to take power to control the sale and transfer of real property by the pensioner. To this end no pension will be granted to any person, nor will the payment of pension be continued to existing pensioners unless the claimant or pensioner furnishes to the Commissioner full particulars of veal property owned by hiin or in which he has any interest. Every pensioner and every claimant will be required to sign an undertaking not to transfer or mortgage any real property except with the prior consent in writing of the Commissioner, and any person who accepts a mortgage or transfer of real property from a pensioner without such consent will be guilty of an offence. ties have knowledge of these matters? persons they will surely be entitled to inquire. A transfer or mortgage effected in contravention of this provision will be void, and of no effect. There are precedents for this provision. Under the Victorian Old-age Pensions Act, which was passed in 1901, the claimant was required to sign a deed poll under which he undertook on demand to transfer all his real property to the State, [21] and the State was authorized to sell such property, and to deduct from the proceeds the amount of pension paid. dents in that act. different, methods. The Canadian pensions law provides that a pensioner who possesses property, being a home in which he resides, may transfer the proevent the property will not be maintained for the purpose of calculating the pension. On the death of the pensioner, or upon his ceasing to use such property as a home, the authority may sell the property and, after deducting the amount of pension paid by reason of the homo not being maintained as property, together with compound interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, is required to pay the balance to the person entitled thereto. The pension authority is also entitled to recover out of the estate of a deceased pensioner the total amount of pension paid together with compound interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. The hill further provides that where a pensioner becomes the owner of property, not including the home in which he resideSj of such value that he becomes ""disentitled to receive a pension, it is provided that the total amount of pension paid after the commencement of the act shall forthwith be recoverable from the pensioner, but so that the total amount of the property is not reduced below £400 or, in the case of a married pensioner, £800.

Under the Wine Export Bounty Act 1928 a bounty of Is. per gallon was payable on fortified wine exported. Wine Export Bounty Act 1930 increased the rate of bounty to Is. 9d. per gallon in respect of fortified wine exported on or after the 13th March, 1930. At the same time the rate of excise duty on spirits used in the manufacture of fortified wine was increased by 5s. per gallon. Provision was made in the act for the amount of revenue derived from the special excise duty of 5s. per gallon to be paid into a trust account, from which the wine export bounty would be payable It was anticipated that the revenue so derived would be sufficient to meet all payments of wine export bounty under the act. Provision was made, however, that any amount hy which the special excise duty fell short of the amount required for the payment of the bounty would be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Mainly owing to the falling off in the local consumption of Australian wines by reason of the financial depression, the revenue derived from the special excise duty has proved insufficient to meet payment of the bounty, and the Consolidated Revenue Fund was required to meet bounty payments to the extent of £96,000 in 1930-31, and £131,000 in 1931-32. The Government feels that a limit should be placed on tlie liability for payment of the bounty, the Gold Bounty Act of 1930. The and provision is, therefore, made in the bill that the amount to be financed by the Consolidated Revenue Fund towards payment of the bounty, namely, the amount of the bounty in excess of the revenue derived from the special excise duty of 5s. per gallon, shall not exceed £96,000, that amount being the deficiency charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund during 1930-31. The bill further provides, in effect, that where payment of the bounty at the rate of Is. 9d. per gallon would involve a charge on the Consolidated Revenue Fund in excess of £96,000, the rate of bounty shall be reduced proportionately. The method of giving effect to this reduction will be prescribed in regulations, but before promulgating these regulations the Minister will confer with representatives of the industry with a view to arriving at a basis of adjustment that will be acceptable to all concerned.

As a result, the producer receives a price in Australian pounds which includes allowance for the depreciation of the Australian pound as compared with sterling and allowance for the depreciation of sterling as compared with gold. The Australian pound in relation to gold has depreciated so much since 1930 that, without any allowance for bounty, the producer now receives far more in Australian pounds than was contemplated when the bounty was first provided for. The par price ofgold per fine ounce is £4 4s. l i d . When the bounty was first agreed to, the Mint price of gold in Australian pounds was £4 l is . 6d. per fine ounce, or 6s. 7d. above par. Wheu the bounty was reduced in July last, the price was £5 9s. i d . or 17s. 7d. above the price when the bounty was first agreed to. At present, the Mint price per fine ounce is £7 6s. in Australian pounds, or £2 14s. 6d. above the price when the Gold Bounty Act was passed. In these circumstances, the payment of a bounty from Commonwealth revenue cannot be justified. trying to catch them on both the London and Australian price. whether the bounty should vary with the variations in the rate of exchange was considered when the original bounty was introduced. Trade and Customs( Mr Porde), in introducing the bill, said that the Government reserved the right to reconsider the question of reducing the bounty in the event of an abnormal rise in the exchange rate.

It is important to remember that, when the Financial Emergency Act of 1931 was passed, Great Britain was on the gold standard. When Britain departed from the gold standard in September, 1931, and sterling depreciated in relation to gold, the mint price of gold in Australia immediately increased. This increase was more than sufficient to offset the reduction made in the bounty under the Financial Emergency Act of 1931. The gold producer is thus now receiving not only more than was contemplated in 1930, when the bounty was introduced, but also more is than was contemplated in 1931 when the bounty was reduced.
