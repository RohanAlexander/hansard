226,Mr Haase,"to move:Wednesday, 21 October 2009 ----Cowan Electorate: Lions Club They do great work, raising funds for not only Lions clubs’ national and international causes, but also locally for individuals in need. As with all Lions clubs they do not do it for the thanks and they do not do it for profile or credit in the community. They do it because they believe in making a difference, with a positive impact on the community. As the federal member for CowanI am proud that there are four clubs within Cowan-Ballajura, Girradoola, KingsleyWoodvale and Wanneroo. These clubs do outstanding work in the community. However, I would like to refer in particular to the Lions Club of Ballajura that has just been named the champion club by the district governor of 201W1 district. I understand that the clubs are assessed with regard to their activities in the categories of service, fundraising and membership growth. The decision comes down to the emphasis applied by the district governor for those categories. Ballajura was named the champion club in 2009 and the title is well and truly justified. The club in Ballajura, with around 23 members, raises about $20,000 each year. The members are often seen working hard at the Bunnings sausage sizzle, running their iconic local prize wheel at community events such as fairs, as well as raising funds through the famous Lions Christmas cakes and Lions mints sales. The proceeds of these fundraisings are distributed to traditional Lions and other well-known causes such as the Perth Lions Eye Institute, the Lions Cord Blood Bank, the Childhood Cancer Research Appeal, the Breast Cancer Foundation, the Leukaemia Foundation, the Australian Red Cross, Foodbank towards the Lions and Rotary Rice Bowl appeal, the Ruby Benjamin Foundation to assist pensioners with the cost of sterilising pets, the annual Lions Walk for Sight at Perry Lakes and this year towards the Lions Victorian bushfire and Queensland flood appeals. In addition I note their local work in the last financial year where they assisted with the purchase of a small gopher for a Ballajura girl, the purchase of a wheelchair hoist-fitted van for a Marangaroo boy, the purchase of a walker for a Wanneroo woman, the purchase of an oxygen machine for a Ballajura woman and to pay for travel expenses for a Marangaroo boy with disabilities to attend a table tennis tournament in Victoria. They also donated towards Quad Dreamers, a group that has organised quad bikes that have been adapted for the use of disabled children in a safe environment in Wanneroo. They have conducted a Christmas dinner and bus ride for Ballajura seniors to visit the city and see the Christmas lights on decorated homes. They also purchased sporting and art supplies for the local scouts to present to the Derby cubs during a visit, assisted a Vietnamese girl attend the Blind Institute and donated towards the purchase of loan computers for the institute. They have for several years conducted an award at the three state primary schools in Ballajura providing $500 to each school for students attending Ballajura Community College the following year.

I will also mention Sue MacDonald, whom has been a very positive force in Ballajura. (Time expired) Petition: Military Justice tend to table a petition for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions which has been put forward by three petitioners who are all senior retired members of the Air Force. The original impetus for this arose out of the effective dismissal of the then commanding officer, senior Air Force officer and honorary ADC in Tasmania, Robert Grey. His grievance has always been a constant denial of simple natural justice in relation to a dismissal to which he was subjected by the then Chief of the Air Force, Air Marshal McCormack, at the asserted request of unnamed Air Force officials and without any prior reference to his commanding officer. But it raises broader issues which are endorsed in this petition by Air Commodore Garry Bates (Retired) and Air Vice-Marshal Peter Criss (Retired), going to the asserted exemption from the rules of natural justice by the most senior officers of the armed forces when dealing with their subordinates. The petition says that except in actual combat the rules and principles of Australian administrative laws should be adhered to so that discretionary powers are not abused, and it calls on still outstanding grievances to be reported correctly and finalised fairly as the Australian people were led to expect. This issue has been raised by Wing Commander Grey and me on numerous occasions. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has recognised, in Mr Grey’s case, that there were significant errors. As a result of a review conducted by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force, the Chief of the Defence Force wrote to Wing Commander Grey acknowledging the deficiencies and expressing regret for the resultant unfairness. But Mr Grey still has not had closure. He has not had any explanation of why this quite unfair process resulted in his effective dismissal from the role he held and of course the humiliation that it imposed in a public way on him and his family. It is important that the issues that have been raised in the petition be dealt with substantively so that all complainants of such nature are given an effective means of addressing what would otherwise be a gap in military discipline which I am certain that our government and the people of Australia would not wish to exist. IfI might close by tabling the petition for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions and for further action, which I hope will be directed towards the minister for a response.

230,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"The document will be forwarded to theDunkley Electorate: Health cessfully in the Dunkley community since 1986. It has the confidence of all the stakeholders, widespread participation from local GPs, and the understanding and valued support of patients. It provides a crucial collaborative asset to the accident and emergency department at the Frankston Hospital, where it is collocated. The Howard government, recognising this very important after-hours GP service, provided $97,000 of funding for a year, on top of earlier avenues of support, to ensure that this service continued to operate. The collaboration with Frankston Hospital is crucial, though, because the medicentre sees about 12,000 patients per year-category 4 and 5 patients that would otherwise join the queues of the accident and emergency department of Frankston Hospital, queues that can be long. I think it does a remarkable job with far too few resources allocated to it by the state Labor government. So here we have collaboration between local GPs and the hospital, organised and coordinated by some dedicated professionals, including Jacquie Haigh. Jacquie is a wonderful individual. Jacquie’s role takes on many aspects in terms of keeping the program going. Jacquie Haigh and Dr Andrew Smith from the Medicentre Advisory Committee came to see me the other day, alarmed that the Rudd Labor government is going to halve the subsidy made available to this after-hours service-halve the modest funding of around $100,000 a year, to provide this crucial service that accommodates 12,000 patients that would otherwise be added to the waiting list in the accident and emergency department. What they have been told is that the termination of the Howard government after-hours funding program has been replaced in the recent budget by the General Practice After Hours Program, a grant program, where only a maximum of $100,000 is available over two years on a competitive basis. There is no certainty about whether the funding will be available, no confidence that they will be able to support the valuable service that is there. One thing we need to recognise is that, without this medicentre after-hours GP service, services would not be available. Local general practitioners stay involved in and are attracted to our community knowing that there is an after-hours GP service that works hand in glove with their clinics, with their practices. They will volunteer to take on certain rostering responsibilities, knowing that will be an after-hours duty but limited and quite specific during the month. This is an outrage. This funding needs to be reinstated. How can the Rudd Labor government stand here in Canberra and say they are interested in public health when they are running down the very health model that has cost-effectively and efficiently supported after-hours GP access for decades? If it at least could revisit the billing numbers, the Medicare item numbers, that limit the payment of after-hours bonuses to after eight o’clock and have them start at 6 pm when the clinics become open and available, that would ease the financial pain. The Rudd Labor government needs to take after-hours GP services seriously in the Dunkley community and reinstate and provide certainty for funding that is available.

I also said that I would work to ensure that our young people would be taught business ethics in our schools and universities. The response by my constituents to this campaign has been incredible. In just one week over 500 residents signed a petition calling on this parliament to ensure that we lead international efforts to establish an anti-asbestos treaty and to promote business ethics. I intend to table this petition in the final sitting week of parliament this year. The response of the people of Lowe to the anti-asbestos campaign demonstrates that the Australian people are fed up with the dishonesty and the deceitful games played time and again by corporate giants such as James Hardie. With this in mind I draw to the attention of the House an article that appeared in last Wednesday’s Australian newspaper by Milanda Rout titled ‘Cruel and inhumane squabble puts asbestos victims in limbo’. This article reveals that compensation claims to dying asbestos victims are being delayed because Australia’s two asbestos manufacturers, James Hardie and CSR, are in a legal dispute over their respective share of financial liability. As a result of this feud, James Hardie, now Amoco, and CSR are insisting that victims of asbestos prove which company’s product they were exposed to. This is outrageous. Victims of asbestos have suffered far too long at the hands of corporate immorality and dishonesty. This latest game of corporate bickering merely creates more suffering and pain for the ever-growing number of innocent victims of asbestos who are urgently waiting to settle their compensation claims. I am not one for mincing words on this topic. As I said, this is an absolute disgrace. As a parliament, we must all do what we can to ensure that James Hardie and CSR meet their compensation obligations and ensure that the poisoning of innocent Australians by asbestos never happens again. Calare Electorate: Health for anything, but I do welcome the fact that the Prime Minister is taking cabinet to Bathurst next month in November. I welcome the fact that he is going there because this is the man who in late 2007 stood up and said ‘The buck stops with me’ on health. Twice he said that in the lead-up to the 2007 election, once when he said that he would fix hospitals and then when he actually said that he would have all that sorted out by the end of June of this year, 2009three months ago. If there is one place in Australia where health needs fixing up it is in the Greater Western Area Health Service, which has been looked after tenderly by the New South Wales Labor government-his colleagues in the Labor Party-over the last dozen or so years. I hope the Prime Minister takes the opportunity while he is in Bathurst, seeing as he is not likely to be the area again, to do a few things. First, I have written to his ministers about the helicopter service there, which has been totally ignored. There is no 24-hour service looking after the whole of western New South Wales out of Orange. I wrote to the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery, Hon. Warren Snowden, who said it was nothing to do with him. He flicked it to the Minister for Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese-that well-known carer of regional affairs. Why would the person responsible for rural and regional health, Indigenous health and regional service delivery, which is everything that the rescue ambulance helicopter service in Orange is about, say this is nothing to do with MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Constituency Statements
233,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (9.43 Am),"Far be it from me to suggest a political motivationhim? I cannot believe it. However, if he is not in cabinet and Anthony Albanese is, one assumes the Prime Minister will tell him to fix that issue while they are in Bathurst. But they can do more. The Prime Minister also said he would fix hospitals in Australia. We have enormous issues. We have Forbes and Parkes hospitals, which the state Labor government promised to fix and renew-but they are not. The Prime Minister should go and have a look at them while he is there. He should have a look at the Bathurst hospital which has been an exercise in ridiculous building and inefficiency and while he is there he can fix that. And he can go to Cobar where the hospital will not accept women about to have babies, making them drive all the way to Dubbo and possibly have their children on the side of the road. I hope the Prime Minister looks at it. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Infrastructure nouncements in my electorate to a total of $6 million. The first was a fantastic announcement along with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, Bill Shorten, for a $4.8 million new autism specific early-learning and care centre-something that we committed to in the 2007 election. I am really pleased that we have been able to go through the whole selection process and announce it last Wednesday, along with the auspices of the Burnie City Council. It will be established at the current Alexander Beetle House Children’s Centre. There will be a top floor put on the centre that currently exists and that will be to a value of $1.75 million in capital works. There will be $2.6 million for operating funding and $372,000 in capacity building for the centre. We look to employing up to six specialist staff, including an early childhood education teacher, psychologist, a speech pathologist and an occupational therapist to work alongside five trained childcare workers. It will be a hub-and-spoke model which will allow the main centre to be in Burnie, but their services will go right throughout the region and even, indeed, into Tassie. This is a fantastic initiative, and I do thank the minister for coming personally to open the centre and for fulfilling our election commitment. I also want to thank, apart from the Burnie City Council which was fundamentally involved in bringing the complex project together, Andrew and Marisa Barry, who met the minister in 2007 and have been advocating for autism services, but particularly for early childhood, for many years. Indeed, they have spent most of their recent lives helping their twin daughters to overcome autism and help support them. They are really glad that this has finally come about. Finally, two other announcements: $969,000 for the Burnie coastal pathway track, which will go from the magnificent Emu River right through to a grand place called Cooee, outside of Burnie. I do congratulate Burnie City Council. There is also $300,000 for the west coast, which is now part of Braddon-I am really looking forward to representing them both now and into the future-for bike tracks at the magnificent tourist centre of Strahan and also Tullah. This will, as part of the Jobs Fund, lead to more employment, traineeships, apprenticeships, particularly as the west coast is doing it hard.

Carers Week also provides an opportunity for carers to come together, support each other and share ideas and information. A survey of disability ageing and carers of 1998-some time ago-identified that there were 2.6 million carers, or 12.5 per cent of the population, and this has increased in recent years. One in five people is a primary carer, providing the majority of continuous assistance. In WA alone it was estimated, back in 2003, that there were 240,000 carers, 16 per cent of the population, 43 per cent of whom spent 40 hours or more on average each week providing care. At times, as we all know, that can be seven days a week and virtually 24 hours a day. These statistics show just how large our population of carers is, and I suspect it is just the tip of the iceberg. From a local perspective, just one person-Coleen Clifton of Australind-is the carer of her sister Susan Hopkins. Coleen has been Susan’s carer for over four years. Susan was diagnosed with schizophrenia and diabetes. She lives on her own, cannot socialise very often and is partially independent. Weekly care includes managing all financial matters, managing her disability pension, doing her shopping, ensuring she has cleaned and ironed clothing, changing her bed linen, carrying out intermittent house cleaning and making sure that Susan has meals and that she looks after her personal hygiene and medication. Coleen makes sure Susan is taken to her doctor and associated medical appointments and for outings. She takes Susan away for a short holiday, usually to the beach at Dunsborough, a great part of the world. Susan receives a much appreciated disability pension and gratefully acknowledges and appreciates the reduced rental she enjoys in her Homes West home. But Coleen also assists with the care of her 88-year-old mother so that she can also live independently. She has family and grandchildren of her own, and other duties as well. The other group I have come into close contact with recently is the Dementia Carers Group in Busselton-Lee Furnance and her group. I call these people the unsung and often unpaid heroes. Completely different to the official carers group, they often have in their homes a 24hour-a-day, seven-day-a week job and they are often unable to access respite because there are not secure environments for the dementia sufferers. I thank all the carers for their loving care and support for those who so badly need it in Australia.

His life was a life of commitment and loyalty to the party and the movement. To John they were inseparable. He was a life member of the party, an honour not bestowed lightly or carelessly by the Labor Party. He served with honour, integrity and distinction as treasurer of the Blair federal electoral council, the Ipswich West state electoral council and his own Ipswich North and Suburbs branch of the ALP.

He was the party’s long standing campaign director in Ipswich West, serving former member Don Livingstone and now member Wayne Wendt. He was the party’s campaign director in Blair in 2001 and the campaign manager in Blair in 2004 and 2007, with particular responsibility for rural areas. In the history of the Labor Party in South-East Queensland he was the best and most dedicated ALP campaigner in the western areas of Ipswich and the rural communities of the South Burnett, Somerset, the Lockyer Valley and the Scenic Rim. In his prime no-one could match him. He was simply brilliant at it. If the party had 10 John Staines in each marginal seat we would never lose an election. His boyhood on farms, particularly at Templin, his timberworking days and his long years as an ironworker enabled him to relate easily to people. He campaigned from Merrinbambi to Maroon, from Murphys Creek to Mount Alford, from Ropeley to Ripley, from Boonah to Brassall and from Karalee to Kalbar. He was persistent; he was fearless. He was relentless. He travelled thousands of kilometres during each campaign-organising, putting up signs, doorknocking and exhorting locals to support Labor at polling booths; he marshalled troops and he fed the troops-all the time in his four-wheel drive with the Labor trailer behind him, often with an ALP candidate in the front of the vehicle with him. He was happiest in the middle of a campaign. He thrived on it. He showed up in mobile offices at country shows, with his checked shirt and his old hat and his elasticised boots. He was persistent. He was philosophically honest and he kept all of us philosophically honest. To Marlene and the family we in Ipswich say thank you; we say thank you for sharing John with us. He fought the fight. He ran the race. He kept the faith. He served till the end. Thank you very much, John Staines. Ryan Electorate: Telstra resent our constituents with dedication, enthusiasm and passion, and I take the opportunity to do just that. RecentlyI attended two community meetings in the Ryan electorate. On Thursday the 8th and on Tuesday the 13th of the month I had the great pleasure of meeting many of my constituents as well as many other locals who in fact were not my constituents but constituents of the federal seat of Brisbane, represented by the Hon. Arch Bevis MP. The reason why I was there was that the local community was up in arms over the decision by Telstra to put up a mobile phone tower some 170 metres away from Rainworth State School, which is in the Ryan electorate. Those who attended the meetings who were not Ryan constituents were there because they would be affected by this tower, in their view, and because they were deeply concerned about the potential health effects of a mobile phone tower. The very legitimate grievance of the people at those meetings was that this tower may have enormous consequences for their health and indeed the health of their children. For those of us who are parents, of course, the most important thing in the world is the well-being, health and safety of our children. As the father of a three-year-old I certainly treasure the life of my son and would of course do anything and everything for him. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Constituency Statements

They came together in the spirit of goodwill and to seek knowledge both from experts and from technical specialists from Telstra. I must say I was deeply disappointed in Telstra’s behaviour at the meeting their representatives attended on 13 October. The way in which the meeting was set up was clearly so that they could defend themselves, not so they could provide substantial information to the people of Rainworth and Bardon. So in the parliament today I want to call on the federal government to consider revisiting the relevant telecommunications legislation that might mandate that mobile phone facilities be placed a certain distance away from sensitive spots such as kindergartens and schools, hospitals, aged-care facilities and retirement homes. This is in the interests of not only my constituents but also constituents around the country represented by other members of parliament. Motorcycling of the Australian motorcycle community: Shaun Lennard of the Australian Motorcycle Council and motorcycling author Greg Hirst. Shaun and Greg had been in parliament meeting with a number of members and senators from both sides of the houses. I found it personally encouraging to hear the stories of a number of members and senators who shared my passion for motorcycling. Last year we gathered together as a group to assist in raising the profile of the positive aspects of motorcycling in a bipartisan manner. I started riding motorbikes at age 13. My first bike was a Suzuki TM75 motocross bike. I graduated to a Honda TL125 trail bike, then to a YZ125 motocross bike, then to a Honda XL250 road bike and then, in recent years, back to a KX250 motocross bike, which I raced on a motocross track south of Gladstone. These days I am the proud owner of a Harley-Davidson Softail with a Fat Boy conversion kit. I have ridden motorbikes now on and off for over 30 years. It is ironic that, at the same time as many people retain outdated prejudices towards motorcycling, everyone has a brother, sister, parent, friend or work colleague who rides a motorcycle or scooter. In recent years, motorcycling in Australia has undergone massive growth in popularity, with the total number of registered motorcycles in the country now well in excess of 500,000. More than twice that number of Australians hold a motorcycle licence. More and more people are taking to motorcycling for a variety of reasons-as a leisure activity, for long-distance touring or for commuting as traffic congestion increases and to combat rising fuel prices. There have also been a growing number of female riders over the past 10 years, with over one in five learner riders being female. Those Australians who choose to commute by motorcycle or scooter are contributing in a positive way to the endeavours of all of us to protect the environment by reducing carbon emissions. As I understand it, the government has co-hosted the first Motorcycle and Scooter Safety Summit. Again, as I understand it, the Australian Motorcycle Council and the FCAI are working in close conjunction with the government’s Motorcycle Safety Consultative Committee. Governments from across all OECD countries are now recognising motorcycles as an essential and core element of the overall road transport mix.

ASIA PACIFIC NATURAL DISASTERS Consideration resumed from 19 October. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (10.02 am)-On indulgence: the Pacific Ocean is the largest body of water on earth. Its name means ‘peaceful’ or ‘making peace’. It was originally named by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who described it as a calm and peaceful ocean. Many thousands of Australians have swum in its waters and travelled to its beautiful island nations. Whilst the vast majority of visitors to the islands have come away with wonderful memories of sandy beaches and warm water, most Australians are aware of the potential for the Pacific to be a danger to human life, mostly through the cyclones that batter the Pacific coastlines. We have been warned many times over the years about the dangers of earthquakes and volcanoes along the so-called rim of fire that circles the Pacific Ocean. Those dangers usually seem distant; however, natural disasters can strike without warning and with great ferocity. In recent weeks the Pacific Ocean was anything but peaceful. Indeed, throughout South East Asia and the Pacific many thousands of people were affected by a spate of natural disasters-typhoons, tsunamis and earthquakes. The first of the disasters, Typhoon Ketsana, lashed South-East Asia on 26 and 27 September. The typhoon flooded most of the Philippine capital of Manila. The flooding was the worse for decades. People were killed; many were injured; and there was devastating damage to cities, homes and businesses, particularly agriculture. The typhoon then hit Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. It is deeply concerning to read reports that the typhoon caused more than 1,000 deaths. I extend my deepest sympathy to the people of the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who lost loved ones or were otherwise affected by this disaster. There was such significant damage to infrastructure that thousands were left homeless. The devastation has been massive. Australia as a good neighbour and friend of these countries has a role to play in helping rebuild the damaged infrastructure. The damage may well take generations to repair. We have a role in providing emergency help with food, water, shelter and other essentials for displaced people. On 29 September I extended my sympathy to the people of the Philippines as they struggled to cope with the devastating floods and welcomed the government’s announcement on that day that Australia would provide up to $1 million to support response and recovery activities in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Ketsana. I understand this assistance is to be delivered through the Philippines Red Cross and UN agencies. I am pleased that the government has also announced $2 million to feed thousands of people affected by the typhoon in the Philippines, with this assistance to be delivered through the World Food Program. I would support the provision of further emergency assistance by the MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Constituency Statements
238,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! In accordance with standing orderAustralian government if the governments of the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos issued a request for further international support. Just as the world was coming to terms with the devastation caused by the typhoon, another disaster befell the region when Samoa was hit by a tsunami. This brought back horrific memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami that hit on 26 December 2004. That was a most extraordinary disaster which had a profound effect on the whole region, with more than a quarter of a million people killed, including Australians holidaying overseas. The news of the Samoa tsunami was deeply distressing. On 30 September, I expressed our concern at the news then known that several Australian tourists had been listed as missing and that many local residents were also missing. I confirmed that the coalition would support the government in providing whatever assistance was necessary to Australians in Samoa, especially those who may have suffered injury. Of course, we now know that there was a death toll of 138, including five Australians. Sadly, nine people also lost their lives in Tonga. We supported the government announcement on 3 October of a million dollars in support for Tonga. I take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathy to the affected families and communities as they cope with the loss of loved ones and the destruction of homes and businesses. I have been to the Pacific and I have visited Samoa, and there are strong links between this Pacific nation and Australia. For example, there are 40,000 Australians of Samoan ancestry living in Australia and the Samoan community here was very active in the relief efforts. We must not forget the vulnerability of low-lying Pacific island nations to tsunamis, and the latest in Samoa is a tragic reminder of this geographic reality. Of course, Australia’s coast-loving communities are also at risk. It is for these reasons that, following the tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the Howard government announced a major initiative to establish an Australian national tsunami warning system. The system gives protection to Australia. It supported international efforts to establish an Indian Ocean warning system, and it contributed to tsunami warnings for the south-west Pacific. And there was no end to the tragedy. An earthquake occurred in Sumatra on 30 September, which was followed by another on 1 October. The coalition supports the government’s announcement on 11 October of $17 million in recovery and reconstruction assistance. Thankfully, no Australians were killed, but I offer my deepest sympathies to all those who were affected. It is such a tragedy that over a thousand people have reportedly died and that many thousands have been left homeless. The bonds of friendship between Australia and Indonesia have again proven strong in our emergency efforts. We will continue to help Indonesia over the years it will take to rebuild this shattered region of Sumatra. With Indonesia we have one of our most important bilateral relationships. It will become even more so in the coming decades. Working together as friends in times of crisis such as these will bring us closer together. Australia and Indonesia must coordinate our efforts with international relief and development agencies in order to ensure the recovery of the region from this triple tragedy. Australia is at the forefront of development aid programs in the region, with the EU being the second biggest donor. But I believe that we can enhance the quality and effectiveness of our aid and emergency relief programs to the Asia-Pacific. I consider that there is more scope for better international development cooperation and humanitarian and disaster relief. The need for this has been tragically demonstrated by the spate of natural disasters in our region in these recent weeks. Australia and the region are bound by our geography and shared interests. Close enMAIN COMMITTEE gagement with the countries of the Asia-Pacific has long been a high priority in Australian foreign policy and, with the rapid and ongoing economic development of our region, Australia is in one of the most fortunate positions in the world to proceed into this, the Asia-Pacific century. The coalition is proud of its record of cooperation and constructive development in the region. The previous Howard government took us down the path of a long-term commitment to the countries in the region, with good relations with all key regional stakeholders. We contributed to initiatives to develop the regional architecture to better address regional issues and concerns and made Australia’s voice in the region welcome and respected. Australia will continue to help our neighbours in the region who are being tragically affected by this spate of natural disasters. We are a prosperous and advanced nation surrounded by many less fortunate nations. As we have done in the past, we will help our neighbours in times of crisis and help them to develop their economies. The coalition urges the government to stand ready to offer further assistance to Samoa and other Pacific countries. Australians can feel rightly proud that they have a reputation for generosity to others who find themselves in dire straits. This has been shown once again by the overwhelming financial and other support provided for those affected by these disasters in our region. I commend all Australians involved in these worthy causes. I urge the Australian government to continue to uphold Australia’s long standing reputation in the region as a responsible and generous neighbour. Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.09 am)-On indulgence: I would like to put on the permanent Hansard record a message of condolence for the tragic loss of life in Samoa last month. While Australians were stunned to hear the news of the devastation caused in the wake of the tsunami, the effects in the Ballarat electorate were direct and immediate. Vivien Hodgins, 55, a mother of two, was staying in Taufua, in the heavily hit area of Lalomanu, when the tsunami hit. She was holidaying with a friend, Claire Rowlands, also from Ballarat. Vivien’s death has had a deep reverberation across our community. ThoseI have spoken to in recent weeks, and in attending her memorial service last week, have described her as a loving mother and wife and an absolutely joyous teacher. I am sure there are many in this House who were inspired into public service due to the input and energy of a teacher. For many of us, our dreams and ambitions began when we were lucky enough to have a teacher who believed in us, who pushed and prodded us to the next plateau and who, in one apt description I read, poked us with a sharp stick called the truth. For 33 years, Vivien Hodgins was a deeply involved teacher at Mount Clear College. She possessed patience, enthusiasm and love. She touched the lives of thousands of students who passed through her classroom. Viv was a bridge builder. She possessed unlimited endurance. She treated everyone like a friend. She was inclusive; she was inspired. She maintained contact with her students for years after they had left school. In short, she loved teaching and she loved those whom she taught. She was what is called in teaching circles a natural. Vivien Hodgins was also a great traveller. She had a passion for fairness and justice. She sought out places that were exotic and hard to get to, where the local people were in struggle. She and her husband, Rod, visited Guatemala in 1983, where Indians and schoolteachers were being murdered by the military. They travelled to South Africa, where she touched first hand the injustices of apartheid. At home she was passionate, involved and fun, conveying and MAIN COMMITTEE sharing her appreciation and enthusiasm for the area’s natural beauty as well as for local galleries and markets. She was a film fanatic, a mother and both a teacher and a student of life. Her sudden and tragic loss has left a black shadow across her family, her school and our community. I want to send my deepest condolences to Vivian’s family-to Rod and their daughters, Stephanie and Carla. They have asked me if I can put the following message to their mother on the permanent Hansard record: Vivien was full of love for people and the world. She was without ego and without a shred of malice. Her life was a life of service-to her family and her students. She travelled the world and saw beauty and terror. She was deeply sensitive to both and lived her life in full awareness of its splendour and its fragility. She was taken by nature, a nature that she communed with at every level. She will be deeply and widely missed, but we, her family, believe she will live on in the memories of the many who loved her and were touched by her generosity of spirit. Her legacy is one she would have never suspected, and only after her tragic death have we fully appreciated the extent of her grace and compassion. May this woman be a model for us all who briefly walk in this wonderful world. Rod, Steph and Carla. I know the small central Victorian rural community of Blampied will also be mourning and rallying to offer solace and comfort to the family. In the spirit of Viv, the family emerge from their grief to encourage us all to support Samoan communities as they rebuild. They have announced the formation of the Vivien Hodgins Samoan Appeal, and I encourage people in my electorate and beyond to donate to that appeal. Vivien was on holidays in the Pacific with another Ballarat teacher, Claire Rowlands. Claire is still recovering from her injuries, and I want to wish her a speedy recovery. I know she is a tough, brave woman, but I really want to encourage her to take care of herself and to let people take care of her. Finally, our hearts also go out to Ballarat’s Lili Aiesi. The tiny village she grew up in, Lalomanu, no longer exists. The tsunami took the lives of her sister and 10 of her cousins. Six of them were children aged between two and 14. This year has been one marked by natural calamity: floods in the Philippines, earthquakes in Indonesia, typhoons off Vietnam, fires in Queensland and Victoria and of course the South Pacific tsunami. At these times we are all tested. Whether catastrophe happens in a far-off place or on our own doorstep, we are confronted with our own humanity, its strength and its fragility. The ties that bind us as a community, country or region become more apparent and possibly more relevant in the face of devastation and death. Long after the event, long after the headlines and the attention have moved on, families and friends continue to grieve. I also take this opportunity to comment on Australia’s response to those recent regional events. In times of crisis we stand in solidarity with our neighbours. We acted quickly with aid, assistance and on-the-ground support in both Indonesia and the South Pacific. We worked around the clock not only to identify and help Australians but to supply help where it was needed. We did everything we could to support the rescue efforts in both Indonesia and Samoa. We stand ready as a country to act quickly and assist as future events dictate. cently in both Samoa and Sumatra there have been some great tragedy and natural disaster. MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Constituency Statements
239,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (10.15 Am),"On indulgence: I rise to speak on this matter. ReYet this is certainly not something new in these regions. We know particularly over recent years of earthquakes around the ring of fire in the Indian Ocean and also there have been undersea earthquakes around the Pacific ring of fire. These have, for recorded history, inflicted pain and suffering on the peoples that live in those areas-no more so than back on 26 December 2004, when close to 230,000 people around the Indian Ocean lost their lives following an earthquake and then a tsunami that devastated a number of countries in that region. It was only at the end of September that this most recent tragedy took place. I would begin by talking a little bit about Samoa and what has been called the Samoan earthquake but has wreaked havoc not only on the Samoan nation but also on American Samoa and, to a degree, on Tonga. Following an 8.0 magnitude undersea quake it has been reported by various sources that as many as 143 people lost their lives in Samoa, and 143 is a significant amount of people. There is no doubt about that, particularly when you hear that there were villages wiped out and families very badly affected. Then when you consider that the island of Samoa has a population of only 179,000, to have lost 143 in one event is a major tragedy that will no doubt be remembered for the history of that nation. In American Samoa they had 32 confirmed dead out of a very small population of 65,000, and on one of the islands of Tonga nine people out of population of 104,000 were lost. These are very small nations but they have suffered greatly. Beyond the deaths we certainly know that the damage to infrastructure and homes has been absolutely devastating. I know, as other speakers have and will, we applaud the efforts of those involved with reconstruction and alleviating the suffering of people, the survivors, and helping those countries get back on their feet. We appreciate that. We know that Samoa is in the Pacific Ocean and we also know that the Pacific tsunami warning system established in Hawaii has been operating effectively for many years. Apparently at the time, or shortly after the earthquake in Samoa, it was registered by the Pacific tsunami warning system that the ocean rose three inches right above the epicentre of that earthquake. That sounds so small and insignificant, but there were four tsunami waves that crashed into Samoa that were three or four metres in height. They were all from that earthquake under the surface of the sea, and the water rose only three inches. That shows the strength of nature. When the tectonic plates shift and an earthquake occurs, you had better be on your guard. The Americans and the Japanese have done so much great work in the Pacific to be able to detect and predict tsunamis. I understand that Samoa had about 10 minutes notice of what was going to happen and the waves that were going to arrive. That of course leads us to how that information is communicated to the people on the ground. It is all very well having government informed and the experts knowing that there is going to be a tsunami in 10 minutes, 20 minutes or an hour and a half, but you must have the capacity to communicate that to the people on the ground. Here in Australia we have not had a very significant history of tsunamis-certainly none that have caused major damage, as I understand. As the commercial radio, the ABC radio and television can be co-opted into giving warnings then we have, to a degree, extra protection. Communication is a real worry in places like Samoa, the Pacific Islands and the Indian Ocean. I think UNESCO has required that the transmission of information from the experts in the warning centres down to the people on the ground be a priority and be looked at. I think there is a fair distance to go on that. MAIN COMMITTEE I would also like to speak about the earthquake in Sumatra. As we know, the Sumatrans and the Indonesians have suffered mightily from the effects of earthquakes in the past. In this case I understand that some 1,300 people lost their lives. This is another warning for that nation. As their standard of living continues to increase, their building standards should be as good as they can be. The Indian Ocean rim of fire is an area of great and significant earthquake activity. On4 June 2000 an earthquake measuring 7.9 was reported. That caused 103 fatalities and 2,000 injured people. The earthquake that caused the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 measured 9.3 and caused over 200,000 lives to be lost. On 28 March 2005 the Nias earthquake measured 8.7 and caused around 1,300 lives to be lost. Throughout recorded history there have been earthquakes in the region that have caused damage and loss of life. There is no doubt that there is a great need for governments, particularly the local governments in Indonesia, to look at the transmission of information regarding the threats and to look at the building standards. I imagine that that has been advanced, but it should always be looked at. The disaster in 2004 was acted on quickly, but, unfortunately, after the event. In January 2005 I think UNESCO convened a conference to look at the need for a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean. The Australian government acted quickly and established the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre, which is operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and Geoscience Australia. That was developed so that Australia had an independent capability to monitor, detect, verify and warn the Australian community of the existence of tsunamis in our region. It was a four-year project, as I understand it, and it has resulted in basically a state-of-the-art facility enabling Australia to predict tsunamis and earthquakes and model their effects on the Australian coastline. I also understand there are some 25 detectors around the Indian Ocean which serve to make sure that the threat of a tsunami following an earthquake is identified quickly and that the countries that are most at risk are warned. Obviously, it is a shame that so many lives were lost before the region acted on this, but I would like to think that progress has been very solid since 2004 and that we are in a position now where the people in the region are so much better protected than they used to be. But I reiterate that there is a difference between detection and the transmission of that information to the people on the ground. While we can be reasonably confident about this country’s ability to make sure people are informed of the threat, the likely impact of a tsunami on the coastline of Australia, I remain concerned that countries in areas such as the Andaman Sea-India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia-are not yet in a position whereby detection is communicated to the people who are ultimately going to suffer the impact of such events. I conclude by saying that in this world we will always run the risk of natural disasters and their realisation. It was in all our interests to take the actions that were taken after 2004 to be able to identify these threats, model their effects and take preventative action to minimise the consequences of these disasters. To those who are helping out in the most recently affected nations, including Samoa and Indonesia, whether they are locals or from other nations, I add my thanks and appreciation for the work they are doing to alleviate the suffering in those places. today to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing my conMAIN COMMITTEE",195,Constituency Statements
240,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (10.28 Am),"On indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker: I risedolences to those who have been affected by the recent events in our region. This has been a dramatic time in our region, with the tsunami that affected Samoa and Tonga, the earthquake in Sumatra and the typhoon that devastated parts of the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. We have seen a fairly concentrated period of quite high activity of this type. There are several thousand Samoans and Tongans who reside in my electorate of Longman. They are greatly valued and appreciated for what their presence adds to the community. I believe that the only Samoan architecturally designed building outside of Samoa, the Maota Fono, is at Deception Bay. The Maota Fono building has been a focal point of the Samoan expatriate community and for Australians of Samoan descent in South-East Queensland for some time now. Indeed, recently they hosted a reception for the Samoan rugby team as part of its World Cup campaign. Because of that concentration of residents in my electorate, I want to concentrate my contribution this morning on the Pacific tsunami. At 6.48 am local time on 29 September-which was 4.48 am here on 30 September-an earthquake measuring around 8.3 on the Richter scale was felt 190 kilometres south-west of Samoa and American Samoa. That is an awful time of the morning for a disaster to strike. Most people, I suspect even in Samoa, would be simply rising at that time, weary from sleep. Your eyes would still be laden with sleep and you would be wondering more about what is for breakfast than what is likely to be approaching from the ocean. The earthquake unleashed what we now know were devastating tsunami waves. The destruction was almost total in many areas of Samoa and American Samoa. There is an interesting piece of video available on the web, taken by CCTV cameras in the parking lot of the FBI offices in American Samoa. It shows the power of even the small wave that came through that parking lot. The footage shows a couple of people crossing the parking lot and then another gentleman leaving the building to go to his car and standing transfixed for a good number of seconds as he sees the wave approaching, before turning and running in the opposite direction shortly before the wave comes through and tosses heavy motor vehicles around as if they were plastic bath toys. There is certainly a great deal to be frightened of in the power of a tsunami wave. The consequential loss of life has been quite severe: 140 people or more in Samoa, more than 30 in American Samoa and another nine or so in Tonga. Tonga is some 1,000 kilometres away from Samoa. Five Queensland medical students were in Samoa at the time of the tsunami. Having been aware of its approach and having run to higher ground, they then returned to the hospital to work, helping people who were injured by the tsunami. They reported early on that it was a very difficult situation for those who had been injured. Their view was that many would succumb to their injuries and that there would be a great loss of limbs as a consequence of the injuries that people had received. Many families from Longman have lost family members. The effects of the tsunami are deeply felt amongst the aiga, or the extended family, of our Samoan community. The Samoan community is strengthened and comforted by its very strong Christian faith. The Sunday before last, I was delighted to attend with them a memorial service at the Holy Cross Catholic Church at Rothwell. They had also invited local people from the Philippines, Indonesia and other South-East Asian nations to join them. There was a very moving service, followed by, in the Samoan tradition, a fine lunch. I was not able to stay at that for terribly long because of other events that were occurring in my electorate on that day, but it was a great pleasure and a MAIN COMMITTEE great honour for me to be with them and to participate in that memorial service. On Saturday just gone, I also attended a fundraiser put on by local Pacific islanders to raise money for the tsunami victims. That event was able to raise in excess of $2,000 in a very short period of time. I am aware that in our local community there are other events coming up. Australia’s responses to all the events-whether the typhoon, the earthquake or the tsunami-have been swift and I know it was very much appreciated by the former citizens of those countries now living in Australia. In relation to Samoa and Tonga, for Samoa there was an initial contribution pledged of $2 million, with a further $5 million pledged later on. We had expert people on the ground within 24 hours. In Tonga we have pledged $1 million. I know, as I said, that the members of those communities here in Australia greatly appreciate the effort by the Australian government. In my role as the secretary of the Pacific Islands friendship group in parliament, we met recently with heads of Pacific missions who had been recalled to Canberra for briefings. I met them here in parliament and we discussed issues in their various territories. Universally, they indicated to us that, from Australia, of greatest importance to these small Pacific nations were the remittances that went back to those countries from former nationals who are now living and working-or indeed, retired-here in Australia. Samoa and Tonga are going to undergo a lengthy process of rebuilding. I indicate here today that it is my intention to write to the Prime Minister with a suggestion as to how we may do something that will cost us nothing and yet be of great assistance to those countries as they proceed in that rebuilding process-that is, to waive the 13-week rule on the payment of pensions for former citizens or former nationals of those countries who wish to return there to assist their families and their communities in the rebuilding process. That would mean, for example, that aged pensioners who have not been in Australia for the 300 months that are required to be able to take their pension overseas would be able to go without having to come back to Australia within three months. Those on pensions that are restricted, such as the disability support pension, to only 13 weeks outside the country would be allowed to stay indefinitely whilst engaged in this process of rebuilding. Australia is a generous nation. We saw that recently with the bushfire appeal for Victoria, where not only Australians but people throughout the world came to our aid. I am hoping that we will be able to show the world how much we appreciated that by coming to the aid of those in the Pacific in a large way. To do that, there are a number of processes. The member for Ballarat spoke of an appeal that is being formed in the name of a Ballarat resident who unfortunately lost her life. We are aware that there is a Red Cross appeal. The Samoan government also has established two bank accounts with the ANZ bank of Samoa, to which people can donate directly to the government and to the relief and rehabilitation appeals. I would like to read those account details into the record today. The first is the TreasuryDirect transfer account, which has account number 1200033 and bank SWIFT code ANZBWSWW. The bank’s address is ANZ Samoa Ltd at Apia, Samoa. The second account is called the 2009 Samoa Tsunami Relief and Rehabilitation account. Its account number is 3826921, its bank If the Australian people were to be able to make direct deposits to either of those accounts, if they felt that they would prefer to do that than to contribute to the Red Cross or to other local appeals, I would urge them to do so. As I said, this is a generous nation. We have received generosity from others during past events in this country-the recent past, as it turns MAIN COMMITTEE out. I believe it would be really telling for us, not just as a government but as individuals, to reciprocate to others in our region who are feeling rather set upon at the moment. Again, I wish to express my condolences to all who have lost people who are dear to them in these events, whether they be locals in any of the areas where these events have taken place or Australians who have been caught up in those events, notably the five in Samoa. Longman, which carry weight because he has worked in and given support to the Pacific Islands. I acknowledge that. In looking at the tragedies which occurred on 30 September in Samoa and Tonga through the tsunami and, within 24 hours of those events, in Sumatra through the earthquake centred around Padang, I want to begin in my home state of Victoria. Earlier this year Victoria suffered a natural disaster in the form of bushfires. The number of souls lost was very similar to the number who perished in the Samoan and Tongan tragedy. From our community to their community we say, with every good sense and intention, that we truly understand that which you have lost. You have lost your mothers and fathers, you have lost brothers and sisters. Most sadly of all, you have lost your sons and your daughters. There is no good answer. There is only support. That support takes two forms. First, it takes the immediate form of human compassion. That is appreciated and delivered with heartfelt intent, but it is no substitute for the second form of support, which is the grand Australian tradition of lending a hand to those in need. Successive governments from either side of the House, from either political philosophy, have lent their support. I know: I was in this parliament and I was very engaged as the parliamentary secretary when the Solomon Islands suffered their tsunami. I saw what happened there and the way in which we were able to deploy, at rapid speed, assistance from those within the RAMSI mission and assistance brought from Australia in the form of Hercules with people and material to assist with health, hygiene, accommodation, food and all the basic needs. That same sort of support has been delivered by the current government and I unequivocally lend my support and give my congratulations and thanks for the work that has been done on Australia’s behalf. What has occurred in Samoa and Tonga has been a great human and physical tragedy, and it will take many years to rebuild. The lives, however, cannot be rebuilt. For those who remain we will simply have to be there to lend our support. We do so as friends, as neighbours and as fellow human beings who are always mindful of John Donne’s imprecation: No man is an island, entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for the. The message is that we are all of one common humanity. MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Constituency Statements
241,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.40 Am),"I begin by acknowledging the words of the member forThe same applies, of course, in Indonesia-Sumatra, Padang in particular. Australians know only too well the tragedy of the tsunami of Boxing Day 2004. We know of the extraordinary human devastation and that this country responded through its government and through the unbelievable generosity of its people with direct, immediate and indispensable aid. That aid, whether it was in the form of helicopters, ships, personnel, drinking water or any form of medical assistance or immediate sustenance, was vital in the early days. But it translated into a multi-year commitment which was begun by one government and which is being continued by another. Sadly, in Pedang, where over 1,100 lives have been lost, we have now had to pursue the same course of action. The difference this time is that the numbers are far fewer, but the human tragedy for those involved is no less. So we offer again our support-firstly, as human beings and, secondly, as neighbours who are equipped through historic circumstances to provide real human and material support. We lend our best wishes, our compassion and our most profound human emotions to those who have been lost and to those who remain in Tonga, in Samoa and in particular in Indonesia, which in Sumatra and Pedang at the epicentre have seen the most tragic of consequences. I thank the government for their work. We lend them our complete bipartisan support, and we as a nation will do all that we can to assist the survivors in Indonesia as well as in Tonga and Samoa. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (10.46 am)-I certainly echo the sentiments expressed by the other speakers on this motion, including the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, most recently, the member for Flinders and the member for Longman in their words and thoughts for the families and the many individuals affected not just in Samoa and Sumatra but here in Australia. I, like many members in this House, have a strong Samoan and Tongan community, particularly situated on the Redcliffe peninsula. As such a strong multicultural community, it came as no surprise when this community stepped up and supported each other through this difficult time. The member for Flinders took us back to the Boxing Day tsunami, and I do not know of anyone who would not be able to recall exactly where they were when they heard the news of the Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia, and particularly devastated areas such as Phuket. I do not think that we will look at situations like that ever again without absolute fear for the people who would be involved. Australia is used to its disasters. It does not make it any easier, but we have seen our fair share of disasters, and we will continue to see our fair share of disasters through cyclones and fires. However, we have not really experienced a disaster such as a tsunami. We have not really understood the horrific impact that such a disaster could have. For it to happen so close to our shores really brought home to the Australian community the risks involved for small islands and coastal areas. We are all vulnerable in our coastal areas to such occurrences. When the news broke that Samoa had had an earthquake off its shores and consequently a tsunami had hit Samoa, we all braced ourselves for the outcome of that disaster. It has certainly touched many lives in my local community. My local community stepped up very quickly. Our local radio stations 99.7FM and Radio Pacifica held a radiothon on Saturday, 10 October of six hours-from 6 pm to midnight-and they raised approximately $6,000 just in that one night. They also had 15 volunteers staffing the phones and they ran a sausage sizzle. They were not just raising money and collecting goods; they were there to support the SaMAIN COMMITTEE moan and Tongan community which came together to support each other at that difficult time. One gentleman turned up to the radio station not wanting to be identified and delivered a $1,000 cheque. There was such goodwill across the community that those donations just kept coming. As I walked in to make a donation that evening, there were bags and bags in the doorway of toys, clothes and blankets. People are still able to donate to that appeal through the radio station. They can call 32845000 to donate if they are local. Obviously if they are interstate it is (07)32845000. There was also a remembrance service held for the victims of the tsunami, which the member for Longman spoke about. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend due to other commitments, but certainly my thoughts were with them on the day. That service was held on Sunday, 11 October. There were representatives from all levels of government and people from not just our Samoan and Tongan communities but also our Indigenous communities and our Filipino communities. We are a strong multicultural community and we came together on that occasion. I wanted to specifically acknowledge both Theresa Butler, who was the organiser of the remembrance service, and Tavita Timaloa, who organised the radiothon. Mr Timaloa did not just organise this appeal; he was personally affected. At the time of the radiothon, Mr Timaloa was one of many Brisbane residents who had lost family members, with some still missing. On his mother’s side, unfortunately, three passed away. The good news is that the majority of them made it out alive. His own words were that it was tragic and they were trying to chase them down. They had a cousin go to the morgue because they could not get there. He saw the names on the board and quickly rang the rest of the family to tell them the news. So Mr Timaloa has also been personally affected, as have many, many people not just in my community but across the country. I want to acknowledge the Redcliffe Kippa-Ring Lions Club, who hold markets every Sunday and choose a charity each Sunday to donate their money to. They donated all of their takings for the following two Sundays and raised over $1,000 for the tsunami appeal. I congratulate them on their efforts. I have talked much about Samoa because of the large community I have in my local area, but I also want to talk about the Tongan community. Koliana Winchester, who works at the local radio station and is herself Tongan, is a strong community worker, and I want to acknowledge her great work. My husband is part Tongan and my mother-in-law is Tongan, so we were certainly concerned about the news that Tonga had been affected, and there were not a lot of reports coming out of Tonga. What we have since found out is that over a thousand people were stranded in the northernmost island of the Kingdom of Tonga, nine people were killed and five critically ill people, including a four-year-old, were transported to the hospitals. So the Tongan community was certainly affected as well, and my thoughts go out to the whole Tongan community-as well as all those affected in Sumatra by the devastating earthquake that occurred around the same time. Thousands of lives have been affected. It is a devastating situation, one that will take many, many months if not years to recover from and to rebuild from. Our communities in Victoria and in Queensland, after their fires and floods, know just how long it takes to recover from these disasters. I am pleased that the federal government has stepped in quickly, as have state governments, to provide support. I know that not only did Queensland have an appeal but also state govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment rescue workers travelled to Sumatra and Samoa to help in the rescue efforts. As a number of members have said, the federal government set up the Australian government disaster recovery payment and funeral assistance payment for Australian victims and their families. There is also the one-off payment of $5,000 available to family members, as well as other crisis intervention and personal support. I also want to acknowledge the wonderful work of aid organisations around the world that always step up, going into these areas immediately to provide support. One such very well known and respected aid organisation, World Vision, has already provided 6,000 family kits consisting of tarpaulins and sleeping mats, sarongs and personal hygiene items. World Vision have distributed more than 750 packages for children under five, consisting of powder, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, blankets and 4,000 collapsible water containers. They are setting up free, child-friendly spaces for over 400 children. World Vision continues to plan a further 10,000 family kits, 5,000 children’s kits and much more. I cannot end without commenting on the fact that so many children have been left as orphans as a consequence of these disasters. That makes our response even more significant in how we are going to assist these young people. We know that these communities bind together and support each other when children are affected in this way. Globally we have a responsibility to do what we can to support all of the children who have been left as orphans as a consequence of the earthquake in Sumatra and by what has occurred in Samoa and Tonga and the outer region. the Leader of the Opposition for their statements to the House. Natural disasters occur in many parts of the world, but more particularly in the Asian zone relating to earthquake activity, and tsunamis are an outcome of that. For many years, more particularly during the Howard government-although upon the election of the Rudd government, I corresponded with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in similar manner-I have questioned the fact that our response is typically, with the exception of some private donations, ‘Send the money.’ While it might be argued by some worldwide funds to be the best way to deliver assistance, I am not convinced about that. Furthermore, I think Australia misses a great opportunity to do better and to promote items of construction-for instance, water purification units. Even though it is an emergency, I think we should not ignore the opportunity to bring to the attention of the world Australian products which would be of great assistance in these circumstances and have a long-term benefit. I have corresponded with many within Western Australia particularly. I assume in other parts of Australia there are simple manufacturing techniques that produce robust plastic shelter tunnels-the type of plastic you see on the sides of trucks. They were designed originally for livestock and are commonly used at agricultural shows and things of that nature as shelter for humans. They could be lived in for a long period by humans and made very comfortable for that purpose. They can be erected in less than an hour to accommodate 100 people. More particularly, if there is an aftershock in an earthquake zone, they will not fall down. At the time of the North Pakistan earthquakes I had phone conversations with the ambassador, who was extremely interested in my argument that we should-as we could do-get a couple of Hercules transporters and take a stack of this stuff up there. They are simply just 50millimetre pipes, curved and they can be slotted-you do not have to carry them as a full MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Swift Code Is Anzbwsww And The Bank Obviously Is Anz Samoa Ltd Apia In Samoa
242,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (10.56 Pm),"I commend the Prime Minister and, I might add,curve. When they are assembled the plastic is then sheeted over them and ratcheted down in the same way that you would on the side of a truck. They are very tight, very strong, very weatherproof, and they can be prepared in many different fashions. They can be as long as you wish and quite wide, certainly as wide as the room in which we now stand. They can be made big enough to put large harvesting equipment in, if you wanted one that big. In my discussion with the Pakistani ambassador I asked him about the sizes of houses that people reside in in that area and he mentioned that they were quite large houses for what appeared to be people of low economic ability. I asked why they were that big, and he said that in the winter the people have to put all the animals inside too. Suddenly it occurred to me that these buildings, if they were put up as temporary accommodation for people, would double very adequately for their original purpose here in Australia, which is the protection of livestock. Maybe someone over there, after all the tragedy, would say, ‘What a good idea these things are. Where do I buy them?’ In Popanyinning in my electorate-getting down south towards Albany-there is a group called Bird’s company that have been making these things expertly for years. There is another group in Kondinin that make them for the agricultural sector and which was very interested in gearing up to supply them. My view in the first instance was that we erect one on the front lawn of our embassy in Pakistan for others to view. ThenI ran into the brick wall called the Public Service. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, gave me a name to ring up, and this fellow came round to see me and said, ‘No, we just send money.’ Why do we do that? That was in the Howard era. Stephen Smith could not give me a more responsive answer when I took the matter up with him. That is not a criticism of him-I know I failed. The whole fact of life is that here is a practical form of protection, easily transported. It has no volumetric problem and could be airfreighted into these areas. They should be flying into Sumatra as we speak. And there is a roadblock in Canberra that says, ‘No, you don’t do those sorts of things.’ Yet the Pakistani ambassador at the time was delighted at the prospect and would have welcomed them. That is just one example. Let me go a step further. One of the biggest problems in Aceh after the tsunami was drinking water. The Australian government eventually packed up what I imagine was a very large piece of equipment, utilised by the Australian Defence Forces to purify water and fluid up there. In a town called Katanning is a manufacturing company that could have provided all that equipment on the back of a car trailer. They are called AQ2 and their whole industry is built around a worldwide patent of a very small, extremely accurate measuring pump, all of which is manufactured out of solid PVC. I am proud to say that under the now defunct Regional Partnerships system-which I introduced and which was later criticised by the Labor Party-funding was made available to small business in regional areas on the principle that if your small business is prosperous, you will always find paint for the scout hall and you will always find paint for a school hall. Making small business prosperous in small country towns is a positive initiative, and in this case the Australian government contributed to them buying some machine tools-to which their local investors made the major contribution-that allowed them to speed up their manufacturing process. That is, of course, done to very precise measurements. The machine that they make meters to the water supply a very small but measured amount of sodium hypochlorite, a liquid disinfectant. More particularly, to give you some idea of the size of this equipMAIN COMMITTEE ment, you can put two 20-litre square plastic containers of that product on top and they virtually take up the full area of the top of this piece of equipment. That is how small it is. It is fully computerised. They are marketing these units to Australian water supply authorities for remote communities. They are in Katanning, some 250 kilometres south of Perth, and they are controlling one of these units east of Derby in an Aboriginal community. When the sodium hypochlorite in one bottle runs out, they chuck one on the local overnight transport and the bloke-the driver-pulls up alongside the unit, pulls off the empty one, puts the new one on, screws the cap on and it is going again. If in the circumstances of Aceh we had had problems of the water going saline and if there had been other contaminants, you could have added to that equipment a typical household sand swimming pool filter and some of the smaller reverse osmosis desalinators. These people could have put that package together, with a two-inch firefighting pump if necessary. They could have been supplied and flowing up there in numbers and people in many locations could have got clean, fresh and sterilised water. Someone in the aid organisations might have seen those and said, ‘What a great thing they’d be in Africa.’ Who said no? It was the Australian bureaucracy here in Canberra. They said, ‘Just send money.’ I find this very annoying. I am giving examples of two items, of which there are many. The technology in building frame houses has existed in Australia for years. I cry every time. I see the media coverage, the TV coverage, of the places that have fallen down in these earthquakes. You may as well put a sign on-and I should not laugh, because it is too serious. The reality is that these buildings are designed to collapse and, unfortunately, fall on top of people. If those buildings, particularly residences, had been framed-and that can be done in a multistorey context-they might have cracked and they might have rattled, but they would not have killed people. It is technology: steel frames, BlueScope Steel. We know all about that, and we do not go up there and build houses like that for them. We did not build any in Aceh, admittedly. At the back of Aceh are thousands of square kilometres of forest. Presumably wood framing gives you a similar design, and I think the little houses they replaced there were probably of that nature. But they are not so much an earthquake spot. The whole fact of life is that we should be out there saying to these people, ‘Here is the solution for your problem so that this doesn’t happen again.’ I have always been a great advocate for better community design. I am a bit of a frustrated builder. I have built horse stables and all sorts of things out of tilt-up concrete. It is common. Virtually every commercial building today is made that way. Yet we do not go out and teach Aboriginal people how they can make them in their communities from local materials, with the exception of a bit of reinforcing and a bit of cement. We could erect them with limited amounts of machinery. A reasonably sized tractor with a three-point linkage that you can put a cement mixer on and a front-end loader could build that sort of construction. It is very robust but it can also be designed to be much more resistant to an earthquake. You do not, typically, use that method for floors, although I know we do in some of our buildings. On Christmas Island, as minister, I was responsible for the construction of the staff accommodation building. Three-storey prefabricated concrete walls were designed and manufactured in Perth. They were then put on the ship that goes to Christmas Island; they were lifted out, stood up and a building was put up between them. I am not saying that is the perMAIN COMMITTEE fect response to an earthquake, but we have all this building technology that we never export during these crises. I welcome the government’s financial commitment. Both sides of government cannot get into the newspapers quickly enough-‘We’ve sent 10 million’ or ‘We’ve sent 20 million’. Sometimes we do not know where it actually goes, and there has been public criticism of that. Why are we not loading up these new strata cruisers-or whatever they named the bigger ones that Brendan Nelson brought-with products of Australia, even food, as part if not all of our contribution? AndI have named only two pieces of equipment. There are photographs of Pakistan showing these funny little tents in which they were housing hundreds of people. They could not have been very comfortable or safe and yet we had better technology that we never sent there. I just cannot understand that. I took this opportunity today to specifically make this point: as a parliament, why do we not start talking about what Australia could do for these people with real items. It would create work here and, what is more, demonstrate technology which-in the case of the sterilising pump-is unique to the world. Nobody else has anything as good or as small as this. These sorts of things are very suitable for small communities and, more particularly, are an appropriate response to the disasters to which the statements referred. I trust some of my colleagues in government might want to raise that issue in the party room. that have hit some of our closest neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region over the past month. I would first like to thank the Prime Minister for bringing the parliament’s attention to the impact of these disasters on literally millions of people across the region. Since the end of September we have seen major calamities strike Samoa, Tonga, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, with thousands dead and millions more left to rebuild their lives in the aftermath. It has been a difficult time for all the communities affected in those countries and equally traumatic for those people who are now residents and citizens of Australia but who have had to watch these disasters unfold from afar-uncertain of the fate of their loved ones caught up in the strife. Each of these natural disasters-the earthquakes and tsunamis in Samoa and Tonga, the earthquake in Indonesia and the typhoons that struck the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos-have exacted a devastating toll on human life and property. It is crucial that Australia continues to demonstrate leadership and uphold its leadership responsibilities in the region by providing the support and assistance needed to help these communities overcome the effects of these disasters. Without diminishing the seriousness of each one of these calamities I would like to take this opportunity to speak in particular about the events in Tonga and Samoa, and the typhoons Ketsana and Palma which struck the Philippines within a week of each other. I have quite a sizeable population in my electorate who come from the Pacific Islands. In fact, just days after these disasters struck Tonga and Samoa, I had the opportunity to visit the Oxley Park Public School, in my electorate, for their South Pacific Expo. This was a tremendous example of some of the outstanding talents of the young people within my electorate. Oxley Park Public School is an outstanding local school under the leadership of its Principal, Mrs Karen Maraga. The school had on display a presentation that was put together by a number of the students but, in particular, a number of students from Pacific island communities. It MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Swift Code Is Anzbwsww And The Bank Obviously Is Anz Samoa Ltd Apia In Samoa
243,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (11.13 Am),"I rise to take note of some of the natural disasterswas hard not to be moved by the singing of ‘I am, you are, we are Australians’ by what was a very multicultural group of students. I know that many of the students and some of the families who gathered to participate on that occasion had been affected by these disasters in Samoa and Tonga. I wish to acknowledge those families and the impact that these disasters have had. I would also like to turn my attention to the situation affecting our good friends in the Philippines. As members would know, on 26 September, at the beginning of the fortnight of disasters in the Asia-Pacific region, Typhoon Ketsana smashed into the Philippines, hitting major population centres in the Luzon region, including the capital, Manila. Typhoons, intense storms with gusts and rain for hours on end, have been responsible for ripping off roofs, overturning cars and causing landslides and flash flooding. Ketsana dumped an entire month of monsoon season rain, almost 600 millimetres, on the Luzon region in just six hours. That is almost the equivalent of the entire year’s average rainfall in my electorate of Lindsay. The consequences of this downpour created the worse flooding in more than 40 years in Manila. Hundreds of people were stranded on rooftops and walls, scrambling to make it to high ground before the water engulfed their homes. It is estimated that three million homes were affected across Manila and the wider Luzon region. In the immediate aftermath, Ketsana took the lives of more than 100 people and, as the days rolled on, that toll climbed substantially as communities counted the loss of those washed away in floodwaters or landslides and missing loved ones who just did not return. As the people of the Philippines reeled from the savage impact of Ketsana, which later moved on to wreak havoc and destruction on Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, another typhoon rolled in eight days after the first. Typhoon Parma struck the northern Philippines with another ferocious day of rain and winds that caused more widespread flooding and soaked an already storm weary Manila for a second time. Dozens of houses were buried in mud and rock as hillsides gave way under the weight of floodwaters, and many more hundreds of people lost their lives. According to the latest reports from the Philippines National Disaster Coordinating Council, a total of 8.4 million people were affected by typhoons Ketsana and Parma and more than 850 people died. This is a massive loss of life, on a scale even larger than our own Victorian bushfires, one of Australia’s worse recent natural disasters, which claimed more than 170 lives. While there is now a massive relief effort underway, those same communities are bracing for a third typhoon as we speak-that is, Typhoon Lupit. Its gusts reach more than 200 kilometres per hour and it is poised to make landfall tomorrow, but its outer rings of wind and rain are already lashing the northern region of Luzon. The Philippines authorities, the United Nations and the Red Cross are all making preparations for this next onslaught, preparing people for evacuation and readying food and water supplies. I know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone in this parliament are with the people of the Philippines as they not only try to get back on their feet but prepare to fend off another threat of nature. In the areas where there is still calm the biggest threat comes from disease. As water becomes stagnant, malaria, dengue fever and diarrhoea start to spread, and already more than 100 people have died from leptospirosis. The Rudd government through AusAID has provided $3 million in food aid, clothes, sanitation services, health care and other basic items that will help thousands of people survive the coming days and weeks. I would like to acknowlMAIN COMMITTEE edge the swift responses of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance in committing Australia to the relief effort. I would also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of the Western Sydney Filipino-Australian community who are organising a charity concert on Sunday, 1 November at Bowman Hall in Blacktown. A group of entertainers has donated their time and talents to help stage a concert to raise funds for the relief effort in the Philippines and this is being supported by all the major Western Sydney Filipino-Australian groups. In particular I acknowledge those groups within my local community that have given voice to the situation faced by those in the Philippines and I take this opportunity to express my personal condolences to those residents within my community who have been affected through the impacts of these devastating typhoons on their family members back in the Philippines. This last month has demonstrated how vulnerable we all are to the ferocity of nature. But it has been a testament to the cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific region that governments, NGOs and grassroots community organisations have all rushed to lend a hand to those affected. To the people of Samoa, Tonga, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, you have all faced a horrible month of tragedy and disaster, but you are constantly in our thoughts and I know that we are all offering our strength and support in this time of great need. Torres Straits. There is great potential in this area for fish farming and crustacean farming, which lend themselves very much to development. In the Torres Strait Islands they have rock walls going out into the ocean, which are fish traps. At high tide the fish can get in; at low tide the water rushes out and they cannot get out and the people can go round in the morning and pick up their food for the day. It gives me no joy to relate to the Houses that whilst we are here-and quite rightly so-to mourn, and to pledge our support for our northern neighbours, the tragic reality is that we are very good at crying about others but not about looking after our own. A few of us went on the Closing the Gap trip to the Torres Straits. I was quite staggered actually when I went out there at what I found-and this is our little part of the South Pacific Islands that we are responsible for and this is how we are looking after them. When I was up there the last time, in 1990and 1990 was last year, I think, I was minister-I would say that 90 per cent of the food I ate was locally grown. It was seafood that had been caught, and taro and yam and other vegetables that were locally grown. This time when I was up there I cannot remember having a single piece of food that was grown on the islands. AQIS, the quarantine service, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and Queensland, had effectively stopped those people from having a source of food. The net result of this-and we were the Closing the Gap committee inquiry-is that there is a 50 per cent higher rate of diabetes and heart problems among the Islanders there than for average Australians and, as we all well know, those things are very much diet-related. The people of the Torres Strait have no way of earning any money anymore because their crayfishing and other fishing operations have been stopped. Their chooks and pigs have been taken away from them by the quarantine service. The people say that even their farming has been taken away from them. We are still investigating whether that is true or not, but that is MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Swift Code Is Anzbwsww And The Bank Obviously Is Anz Samoa Ltd Apia In Samoa
244,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (11.21 Am),"For many years of my life I was responsible for thewhat they told us. When we went into the supermarket, we saw that four to seven per cent of the entire shelf space was filled with rice. This is a drivingly poor Third World country, where the death rate is 50 per cent higher than in the rest of Australia. Why? Because of the actions of this place. People are dying up there at a 50 per cent higher rate than anywhere else because of the actions of this place. And do you think anyone cares, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer? With all due respect to the chairman of the Close the Gap committee, to my knowledge the committee has still not put out a report. I am not cognisant of any report having been put out. So whilst it is very good for us to be supportive and sympathetic towards the plight of our northern neighbours, we have a responsibility to the Pacific islanders, and that responsibility is being discharged in such a way that there will be shame on this place and, unfortunately, on my nation for the historical future. The gulf cattlemen live pretty sparsely; they live pretty hard. They do not have many of life’s good things. They live hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town. My station property was 230 kilometres from the nearest town, and that was the little town of Croydon, with 200 people. So we were right out in the middle of nowhere. Many of the people who were caught in the floods this year were in an even worse situation than we were distance wise. For the last 50 or 60 years, the fifth or sixth biggest export item of this country has consistently been beef. We have the growing area for the beef industry. If you wipe out the breeding herd in the gulf then all Australia will suffer. When the floods hit, it was communicated to state and federal governments. There was a request for fodder drops for the cattle. No fodder drops took place. No government even bothered to reply to the people. They did not come back to them and say, ‘We’re not doing it.’ They did not even bother to do that. So these people watched in horror as their cattle were washed away into the gulf and drowned. We hear a lot of people criticise their own. There is a name for these people: traitors. I will shortly be fixing up a few of them when I get up to Normanton and Karumba. These people said that we were crying wolf. The web and all the newspapers in Australia showed pictures of the hundreds and thousands of cattle that had died and the wildlife that had died in the great floods at the start of this year. It was the furies of February for Australia. Whilst the southern part of Australia was on fire, the northern part was under water. Once again, I make the point, as I have made a thousand times in this place: what is wrong with us as a race of people that we do not take some of the water from up there and move it south? It is quite extraordinary. Many of the cattlemen, the contractors who served them and the employees who worked on the stations are in diabolical straits. Many of them will be bankrupt as a result of what has taken place there. These are our frontiersmen. The people who live in the Gulf Country have no restaurants to go to; they have no picture theatres to go to; and they have no friends that they can visit. Our nearest neighbours were 40 kilometres away. You think twice before you drive an 80-kilometre round trip to say g’day to your neighbours. A lot of the time the telecommunications, which are very substandard, do not work. We are completely cut off. Sadly, many people that I know have had mostly children die as a result of that isolation because the telephone does not work or they do not have a telephone or the pedal radio is not working or the flying doctor could not fly in because the airstrips were too muddy and they had no access to a helicopter. So many of these people have died. The part that enraged me was that I could get in an aeroplane at Ingham, just north of Townsville on the Pacific Ocean, MAIN COMMITTEE and fly all the way, 1,000 kilometres to Karumba and Normanton, and, except while crossing the Great Dividing Range, I could see water out both sides of the aeroplane. It was a flood of massive size. We have had worse but it was still a flood of massive size and all of the people have suffered as a result of this: the cane-farming people, contractors, employees and mill workers, who have had a short season because of the lack of cane. Many of them will lose their stations, their farms or their houses in the town as a result of this. But whilst this was happening the government announced three per cent interest rates from the Reserve Bank. If those people could have been able to access the three per cent that was made available then they would have had no problems. If the government is lending it at three per cent, why wouldn’t you lend it to these people at three per cent? But, no, the obsessive, stupid, brainless policies of the free market say, ‘No, you must go through the marketplace.’ Well, the banks do not compete against each other; they compete with each other. I defy anyone to point out to me where there is more than a one per cent difference between the banks. But if they can pick up three or four per cent before they send it out to you, why wouldn’t they? There was a time when there was enlightened government in this place, when truly great men walked in this place, and let me name them: King O’Malley, Ted Theodore, Ben Chifley, Jack McEwen and Doug Anthony. Each of these people put in place a banking mechanism that enabled people, when there was trouble through no fault of their own, to take money, effectively from the Reserve Bank but in some cases not from the Reserve Bank, at interest rates of two per cent. I am one of the people that set up one of those banks. I had responsibility from a state government under the Treasurer, Bill Gunn. He and I were assigned the responsibility for the QIDC. The argument is that this costs us money, and if you are a brainless, incompetent government it does cost you money. Perish the thought that a brainless, incompetent government would go into banking! When you are a smart government going into banking, you make an awful lot of money. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we started off with a $200 million loan-it was a loan and no money was actually ever allocated-and the bank was sold for $1.5 billion some seven or eight years later. I deeply regret to say that the QIDC was sold by the National Party. It was the last of the banks to be sold. The Commonwealth Bank was sold, the Commonwealth Development Bank was sold, the Primary Industries Bank was sold, the AIDC was sold and, yes, the QIDC in Queensland was sold. Properly handled, and I have not got the time to say why nor are we canvassing the issue of banking today, a development bank makes money. But I will give you a quick hint that when you lend money intelligently to a farmer who is in trouble through no fault of his own he will give the money back to you and he will stick with you. So if you lend him $300,000, the amount of a debt to some other bank at the start and you take over that debt, then you have $300,000 worth of gilt-edged business which is secured by the value of the farm and you are dealing with a person who you know is going to pay it back when things turn around. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, that gives you a quick view of why you make money. These people have now been languishing since the start of this year, and my understanding is that not a single dollar of any substantial assistance has gone to a single person in the Ingham area or in the Gulf Country. Neither category of people has had a single cent of assistance, and yet the government down here is telling us they have money available at three per cent. We have not seen it. Some of those people, tragically, might join the ranks of the farmers MAIN COMMITTEE who last time. I looked were committing suicide at the rate of one every four days, thanks to the deregulation of the dairy industry, probably, more than anything else-actions by this place and, I might add, the National Party in this place. If they join those ranks then let it be upon the heads of the people in this place. Heaven only knows that representatives such as me have hounded endlessly and ceaselessly the ministers involved in this, trying to get some of that three per cent money made available to the people out there. If you have it and you are handing it out, why don’t you give it to them? Name me a more deserving group of people in Australia. What we asked for was so little. It shows the hypocrisy of this place and the hypocrisy of government as it operates at the state and federal levels that they would not give us any flood drops. They would not give us a helicopter to ferry people out of Karumba. Karumba is a little town, and it was surrounded by 15 kilometres of raging, crocodile-infested floodwaters. The airstrip was out the whole time. They do not effectively have an airstrip out there. The state government has done up the existing one in such a way as to ensure that we will continue not to have an airstrip there. So we do not have an airstrip, for about 2,000 people. The floodwaters were rising. We had no wayeven if you broke a leg or broke an arm-of getting out of there except for 2½ hours in a dinghy in raging, crocodile-infested floodwaters. That is the only way we could get anyone out of there. We went to the media with the pictures of the raging floodwaters and everything, and we told them that they had not even got a helicopter there. We showed them the airport at Normanton, and there was no helicopter there. They told us that they had a helicopter. It was all right and I did not have to worry, because they had a helicopter based at Cairns. I said, ‘Do you think we should run the emergency services for Brisbane out of Sydney?’ He said, ‘No, why would we want to do that?’ I said, ‘It’s the same distance. You could save a lot of money.’ That is exactly the same as you saying to me that you had a helicopter based at Cairns that was going to be available to evacuate people from Karumba. But when the spotlight of public attention was turned upon them, and when the pain of these people, and the dead animalsthe cattle and the kangaroos-were flashed onto the national media, suddenly we had politicians parachuting out of the sky and suddenly we got money through. But it was a bit too late for the fodder drops, because the cattle were all dead at that stage. These people did not have the money or the wherewithal to be able to get those fodder drops made to rescue those cattle. We do not do that to help the grazier. They say, ‘If they live up there, they should be able to live with these sorts of thing.’ We are not doing that to help the grazier. We are doing that to preserve the Australian cattle breeding herd. Heaven only knows! In India it is a religious belief that you are not allowed to kill the cow. The cow is the calf factory and it is the tractor. The sanction is not upon the ox as an animal. The religious sanction is upon the female ox. Similarly here: it is our belief that we should preserve the herd. That is why government should become involved. It always amazes me to see the animal welfare people that go running around and crying about the animals. We did not hear from them. They were pretty silent. Whilst hundreds of thousands of kangaroos, wallabies and other animals drowned, and whilst maybe 100,000 head of cattle drowned as well, they did not seem too worried. I certainly feel, as everyone in this place does, for our brothers and cousins up in the Pacific Islands. We have a very, very close relationship with those people. The Filipino people MAIN COMMITTEE have had a western democratic system there for 60 or 70 years now, arguably longer. They have been an American colony-an Anglo-country colony, if you like-for a large part of their recent history. They have a similar religious belief system to our own-they are Christians-and we have many, many of those people in Australia. In some of the areas I represent it is a male society-we cannot get Australian women to live there. A lot of those men marry Filipino ladies and they are extremely successful marriages. One of only six people who were invited to my own wedding married a Filipino bride. I will mention their names: Col and Melinda Jenkins. They have a beautiful family-a really outstanding family. I think they are a great credit to anyone in Australia. We have a very strong kinship with these people. Many of our rugby league teams have Polynesians and Melanesians playing in them. They come to Australia and they always will. They have always been a race that has moved in and out of Australia, and we welcome them greatly as our cousins and our brothers. But let us start with our more immediate family that has suffered greatly and has not received the assistance that they should have received. In fact, they have really received callous disregard from government. That is still the situation as I speak. To my knowledge and information, no money has been passed out at all. make some brief comments in relation to natural disasters. I want to associate myself with the statements made by the Prime Minister and other ministers in the government in this regard. Natural disasters strike indiscriminately and all over the globe. They strike at home, they strike our nearest neighbours, and sometimes they strike in the most unfortunate of places. While natural disasters are very indiscriminate in the way that they occur they often, unfortunately, very much hit those least able to cope with the natural disaster in the first place. While we have heard a range of comments-and I appreciate the emotion and passion of members of parliament in terms of natural disasters around the country and also those within our own country-I note that Australia has played a significant role both at home and overseas in trying to mitigate those disasters as best as possible in the humanitarian sense and also in an economic sense. First can I just make a few brief comments about some natural disasters at home. We have seen many of those over the years. It is something that most Australians put in the back of their minds. We see ourselves as a very lucky country, a country that is lucky in a whole range of ways, but particularly in terms of having a very small number of natural disasters. But we can easily think back to the earthquake in Newcastle, flooding and fire in different parts of the country and most recently, of course, the devastating fires in Victoria and the massive loss of life there, which was a real shock to all Australians-just how large scale that disaster was for us. In my own home state of Queensland a number of floods have cost not only lives but have also done irreparable damage to some communities in terms of their land, their crops and, as we heard from the previous speaker, their livestock as well. I acknowledge that Australia, while it is a lucky country, has suffered probably not as severely in most cases as some of our nearest neighbours but certainly we have suffered as well. I note that governments of all persuasions have made efforts-and I believe appropriate efforts, as we have seen in the aftermath of the fires in Victoria-to assist people on the ground and also to provide services and facilities in the aftermath, because we know that natural disasters often occur quickly and they MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Swift Code Is Anzbwsww And The Bank Obviously Is Anz Samoa Ltd Apia In Samoa
245,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.41 Am),"I thank the Main Committee for this opportunity toare over quickly, but the impact of those disasters on individuals and the community last for many, many years into the future. I also wanted to make particular reference to a number of natural disasters affecting some of our nearest neighbours, including Samoa, Tonga-all the Pacific islands that have been hit recently-the Philippines and Vietnam. I wanted to make particular mention of all of those groups because not only do I have a compassionate view about the circumstances but also many from those countries live in my electorate. I know first hand from speaking to representatives of those communities just how much impact it has on them here in Australia. I had the privilege of attending a cross-community church service recently for the Pacific Islander community, in particular the Samoan community, in my electorate, and the outpouring of grief, of sadness, made me understand that the disasters that happen in those places directly affect all of us here in Australia. There is actually a direct impact. There is almost nobody in the Australian-Samoan community who has not got a friend or a direct relative-perhaps a cousin, an uncle or an aunt-in Samoa who has been affected in some way, or lost their lives. It is very much something that we feel very directly right here in Australia. I am very appreciative of the way that the Australian government has been able to, in a very compassionate and humanitarian manner, deal with some of those issues, particularly in the immediate aid we provided by sending doctors and medical professionals, supply ships, helicopters and a range of other services directly to those hardest hit communities. We do that because we feel a kinship with our nearest neighbours. I have always been of the view, whether it is in relation to natural disasters, humanitarian aid or just those who are less fortunate than us-and I do not want to talk about immigration issues in relation to this-that often there is a link between natural disasters that take place and the immigration issues that come afterwards. There is a role for Australia to play, a place for us, as the good neighbour and a humanitarian neighbour in many of those cases. I will always applaud governments that look at it from a wide perspective and do the best that they can. We are a small country; we are only 20-odd million people. We have a large geography and there has always been a capacity for a wealthy nation like Australia to step up to the plate and do a little bit more. That is what we have seen with natural disasters in our region and a range of other areas. We should always continue to do that. I want to thank my local community for the way they have behaved and been able to come together as a community to demonstrate their courage, to demonstrate their ability to fundraise and to grieve within their community but to do it in a constructive way that means they can be of assistance. Many of the Samoan and Pacific Islander representatives in my community have actually flown back to their countries to lend assistance personally. That has come at a personal cost to them-a financial cost-and I am very appreciative of the Australian government’s approach in assisting those individuals. We have done that through Centrelink for a range of programs. That is an appropriate way to deal with understanding how these peoplewho, generally speaking, are not wealthy people-have taken a very high personal financial burden to try to assist others. Sometimes it is their own family, of course, but sometimes it is not. Sometimes it is just their broader community. This is on top of AusAID providing $3 million in the way of sanitation, food, clothes and a number of other products that we might provide. MAIN COMMITTEE In closing, I also want to briefly thank the minister as well as the Prime Minister. I understand and appreciate the way they and their offices have dealt with these issues. The action that we have taken is always the appropriate action in dealing with natural disasters in our region and in dealing with our neighbours. We ought to continue that when those situations arise both at home and overseas. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 October, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms NEAL (Robertson) (11.49 am)-I rise to conclude my remarks on the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. Accordingly, the national partnership agreement on preventive health provided $872 million to reform how the Commonwealth and states work together on preventive health. This agreement represents the largest single investment in health promotion in Australia’s history. Prevention forms the foundation of the Rudd Labor government’s approach to health care. I am very heartened to know that the health professionals on the Central Coast have already endorsed the Rudd Labor government’s new approach to a coordinated national strategy for preventive health. In September 2009, Dr Phil Godden, the Chair of the Central Coast Division of General Practice, said ‘increased efforts in preventive health will result in fewer chronic illnesses, less pressure on hospitals and a healthier community’. Dr Godden also said that Central Coast GPs work with their patients every day in matters of prevention of chronic illnesses, especially obesity, smoking and alcohol. These are the three areas that we are specifically targeting with the National Preventive Health Strategy. The division is already running a number of programs supporting GPs in their preventive health roles. These include a lifestyle modification program that is run in conjunction with accredited physiotherapists and that aims to proactively prevent type 2 diabetes through a GP-monitored exercise program. The Rudd Labor government is in total agreement with Dr Godden when he states that ‘it is self-evident that prevention is better than cure’. Dr Godden concludes by urging the government ‘to act on the findings of the strategy and begin implementation of it as soon as possible, as the longer it takes to start, the worse the health outcomes will be for those Australians who are most in need’. I can assure Dr Godden and the rest of the Central Coast GPs that this government is acting both decisively and quickly on a national strategy for preventive health. The establishment of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency represents a bold new initiative in public health in Australia. It will boost Australia’s capacity to combat preventable diseases and set the nation up for a healthier and more prosperous future. I commend the bill to the House. Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. Fortunately for me, I happen to be a board member of the Inala Primary Care facility in my electorate of Oxley. It is a community role that I have undertaken in an honorary capacity because I felt that this was one area of health care that was desperately needed and could be better managed in the overall construct in the way health services are provided in this country. MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Swift Code Is Anzbwsww And The Bank Obviously Is Anz Samoa Ltd Apia In Samoa
246,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.52 Am),"I thank the House for this opportunity to speak on theIf there is one thing that we know after many years of study and many years of experience and learning in the health sector it is that preventive health care is the best health measure that we could possibly provide. Combining information from across the sector into a substantial health policy and providing that to all areas is, I think, the best approach. I am more than happy and more than satisfied to say that this is the approach that the Australian government, the Rudd government, has actually taken. We will certainly see that as part of the bill that is before us today. My experience of preventive health care and primary health care in my local community has shown me that the benefits they provide to a community are enormous. The Inala Primary Care facility, which is right in the heart of my electorate, is an amazing organisation. It has developed out of a need in the community and it demonstrates just what can be done by a community when it has the right partnerships in health services. It was a struggling organisation that was having financial and, I think, service delivery difficulties. With its reorganisation-the establishment of a new board, a new system put in place and an approach that looks at how preventive health can benefit the community directly-we have seen an amazing outcome. There have been not only health outcomes but also economic and financial outcomes, which provide for the taxpayer as well as the health consumer. May I say-and it is a great opportunity to do so-that the Inala Primary Care facility has won a number of accolades in the last two years. In particular, it has just won an award for the best preventative healthcare provider in Queensland. It is in partnership with the University of Queensland and with the state government department of health and really in partnership to with the private sector through GP services and through the people who actually run the organisation. I want to make particular mention too of Cathy Brown, the CEO, who is an incredible person. She has done some great work over many, many years and has brought an enormous amount of energy, experience and talent to the board and to the organisation, which has been able to provide fantastic service to the local community. I think that it is one of those areas where we can do the most good in many cases. For too long health care has always been at the wrong end of health provision-that is, after the event. If we look at the great issues of health care today-obesity, diabetes, chronic diseases such as liver diseases and lung diseases, cancer and a whole range of other areas-we can see that if we can take some early preventative measures we can actually have a positive impact for the individual, which in the end is the most important person, but also for the community they live in and for taxpayers as a whole. The communities in which we have seen the biggest impact are the Indigenous communities, and they are certainly a focus for Inala Primary Care. There are also other disadvantaged communities. It is not just about healthcare provision but also about education and about providing people with the right tools and knowledge to understand about lifestyle choices and about what they are actually doing themselves in order to get the right equipment so that they can be a major participant in their own long-term health care. Certainly there has been a lot of evidence of the good work done by Inala Primary Care and the long-term benefits that will be provided in that community. Through a range of changes and policy directions that the Rudd government has taken we have been able to step forward in a number of directions when it comes to preventative health care and health care more broadly. It would have to be one of the most complex portfolios that MAIN COMMITTEE any minister could take on, and I congratulate Minister Roxon on her fine work. It is one of the most complex portfolios-and I daresay that no-one on the other side in the opposition Liberal or National parties would disagree-but also one of those portfolios that needs almost a bottomless pit of money. There is no limit to what you could spend on healthcare provision. There is an understandable and expected standard in the Australian community that we are provided with the best healthcare services in the world. For the most part, that is actually the case. Our training, standards and requirements are world class; they are world’s best practice. The amount of equipment and services and the types of resources that are provided are first class and world’s best practice. Also, through the Medicare system we have a universally accessible system that is affordable. Those different pillars within the health portfolio provide all Australians with an incredibly great service, one that does not discriminate on locality as such, on your income level, on who you are as a person or on what community you live in. In saying that, I do acknowledge that there are some limitations. Where you live does have an impact on your ability to get certain services, and locality is one of the great challenges for all Australian governments in how they provide services. But certainly the work that we are doing and the cost-saving measures that we are bringing to the health portfolio, along with the enhancements through our GP superclinics in communities where they are desperately needed and a range of other policy initiatives, I think take us in the right direction. I will sum up briefly by saying that having a preventative health framework, a preventative healthcare policy and legislation that does all that it can to provide the right instruments, tools and regulatory frameworks for the health sector to provide the best possible care and give people the tools necessary for them to look after themselves is the right way to go. It is a commendable approach by the Department of Health and Ageing. I commend the bill to the House and again congratulate the minister for health for her fine work. tional Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. My first inclination is to use the word ‘preventative’ rather than ‘preventive’, but people should not be too disturbed about it. I looked up the etymology of the words ‘preventive’ and ‘preventative’. It is from Middle English and, prior to that, from the Latin ‘praevenire’, meaning ‘to come before’, so it is much the same word. People can relax because there is no big difference at all. The passing of the preventive health agency bill will bring about a new era in Australian health reform as we move on from talking about preventive health care to actually doing something about it. We have known for a long time that as a nation we must do better and do more to prevent chronic disease-from when the cartoon character ‘Norm’ was telling us to be more involved with life, back in the seventies. A former Queensland health minister, the Hon. Stephen Robertson, who was my boss, described it as ‘a tsunami of chronic disease coming our way’. The member for Oxley touched on that in his speech. There are some pretty chilling facts out there. The first baby boomers will retire next year. I was born in 1966. According to some definitions, I am either the last of the baby boomers or a few years into Generation X. That whole wave of baby boomers is going to put incredible strains on our health system. As earlier speakers have indicated, we have a high expectation of healthcare needs in the Australian community. People are not prepared to lower those standards, and obviously no government wants to lower those standards. But the costs to our community are going to be astronomical if this tsunami of chronic disease does reach us. MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
247,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12.00 Pm),"I too rise to speak in support of the Australian NaI will take one example: obesity. It is estimated that the overall cost of obesity to Australian society and governments was $58.2 billion in 2008. Chronic diseases like diabetes, some cancers and heart disease loom large on the horizon for way too many Australians. But prevention, as they say, is better than cure. The other proverb is: ‘A stitch in time saves nine’. US studies have shown that every dollar we spend on preventative health saves us about $5 in health expenditure, so, to be more accurate, we could change the proverb to: ‘A stitch in time saves five’. When you consider the escalation of healthcare costs in recent years and the projections for the future, now more than ever, we need to, as Norm said, be a little bit more active. Not only can we save money but, more importantly, we can save lives, extend lives and improve people’s quality of life. During the parliamentary recess I held two seniors forums in the northern and southern bits of my electorate. Because they were so successful, I then held a seniors health forum in Annerley. After the Sunnybank and Annerley seniors forums, people were so excited about the local Brisbane South Division of GPs that they wanted more information about some of their health concerns and what they could do. It was a golden opportunity for our senior citizens to meet local health practitioners, to find out more about how to keep fit and healthy and to give their feedback on our health system. The chilling bit was when one of the GPs from Sherwood talked about inoculations. Basically, all of the characteristics of the people who should be getting swine flu injections applied to me. I thought it was for other people, but it became clear that if you travel a bit, meet lots of people and shake hands you should receive a swine flu vaccination, which I will be taking steps to do. The message I heard loud and clear from our seniors at the three forums is that governments have to do more to promote healthy lifestyle choices and help people stay healthy and out of hospital. Prevention, as they say, is much better than cure. If we do not act now, we will be overwhelmed by this tsunami. This bill sets up the Australian National Preventive Health Agency to drive research and investment in preventive health. The agency will report directly to the health minister and, through the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference, to ministers around the country. It is another initiative to come out of COAG and was agreed to in November last year as part of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. Again, the Rudd government is putting politics and turf wars aside in the interests of a better and healthier country. In consultation with Australian health ministers, the health minister will appoint the CEO and an advisory council for the National Preventive Health Agency. The council will include Commonwealth, state and industry representatives, including experts in preventive healththe people at the coalface, so to speak, in terms of saving and changing lives. The agency will help support health ministers around the country achieve outcomes through the national partnership. This includes delivering about $700 million to help Australians adopt healthier lifestyles. The Commonwealth is providing $133 million over four years to establish the agency and fund preventive health research and social market campaigns that target issues like obesity and smoking. It is no secret that obesity and smoking are major causes of chronic disease but the messages are not yet getting through. I remember when I was elected in November one of the first things that happened was that the ‘baby’ MPs were brought to Parliament House and were given a talk about the challenges of life in Canberra. The MP who gave us the talk spoke about putting on one kilo of weight a month. Thankfully I have not quite lived up to that; I think that would be 23 extra kilos. LookMAIN COMMITTEE ing at the other MPs who were at that talk, I do not see anyone who has done as bad as that. I am not sure that every MP can say the same thing. It was certainly an indication that you have to be very, very careful. Everywhere we go we get offered some food, and it is normally very tasty food but probably not the best food, and it is likely to put on a couple of extra kilos. Similarly around 20 per cent of Australians still smoke. Regarding the overall numbers, the trend is slightly downwards except, I was sad to see, amongst young women. The numbers of young women who are taking up smoking are actually increasing. With all of the knowledge that we have of cancer and carcinogens, there are still people who smoke. I know it is hard to believe, and some of them are informed people. We need to do what we can to get those trends down for young women and for Australians overall. Obesity is projected to lower our children’s life expectancy by two years by the time they reach adulthood. That is an amazing statistic. My children are nine months old and four years old and to think that we are breeding a generation that is going to have a lower life expectancy than us is a suggestion that civilisation is not getting it right. Even my four-year-old knows many of the brands and the as connected with fast food establishments-I am loath to call them restaurants. It is amazing how much more efficient some of these fast food agencies are compared to parenting advice. It is almost unbelievable to consider that the next generation could have a shorter life expectancy than us, their parents. As I said, it is almost an abdication of the term ‘civilisation’. But, and it is a big but, spelt b-u-t-t, we can turn this trend around. The agency will focus on issues like healthy weight, physical activity, healthy eating and smoking to help drive the wholesale change in attitudes and behaviours. Of course, if our aims to reduce preventable chronic disease are to be achieved, we need cooperation across governments, across academia, through the media, through sporting bodies and through others. I think it is about time that the fast food industry stood up. I would certainly call on my local restaurants and fast food establishments to see what they can do. Rather than just having a token healthy food item on the menu, perhaps they could actually try and sell it rather than merely have it there as a token item that no-one buys. The Preventive Health Agency will have a big role to play in fostering this cooperation across industry and the non-government and community sectors. Other key roles of the agency include providing evidence based advice to health ministers on preventive health issues; pulling together data on preventable chronic diseases and risk factors; providing research grants; and promoting national guidelines, standards and best practice codes for preventive health. I have spoken about this before, but one of the most appalling legacies of the coalition government was their gross underfunding of the public healthcare system. Over the life of their government, they left state governments billions of dollars out of pocket on public health through the funding administered by the Australian healthcare agreement. In June 2007, state and territory health ministers released the report Caring for our health? A report card on the Australian government’s performance on health care. This report found that, around the nation, the coalition government were ripping off the public health system by about $1.1 billion every year. That equates to about 350,000 additional admissions each year. So starved of funding were our state health systems that there was very little left over to focus on the longer term preventive strategies to address the causes of chronic disease. You cannot worry about MAIN COMMITTEE tomorrow or what is going to appear on the horizon when the ambulances are ramping outside the emergency services department. In contrast, the Rudd government are facing up to our responsibility to improve the health system, and we are moving on a number of fronts through our health reform agenda and the national preventative health strategy. In cooperation with state and territory governments, this strategy sets bold targets to reverse obesity trends, halve smoking rates to below 10 per cent and reduce risky drinking levels. The new Australian National Preventive Health Agency will have a significant impact on the future of health care in Australia. All of us in this place want to see Australians healthier, and I am confident this new agency will provide the kind of support and advice that our health ministers need to achieve that. I commend the bill to the House. Ms REA (Bonner) (12.12 pm)-I too rise to support this very important Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 before us today, because, as we all know, there is nothing more essential to all of us than good health. If you are suffering from some form of illness or injury, it just makes resolving all the other problems that you contend with in your daily life so much more difficult. So we all know that the best start to any day is to wake up feeling healthy. That can prepare you for whatever the day may bring-and we all know, particularly those of us in this job, that the day can bring anything other than that which we have planned! It is also important for a well-functioning and productive society that all individuals have good personal health and that we support the physical and mental health of all who make up that society and community. Although these statements may be self-evident, unfortunately, as individuals and as a community our physical and mental well-being is not the highest priority at all. In fact, it is often the lowest priority. Whether it is work or family responsibilities or other commitments in our lives, they always seem to take precedence over taking care of ourselves during the day. As a result, often the only time that we ever really deal with our own physical well-being is when it is too late-when we are either ill or injured and we require medical attention and expertise. Rather than focusing on prevention, we wait until we get to the point of falling ill or hurting ourselves because we have not paid due attention to our health. If we took the time to care for our minds and our bodies before they break down, we would find that not only the rest of our own lives would be easier but many of the social problems that we as a society face, and, of course, the enormous amount that we as a government and other levels of government spend on health care, would drop dramatically. We are not talking about a new-fangled idea here. We know that prevention works. There is enough evidence to show, as the member for Moreton said, that losing weight, getting fitter, stopping smoking and reducing or even giving up alcohol consumption make a big difference in preventing disease and improving our life expectancy. But, for some reason, a vast majority of us just do not take any notice. But when we do take notice, when we see governments or community organisations embarking upon community awareness campaigns around a particular disease or some other form of injury and people do take notice, we know that prevention actually works. Whether it is the restrictions on tobacco advertising, which have seen a significant reduction in the number of people taking up smoking, whether it is the good old ‘Life. Be in it.’ campaign on television that we all remember, which got us up out of our chairs and our beds and got us walkMAIN COMMITTEE ing and exercising, or whether it is something as simple as enforcing policies on the wearing of bike helmets, and what a significant reduction in head injuries and other injuries we have seen as a result of that small but very significant change, prevention works. There is the campaign around the wearing of seat belts and enforcing that policy. Indeed there are some very significant changes, particularly when we look at the campaigns on safe sex practices which have had such a significant impact on reducing the spread of HIV-AIDS in this country. All of these things clearly point to evidence that, when a good prevention campaign is run, people will take notice and it will have results. In fact, road trauma deaths have decreased by 80 per cent since the 1970s. There are probably a number of factors involved in that, but I think it indicates that the simple act of wearing a seatbelt and requiring all people to wear seatbelts in a car certainly has made a dramatic difference when it comes to road trauma, accidents and deaths. For that reason, I am very pleased to see that the Rudd government, under the leadership of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, established the National Health Workforce Taskforce in 2008 and recently launched the National Preventative Health Strategy, in September this year. If we are serious about reforming the health system, and we know that we as members of the government were elected on that very clear commitment, if we are serious about implementing our commitment and our policies, we must start with prevention. We currently spend less than two per cent of the health budget on prevention measures and, as a result, we all know that the demand on our public health system, the reliance on GPs and the cost of, and reliance on, medication are increasing dramatically. But, of course, we could do a lot better if we were able to focus policies on prevention. We know that this is not just about feeling better ourselves. We all know the personal cost of being unwell, whether we just feel bad or have hurt ourselves. We know the social cost of being unwell and the impact it has on us both socially and economically. Whether it is the loss of work time or the loss of income, not only does that impact on the sufferer but also it clearly impacts on the family and the people they are dependent on. It also has a significant impact on general productivity. So this is not just about making us feel good. It is about saving the dollars that we spend through taxation support on the health system and about improving the economy through increased productivity. That is why the role of the preventative health agency is so critical and why I am so pleased to see this legislation before the House, because the government’s goal of reforming and improving our health system cannot occur without it. The health agency will be established as a statutory authority under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. It will be established as a result of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health between the state and Commonwealth governments, which was agreed to in November 2008. Once again we see not only that this is an important initiative for health but also that it demonstrates this government’s constant argument that, when governments at all levels work together rather than in competition with each other, the community and all of us as individuals benefit. The Commonwealth will provide the agency with funding over four years of $133.2 million. This includes $17.6 million for set-up and maintenance of the agency, $102 million for national social marketing campaigns around smoking and obesity-two areas where we know prevention can significantly reduce the onset of a vast number of diseases, particularly in later MAIN COMMITTEE life-$13.1 million for research to inform policy development around preventive health and $500,000 for an audit of the preventive health workforce. As you can see, this is a significant commitment. We acknowledge that, if we are to be serious about preventive health, if we are to put our money where our mouths are, it needs to be serious funding and clearly this legislation indicates that. Marketing and awareness campaigns will be funded, as will research around measures that will help us to develop better and more informed policies around preventive health for the future. I think that the most critical role of this agency will be that of coordination. The failure in the past to get the message across to members of the Australian community has not just been because there has been a lack of activity in this particular area; I suspect it is also because there has been a lack of coordination and cohesion, which has prevented a clear focus on the policies that can work when it comes to preventive health. The agency will provide leadership, coordination and monitoring to support the successful implementation of the initiatives that will be funded through the national partnership on prevention, and it will include $692 million for interventions to help Australians modify their lifestyles. As we know, $692 million is not an insignificant amount and I suspect that the investment in intervening in people’s activities and encouraging them to change their lifestyles will save much, much more than that in the long term. It will mean we are not required to spend that amount of money on treatment those people would require if they had not done anything about changing their behaviour. The coordination is important when you consider the diverse number of organisations, individuals and industries that already exist around preventive health, such as health and fitness operators from gym owners through to personal trainers; private health insurers; sporting clubs and associations; health professionals; allied health professionals and alternative medical people such as naturopaths, osteopaths and the like. When you consider the range of people trying to do their bit in this area, I think we can all appreciate the incredibly powerful impact that would occur in the community if there was an agency that brought together all of the good work those people are doing. The agency could start to coordinate and focus on how combined efforts could do more in the area of prevention of illnesses and injuries. The agency will be a significant government body and will therefore need to be accountable to the taxpayers who fund it. It will produce triennial strategic plans and an annual operational plan that must be approved by state and federal health ministers. The minister will appoint a CEO to the agency. There will also be an advisory council that will consist not only of the key government bodies-state, territory and Commonwealth governments-but also representatives and individuals with expertise in this area. So, once again, we will see a significant step towards being serious about preventive health by having an agency that incorporates not just the funding bodies but the people who are doing the work on the ground, that knows what works and can not just inform existing programs but help us to better develop future policies. I think it is important that we do acknowledge the role of all levels of government in this. Coming from a local government background, I certainly appreciate the role that all governments play. Indeed, I believe that local governments are key in the preventative health strategy of this country. It is local governments that provide the parks, recreational activities, the physical spaces and the sporting and recreational programs at a local level which encourage people to get out of their houses and be more active. Whether it is simply a festival that means MAIN COMMITTEE you do not sit and watch videos on your TV but you walk outside and listen to some local music, whether it is a kite-flying day or whether it is providing bike paths-all of that physical and social infrastructure, which does not get acknowledged as a key part of the health budget in this country, is now being brought to the table with other levels of government and acknowledged as playing a key role in preventing illness and improving the health of all in our communities. The council will also focus on a couple of very key issues when it comes to developing policy and working towards improving the health of our citizens. Social marketing is a term not usually equated with health policy, but, as I demonstrated earlier with the number of significant community and government awareness-raising programs in this country, it is clearly a very important part of the health policy in the health budget because it is the way that you get the message out to people. It is the way that you encourage people to take some responsibility for their own well-being and to understand that it is not selfish, ignorant or negligent to take time out each day to care about yourself. You need to care about yourself and make sure you are functioning in a well and satisfied way. The people who depend on you-your work colleagues, family, children and friends and people in organisations that you are involved inwill benefit from you taking care of yourself. That is a very important message that we need to get out there. It is also why I think that this agency will work, particularly through the advisory council. This is not just a top-down approach; it is acknowledging the significant investment in dollars but it is doing so by saying that we have to form partnerships with not just the people who are working in this industry but the people who are benefiting from the industry. We need to encourage individuals and community organisations, as well as those providing the services to them, to be part of this program. You need to take responsibility for yourself. The government will invest in your health if you partake of those activities that will ensure a longer and healthier life. In the last few minutes I have got I want to talk about the local consultations I have been having in my electorate of Bonner. They have mainly been around the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report. Three messages came out of the discussions and consultations I have had with people about how we deal with the already fairly pressured health system: prevention, prevention, prevention. The health professionals are saying that we need more money put into prevention-‘Let’s get that graph of funding better. We don’t want less than two per cent spent on preventative health care and such an enormous amount spent on acute health care. We want to reverse that trend. We need to invest more in preventative health policies.’ I would like to pay tribute to Tyack Health in my electorate. It is a family run business that for 40 years has been doing just this. This group of doctors understand not just the significance of having a good supply of bandages and injections but the importance of preventive health care. They started doing it 40 years ago. They now have a massive medical centre on Radford Road in Manly West. They have pilates teachers, chiropractors, GPs, physiotherapists, nutritionists, dieticians and massage therapists all under the one roof. When someone rings to access any of those services the first thing that is done is an overall health check to find everything that may be affecting them. The professionals at the Tyack Health Centre understand that people do not always see the symptoms of a potentially life-threatening disease and that intervention is sometimes needed. MAIN COMMITTEE They also appreciate that treating one symptom that a person has can often have an impact on everything else associated with their personal well-being. So a holistic approach to health care achieves great results when it comes to prevention. Obviously, it also means that we see great results in terms of the cost of health care in this country. On a final note, when I was researching for this speech I referenced a very interesting media release put out by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke, who often does not get mentioned in health debates, but I think his press release is worth mentioning. The press release talks about the research that was done on the health benefits of Australian native food. Indeed, when you look at things like the Kakadu plum and the Australian desert lime, you find that they have incredibly high levels of vitamin C. The bush tomato, the Tasmanian pepper leaf and wattle seeds were found to contain the richest sources of iron amongst all the herbs and spices tested. The Kakadu plum is also rich in antioxidants, which all of us who are very concerned about our skin would know is of great benefit. It is well worth looking at what is literally in our own backyard. It reinforces once again that we should pay tribute to being in a country which is home to the longest living, longest running civilisation on this planet, the Aboriginal people of Australia. Perhaps it was the wattle seeds, the quandongs and the Kakadu plums that have contributed to such a vibrant, interesting and wonderful culture still being with us today. I think we know that there are many lessons to be learnt from the fact that Indigenous people have cared for this land and for themselves and their families for so many thousands of years. (Time expired) on preventive health. That is the legacy of the Howard coalition government after 11½ years. We are about to change that, because preventive health works. The federal government has brought forward a number of reports. There is the final report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, which was released on 27 July 2009, and also two other significant reports, including Building a 21st century primary health care system: a draft of Australia’s first national primary health care strategy. The report that is particularly germane to the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 was prepared by the national Preventative Health Taskforce, chaired by Professor Rob Moodie, and is entitled Australia: the healthiest country by 2020: National Preventative Health Strategy-the roadmap for action. Professor Robert Bush from the Ipswich Campus of the University of Queensland was also a participant in that strategy. I was pleased that he, amongst other people, was present at the Ipswich and West Moreton health forum hosted at the Ipswich Campus of the University of Queensland on 8 October this year. I want to pay tribute to the many people who turned up to that forum: the Division of General Practice, many doctors, Ipswich General Hospital, the Queensland Department of Communities and, of course, the University of Queensland, which has engaged in a significant health study, including the Ipswich study. I want to thank Professor Alan Rix, the Pro-ViceChancellor of the University of Queensland. But the driving force, along with me, was Professor Helen Chenery, who was actively involved in the promotion of the health forum. As the member for Bonner said, the message is loud and clear. People are interested in this issue and in what we are doing both nationally and locally when it comes to preventative health. I was very interested to read the press release from the University of Melbourne; of MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
248,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12.32 Pm),"Less than two per cent of health expenditure is spentcourse, that is where Professor Moodie comes from. It is from September 2009 and relates to the 307-page report, which had a broad range of recommendations to be implemented in three stages until 2020. They are all focused on reducing the burden of obesity and alcohol and tobacco consumption on Australia’s health and well-being for young people and our more senior citizens. We know from this report that these three risk factors cost us in the order of $6 billion per year, and we know that productivity loss is estimated at $13 billion annually by reason of the scourge of obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and the simple use of tobacco. The first National Preventative Health Strategy gives us what has been described by Professor Moodie ‘as a road map of guidelines’ to address these significant health issues. We in this country pride ourselves on our champions. We are terrific when it comes to sport for a country of 22 million people. Our Olympic record is fantastic. We are very good when it comes to sports such as netball, hockey, basketball, rugby league and rugby union. Our recent performances in men’s and women’s soccer are to be applauded as well. But it comes to the question of what we do in our classrooms, schools, kindergartens, preschools and homes. This is the big and problematic issue. What we do in our family life really affects the long-term health, prosperity and well-being of our people. The Rudd Labor government is strongly committed to recognising that prevention is better than cure, and we are working closely with the states. The Institute of Health and Welfare recently came out with its press release of 30 September 2009, relating to a study that showed that the Rudd Labor government is correcting the past failures of the Howard government with respect to health issues. The Australian government’s share of public hospital funding was 42.5 per cent in 1997-98. It plummeted to 38.6 per cent in 2006-07 and under the Rudd Labor government it has risen again to 39.2 per cent. But what we spend on our hospitals is really going to curing the disease or illness. The national health and hospitals strategy put forward a very serious problem in terms not just of the health and welfare of our people but of the economic development and future prosperity of our country. In 2003 in this country we spent-this is what the Institute of Health and Welfare says-$84 billion on health and aged care. It is projected that by 2033 we will spend $246 billion, or 12.4 per cent of our GDP. That is simply unsustainable. We really need to look at what we do with respect to preventative health. We need to keep our people fit, healthy and out of hospital. We know that, as Benjamin Franklin said, there are only two certainties in life-death and taxes-and we know that all of us will pass away at some stage, but what we need to do is enjoy an abundant, full, happy and healthy life as best we possibly can. The government’s commitment to preventative health is demonstrated not only by the legislation before the House but also by the record amount spent on preventative health, $872 million. We are doing that through the COAG process in partnership with the states and territories. So we are trying to keep people fit. We are providing health checks for four-year-olds to promote early detection of chronic disease factors. We are spending $12.8 million to fund 190 schools around the country to construct either a kitchen or a garden under the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden National Program. There are a whole raft of reforms we are undertaking. But it is the recommendations with respect to obesity, tobacco and alcohol that, if implemented, I believe will make the greatest change to the health and welfare of this country, beMAIN COMMITTEE cause these things affect every family and every community and, when tackling primary health care, we need to focus on preventive health measures. The member for Bonner mentioned in detail the funding provision under this legislation. We are providing $133.2 million over four years for the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. That is a lot of money, and that is a demonstration of the seriousness of the government’s commitment in this area. As the member for Bonner outlined, of this money, only $17.6 million is for the establishment and maintenance of the agency. We are putting $102 million into the national level social marketing campaigns targeting obesity and smoking. It is sad to see that in a lot of other countries around the world smoking is an addiction and an obsession. Many countries have smoking rates at 40 and 50 per cent of the adult population. In this country, we have had a targeted strategy for smoking and we have seen a clear reduction in the per capita consumption of tobacco. The Minister for Health and Ageing, in her second reading speech on 10 September, pointed out some very interesting facts in this regard, and they are worth repeating: Between 1950 and 2008, more than 900,000 Australians died because they smoked … That is notwithstanding the fact that it was known from the middle of last century that smoking tobacco had clear risks to people’s health. The strategies that we have undertaken have seen a reduction in smoking. We have seen a reduction in the number of young people taking up the habit. The Australian public is more aware than ever of the perils of smoking. The average person on the street knows that smoking is a danger and that, if they smoke, not only their lifestyle but their life expectancy are affected and they risk a premature death. As the minister said: The Preventative Health Taskforce set a target of reducing smoking rates to less than 10 per cent. What a great target. If we can achieve that: This would mean approximately one million fewer smokers in Australia, and according to the taskforceAnd this should really resonate with everyonewould prevent the premature deaths of almost 300,000 Australians. The government are also undertaking a big information campaign about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly among young people. Certainly, the schools in my electorate have seen assistance with ‘mystery tour’ funding, which ensures that when young people have their school formal they do not engage in binge drinking but rather in alternative, enjoyable, healthy physical activity where they are not in danger of assault or misbehaviour or vulnerable to any other form of risk. I commend people like Tanya McKenna, a teacher at Ipswich State High School, for the program that is now being duplicated at schools like Bremer State High School and Redbank Plains State High School, and I commend the government for the funding they have provided to Ipswich State High School in this regard. As a bit of a sports tragic and also as a bit of a Brisbane Bronco supporter, I look forward to the day when my beloved Brisbane Broncos do not have alcohol advertising around Lang Park. I look forward to that day because, just as the abolition of smoking advertising on TV had an impact on young people and our community generally, I think that if we were to undertake that strategy, if we were to phase out alcohol promotions and advertising to our young people, as is recommended in the strategy, it would change the drinking culture in our comMAIN COMMITTEE munity. I think we can do better with respect to advertising. I think we can ensure our young people are not put at risk. As the parent of an 18-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old daughter, I am very concerned about what I see amongst young people in my community with respect to excessive consumption of alcohol. But the member for Bonner was absolutely correct when she talked about the role of local government. That is what came through in the health and hospitals forum we had for the Ipswich and West Moreton area at the University of Queensland. One thing that came through very clearly was the role that community infrastructure could play, and that is why the federal government’s commitment with respect to community infrastructure is so important. The Ipswich City Council, the Lockyer Valley Regional Council, the Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Somerset Regional Council-all in my area west of Ipswich and the Ipswich City Council-have undertaken to use that Community Infrastructure Fund in a way which helps the health and welfare of the community. For instance, to the credit of the Scenic Rim Regional Council, they have used $480,000 of that federal money for the Scenic Rim health and hydrotherapy complex. The Ipswich City Council has used that money across the whole area-from the rural parts all the way down to Springfield-for funding for parks, toilet facilities in those parks, beautification of those parks, bike trails and the like, and they have used $10 million of federal government money for the Springfield parklands, which will make a huge difference. It will be like Central Park in Ipswich. That is how much it will be used by the people of Ipswich in those rural areas. Local government has a big role to play because what it can do is enormously important. For example, there are parts of my community in Ipswich where there are great bikeways all over the place. You see people out there walking, riding their bikes, jogging, with the dog, getting active and getting healthy. They are not being Norm; they are being healthy. That is the difference local government can make. So our strategy-in terms of not just our agency strategy under this legislation but also our strategy undertaken with respect to the Community Infrastructure Program rollout-is playing an important role in helping the health and welfare of this country as well. It is partnering with local government, making an impact on people’s lives locally. I think that we can do a lot more in this country. I think we can achieve what we hope to achieve by 2020. I think we can reduce the obesity rates. I think we can reduce the excessive consumption of alcohol. I think we can stamp out the practice of so many young people consuming and taking up the vicious and wicked habit of tobacco consumption. I think we can make a big difference. I am one of those people with a belief that governments can make a difference in people’s lives. I have seen it in my personal life and I have seen it in the lives of the people who live in my community. I think this legislation is one of the most important pieces of legislation we have ever passed in this House. I think that it is going to make a huge difference in every community across the country. I am so happy that we have taken this initiative. I think it is long overdue, and it is really to the discredit of the opposition that when they occupied the treasury bench they did not have the wit or wisdom to do what we are doing now. If they had done that, how many more people would live happy and healthy lives, lives of activity, lives of sport, and lives of abundance. I commend the legislation to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (12.50 pm)-It is my pleasure to rise to speak in support of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. This is certainly a step forward in the Rudd government’s commitment to health and hospital reform throughout this country. It is more than just a step forward; it is a historic step. It is the first time in this country that we will have a dedicated organisation to help combat the complex challenges of preventable, chronic disease. This bill establishes the Australian National Preventative Health Agency, an agency to support the Australian Health Ministers Conference and, through the ministerial conference, the Council of Australian Governments in addressing the increasingly complex challenges associated with preventing chronic disease in our community. This agency will be established under the auspices of the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health, which was announced through COAG in 2008. It is through this national partnership that the government has already committed to providing $872.1 million over six years for a range of initiatives targeting the lifestyle risk factors of chronic disease. These include settings based interventions in our preschools, our schools, our workplaces and our communities to support behavioural changes in the social context of everyday lives. These will focus on poor nutrition, physical inactivity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, including binge drinking. It will also address social marketing aimed at obesity, tobacco and enabling infrastructure to monitor and evaluate progress made by these interventions, including the Australian National Preventative Health Agency. This new agency will have a very important role in providing evidence based advice and national leadership and stewardship through data collection in order to ensure that we improve the availability and comparability of evidence. It is important that we have this national coordination in providing evidence based advice to the minister and the government as a whole as they try to tackle this issue that we face in relation to chronic disease. The agency will also support behavioural change through education or promotion and community awareness programs relating to preventative health. I will talk in more detail shortly about how important those educational and promotional activities are in the community and how important it is to lift awareness and education. This agency will also have a role in supporting and facilitating partnerships with relevant groups; and promulgating national standards and codes to guide preventative health initiatives, interventions and activities. Of the total cost of the measures enabled under this bill, $133.2 million over four years, $102 million is allocated to national-level social marketing campaigns targeting obesity and smoking. Another $13.1 million will go to a preventative health research fund. Any focus on preventative health is welcome not just at the government level but by our health professionals in our local communities. In my electorate, local GPs, physicians and allied health professionals have been calling for a national focus on preventative health and for funding commitments to reflect this focus. I am excited at the acknowledgement of the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, that preventative health is a policy area that the government has given the highest priority. We all know that by focusing on preventative health significant benefits can be achieved. Those savings, of course, are not limited to financial savings. By working towards a healthy nation we will help improve people’s quality of life, the quality of life of their families and their ability to productively be part of society and to relieve the burden on the social services in our communities that deal with chronic disease. As the saying goes, prevention is certainly better than the cure. MAIN COMMITTEE This brings me to some of the more commonly known preventable chronic diseases. Prevention has been defined by the World Health Organisation as: … approaches and activities aimed at reducing the likelihood that a disease or disorder will affect an individual, interrupting or slowing the progress of the disorder or reducing disability. Early intervention and treatment can result in complete recovery, remission or a long and improved quality of life than otherwise would have occurred if preventative measures had not been taken. There are a number of common preventable chronic diseases, and some wonderful initiatives that have already been undertaken in our local communities, in our states and across the country. Diabetes is one example. In Petrie alone there are 4,791 people with type 2 diabetes. Of all of the people with diabetes in my electorate, 84.41 per cent of those people are type 2. This is above the national average. There are 1,657 people in Petrie with diabetes who need insulin. Type2 diabetes affects 85 to 90 per cent of all people with diabetes. While it usually affects mature adults, more and more young people, even children, are getting type 2 diabetes. Type2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease and is strongly associated with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and extra weight around the waist. Across the globe the statistics are even more daunting: every 10 seconds a person dies from a diabetes related cause, every 10 seconds two people develop diabetes, every year a further seven million people develop diabetes. Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of global death by disease. I mentioned earlier that there are some preventative measures that are already being taken by governments and organisations both nationally and globally to tackle these diseases. World Diabetes Day is celebrated worldwide and is coming up on 14 November. It involves more than 160 countries. Millions of people are engaged to take part in diabetes advocacy and awareness. This year, 2009, is the beginning of a five-year campaign to address the growing need for diabetes education and preventative programs. The campaign slogan is ‘understand diabetes, take control’. World Diabetes Day is also a major fundraiser for Diabetes Australia Queensland, and helps raise awareness about diabetes. Funds are used to educate the public about the risks associated with diabetes and to support people, families and carers living with diabetes. Diabetes associations and Diabetes Australia have established a website. I attended the launch last year. This new website allows individuals to not only gain information about what are the risks associated with diabetes and what can be done to avoid getting diabetes but also gain more education about type 2 and type 1 diabetes and what are the types of treatment. It also provides an amazing tool for individuals who have diabetes, where they can put in their local suburb or postcode and it will come up with a map, a bit like a Google map, which identifies medical providers and pharmacists in the area who provide the equipment that they need. This is a great new tool to help people manage their condition. Prevention is not just about stopping the disease occurring in the first place; once someone has the disease, it is about managing the disease in a better way so that those people have a better quality of life overall. Heart disease is another chronic disease that is preventable, yet many Australians are still quite ignorant about the risks that they face. Cardiovascular disease is heart, stroke and blood vessel disease. It kills one Australian nearly every 10 minutes. It affects more than 3.7 million Australians. It prevents 1.4 million people from living a full life because of disability caused MAIN COMMITTEE by the disease. Cardiovascular disease affects one in five Australians and affects two out of three families. It has claimed the lives of almost 46,000 Australians-34 per cent of all deaths in 2006-despite the disease being largely preventable. Females are particularly at risk of this disease and I think we are quite ignorant of that fact. Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted. Debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Economic Stimulus Initiatives (Question No. 958) Dr Southcott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 20 August 2009: In respect of Chart 17 on pages 2-33 of Budget Paper No. 1 for 2009-10: (1) Which of the Government’s fiscal stimulus packages were included as part of this chart’s assumptions. (2) By quarter from December 2008 to June 2012, what sum of money was spent or will be spent by the Australian Government in the (a) Economic Stimulus Strategy, (b) Council of Australian Governments reform package, (c) Nation Building package, and (d) Nation Building and Jobs Plan. (1) Dr Southcott is referred to the note under Chart5 on page 2-17 of Budget paper No. 1 for 2009-10. (2) Treasury’s submission to the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the Government’s economic stimulus initiatives (dated 2 October 2009) outlines the size, composition and scheduled roll-out of the Government’s fiscal stimulus packages. Details of the individual measures within these packages were published as follows: Economic Stimulus Strategy: Table A4 on page 138-139 of the 2008-09 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (November 2008); Council of Australian Governments reform package: Table2 (Appendix A) on page 49-56 of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook (February 2009); Nation Building package: Table2 (Appendix A) on page 49-56 of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook (February 2009); and Nation Building and Jobs Plan: Table 2.1 on page 17, and Table2 (Appendix A) on page 4956, of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook (February 2009). Both the Coordinator-General’s first progress report on the Nation Building– Economic Stimulus Plan (released on 27 August 2009) and Treasury’s submission to the Senate Economics Committee outline actual payments to date under the cash payment and COAG elements of the stimulus packages. As noted in the submission, queries regarding the implementation of the investment components of the Nation Building package and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan should be directed to the Commonwealth Coordinator-General, who has responsibility for these components. Centrelink: Nerang Office (Question No. 965) Mr Ciobo asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 7 September 2009: In respect of the Centrelink office at Nerang, Queensland (1) What funds were appropriated to this office for the 2008-09 financial year. (2) What funds have been appropriated to this office (a) for the 2009-10 financial year, and (b) over the forward estimates years. (3) How many staff were employed at this office as at 7 September 2009, how many of these were employed on a full-time basis, and what is the total budgeted funding for salaries and wages of staff in the 2009-10 financial year.",223,Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009
249,Mr Swan,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) How many (a) clients were seen, and (b) counter enquiries were made, at this office between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009. (1) Funding for Centrelink Customer Service Centres in the northern Gold Coast region (Biggera Waters, Nerang and Southport) is not appropriated to individual offices. As customers in this region use one or more of these offices regularly, resource management in the region is managed centrally to ensure maximum flexibility to meet fluctuating demand. Funds were not appropriated specifically to the Nerang office for the 2008-09 financial year and can not be disaggregated. Customers in the northern Gold Coast region attend the office most convenient to their work, study, employer provider and/or home. (2) As noted in question 1, funding for 2009-10 and the future financial years, specific funding for Nerang is not fixed. Funding for future years, including 2009-10 and over forward estimate years, will be subject to customer demand and changes to service delivery. Funding will continue to be allocated to the northern Gold Coast cluster of offices, as a whole, to ensure that the Biggera Waters, Southport and Nerang Customer Service Offices are able to respond effectively to changing customer demographics and demands. (3) On7 September 2009, 31 employees worked at Nerang Customer Service Centre, of whom 22 were employed on a full time basis. The total budgeted funding for salaries and wages for staff for the 2009-10 financial year cannot be provided specific to Nerang, as noted above. (4) Centrelink is unable to answer this question completely as it does not currently capture the total number of customers who attend a Customer Service Centre. Centrelink is able to advise that there were approximately 192,000 instances where customers reported income or were recorded at a reception point in Nerang in 2008-09. Of these, 66,999 were instances of customers reporting income at Nerang and 124,979 were recorded reception contacts. Data on reception contacts does not include situations where a customer’s record was not accessed and may not include situations where the customer was seen by a Customer Liaison Officer prior to reaching a reception point. Whaling (Question No. 1012) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 15 September 2009: (1) Can he indicate the most recent advice the Government has received regarding potential legal action against Japan regarding its whaling program. (2) Can he confirm the point at which the Government may view that its diplomatic efforts have not succeeded, and that legal action may be required to stop Japan’s whaling program. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) It has been the practice of successive governments not to provide information on the content of legal advice given to the Government. (2) The Government is continually reviewing progress with respect to resolving Japan’s special permit (so-called ‘scientific’) whaling and will make a decision in due course on the success or otherwise of diplomatic efforts.",230,Questions In Writing
250,Mr Bowen,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:China Non-ferrous Metal Mining Group (Question No. 1014) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 15 September 2009: (1) Has he received any advice on the Foreign Investment Review Board’s (FIRB’s) decision in relation to the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group becoming a majority shareholder of the Lynas Corporation; if so, can he indicate what this advice was and from whom it was received. (2) Has he provided an opinion or advice on the FIRB’s decision in relation to the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group becoming a majority shareholder of the Lynas Corporation; if so, can he indicate what it was. (3) Has any consideration been given to the fact that China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group is the largest foreign investor in Burma. (4) Are the track records of corporate responsibility by foreign companies seeking to invest in Australia taken into account; if so, in what ways. (5) Is an application by a company like China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group, a state-owned enterprise directly under the administration of the Chinese Government, treated differently in a foreign investment application; if so, in what ways. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I have been advised that the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group has decided to terminate its proposal to become the majority shareholder of Lynas Corporation. Questions regarding foreign investment applications should be directed to the Treasurer. (2) Treasury consults with my Department as part of its consultations with relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies on foreign investment proposals. These consultations are to identify any potential national interest issues arising from foreign investment proposals allowing Treasury to provide whole of government advice to the Treasurer. (3) The Government is aware that the China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Group has investments in Burma. (4) The assessment of potential foreign investments, including from foreign government entities, involves consideration of any matters that are relevant to Australia’s national interest, which can include corporate conduct and business standards. (5) The Government has clearly stated that it welcomes foreign investment across all sectors, so long as it is not contrary to Australia’s national interest. Australia’s foreign investment regime is nondiscriminatory and Chinese investors are treated the same way as other investors. National Partnership Agreement To DeliverA Seamless Economy (Question No. 1018) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in writing, on 15 September 2009: In respect of the National Partnership Agreement (NPA) to Deliver a Seamless Economy, and the associated implementation plan: (1) What benefits will the reforms made under this NPA deliver on housing affordability. (2) What proportion of the $550 million of funding for this NPA will be allocated to the deregulation priorities of (a) environmental assessment and approvals processes, (b) development assessment processes, (c) the National Construction Code, and (d) the National Electronic Conveyancing System. (3) By what date are the State and Territory governments expected to provide their first progress report under this NPA. (4) Will the reports provided to the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council from each State and Territory government be made available to the public; if so, when, if not, why not. (5) Have all overdue milestones set out in the implementation plan relating to (a) environmental assessment and approvals processes, (b) development assessment processes, (c) the National Construction Code, and (d) the National Electronic Conveyancing System, been achieved; if not, why not. (1) Four reforms in the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy (NP) are directly relevant to reducing business costs and compliance burdens in the building and construction sector, including the housing sector. These are: (a) development assessment, to deliver improved development assessment processes to provide greater certainty and efficiency in the development and construction sector; (b) a National Construction Code, to enable a nationally-consistent approach to on-site building and plumbing regulation; (c) a national electronic conveyancing system, to deliver a single electronic system for completing real property transactions and lodging land title dealings for registration in Australia; and (d) licences of tradespeople, to establish a national trade licensing system. (2) The NP provides up to $550 million in Commonwealth funding to States and Territories over five years in order to facilitate and reward the delivery of 27 priority deregulation reforms.

Mallee Electorate: Solar Power Station (Question No. 1034) Mr Forrest asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on 17 September 2009: In respect of the Solar Power Station to be constructed near Mildura in the electoral division of Mallee, currently in voluntary administration(1) What is its status. (2) Can he provide the security status of the (a) $75 million grant provided by the former Coalition Government, and (b) $50 million grant offered by the Victorian Government. (3) Is the future of this project secure. Mr Martin Ferguson-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The project is to build a 154MW heliostat concentrator photovoltaic (HCPV) power station project in Victoria in three stages. The first stage involves the construction of a repeatable HCPV unit at Bridgewater with a 2 MW pre-production prototype to be constructed at Mildura; stage 2 involves the construction of a further 100MW at Mildura; and stage 3 involves the addition of a final 52MW at the Mildura site. On7 September 2009, Solar Systems Pty Ltd placed itself into voluntary administration by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). PwC is assessing Solar Systems’ financial situation and is seeking a buyer for the business. The Administrators have until 7 December 2009 to put forward recommendations to the creditors on the business going forward. The first part of stage one, the development of a repeatable HCPV unit at Bridgewater has commenced. Stages two and three have not commenced. (2) The current status of government grants is: (a) The previous Government committed $75 million under the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (LETDF) to Solar Systems Pty Ltd to construct stage two, the 100MW stage at Mildura. LETDF funding is strictly tied to achievement of project milestones, none of which have yet been met; therefore no money has been paid. The previous Government also committed $4.5 million under the Asia Pacific Partnerships Program (APP) for stage one. Of this, $2.62 million has been paid through the APP following the successful completion of project milestones for stage one. (b) The Victorian Government also committed $50 million under its Energy Technology Innovation Strategy Large Scale Demonstration Program to the project. Of this, $0.375 million has been paid by the Victorian Government following the successful completion of project milestones for stage one. (3) It is too early to make an assessment about the future of the Mildura Project at this stage and the Administrator must be given time to explore all options regarding Solar Systems.",233,Questions In Writing
