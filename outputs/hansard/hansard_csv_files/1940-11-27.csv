EFFE CT OF BUDGET PROPOSALS. member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) on Friday last asked as to whether retailers, in addition to passing on the increased sales tax, would be entitled to charge profit thereon. In reply to the honourable member, I point out that when the sales tax was first introduced in 1930 the Government of the clay did not see fit to impose any such restrictions on retailers. The practice then adopted of regarding sales tax as portion of the cost has persisted through all the variations of sales tax rates that have been made during the last ten years. The freedom of retailers has now been limited by a recent determination of the Prices Commissioner which provides that, for the time being, the normal gross profit margin may not be obtained on sales tax in excess of 10 -per cent. Consideration w ill be given to special cases where this ruling may involve hardship. member Ward) whether it was a fact that at the outbreak of the war Richard Allen and Sons Proprietory Limited bought up all available blankets and in a few weeks disposed of them to the Commonwealth Government at a profit of 10 per cent.

In this care, however, I am able to in form the honourable member that the company named has no record of any sale of blankets to the Commonwealth Government nor has the Contracts Board any record of the purchase of blankets from the company.

Can he inform me whether the report is correct? the honourable member when he asked me a question on this subject last week, I have sent a cablegram in regard to it to the Government of New Zealand.

This additional payment will make the total advances in respect of wheat in this pool 3s. 5-kl. a bushel, les3 rail freight on' bagged wheat, and 3s. 3id. a bushel, less rail freight on bulk wheat. The payment will involve the distribution of a further amount of £2,450,000. Of the total wheat acquired by the board of the 1939-40 harvest, namely, 195,500,000 bushels, sales have been made of 154,000,000 bushels, leaving an estimated carry-over"" as at the end of November of approximately 42,000,000 bushels. Thirty-six million bushels have been sold, but have not been shipped. Advances by the Commonwealth Bank to the wheat pool were £34,500,000 to cover payments to the growers for freight, storage and incidental expenses, including the ad£13,000,000, which, of course, will be further increased by the additional payboard to growers. The initial advance for wheat acquired for the present harvest, 1940-41, which will be known as No. 3 pool, will be at therate of 3s. a bushel, less freight, on bagged wheat, with an appropriate adjustment for bulk wheat.

A t this stage, the of preceding governments has been to Government is satisfied that the higher maintain the statutory exemption at as ranges of income cannot contribute more high a level as is possible, having regard than an additional £10,000,000, making to the needs of revenue. The statutory exemption of £250, £20;000;000 by taxpayers in this group. which has applied for many years, has Similarly, in the range of middle incomes had the effect, in conjunction with the between £400 and £1,000, the additional liberal concessional deductions allowed, £6,000,000 which the taxpayers of this of keeping a very considerable section of class are being called upon to contribute the income-earning people of Australia outside thefield of' Commonwealth direct taxation.

131,Mr Fadden,"lower group, it has proved to be necessary to extend the field.of the tax by lowering the statutory exemption. This the Government has-done, but I assure honourable members that only in the face of stern necessity has this course been taken, a course which the Government considers to be inescapable. This matter is quite outside party political considerations; it raises no question of thrusting unfairly a burden of tax upon any sectionof the community, or of discriminating against one section in favour of another. If revenue is to be obtained in amounts essential for the successful prosecution of -rate of tax. The discrimination as be the war, it is plainly unavoidable that some greater measure of tax shall be borne by taxpayers in the lower income group. To facilitate the collection of the tax from salary and wage-earners and, at the same time, to ease the burden of meeting the payment of the tax in a lump sum, tlie Government proposes to introduce a scheme for the deduction of the tax from salaries and wages, and earnings of that character, by instalments spread throughout the year. I shall explain the operation of this scheme in a few moments. Another important amendment is the withdrawal of the tax rebate hitherto allowed to individual shareholders in respect of dividends distributed to them by companies. Briefly stated, the rebate of tax which the law at present allows to shareholders is made at, the shareholders' rate of tax on property income, or at the company rate, whichever is the less. The allowance of a tax rebate is based on the conception that the assessment of the profits of a company, and the assessment of a shareholder on dividends paid out of those taxed profits, involve double taxation: in other words, the company is merely the machine by which the shareholders combine to earn profits, and the assessment of the profits of a company is really the assessment of the income of the shareholders. Whatever merit be attached to the principle of the allowance of a tax rebate on dividends, the Government. considers that the concession which might be Granted in normal times should he withdrawn as part of a plan to provide the funds so necessary for war purposes. Mr Fadden. It is appropriate to mention that the allowance of. the rebate has operated in such a way as to confer unequal advantages upon shareholders in companies generally. Thus, whilst a company's profits have been taxed at a flat rate of 2s. in £1, a shareholder whose rate of tax was 2s. or more in £1has received the full benefit in rebate of the tax paid by the company. But a shareholder receiving the same amount' of dividend whose rate was less than 2s did not enjoy thef u l l benefit of the tax paid .by the company but only a rebate based on his lower tween shareholders is more clearly revealed when one considers that one class of shareholder received a rebate of 2s. in the £1, whilst a shareholder whose income fell below the statutory exemption received no rebate at all. The Government has given earnest consideration to views expressed in support of the retention of the rebate as well as to those advanced for its abolition, and has decided that, the revenue demands of the moment-justify a discontinuance of the concession. The gain in revenue which will be derived from the abolition of the rebate in the case of individuals is estimated at £1,700,000 for this financial 'year. The allowance of the rebate is being retained in the case of dividends received by resident companies from other companies in which they hold shares, as it is considered that the holding company is merely .the channel through, which profits eventually flow to the individual shareholders. To levy a tax upon the dividends received by the holding company without a corresponding rebate would have the effect of throwing an inequitable burden upon investors iu companies. General consideration of the question of the allowance of the tax rebate has attracted attention to the anomalous situation that has arisen in regard to dividends paid, out of Commonwealth loan interest."" The effect of section 45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is that the part of a dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest carries a rate of tax of 16d. in the £1 as compared with the rate of 2s. in the £1 on the balance of the taxable income of a company. been allowed to companies at the rate of 2s. in the £1 on the whole of the diviof the recoupment of capital expenditure dend received by tlie company, resulting in a loss to revenue of 8d. in the £1 on the part of the dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest. Now that section 40 of the act is to be amended the opportunity is being taken to correct this anomaly by limiting the rate of rebate in the part of the dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest to Is. 4d. The amending bill also provides for an section 159 and the "" corresponding alteration of the basis on which the further tax on the undistributed profits of public companies is to be levied. When this further tax was imposed in May last, provision was made for a deduction of an amount equal to 25 per cent, of the company's profit after certain deductions had been made therefrom. This allowance was granted because the reservation of profits was considered necessary to meet expansion and contingencies and to cover expenditure not deductible for taxation purposes. additional sources of revenue the Government has given further consideration to the question of this allowance and has decided that it should be withdrawn. The view taken is that the allowance of 25 per cent, of adjusted profits is more than adequate for the purpose for which it was designed and the withdrawal of the deduction still leaves a substantial pool of reserved profits after payment of the undistributed profits tax at the comparatively low rate of 2s. in the £1. The undistributed profits tax is levied after the provisions in the law of the United allowance of a. deduction for dividends paid within six months after the close of the year of income. The Government has reconsidered the position of non-resident companies, particularly those in the United Kingdom which, owing to the present disturbed conditions, find themselves unable within the statutory period of six months to comply with the formalities necessary to the distribution of company profits. The Government has, accordingly, decided to extend the period to nine months in the case of non-resident companies. A further proposed amendment relates to the sneoial deduction provided by section 122 of the act for capital expendedby mining companies in plant Previously the tax rebate has and development of the mining property. The object of that provision is .to permit out of profits during the estimated life of the mine. The practical application of the -provision, however, has disclosed that it is defective in that a ' f u l l recoupment is not provided for in the section. The amendment is being proposed to cure the defect. ; The act is also being amended to place a time limitation upon the operation of sections of the law which provide for the allowance of a rebate in the case of income doubly or trebly taxed in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the States. Those provisions apply to assessmentsback to the financial year 1921-22 and, at the present tfime, an application for a rebate may extend retrospectively for nearly 20 years. It is proposed that an application for a rebate in respect of any assessment must be made within six years fro m the date In its search for when the tax on that assessment became due and payable. The period of six years is considered to give a reasonable opportunity for the lodgement of the application and the submission of the particulars required for the calculation of the rebate. It is most unreasonable that the Taxation Department should be required to attempt to calculate rebates after the expiration of more than six years from the time the assessments were made. In reaching this decision the Government has been influenced by Kingdom which places a similar l i m it on application for relief granted in that country in. respect of dominion .income taxes. I shall now proceed to explain the scheme which the Government proposes to introduce for the collection of tax payable on salaries and wages and earnings of that character. The comprehensive legislative machinery necessary to give effect to the scheme w ill be found in clause 13 of the bill which consists of 23 proposed new sections. W it h the lowering of the statutory exemption a considerable number of taxpayers from the salary and wage-earning class w ill be brought into the taxable field; and to ease the burden which would be imposed on them if they were obliged to meet tbe payment of' their assessments in a lump sum, the Government has-decided to introduce a. scheme whereby the tax will be pajd. by instalments throughout the greater (part of the year. The scheme has already been adopted for State taxation purposes in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Stated generally, the scheme for which the bill makes provision is an arrangement whereby the payment of income tax is effected by instalment deductions from the salary or wages of the employee, either by the purchase of taxinstalment stamps by the employer, or by means of cash-instalment deductions made under approved group schemes... The deductions to be made will commence on tbe 1st January, 1941, and will be on account of tax payable in respect of assessments for the current financial year based on income derived during the year ended the 30th June,. 1940. The deductions will be fixed amounts of instalother approved places as may be found ments based upon salary or wages being received at the time the instalments are deducted. The basic deduction which it is intended shall apply is that relating to a person without .dependants, and in the case of a married man with a dependent wife and children this basic rate is reduced by 4s. a week, in respect of each dependant. As tlie deductions are being made as from the 1st January next, it is necessary that the weekly instalment be based on an. amount thatwill secure the payment of the tax in full before the 30th June next. Thus the deductions for this year will be spread over a period of only 25 weeks. For subsequent years it is proposed, that the deductions commence on the 1st August and continue over a period of 40 weeks. The statement "" A "" which has been circulated for the information of honourable members shows the weekly deductions which will be made on varying incomes ranging from £4 a week to £19 a week in the case of a taxpayer without dependants and taxpayers with one, two, three and four dependants. It will be seen in the case of. a single employee in cash, and where the value of man earning £6 a week that the weekly deduction is 12s. and in the case of a married man with a wife and one child Mr Fadden. 4s. A single man earning £10 a. week will have 30s. a week deducted, whilst the married man with dependent wife and child earning the same salary or wages will have 22s. a weekdeducted from his salary or wages,, and so on. The maximum rate of deduction which is to be applied is 5s. in the pound a week. To authorize the employer to make weekly deductions lower than the basic rate prescribed in the case of a person without dependants, the employee will be' required to furnish a declaration in duplicate to his employer setting out therein particulars regarding his dependants-. . On the information shown in this declaration the employer will reduce the basic deduction by 4s. a week for each dependant. The employer will retain one copy of the declaration and forward the duplicate to the Taxation Department: Tax instalment stamps will be made available for sale at all post offices and necessary. Employers will be required to make the prescribed deductions from each payment of wage3, and to hand to the employee concerned a tax-instalment stamp or stamps equal in denomination to the deductions made The employee will be required to affix the stamp to a page in his stamp book and to cancel, it by writing thereon his name or initials and the date. Approved stamp books published by a number of printing firms will be on sale at stationers' shops and other distributing points at a nominal charge. Books for instalment stamps cost l i d . or 2d. each and last for at least a year. The employee will be responsible for the safe custody of his stamps until such time as he presents them at the Taxation Office in payment of his tax. When the taxpayer receives his notice of assessment he will forward the book of stamps , and the notice of assessment to the Taxation Department where the face value of the stamps will be applied in payment of his tax. If the value of the stamps is insufficient to pay the whole of the tax, any balance must be paid by the the stamps exceeds the amount of the tax payable the excess will be refunded in cash immediately to the employee. Employers of large numbers of employees who do not desire to use taxinsiahnint stamps may, with the concurrence of their employees, obtain the Commissioner's approval for the formation of a group. Under this arrangement, the employer will make prescribed deductions on pay days and will pay the aggregate amounts -deducted to the Taxation Department at pre-arranged times. When the employee receives his notice of assessment he may either hand it to his employer who will vary the amount of the deduction to meet the tax by the due date, or the employee desirous of maintaining the confidential character of his notice of assessment may obtain from the employer a certificate of the deductions made. The certificate will then be presented by the employee to the Taxation Department and the necessary credit will be given to him for the amount of the deduction paid through the group. Adjustments for under-payments and over-payments will be made as in the case where tax-instalment stamps are used. Provision has also been made for the Commissioner to require employers to make deductions under group schemes in lieu of delivering tax instalment stamps to employees if , owing to special circumstances connected with the character of their employment, such an arrangement is considered to be desirable. The Government considers that the benefits of the scheme should be afforded to taxpayers other than employees, and the bill contains a provision enabling such persons, if they so desire, to purchase tax instalment stamps from the authorized source. As regards, these persons, however, the purchase of the stamps will not be compulsory, but the provision is made to assist those taxpayers who desire to set aside a certain amount of tax, from time to time, in anticipation of the receipt of a notice of assessment. Taxpayers may at any time make application to the Taxation Department for a certificate exempting them from suffering further instalment deduction's The system of payment ot tax by tax from their wages. These certificates will instalment stamps and group schemes, be issued in those cases where(a)-the assessed tax has been fully paid; ; (b) where the taxpayers' annual return shows that the income received for the year is less than the minimum amount taxable. A3 soon as possible after the lodgement of annual returns, those of the employee' class will be examined by the Taxation Department, and in the nontaxable cases, certificates of exemption will be issued to the individuals concerned, informing them they, have no tax 'to pay and authorizing their employers to refrain from making the prescribed deductions. This Certificate will also entitle the taxpayers, to a cash refund from the department of the face value of any stamps, he may have in his possession. The advantages of the scheme are summarized as follows :(a) The deduction of instalments in a financial year will normally commence on the 1st August and continue for a period of 40 weeks or such shorter time, until the taxpayer has. accumulated sufficient credit to meet his tax liability. The load of taxationis, therefore, spread over the maximum period of time. Eor the current year, however, deductions will commence on the 1st January and continue for a period of 25 weeks. (l>) There will be an earlier and regular flow of revenue from income tax instead of the receipt of large payments towards the .end of the financial year. (c) It is expected it will lead to the discovery of a certain number of defaulters. Some persons liable to lodge annual returns fail to do so, but Under the proposed scheme the employers of these -""ersons will be required to make the prescribed deductionc and issue tax instalment stamps. . Consequently the income tax revenue will receive-amounts to which it is entitled whether the taxpayer makes his returns or fails to do so. which has been in operation-for Stale taxation purposes in South Australia and Victoria for several years, has been a marked success. After investigation of the results achieved in those States, Western Australia and Tasmania introduced similar schemes as from the 1st July, 1940: The fact that the .scheme is already in operation in four States will enable the Commonwealth to superimpose the scheme for federal purposes with a minimum of inconvenience to employers, employees and the department concerned. . In New South Wales and Queensland the federal provisions will, operate independently of"" the State systems although administered' by. the one amalgamated Taxation Department. To facilitate the operation of the scheme, it is proposed to amend section 204 of the. act to provide that income tax shall be due and payable on a date not. less than 30 days after the serviceof the notice of assessment in lieu of the specific period of 60 days at present allowed. The operation of the scheme in those States where a similar scheme is already functioning for Statepurposes makes it very desirable that the Commonwealth and State tax should be made due and payable on the same day. The proposed amendment will enable this course to be followed: I wish, however,to make it clear that taxpayers outside these particular States as well as all taxpayers who do not come within the provisions of the scheme, will, a -s heretofore, continue to be allowed 60 days for payment of their assessments. The additional tax payable by private companies and the further tax on the undistributed income of public companies will, however, be payable .30 days after the receipt of the assessment. There will be' no disturbance of the existing methods of administration by the adoption of the proposed: scheme. It will be necessary, however;, to'provide for the Governor General in: Council, to nrrange with the Governors in Council of the States for agreements to' be enteredinto for the carrying out of thenecessary functions arising from, the new provisions. The preparation of these agreements will follow the passing of the necessary legislation. At present in the States of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, State tax instalmentstamps are in use. The agreements with those Ifr. Fadden. -States will provide for the withdrawal of the State stamps on the 31st December, 1940, and .^commencing on the 1st January, 1941, the new stamp will come into circulation and will be used as a joint stamp for Commonwealth, and State purposes. The stamp will be accepted by the Commonwealth and State Governments in the four States mentioned as payment, in due proportions, of the taxassessed for Commonwealth and State purposes respectively. In the States of New South Wales and Queensland, the stamp will be usedfor Commonwealth purposes only during the period' in which those two State-Governments retain their, existing systems of State taxation. Tho principle followed in these two States is that of tax assessment and tax collection at the source in respect of the current year's, income. The tax on income from employment is levied on weekly earnings and irregular wage earners pay tax at the same rate as thoso in regular, employment. Tax contributions are, therefore, not equal: There is no complete recognition of the varying domestic 'responsibilities of the taxpayers ; and the differentiation is made in the case of taxpayers in receipt of busi=ness or property,income where the assessment is based upon the income of. the immediately preceding financial year. For the reasons mentioned, the Government. has decided to adopt the scheme in operation in the four States other than New South Wales and Queensland. The scheme adopted also has the recommendation of the conference of expert taxation officers, held in Sydney in January this year. Both the 1921 and the 1934 Royal Commissions on Taxation supported, the principle that in any system of payment of income tax by instalments collected at the source,an adjustment of over and under payments in. relation to thetotal income of the year should be made. The comment of' the-1921 Royal Commission on Taxation readsasfollows:We have no hesitation in saying that the proposal to tax wages at the. source cannot fairly be considered except in conjunction with the system of adjustments which will have tlie effect of finally imposing tax only to the extent justified by the total taxable income for the year. The remarks of the 1934 Koyal Commission on Taxation arel .v. ',!-;', '' '! S nV ,! l *°prepared to recommend any method L t a due* not provide for any eventual adjustment or under jiayniunts. Trafficking in tax instalment stamps is prohibited and is made an offence under uic act and heavy penalties are provided in cases where a person is proved guilty ot forging or uttering counterfeit stamps.

We live in the midst of In New Zealand severe basic rates of Mr Fatldm. uncertainties, but one thing at least is sure-that there is no cheap road to success in war. On the other side of the world men of Ta<e Payable by a and women are at this moment buying' liberty with.their blood. Their cause and ours are one, and for us in Australia the issue is simple. It is this: Must this war be won ? Everything that is goodi in our eyes is at stake. There can be no two answers. I repeat that there is no chea.p road to victory. The way lies, in Mr Churchill's phrase, through ""blood' and tears and sacrifice "". We as a nation of Tax Payable by a have taken upon ourselves the payment* of a share of that price for liberty. We mine is needed to justify even an uncomThe income tax, as a means of raising money, has the great merits of equity cial calls on the individual can be sympaI t is natural, therefore, for the GovernI n both Australian taxpayer a very I need quote only a few examples burden indeed. I ..do so taken at random of the resultsof these regret, but without apology.. increased burdens on the British taxincome tax have been adopted and have been supplemented not only by a surtax of 15 per cent., but by a flat levy of Is. in the £1 on the gross amount of all incomes. There are no exemptions. All over the Empire the story is the same; those peoples have taken up their burden. We will not wish to do less. It is no part -of the present proposals to deprive the taxpayer of any of the concessional deductions which he has enjoyed in the past. So far as he can be protected from the effects of war-time taxation he will be protected. For reasons I have given at length in connection with the Income Tax Assessment Bill, however, the Government has been forced, I need not say unwillingly, to lower the statutory exemption. The vast fields of income hitherto left untouched by the Commonwealth must be tapped if we are to finance and win this war. Commonwealth income tax has hitherto fallen very lightly on low incomes. I remind, honourable members that our collections from incomes below£400 have yielded only about £100,000 a year. Yeti t is the aggregate of the lower income groups which constitutes the great bulk of the nation's income. The total personal incomes amount to about £745,000,000. Incomes of over £1,000 account for only about £S5,0000,000, or 11 per cent, of that total. At the other end of the scale the income groups under £400 receive no less than £517,000,000, or 70 per cent, of the total. The middle incomes account for £143,000,000, or 19 per cent, of the total. When increased income tax becomes unavoidable, the accepted principle of ""ability to pay"" immediately suggests that the bulk of the increased burden should be thrown upon the higher incomes. But the capacity of income to carry increased Commonwealth taxation cannot be judged separately from the incidence of State taxation in the highest taxed State, which virtually sets the limit beyond which the Commonwealth cannot go. When the factor of State taxation is considered, it becomes obvious, upon examination, that the full weight of the increased Commonwealth taxation cannot reasonably be placed upon the higher incomes. While the greatest portion of the burden of this increased taxation will fall upon the wealthy sections of the community, it is unavoidable that the middle and lower incomes must be called upon to make further contributions and, under the present proposals, they will do so. I again remind honourable members of factsand figures that I have given elsewhere. The new rates are designed to produce £33,000,000 in a full year. i( Incomes over £1,000 will contribute £20,000,000, as compared with £9,800,000 under the present scale, and £6,200,000 1 under the 1939-40 scale. Middle incomes-£40 0 to £1,000-wil l contribute £8,000,000, as against £2,000,000 under the present scale and £1,300,000 under the 1939-40 scale. The lowest group-unde r £400-wil l be called upon to provide £5,000,000 as compared with £200,000 under the present scale and £100,000 under the 1938-40 scale. There is, as I have said, no escaping the costs of the war that has been forced upon us. Nevertheless, the Government proposes, as a measure of relief to the community, to institute a scheme of payment at the source, the benefits of which will be felt by the lower income earners mo3t of all. I turn now to the proposed scale of rates. The scale of personal exertion rates enacted in May last begins at 5d. in the £ 1 ; the proposed scale begins at Is. in the £1. This is a large increase, but it must be borne in mind that the various deductions so protect the taxpayer that the married man with one child, for instance, would not pay tax at the rate of Is. in the £1 on his actual income until that income is at least £400 a year. A single man without dependants will not reach the Is. rate of tax on his actual income until the income is rather more than £300. The scale now proposed rises rapidly from Is. in the £1 on a taxable amount of £300 to 5s. in the £1 at £1,500. The excess over £1,500 taxable income is taxed at a flat rate of 10s. in the £1. The rate of increase has to be gradually slackened as incomes rise, or it would lead to aggregate Commonwealth and State rates of over 20s. in the £1. This is achieved by the limitation imposed by the flat rate of 10s. The amounts of tax payable .to tbe Commonwealth at the new rates will be roughly comparable to the amounts of State tax payable in tbe highest taxed States and will be, especially, in the higher ranges, much greater than the amounts of State tax payable in the lowest taxed States. The relation between State and Commonwealth totals varies, of course, at different levels. It will be seen from the tables that the State ""taxes on a single man in the highest taxed State exceed the Commonwealth up to the £S00 mark. On the £900 to £5,000 incomes the Commonwealth taxes are the heavier of the two. In the highest ranges, however, the State taxes weigh so heavily on the taxpayer as to preclude the Commonwealth from imposing on that .field taxes of even equal severity. Honourable members are aware to what degree the imposition of Commonwealth taxation can be impeded by the States. The property scale has been determined on the same principles as were observed when theoriginal rates for 1940-41 were adopted. The more important personal exertion scale has been arrivedat with strict reference to the relative ability of different incomes to bear the taxation which the circumstances dictate; and the property scale has been derived from it by increasing the. rates u p to £1,200 by 25 per cent. The minimum property rate is thus Is. 3d. in the £1; and applies to taxable incomes up to £300. The rate rises steeply thereafter, and reaches 5s-. at £1,200. A flat rate of 10s-. in the £1 is imposed on the excess of the taxable income over £1,200* From that point'the difference between the personal exertion and the property rates tapers steadily off as the income increases, hut until the high levels of income are reached the property scale-remains substantially heavier than the personal exertion. The taperingof the scales, I may remind honourable members, is simply a recognition of the increasing, element of property in personal exertion in the higher rauges, and an. attempt to put the relative weightsof taxation on the two classes of income on the equitable footing that their similarity warrants. As I have said, the proposed rates are severe, but if they are weighed against our danger andour purpose; they will be seen in their true light as an honc3t attempt to face reality with clear eyes.. Mi: Fadden. Some comfort of the negative kind ma.y' be drawn from the realization that we are not alone in our labours and sacrifices for the common good. The comparison of the income taxes levied in this country and inNew Zealand is illuminating. It will be seen from the tables that on the -specified incomes the weight of income taxation is, except in a very few cases, heavier in New Zealand than it will be. in Australia even at the new rates. At the lowest levels there are very notabledisparities. Consider the taxpayer with; a dependent wife and one dependent child"" on an income of £250. In New Zealand,, he must pay £25 in taxation; in the highest taxed State of the Commonwealth, at that level, he pays £7, and that all inState taxation. At £300, the same taxpayer in Australia will be required to pay in State and Commonwealth taxes about £15, which is exactly half of what he would pay in New Zealand. I need not labour the point. No section of the community can escape the effects of the Avar and under the present proposals the income of companies will, also be called upon to bear an increased contribution to the revenue. The resolution provides for an increase of Is. in the flat rate of tax to be levied on the undistributed profits of public companies. The undistributed profits' tax was introduced in May of this year and has not yet beenapplied. The tax, as-honourable members will recall, corresponds generally with the tax on undistributed, profits of private companies which has been in operation for many years. Under the law as it stands at present, a. fiat rate of Is. in the £1 is prescribed as the tax on undistributed profits as determined under the act, but a revision of that rate has become necessary to conform with tlie upward trend of the rates of tax on the incomes of. individual taxpayers. High individual rates and a comparatively low rate of tax on undistributed profitswould induce shareholders to leave their profits in the company, and so avoid the heavy rates at which they would have to-pay as individuals. I propose to the-committee, therefore, that the rate of tax on the undistributed profits of public companies be raised to 2s. in the £1. The total income of companies which, is available £93,000,000, and it has been estimated that taxation, including State and overseas taxes, will appropriate some £32,000,000 out of that income. I need not enlarge -upon the important part which companies play in the industrial economy of the community, especially in war time. Obviously, they must not be subjected to a burden which will cripple them and hanmcr the conduct of the war. In the light of that consideration, I think come are of the nature of commuted rent,, honourable members will agree that at about 6s. Sd. in the £1 the taxation of comnanies approaches what may be regarded as the limit under present conditions. I have dealt with first things first. My remarks so far have related to divisions A, B, and H of the resolution, which are the divisions which, will most nearly interest the community in general. I must now offer honourable members a word or two in explanation of the other divisions. These, however, represent no departure from provisions contained in similar resolutions of 'previous years. Division0 provides the rates to be applied when taxpayers derive taxable income from personal exertion and from property In these cases the rate of tax"" on the separate amounts of each class of taxable income is ascertained as if the total income were derived wholly from personal exertion and wholly from property respectively. The effect of the application of division C is that the taxpayer 'pays tax on his taxable income from personal exertion and oroperty at the rate attributable to his total taxable income. In other words, to illustrate with an example, if the total composite income were £5,000, made up of £3,000 personal exertion income and £2,000 property income, the rate applied to both the £3,000' and the £2,000 is the rate applicable to the £5,000. DivisionD will operate when the averaging provisions of theassessment act are applied! Those provisions are limited to the assessments of primary producers. To describe the working of the averaging system briefly I may point out that the rate of tax on the taxpayer's taxable income is ascertained by averaging his taxable income over the year of income, and the four preceding years. The for taxation is about rate that is attributable to the amount of the taxpayer's average income over the five-year period is the rate of tax prescribed by division D to be paid by a. taxpayer on his taxable income of the year of income. In division E, an equitable basis is provided for the calculation of the tax' payable by a taxpayer who receives at premium upon the grant or assignment' of a lease. These lease premiums as inand, for this reason, the premiums are included in the taxable field by specialprovisions of tire assessment act. The full amount of the premium is, however,, taxed, as income of the year in which it: is received, and it will be readily appreciated by honourable members that the graduated rate of tax would cause a taxpayer to pay a greater, amount of tax than he would be called upon to 'pay if he received the amount of the lease premiumin the form of rent spread over the term, of the lease. This inequity is removed as ; far as possible by the assessment act which provides for the premium to be taxed at the rate that would be payable on a notional income ascertained by dividing the lease premium by one-half of the number of years in the term of the lease. Any taxable income which may be derived by the taxpayer in addition to the lease premiums is aggregated with the lease notional income to determine the rate of tax payable on his total taxable income. DivisionF provides for a minimum tax of 10s., which has been the minimum tax for many years. DivisionQ prescribes the rate of tax payable by trustees in those cases where, under the provisions of the assessment act, the trustee is assessed on the whole or portion of the income of a trust estate. A provision of this kind is necessaryto meet, the ease where a trustee of a trust"" estate is a company, otherwise the rate of tax applied to the taxable lincome derived by the trust estate would be the company rate instead of the graduated rate -payable by an individual. The third paragraph of the resolution; empowers 'the Commissioner to apply the rates of tax as set out in the resolution in those cases where it becomes necessary,. viz., in the'case of persons departing overseas, to' make assessments for the succeeding financial -yearbefore the rates bill for the financial"" year 194-1-42 is passed by Parliament. ' It is expectedthat new rates' -of tax 1 upon individuals will yield a total of £33,000,000 revenue for. the full year, of which £26,000,000 should be collected during the current financial year. To this is to be' added £1,700;000 to be obtained by the , abolitionof the company rebate. The revenue from .companies to be derived at the 2s. flat rate is estimated at £S,S0O,O00 for the -full year, of which £7,800,0000 should be collected during the current financial year. The additional tax to he imposed on undistributed profits will yield £2,400,000 revenue in a full year, of which £2,000,000 should be collected in 1940-41: Believing as I ' do that the nation is willing to take up the incscapable^burden of the-war, I commend the resolution to the committee.

The Speech delivered by the Governor General the other day was remarkable, not so much for the things that it said as for the things that it omitted to say. There was some mention of the war, a considerable amount of inspired, propaganda, and a reference to industrial disputes in this country; but there was no reference to any ameliorative social legislation that would give to the great mass of people in this country-the real Australians-an y reason to hope for an alleviation of their conditions. ' I shall not be able to deal, in the time allotted to me, with all the sins of omission or commits'ion of this Government; in fact, there is scarcely time for me even to adumbrate the subject. Unfortunately this Government won the last elections. It is a bad thing for Australia that a Labour government is not now administering the affairs of the nation. I make bold to suggest that, had the budget been presented a week or so before the election, and had the electors been supplied with the illuminating figures which were disclosed to us this afternoon, the members of the Government would have been in opposition to-day and the Leader of the Labour party ( Mr Curtin), as Prime Minister, would have been putting into effect this party's policy for the proper conduct of the war and for the enactment of all that legislation which this country needs if it is to be governed in the best interests of true Australians. For many years the United Australia hear !party and its variable companion, the United Country party, have governed or misgoverned the country, according to the point of view of the observer. Many of the things that should have been done in the nation's prosperous years were not attempted, so that to-day we find that, in contrast to many other countries, Aus. .

134,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [8.0],"for having some opinions and some philosophy. To the members of the United Australia party the capitalist system seems to be the best of all possible systems; in fact they regard it as the only practical system-on e in . which the Government must allow certain people to keep money which they allegedly earn, but which in fact they make by exploiting: the people they employ or the consumers to whom they sell their goods. That is an understandable view and, although we oppose it entirely, we recognize that the United Australia party can support its case with at least some show of reason. But nothing can be said in praise of the political "" United"" Country party on social and political problems. As has been amply demonstrated already in this Parliament, the policy of that party is one of "" catch a3 catch can"". It does not agree with anything in the political philosophy of the United Australia party and it certainly does not agree with the Labour party's views that the surplus value created by the wealth producers of the country belongs to those' producers and not to those who happen to own the machines of production. It continues to exist as a party only by the exercise of a system of political blackmail. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosovear) has suggested, members of the Country party always have a nuisance value and, in addition, they have almost a preternatural nuisance value and obtain whatever positions are available without giving good service in return. That is a fact, and now that you, Mr Speaker, have shed all your political prejudices and party predilections upon your elevation to the position of Speaker of this House and have begun to preside over our deliberations with charming impartiality, you w ill no doubt agree with some of' the strictures that I pass upon your quondam friends': No member of the Country party, in all the time that that organization has been in existence, has done anything to w in the respect or admiration of succeeding generations. monument to its ability and no administrative record'of which it might be proud.

I said that it was a misfortune for this country that the Labour party did not win the election. The United Australia party, or its organization outside this Parliament, won this election-o r rather stole it -by a series of activities of which it has no reason to be proud and which will poison the political atmosphere of this country if they be perpetrated at succeedingelections.' There were faked official statementsduring the ability to capitalize that election campaign. There were statements about Australian forces going into action in Egypt,, and,, in addition, there was loaded propaganda'' against the Labour party, designed to exacerbate the feelings of people whose loved ones were overseas. 'Then there were faked German broadcasts that were paid for by big busir ness interests and broadcast almost continuously fro m the B-class stations, in Victoria at any rate, from morning to night in an endeavour to poison the minds of"" the people against the Labour party, which I remind honourable members is the only really Australian partya party which hasnever been under the p a in f u l It has left no legislative necessity of changing its nanie-at election times in order to escape the wrath of the people.

In time of war, this Government has tremendous power to do much for either' good or evil ; it could almost completely mould the future of this country.

It is said that a new social order w ill follow the conclusion of the war. I do not believe that we shall have social justice from those who now sit in power, or from the financial interests which dictate their policy, cither while the war is in progress or at its termination. It was said that those who fought in the last war did so in order to make -the world safe for democracy and a world -fit for heroes to live in ; yet that conflict wa3 succeeded by the worse -depression in history.

140,". Mr Cinxwell,","I have not long beenand who have done so well for themselves while thousands of persons have suffered cruel hardships. The conditions of the people arc becoming, not better but relatively worse. A statement that I prepared some time ago for a select committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria gives a summary of the output of factories and their value. It is an illuminating document, which shows that the workers are not receiving from industry to-day the percentage that' they received a few years ago. For example, in 1924-25, the total value of raw materials, power, fuel, etc., in this country, was £233,000,000. Salaries and wages accounted for £S1,000,000, whilst interest, profit, etc., totalled' £65,000,000. hear from some honourable member The proportion of added value which wages bore to that total was 55.3 per cent:, whereas the figure in. respect of interest and profit was only 44.7 per cent. In the succeeding years the per1 centage taken out by wages and salaries grew progressively less, whilst the percentage in respect of interest, profit, & c , the presentone is an honourable gentleman inevitably grew progressively larger. In 1928-29, the respective figures were 54.3 per cent, and 45.7 per cent. In 1929-30 they were 52.8' per cent, and 47.2 per cent. In the depression year, 1932-33"", the withdrawal by wages and salaries was less than that of interest and profit, the respective figures being 49.8 per cent', and 50.2 percent. Only after the basic wage was increaseda couple of years ago did salaries and wages begin to show a greater percentage than profit and in terest. 52per cent., and 4S-. per cent., and in 1938-39 they were 52.4 per cent and 47.6 per cent. We who speak for the workers of this country can prove that in 1938-39 they received' 3 per cent. Ies9 of the total value of production than they, received in 1924-25, and that interest and profit -accounted for 3 per cent, more, endowment which was introduced by a with tlie result that there has been an accumulation of big incomes on one-side of the river and' slums and poverty on the other side.

I have no doubt that the present, feelings of the' honourable member are slightly different from what they would have been hadhe remained in the Ministry. As the result of"" a seriesof unfortunate accidents, another honourable gentleman was catapulted into tlie position of Treasurer, and the honourable member for Barker was left lamenting. I shall be glad to opposite in. due course,, the reason for the fact that the two "" tragic treasurers "" of this Commonwealth have come from the ranks of the Country party; the first was the gentleman who helped to precipitate the last unfortunate, and calamitous depression a decadeago, and of the same political persuasion who has produced a-budget equally deflationary in its effects, which will precipita te . another depression. I remind the -House that the ill effects of deflation,, as of inflation; are cumulative; both deflation, and inflation can be equally disastrous to the community. I have said that this Government has done nothing to implement a scheme of family allowances, child endowment, and In 1937-38 the figureswere marriage loans. I have . instanced the conditions' under which the great mass .of the people are sinking, because they do not receive their rightfu l share from the general well of production, and are therefore not able to provide for those who are dependent on them. There is in New South Wales a system of child Labour government and has been in operation since 1927. There is another scheme of child endowment or family allowance in the federal public service.

Professor Lodewyckz made the following observations on the subject:However, 60011 after the National Socialist _ party took office early in 1933, energetic measures were adopted in an endeavour to stop tlie downward trend. These nvasures may be summed up under the following four headings:(1) Direct financial advantages to large families and to newly-married couples. (2) Seduction of unemployment. . (3) Intensive propaganda aiming at a new outlook amongst the whole people. (4) Stricter enforcement of the law prohibiting the practice of abortion. The result -has been a substantial increase in the birth-rate. Tlie numbers of birth's registered for the years 1933 to 1937 are as follows:year. 1933 11)34 1935 1930 1937 It will be seen that about 300,000 wore children ure torn in Germany to-day than during the last few years before the National Socialist party took over the reins of government. So that, assuming that the figures for 1938 arc about the same as those for 19311 and 1.937, during the five years 1934-3.8 German mothers have given the Fatherland 1,500,000 more children than would have been, the case if conditions as prevailed before 1933 had continued. The record of Australia in relation to the birth-rate is such as to demand serious consideration. Our birth-rate fell from 4.3 per 1,000 of the population in 1S62 to 1.7 per 1,000 in 1987. The effect can be expressed in another way: In 1911, when Australia had a population of roughly 4,500,000, more children were born than in 1938, when our population was approaching 7,000,000. This problem cannot be ignored, and we cannot procrastinate in. dealing with it: if.' we wish to continue to progress as a white nation.. Several State governments and. I am glad to sa.y, also-some municipalities, have done something to cope with the position. As the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) well knows, the Melbourne City Council has done a great deal of good work in this connection, although only 10 of its 33 members belong to the Labour party. The council has improved the conditions of mothers and children by establishing a number of public health centres and kindergartens throughout the areas' under its control. 1 am sure that what has already been accomplished in this regard will be an inspiration to the council to do more in the future. With the help of the Commonwealth Government, the council has established a. child welfare centre in my constituency of Melbourne, and good results have been achieved by it. It is also subsidizing many denominational kindergartens. But a great deal more must bo done in on population problems this way if the nation is to prosper. Surely it is not too much to ask that steps should be taken to do for Australian women and children at least as much as was being done before the war for the German women and children-. I Leave to continue given.""] I thank Births honourable members for their courtesy. .. .. 971,f;()0 .. . . 1,198,000 Family endowment allowances need to .. .. . . 1,204,000 .. 1,297,000 be supplemented'. I favour, as a comple.. .. . . 1,2.70,000 mentary measure, the granting of marriage loans. The young people of this country cannot marry at' as early an age as is desirable from a national point of view unless they be gr-anted some financial assistance. In 1939 action was taken in France to give financial aid to young married people, but, unfortunately for that country, it was too late to be of much value. Long before the outbreak of war schemes had been put into operation in Germany and Italy to assist newly married couples. Arrangements were made in. those countries for interest-free loans of from £100 to £200 to be made to young married couples. It was provided that 25 per cent, of the. loan should be cancelled if , in the first year of its currency, a child was born. The remainder of the loan was car/belled progressively as additional children were born, and it was completely liquidated by the time the fourth child was born. No such government scheme is in. operation in Great Britain, but. the employers of that country have done a little better in this regard than the employers of Australia have done, for in certain areas around London, and in other parts of England., private schemes provide for the payment of allowances varying, from 5s. to Is. a week in respect of dependent children. In one case £10 per annum is paid as'a child allowance. Apparently the employers of Australia have not been sufficiently educated on .this subject to take any such 'action: At any rate they have not' be.e'ri sufficiently patriotic to realize that their'failure to disburse-a 'certain amount! of money in child allowances must, in tlie long run, act adversely in respect of both themselves and their 'children. I consider.it proper to chide the Government on its failure to. allow the maternity allowance, colloquially known as the "" baby bonus'-', to be paid in all cases. The allowance is payable to-day only in .respect of .births in families where tbe income does not exceed £4 a week. That limitation is a negation of the intention that led to the introduction of this legislation. The Fisher Labour Government, which introduced .the maternity allowance, intended that it should have general application, .but owing to the crass stupidity of certain persons in influential circles at that time the scheme was attacked as "" a sop to profligacy"". It was also condemned by other unfortunate epithets, and denounced as a measure which would result in the breaking of the marriage tie. As a matter of historical fact, the maternity allowance is known to have been of very great assistance to the mothers of this community from the very inception of the scheme, and it is regrettable that a government which saw fit to make substantial remissions of land tax should have revised the conditions applicable to the maternity allowance in such a way as to make it appear to be a charity and not a right. The mothers of this country are entitled to the maternity allowance, even more than the judges on our High Court bench are entitled to their pensions. A judge should be able to accumulate during a long life at least enough wealth to enable him to spend his declining years in case. It cannot be suggested that he would need a retiring pension as much as a mother may need an allowance at the time her children are born. I appreciate the fact that other honourable members may wish to participate in this debate, feeling it to be their pleasure and honour, if they are members of the Opposition, to direct attention to the short-comings of the Government. shall therefore confine my subsequent remarks to one subject. Mr Calwell. During the election campaign we saw many pictures in the newspapers and elsewhere of Mr Winston Churchill, the Prime' Minister of G reat Britain, in juxtaposition to Mr Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia. In association with-these pictures were slogans exhorting the people to vote for our great Empire leaders. In passing, may 1 say that as the campaign progressed towards hill showed him as becoming more and more stooped--presumabl y because he was required to carry the Prime Minister of Australia, as well as the burdens which were properly his own. It was not pointed out that the views of the Prime Minister of Great Britain were in direct conflict with those of the'Prime Minister of Australia on the important subject of land taxation. I do not see. any indication in the budget, nor was any statement made in the Prime Minister's policy speech, that the Government intended to call upon large land-holders to bear their fair share of the burden of financing the war, I remind honourable members that under the system of graduated land tax formerly in operation, two-thirds of the impost fell upon the owners of. big city properties, for the tax was levied only, on holdings of an unimproved capital value in excess of £5,000. The farming community contributed only a small proportion of the tax, for only farmers with properties of an unimproved capital value in excess of £5,000, and on which improvements to the value of from £2,000 to £3,000 had been made were liable! Mr Winston Churchill has very definite views on the subject of land monopoly, and he is reported to have saidLAND, WHICH IS A NECESSITY Oh"" Land monopoly is not tlie only monopoly which exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies-it is a perpetual monopoly, and is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. Land, which is a necessity of human existence, which is the original source of all wealth, which is strictly limited in extent, which is fix.ed in geographical position-land , I say, differs from all other forms of property in 'these primary and fundamental ""conditions. .

We have to change the system and we can do it very easily. I commend to the attention of honourable members clause 504 of the. report of the Monetary and Banking Commission, which says that the Commonwealth Bank can supply credit without. interest. We must fight this war with Hitlei-'s own methods. He does not go cap in hand to borrow £2S,000,000or even £38,000,000 or £4S,000,000. He takes what he needs, and we shall have to «lo the same, through the Commonwealth Bank. Sir Denison Miller who financed the last war-the war to make tlie world safe for democracy-provide d . £320,000,000 through the Commonwealth Bank and after the war said that he could find another £320,000,000 for the arts of peace if it were necessary. I do not subscribe to the proposal for the formation of a national government. It sounds well to say, "" Form a national government to win the war"", and it looks all right, but. let us examine it analyletter of resignation from the Country tically. In my opinion the proposal for the formation of a national government would be nothing more than a trick whereby the Government parties would implement their policy and have the Labour party take the responsibility. The Labour party cannot join with the Government parties. Our party and theirs are as opposite as the poles. The Labour party , is intensely constructive; the Government parties are not. The Labour party is dynamic and the Government static. and the Government stagnant. The Labour party sets out to give a fair deal and equal opportunity to all, but the Government parties stand for the privileged class. The two cannot join. The Labour party believes that there is no wealth but human life, and the Government that a certain privileged class has the right to profiteer. That class is still profiteering and, in case I should be charged with exaggeration, I point out that on the 31st January this year, less than five months after the declaration of war, there were 107 additional millionaires in England. No wonder the people there changed their Prime Min. ister. Now, I do not want to say any3Ir. Boh er. thing about Mr Chamberlain. It would be out of place to do so. De mortuis nil nisi bonwm. Say nothing but good of the -dead. He did his best, but be was a victim of circumstance. Well, . they changed their Prime Minister to Mr Churchill and members of the. Labour party were brought into the cabinet and given carte blanche. They are doing remarkably well in winning the war, but we of the Australian Labour party cannot form a union with the parties opposite. . You cannot amalgamate two incompatibles, or reconcile two elements which are irreconcilable, and the Labour party cannot join with the Government parties to form a national government. The Government is a conglomerate consisting of the United Australia party and the United Country party. I suggest that they be called the benighted partya doubly benighted party. I shall give to the House something appropriate to the occasion. The 'honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) in his party, said that there were within that party everlastingintrigue and manoeuvring for party advantage. If that be so, how could we of the Labour party go in with a lot like that? It would be like trying to mix oil and water. We are strongly opposed to petrol rationing, because, to' save ithe small amount of £4,000,000, we lose something like £40,000,000. That is being penny wise andi pound foolish, and it throws out of gear the highly important transport industry. That policy is a great mistake. Labour is progressive Tlie wheat industry is in a hazardous position. The 70,000 peopleengaged in it owe £150,000,000. The wool-growers are in almost the same plight. They owe £170,000,000. The tree is known by its fruit and the party by its work. How, therefore, could We join with a party which has muddled up things so badly? AlthoughI appreciate the courtesy of honourable members in giving new members precedence in this debate, I did not intend to speak, desiring to reserve what I had to say for the budget debate. I am fully in accord with the sentiment expressed by the mover of the Addressin-Reply, the honourable., member for Denison( Mr Beck) that we are",42,Human Existence
146,"Mr Morgan (Reid) [8.57],","here to get on with the job, and the budget is, I should say, the -job that we have to do. For some reason, of which we on this side have a f a ir idea, the Government does not now seem to be so anxious to go ahead with the budget as it wa3 before As we are not getting on with the job, it is an appropriate time for the House to consider something in the way of constitutional reform, particularly reform of the procedure of this Housei n order to make it more workable. The best way to do that is to ensure that members on the Government side have a job to do. Judging by the debates and question time, all the activity seems'to be on this ""side and all the apathy on the other.' Perhaps that is right, because the Government parties represent people of wealth whereas werepresent those people who have wrongs to be righted. Perhaps we might take advantage of the array of legal talent now in the House to achieve something in the way of constitutional reform. I remind honourable members that we have with us the honourable member for Barton( MrE v a t t ) , who made a notable sacrifice by the statutory limit . In these matters we stepping down from a lucrative position on the H i g h Court Benchi n order to serve his country in this House. I hope that an early opportunity w ill be taken to utilize his services. One way in which that could be done would be by setting up a committee to deal with constitutional reform, with the idea of making Parliament more workable. Let us follow the example of legislatures in other parts of the world, particularly in the United States of America and New Zealand, where every member of the rank and file participates in the administrative, as well as the legislative, work of parliament. In the^e countries, private members assist the Ministers in their administrative duties. We should adopt more extensively the committee system, particularly for the handling of regulations issued under A t the present time, these regulations are turned out like sausages from a machine, and by the time they come under the notice of honourable members it is too late to do anything about them. They should go before a committee for consideration before they become law. I also maintain that the plank of the Labour party's platform, which provides for the recall should be adopted, so that every member of the House would be at all times subject to the will of the people. Then, if . a member were not doing his job, he could be immediately recalled. Those members who did their job properly could be given a lon'gter term of office, and in this way we might avoid recurring and expensive general elections. I hope that the Minister for' the In terior (Senator Foll) w ill honour his undertaking to amend the Electoral Act in respect of election expenses. TheM in ister stated that the act, as at present framed, is farcical and hypocritical, in that it requires members of Parliament to make a palpably false declaration regarding their election expenses. This applies particularly to some honourable members on the other side of the House, who incur tremendous expense in paying for huge advertisements, and the erection of great electioneering hoardings. Obviously, their expenses run into thousands of pounds, instead of the amount of £100 which is should seek to set a higher standard. We should, in fact, set an example to the rest of the community. The budget which has just been introduced is the most calamitous, deflationary and destructive budget ever brought before Parliament. The Speech of the Governor General, and now the budget, indicate clearly the Government's state of mind, which is purely negative. There is nothing constructive or creative about the Government's programme; it is entirely lacking in vision and inspiration. It is the expression of capitalistic economy and orthodox finance. The taxation proposals are directed against the low wage-earner and the small proprietary companies, but monopolistic concerns, the holders of unearned increment in land, the owners of watered the National Security Act. stocks, and those in receipt of inheritances, are left practically untouched. That shows just where the Government stands. The scheme w ill break down under its own weight, and under the huge weight of debt. The purchasing power of the people -will vanish. The national debt is at present £1,300,000.000; before the war is finished, if the Government continues its present loan policy, the national debt will be £3,000,000,000'. Half the national income is absorbed in defraying, the cost of the present Avar, and of the last Avar; if we continue on the present lines', soon tbe AA'hole of our national income AA'ill be absorbed for Avar purposes.. o^Then the people -will bo aroused, a«d"" some better financial system Avill take the place of that HOAV in operation. Sooner or later ,the Government will be forced to use the credit resources of the nation, both in Avar-time and in peace. The old order of capitalist economy is doomed. Even UOAV its supporters are like the Christmas poultry, which, know subconsciously that their fate is sealed, and live in dread of the fatal day. The attitude of the proponents of orthodox finance reminds me of the attitude of the orthodox members of tbx medical profession Avho, more than 200 years ago,, denounced Dr. Harvey for asserting that the blood circulated throughout the body. He Avas universally condemned, and died in poverty, yet Avithin twenty years of his death his discovery Avas accepted by every one. I believe that Avhat is now propounded by some of our more advanced economists, and by Senator Darcey Avill, before long, be the generally accepted economic system in all enlightened countries. The honourable member for Denison said that the people of NeAv South Wales must have taken leaA^e of their senses to vote as they did in the recent election. He reminds me of the man m the lunatic asylum Avho thought that every one else Avas as crazy as himself, and invited them all to come inside. When the honourable member has been here a little longer, and has thought a little more on tins subject, he Avill realize that true sanity is to be found on this side of the House. The Government's attitude toAvards the Avar is also negative. All the time Ave seem to be waiting for some one else to move. We are Avaiting to see what Germany Avill do, Avhat Italy Avill do, and what Japan will doI maintain that it is for us to take the initiative, and to plan a campaign that Avill bring victory to us. The Government seems to expect that the war will be over in a year or two> hut hoAv can it be sure of that? The GoAlr. 3forgan. vernment does not appear to visualize the possibility that the Avar may go on for a much longer period. We knoAv that fifteen years Avas occupied in ridding Europe of Napoleon, and \ve should recognize that it may take as long to clean up the mess that Hitler has made. And Ave have to deal, not only Avith Hitler, hut also Avith the Avhole philosophy for which he stands, and the system Avhich supports hirn, Avith its tentacles spread throughout tbe Avorld. We should, even at this stage, define our peace aims. Mention has been made of the fact that in Great Britain member.? of the Labour party participate in the Government. That fact Avas considered by the Labour party here Avhen proposals Ayere put forward for a national government. I point out, hoAvever, that a divergence of opinion has arisen in Great Britain recently. Mr Ernest Bevin, Minister for Labour in the British Government, has emphasized the need to plan for peace. He said that our purpose should be to achieve social security, but immediately he made that statement others, Avho are politically opposed to him, took him to task. They made it clear that his opinion Avas not to be taken as the opinion of the War Cabinet, and that it Avas not desirable to talk about peace, and the conditions that would! folloAv the attainment of peace, until Britain looked like Avinning the Avar. I disagree entirely with that. Now is the time to define our war aims, to give the people a lead, to give them inspiration, and to give them something to fight for. Let me quote the advice given by the Government's own guest, Mr Noel CoAvard, AVIIO, I understand, has come here at the Commonwealth's expense to teach us about Avinning the war. In a recent broadcast, he saidThe hour has struck for a co-operative human civilization. This is no longer Britain's war. or even a new war; it is a continuation' of. tlie struggle between two cultures. It is two views of life battling for the development of mankind. I do not think it is necessary to point out Avhich A'iew is held by honourable members on this side of the House. Mr Co-Avard Avent onWe have two aims-to win the war, and to win the after-war. I am certain that"" this war is not to be won by force alone. It is to be won by belief in a Christian anddemocratic way of life, and by courage-no t ordinary courage, but moral courage, ami personal initiative to use it . Perhaps it would have been better if Mr Coward, instead of lecturing the people of Australia, had lectured the Government of Australia on its duties. ""We should not leave this problem to others to solve. Only recently, the secretary of the Local Government Association of New South Wales said-^Wc are visualizing Australia as a great nation after the war, and we believe that To fault of the Commonwealth Government prepare for it now is as essential as the immediate task of winning the war. We should not leave matters of this kind to the local bodies; they should be taken up by the Government itself. The Prime Minister has pointed out that there are. some difficulties in the way of Australia's acceptance of representation on an Imperial War Cabinet, but I see no obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth's participation in an Imperial War Conference representative of all seetions of the'British Commonwealth of Nations convened to lay down definite plans for the conduct of the war and the terms and ideals of the peace. Such a conference might properly be held in Canada which may be regarded for the time being as the centre of the Empire. India, which is playing its part so well in the Empire war effort and, for obvious reasons, Eire, should be invited to send representatives to such a conference. I go further and suggest that the United States of America should be invited to send a representative in the capacity of an observer. To such a conference it may be possible for each of the Dominions to send representatives, not only of the Government, but also of the Opposition. Australia might very well follow the lead given by Canada in regard to aviation. Training Scheme 80 air schools have been established in Canada. In addition that dominion is building 100 naval vessels and IS large merchantmen for Britain. What is there in the Governor General's Speech or the budget speech to show that Australia is playing its part in the Empire war effort as the sister dominion of Canada is doing? The Fisher Labour Government laid the foundations of our Australian Navy, and had successive governments continued to add to our naval strength and maintained the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, the position of this country would, have been very different from what it is to-day. .The present Government has acknowledged -that it has no shipbuilding policy and has refused to use its efforts to induce the New South Wales Government to re-open the Walsh Island Dockyard. >! that Walsh Island Dockyard was closed down. the States can do nothing in this direction without the assistance of the Commonwealth, and I have not heard it suggested that the Commonwealth Government has offered to subsidize any of the States for the encouragement of the shipbuilding industry. For the last 25 years, anti-Labour governments have been in office in the Commonwealth and State spheres; they have sown the wind and we are now reaping the whirlwind. Never was a time more appropriate than the present for the putting into effect of a sound migration policy; but the present Government has no plans in this .direction. Tho first line of defence in any country is a virile and healthy population. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Hughes) has often said that the best immigrant to this country is a young Australian. What has the Government done to provide subsidies for mothers as an encouragement to parenthood? The totalitarian countries, realizing the need for encouraging the natural growth of the population, have subsidized motherhood. No matter how much we may disagree with them in most things, we have to Under the Empire Air admire their attempts to provide for mothers and young children. Only a few days ago I read in the press that of 112,000 children still in London, 92,000 are without any form of education. It was said that more than 100 schools have been bombed, and that many of these children have been described, as London's "" dead end kids "". They are being bred into strange and dangerous ways of life in the new underworld beneath London's streets. They do not go to school, but during the day they watch like gangsters",43,Human Existence
147,Mr Archie Camekon,It was not the,46,Human Existence
148,Mr Morgan,"It is obvious thatover their families' shelter pitches. Their only playgrounds are the escalators and platforms of tube stations and the clingy corners and holes of ordinary shelters below the streets. Surely provision should have been made in the budget to 'bring as many as possible of these children to this country. We know of the dairgcrs of steamer travel during these anxious*days, but the alternative to offering them shelter in the Dominions is to allow them to continue a perilous existence which will inevitably result in their ruin. These children might very well become the young Australians of the future. The United. States of America might, be asked to assist in their transport to this country. Even Hitler himself, bloodthirsty though he is, might be willing to allow the children to come here unmolested. ""We should also offer shelter to the unfortunate children in occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands, who are still subjected to the horrors and dangers of war. The unfortunate children of these countries look toAustralia as a haven of refuge. Under the benign influence of our glorious sunshine they would quickly be restored to health and happiness. No reference was made in the Governor General's Speech to a national health and pensions scheme. I had a great deal of admiration for the attitude taken by the present Prime Minister when, as a. member of the Lyons Ministry, he resigned his Cabinet post because of the failureof the Lyons Government to give effect, to its promise to introduce a national insurance scheme. The right honourable gentleman is now at the helm of the ship of State and is in a position to give effect, to his pledge to bring about such a scheme. But what do we find? In spite of the fact that the machinery for the carrying out of a health and pensions scheme is already in existence,, not one word is said about it by the present Government. When the experts advising the Lyons Government pointed out that to give effect, to the scheme it proposed would £2,000,000, they were told that"" the Government had not. the money to go ahead withit. Although that Government could not find £2,000,000 for the health of the people, in a year or twoits Mr Morgan. successor in office committed this country to an expenditure of £400,000,000 for war purposes. The standard of bealth of the people of any country is the measure of its real wealth. In planning for the future we have to bear in mind what happened after the last war. The loss of life in that great conflict was greatly exceeded by tlie loss of life as the result of the epidemics of pneumonic influenza, which raged in -many countries soon after the war was over. The Government should subsidize the medical profession to instruct tlie people in better ways of living and in improving their diet. The Estimates this year provide £20;000 for a physical fitness campaign. Thai is a mere bagatelle. According to experts, Australia requires an expenditure of £20,000,000 a year for the provision of homes for the people and for slum clearance. The whole of that money could be provided by the Commonwealth Bank at a very low rate of interest. According to the London Economist, it ""costs only one-half of 1 per cent, for the book-keeping and clerical work associated with the provision of credits, and if the Commonwealth Bank charged* 1 per cent, on advances for housing it coull make 100 per cent, profit on the deal. But people who want, homes are prepared to pay a much higher rate of interest for home building. In New South Wales to-day people pay as much as o or 6 per cent, on advances for home building. The profit of from 4' to 4^ per cent, which the Commonwealth Bank. could make on advances for home building could be utilized for the development of tourist resorts, of which there is such a diversity in this country and these could bethrown open to the people to enable a healthy, sturdy race to be built up in Australia. In merely proposing to setup costly industrial tribunals the Government shows no initiative in its industrial policy. Conciliation committees serve a very useful purpose, but if the Government wishes to prevent strikes -it must require an expenditure of first go to the root cause of industrial upheavals. I propose now to quote from an article which appeared in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald under the heading "" Strikes in Time of War. Some Causes andRemedies. ""Workshop Nerves, War Strain"". The writer, an industrial authority, saysUnion officials claim that the pressure has been so great on the war workers that it is humanly impossible for them to keep going. Many, they say, have reached the stage of collapse, ' i heir nerves have become frayed and on the slightest pretext they are prepared to down tools. Strikes to them now mean a welcome holiday which they can enjoy in the certain knowledge that when the strike concludes their job will be still awaiting them. Because of the shortage of skilled labour they have become indispensable for the first time in their lives. Only a few days ago the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) condemned the workers at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow for going out on strike as a gesture of sympathy with a man who had been dismissed. Although the .honourable gentleman is in charge of. the administration of the conciliation committees, he castigated the strikers as irresponsible before he ascertained the facts of the case. Mr Martin, the Minister for Local Government in New South Wales, after inspecting slums and humpy camps at Lithgow, recently, saidThere are certainly some rotten houses here. It is shocking that people should have to live in stables. He saw slums a few yards from the chief thoroughfare of Lithgow, at Oakey Park, and at the Woollen Mills Terrace, and visited a camp of bag humpies at the Pine Forest. .1 also refer honourable members to a letter written by none other than the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), who seconded the Addressin-Bcply published in the Sydney Morning Herald not long ago. The honourable gentleman wroteThe whole community should be indebted to the Sydney Morning Herald for the articles, photographs and leading articles entitled "" New War-time Slums "", published recently in your journal. I do not propose, to say anything with regard to Glen Davis, as that is in a somewhat different category from' Lithgow, insofar as there may be some difference of opinion as to where responsibility lies. But there can be none as to Lithgow. Responsibility lies in the-hands of the Ifederal Government. There appears to be a failure to understand that the munition workers .of Australia in a total war arc just as important as the soldiers. Tliey are the ""civilian fighters"" in our war effort. Not for one instant would the public have tolerated the housing of our soldiers in the various camps under such appalling conditions as you disclose. Yet these men and women of L it hgow are performing a function not one whit less important than the soldiers. Just as wars are won on the ba-ttlefront, so they are lost on the home front by the failure to produce adequate munitions, the discontent of tiie people, and the loss of morale in the nation. It would be interesting to know whether any recommendations have been made to the -'Commonwealth Government in the past, few months to meet this' situation, and if such recommendations have been made why they have not been implemented. If they 'were made, 1 then whoever is responsible for the failure to carry them out should be discharged from public office. It was because of such matters that some of us stood at the laet election so that Our voices might be heard in Parliament. I hope that honourable members on this side of the House will be aware of something more'suibstantial than the voices of Ministers in regard to this problem. We want to see. something concrete done immediately for the unfortunate people who are living under the conditions I have described at Lithgow and other places where"" munitions work is being carried out. Australia was once considered to be leading the world in regard to industrial legislation, but to-day it is far behind other countries. That is due, no doubt, to the fact that anti-Labour governments have been in office for most of the last quarter of a century When a Labour government held office for a short time the country made great strides under the stimulus of good industrial legislation. To-day, legislation in Venezuela provides that all persons in public and private employment, with the exception of a few categories, shall be granted one day's holiday pay for every month of employment. In Chile, most manual workers enjoy up to sixteen days annual leave on full pay according to the time they have worked during the year. Similar privileges exist in Finland, Latvia and Peru. But in New -South Wales, only 239 of approximately 500 awards include holiday provisions. The Government should go right to the cause of these industrial troubles in order to find a solution of the problem. On the one hand, big profits are being made; on the other, an exhausted working class is suffering becaure of the absence of proper industrial legislation. Those elements are likely to cause trouble at any time, but they are much more menacing in time of war. There is only one effective way to overcome the difficulties I have outlined. That is to give to the workers a voice in the control of industry and a share in its profits. When big munitions contracts are banded over to private enterprise, the workers who are carrying on in those industries should share in their profits. The Government has the power under the National Security Regulations to provide that workers in each industry engaged in munitions production shall have the right to elect their own representatives to the boards of directors of the companies concerned. Co-operation in industry and other avenues of life is essential in a soundlybased democracy. Co-operative farming is a snbject I commend to the earnest consideration of members of the Country party. Instead of asking for subsidies for primary industries those honourable gentlemen should investigate the cooperative farming schemes that are being conducted successfully h i other parts of the world, particularly in the Scandinavian countries. A solution for the problems of primary production can be found in those schemes. I urge the Government to take immediate action to improve housing conditions, because the need for reform is pressing. I direct attention to the first report of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board of Victoria on the conditions that exist in certain Victorian cities. That report was on similar lines io the report made by the Housing Board of New South Wales, whioh stated that in the metropolitan area of Sydney alone there were 30,000 sub-standard houses, not even fit for animals to live in , much less human beings. given.-\ appointed by the Victorian Government statedThe hoard records its horror and amazement at. the deplorable conditions under which these thousands of men. women, and children are compelled to exist. That statement referred to the inhabitants of over 7,000 houses in Melbourne. The report continuedHundreds of houses contain small rooms, low and water-stained ceilings, damp and decaying walls, leaking roofs and rotten floors. Many are badly lighted, rat and vermin infested, and without proper Inadequate sunlight, dampness, and lack of drainage render these shelters (which are not worthy of the name, of dwelling) veritable Mr Morgan. plague spots, and heavy toll is being taken of the health of the occupants, particularly of the women and children. I am, sorry that I have to refer to these gruesome details, but I am impelled to do so by a recent statement of the former Minister for Social Services( Sir Frederick Stewart.)I am pleased to notice that tlie conscience of the community is being aroused by the press campaign for better housing. This will make it easier for us to handle the question. I intend to use my position to see it done. IfI am to remain Minister for Social Services, I am not going on vacation for the duration of the war. I am more concerned about arousing the conscience of the Government, because the conscience of the community has become almost, numb owing to the lack of attention to this grievous problem. Statements such as that made by the Minister sound all right, but we want action taken in order to destroy the evil. I refer again to a section of the report made by the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board of Victoria These houses, in many cases, are erected ore "" pocket-handkerchief"" allotments of inadequate depth and with meagre frontages to lanes, rights-of-way, so-called ""places"", alley ways and even in wide.streets, and are literally falling to pieces owing to neglect, decay and old age. Land has been so avariciously used in some instances that two or three houses have been erected on an area which was originally intended to be the back yard of a house facing a major street . . . . In addition, the rents of these so-called houses are being progressively increased to such an extent that many families, in order to pay the rents demanded, have be07i reduced to a state of semi-starvation. In some slum areas children arc fed by church organizations while charit[Leave to continue able institutions are called upon to supply The report of the board family necessities where the income of the family is insufficient to procure them. Failure to pay the rent inevitably ends in eviction of the family and the consequent heart breaking struggle to find another shelter . . . . Hidden behind wide spacious streets there are slum pockets which are hot-beds of depravity and disease. In many houses, dilapidation of structure is such that bugs and other vermin cannot be eradicated. These houses are infected to such an extent as to be unfit .for human habitation. The ravages of vermin on the occupants cause indescribable physical discomfort and distress, particularly to infants and little children. Many prefer to sleep out of doors, on verandah floors, and in back }*ards rather than endure ventilation. tlie distressing torment of vermin in the house. The rat menace is also prevalent in all of the congested areas, particularly where factories and' stables have been established in tlie vicinity of houses. Residents complain that they aire unable to combat this nuisance, which is being aggravated by insanitary conditions in the vicinity. Lack of facilities for food storage in these low-grade houses exposes food to constant contamination by rats. Housewives are driven to storing (food-stuffs in well-secured bags suspended from ceilings in kitchens and wash-houses. Many men, a large number of whom are returned soldiers, have expressed very forcibly the resentment and indignation they feel at being housed in such, miserable hoveis. The burden falls most heavily on those least able to bear it. The women, who are unable to escape from their sordid surroundings despite their intense and heroic struggle to maintain a state of cleanliis the only option, I am afraid that is what ness, and the children, suffer most. These unwholesome conditions sap the physical fitness of the children and develop their mental processes along lines of abnormal ' quickwittedncss in the lowest ideals.

It is possible for Australia to be blockaded and for aeroplanes to set fire to standing wheat crops. Although production has already been restricted by drought, the Government advises farmers"" to restrict their output still further. That may be sound advice, but if the Government were to carry its logic further, it would advocate a reduction of interest rates. Why is interest regarded as sacred ? Tho granting of a moratorium has been, suggested, but that would beimei;ely.a j)a)liative and not. a solution .of. this problem. A reduction of interest charges would be equivalent to an increased price -forwheat. includes the establishment of a mortgage, branch of the Commonwealth Bank which would take over the mortgage of a farmer who was paying a high rat.e.of interest. To-day, .a farmer who goes to a private bank for an advance of only £20 or £50 does uot get even a kind look.. The private banks should be told that as they have refused to make advances on wheat, which is a national asset, the nation will take over the . wheat of .the farmers and hold their land, as security. If that were done, the farmer need pay only 3 per cent, instead of 6 per.cent, interest. That would be equivalent, to an additional 6d.. a .bushel to the farmer for his wheat. This, is no ""wild cat"" proposal. Adverse seasons have .forced many farmers to leave their holdings in the Horsham district. Business people can no longer give credit to the farmers, with the result that many of them are leaving for the cities. The concentration of war industries in the cities is not only dangerous because of the possibility of attack by an enemy; it is also having a serious effect on the development of country districts. The following letter from the Horsham Town Council emphasizes this point:I am directed to inform yon that at the last meeting of the council a resolution was passed dcpicTing the fact that all the important war industries are being centralized in the capital cities. Apart from the fact that this action will spell disaster to country towns, we feel that it is not in the best interests of the national ell'ort. One has only to consider what is happening in 'Europe to rea'ize that it would be a comparatively an enemy to bomb our principal war industries out of existence situated as they arc in a few towns only, all located on the coastline. Thed r if t of country people to the metropolis is alarming, and is so serious that unless checked it must ultimately end in a major disaster. The council trusts that you will urge upon the Government the wisdom' of altering this state of affairs. It should not be necessary for me to direct the attention of the Government to this matter. The drift of large numbers of people from country districts to the cities is an economic loss to Australia as a whole. These men, who are as much ; skilled workers as are skilled tradesmen in our cities, are out of their proper element as residents of cities. Their skill is in agricultural pursuits. I fear that if conThe Labour party's policy siderable numbers of farmers be driven off their holdings there will be an aggregation of land in big estates. After the war, land values may rise because of a demand for land for tbe repatriation of soldiers. That may be the motive underlying the policy that is in operation to-day. Should this drift, to the cities continue, it will constitute a major disaster. Far better to tackle this problem now than wait until too late! The only logical thing to do is to give assistance to the farmers now, through the Commonwealth Bank, in order that they may carry on. I sincerely trust that the mistakes in connection with the repatriation of soldiers which were made after the last war will not be repeated when this war is over. It was the squatter who was repatriated. The ouly man who received a rough deal was the digger, and that experience is likely to be repeated unless, as I hope, a Labour administration be in office at the conclusion of the present war. Many persons have the idea that land settlement is a failure. I should like to disabuse their minds of that notion. Despite the losses on soldier settlement, to which attention has been directed in reports of the Auditor-General, many sons of farmers, as well as returned soldiers, will have to be settled on the land; but a balance will have to be struck between secondary and primary settlement, and a different basis will have to be adopted from that which now prevails.

That is the curse on Australia. Land values in this country are higher than in any other country in the world. I am not advocating confiscation. J. believe that every man should receive justice. Neveri n my life have I received anything for which I did not work, and I have been robbed of most of what I have earned. I maintain that what I create should be mine. The man who neither tills the soil nor shears, a sheep, who could not tell the difference between a comeback ewe and a shorthorn bull, reaps the bulk of the harvest, because he holds the mortgages. Two years ago, I had to shear 900 of a total of 1,100 sheep before I shore one for myself, and the price of wool was 2d. per lb. below the cost of production. The farmer w ill never secure stability except through the medium of the Commonwealth Bank, and fro m a Labour government. on land are a f r u it f u l field of investbeen achieved the price would begin to ment. On our wheat lands alone, they represent a. total of £150,000,000. That is why the cost of production is so high, and a loaf of bread is so dear. The mortgages £170,000,000. I do not want stability at boom prices,-nor does any other farmer. Four years ago, 1 received for wool 26d. per lb. Two years later, I received only 15d. per 'lb. for a better class of wool. We have to go out into the world and fight for a market for every commodity grown in Australia with the exception of wool, and even then sell at a loss. The growers have to be paid a bounty in order that the banks may receive their interest, and the revenue from which the bounty is paid is provided by the worker. Buyers from every nation are stipposed to bid against each other for our wool, but they have a "" r in g "" and will not do them were so. Sometimes we receive the cost of production, and at other times there is a very steep rise. W it h a stabilized price, I would be in a position to discharge my mortgage liability within 10 year3, and my neighbours would be in a similar position. The mortgage-owning industry is the greatest in the world. No man could dispute the moderateness The gallant men and women of a stabilized price of 18d. per lb. The discharge of my mortgage would be as great a. calamity to the money-lending The values of the good land industry as the death of the whole of my flock would be to me. Control is exercised through the medium of prices. The question may be asked: "" W h y is the price of wool allowed to rise; why not keep it at a low figure""? A t an average price of 12£d. per lb., the return is l & . per lb. over the cost of production. According to my understanding of the position, if the price of wool remained at too low a figure for too long a period even this Government, which is the friend of the money lenders, who own not only tlie mortgages on our land., but also the bonds of Australia, would have to default or face collapse. Not many persons know that wool has the greatest effect on our internal economy, and that a rise of I d . per lb. represents in the aggregate between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. An advance of from 6d. to 8d. per lb. would bring into this country' an additional Mortgages £20,000,000, and when ""that result had recede. When wool was at a high price, I made it my business to ascertain, the statistical position. I thought that it was very scarce, but I found that that was on our wool lands total not the case. When the price wa.3 very low I thought that there must be a surplus, but I found that there was a shortage. Let lis reverse the position. If Australia had to purchase wool from It a ly or any other country, would our buyers be permitted to obtain supplies at a low price? They would not. But the Australian Government has allowed foreign representatives'to buy our wool at a low price. We are exporting wool in the grease to-day, even though shipping space is scarce. Wool will be the foundation of Australia's future prosperity. When I was overseas, I saw thousands of foreign nationals who obtained a livelihood -In many factories in manufacturing cities such as Lille, Boubaix, and TourcOing, in northern France, thousands of persons are engaged in spinning Australian wool.. Foreign buyers are compelled to come, to Australia for this important commodity, which is one of our. greatest national assets. Unfortunately, we have not made enough of it. in. the past. We have even allowed ourselves to be robbed in respect of the prices paid for it. At the conclusion of the war, we must be prepared ..to divert to peace-time occupations large numbers of men who are now employed in munitions factories or who have been fighting oversea, and land settlement will be one of the principal means of absorbing this manpower. In planning ahead in respect of land settlement, the Government must avoid the unfortunate mistakes that hav-j been made in the past. The greatest mistake was that State governments were intended to carry the financial burden, but the money lender was far too shrewd to advance capital to them. As the States did not possess rich sources of revenue such as customs and excise, the Commonwealth was obliged to guarantee bonds issued in respect of the purchase of land. In addition, intending settlers competed one against the other for the purchase of blocks at inflated values. That error also must be avoided. I suggest that the Commonwealth Bank should purchase the estates at a fair .valuation. Prom the amount paid in land .tax, a just value of the land may be ascertained. A block should then be allotted to a settler on a leasehold, basis, the title remaining with the nation. By that means, the Government would stabilize land values and blocks would not be disposed of at exorbitant prices. Although some persons may complain that, even under such a scheme settlers will be competing with each other for the acquisition of blocks, such a view is erroneous, because no money lender will make advances on the security of a leasehold property. My plan will give to a genuine settler an excellent opportunity to become independent. .Queensland do not like such a plan. not growl, because' they made their money from leasehold property in Queensland. The manner in which people are gulled over the ownership of land is amazing. The fallacy originated in our forefathers, particularly those who dwelt in Scotlaii-1 and Ireland-, where the landlords owned them, body'and soul. They made it their life's ambition to own a little patch of land. To-day we know that it is not the 'ownership but the use of the land whim is so important, because we are on earth for only a relatively short span. Perhaps honourable members will be interested to hear me recount my experiences as a settler. They afford an excellent illustration of how futile is the expectation of the average settler some day to own his block. I had confidence in myself, in the land which I had selected, and iu the scheme of settlement. It was the system that was wrong. When I pastured 420 sheep on an area embracing 1,200 acres, 100 of them died, and I nearly died with them. For fifteen years I was battered and bumped by misfortune. The honourable member for Ballarat (Air. Pollard), when he sat in the Parliament of Victoria, undoubtedly saved a num.l-.cr of us. Others became dispirited and broken-hearted, and drifted away from the land. For myself, I never like to give up once I have begun a job and f :>r fifteen years I fought to live. AlthoughI was earning money, and was improving the place, I never, because of the mortgage, saw a penny that I earned. Tlie money was always paid from the wool firm to the Closer Settlement Board. I had virtually to beg for food, as I had no money with whioh to purchase it. In truth, I had to fight for everything. A rural rehabilitation plan was inaugurated in 1937, and I had an enlightening conversation with a valuer upon my financial position. He informed me that I had paid off the sum of £2,000. I retorted; "" I did not pay the money; you took it . "" I had to laugh, when he told me that the principal had been reduced by £32. I cried, "" Hurrah! The property will be mine in 1,500 years "". The original value of the block was £3,300. When I returned from tbe war, I was practically penniless, but I liked the appearance of the land Although it",51,Human Existence

Only 100 years before Major Mitchell had passed by the site and the land had belonged to nobody. Subsequently a generation of sqnafters possessed it and paid, probably, 10s. an acre for it.

Interest upon the capital outlay amounted to £180 a. year, although the land, as I stated, was a wilderness. It was utterly impossible for me to make a success of the venture.. With those experiences so vivid in my mind, I emphasize that the Government must avoid a repetition of similar mistakes. . Australians Respect for our parliamentary institutions is inherent, in us, because they proreplies given by the Prime Minister( Mr tect our liberties. EvenI , a settler, am entitled to seek election to this chamber, and I shall always boldly support that principle of freedom. Whilst Australians have no sympathy with dictatorships, there is, unfortunately, in the Commonwealth the dictatorship of finance. That must be abolished without delay. In the past, although we produced a surplus of wool, wheat, butter, and fruit, we could not feed our people and they went hungry because they had no money with which to purehase the necessaries of life. To-day, the Commonwealth is appealing for the services of young' skilled men to manufacture munitions. Out in the bush, I have seen many fine types of la;ds who, because they were unable to find employment, have been forced to beg. for bread. They learned the rudiments of various trades from the technical schools. They are an asset to the country; they, not the money lender who denies them the right to live, to marry, and to raise a family, represent the re.il Australia. It is tragic to think that our social conditions are retrogressing, as young men dare not marry because they lack security of employment. Eor that reason, a Labour government is essential to the welfare and progress of the Commonwealth. Debate (on motion by Mr Dednian) adjourned. , SUBVERSIVE STATEMENTS INTEK-N'Xhat the House do now adjourn I have on -many occasions in this House pointed out that certain powers now possessed by the Government as the result of legislative action by this Parliament are being exercised'for what I regard as political purposes.

It seems rather remarkable that whilst action has been takenagainst workers who qiiite legitimately criticize the Government, apparently no action is to be taken against individuals who expressed views that are evidently acceptable to the Government concerning the establishment, of a dictatorship in this country. Why should the workers be gaoled for their justifiable remarks while these other persons are allowed to retain their liberty, although their remarks as reported are undoubtedly subversive? The reported remarks of Mr L. A. Robb, in particular, and also those of Messrs. Marshall and Sharland, were of such a nature as to be described by the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of New .South Wales as "" closely approaching treason "".

155,Mr Waed (East Sydney) [10.20],"National Security Regulations in regard to internments. On a previous occasion, I asked whether certain persons who had been interned had subsequently been released and later, following action by the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, had been returned to the internment camp because incriminating evidence had been found upon them. I requested that the papers ""in relation -to these cases should be made available for the perusal of honourable members. I wish to know the names of the persons who made representations to the Government for the release of these individuals. I have been informed that representations in respect of a certain case were ""made by a one-time member of the Cabinet. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that members of the Parliament should be afforded facilities to examine the papers in such cases as these. It could hardly be suggested that, by examining the papers, we would be doing something that might assist the enemy. I take it that the only reason for exercising of -powers of censorship is to prevent the disthe press. Not long ago, Captain Ramsay, semination of information that might be helpful to the enemy. The members of the Labour party broadcast to the world. I can see no believe that the censorship power reason why the censorship power should is being used for political poses. In tention, I bring to the notice of honor-happening. Why, for instance, should able members the fact that although the the public be denied the know-ledge that Honourable Herman Homburg, member of a member of the South Australian Parliathe Legislative Council of South Ausment had been interned? tralia, has been interned, all information on the matter has been censored. This person is not a member of the Labour who party. He belongs to the Liberal-Country this information, and also what persons in party, which is the South Australian the community have been endeavouring equivalent of the United Australia party, to secure the release of these internees. It He was at one time Attorney-General of may be assumed that persons are not inSouth Mr Fritz Homburg, and released on appeal. Mr Fritz monwealth Investigation Branch has, on Homburg'3 son-in-law, whose name is many occasions, been prevented, by the Klawinkle, appealed, but although his appeal was supporters, from taking action which it dismissed, I am given to understand that desired to take. There is more than a he has been released. I wish to know who suggestion of political colour attaching to made representations on behalf of these the administration of a good many of our people? This information is necessary in national security regulations. What has order to assist us to determine the degree the Government to say on these various to which political considerations are matters? I submit that there is no need Mr Ward. entering into the administration of certain important powers granted to the Government under national security legislation. ""Why does the Government permit the censorship power to be exercised in such a way as to prevent the publication in the daily press of information on -these important public matters? It was never intended that the power should be exercised in this way. The individuals to whom I have specifically referred have no associations whatever with the Labour party. We are entitled to know whether "" Fifth Columnists "" are at work and so imperilling the safety of the country. Thero can be no justification for the use of the censorship power to prevent the publica* tion in the press or by wireless of information on these 3ubjects. Although Great Britain is so much closer to the scene of the conflict in Europe and is, in fact, embroiled in it in almost every imaginable way, information about the internment of prominent persons is not withheld from a member of the British House of Commons, was interned, but the information was not suppressed.

The Government cannot throw aside its responsibility in these matters. The Labour party, and also the people at large, wish to know who are the guilty parties in respect of these various matters. will ensure that justice shall be meted out I make a strong protest against the action of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) in resolutely refusing to invoke Commonwealth powers to intervene in the unfortunate industrial dispute at Port Kembla. I regret that the Minister has attempted to shelter behind the plea that the Commonwealth Government should not interfere with the finding of a State court or with the actions of a State tribunal. In so serious a matter the Government must not stand on courtesy to any court. resources of Australia must be mobilized 100 per cent, in order to enable us to face of industrial disputes, simply on the plea dangers in the near future. It. has been said that an enemy is practically at our door. Yet, at a time when prices are rising a State industrial court has reduced the wages of workers at Port Kembla by approximately 10s. a week. incompetent is threatening throughout industry. Nevertheless, this by, refusing to take any action whatever to bring about a settlement of the dispute at Port Kembla, because it knows that when the matter is dealt with fairly the workers will be found to be right andrising prices, increase the rates of pay of the employers wrong. I protest most strongly against that attitude, particularly at .a time when the Government has just announced proposals for the prevention of industrial disputes, through the establishment of conciliation machinery which will enable justice to be done between the worker and his employer. I -am sick and tired of reading reminders in the press to the workers that there is a war on: The boss also must be reminded of that fact. To-day, however, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited and other big concerns absolutely refuse to make public details of profits obtained: through the watering of stock. The dispute at Port Kembla has arisen solely because the State Industrial Court has taken up the attitude that it will reduce wages in spite of the fact that prices of commodities are rising; and this Government refuses to do anything in the matter. It is about time that this Government declared emphatically that it to the employee as well as to the employer, and that when the employer comes into court he shall be reminded as well as the worker that there is a war on. The Government should make it clear that, when it asks the workers to give of their maximum effort in industry, it will demand an equal measure of service from the employers. I have read a report in the Sydney Morning Herald that men in many industries are working 50 and 60 hours a week, and are doing so willingly in the national interest. In spite of those facts, this Government is not prepared to allow the men involved in the dispute at We have been told that the Port Kembla to invoke the machinery Avhich it is setting up for the prevention that it would be discourteous on its part to go over the head of a State tribunal. the dispute -at Port Kembla?

How can any industrial tribunal, in a time of certain classes of workers and, at the same time, decrease the rates for other classes? Such inconsistency cannot be justified on any moral or economic grounds. The Minister for Labour and National Service said that the Government would not intervene in this dispute because it was not prepared to interfere with an award of a State court. AllI can say is that if decisions of State courts threaten widespread disputes in industry, this Government will be obliged to interfere with them. It has a responsibility in this matter.

I know men in Sydney who were interned allegedly because they were supporters of the Fascist regime in Italy and because they hud incriminating documents in their possession when they were questioned. To-day those men are enjoying freedom. When those men were interned they did not know why and, having been interned, they do not know why they are now outside. If their internment was a mistake they should have been told so. One man whom I have known for five or six years was interned. Yet to-day he is at home with his family at Bon'di. I do not object to that, but his people want to know why he was interned. It is not fair that they should be kept in the dark. If this Government wants peace and the workers to do the right thing, as they desire, it will treat them as men.

Many complaints are received from the public, and these are thoroughly investigated, but apart from these, test checks initiated by tbe Commissioner and his deputies are made from time to time on selected commodities and the investigations cover a l l classes of traders from manufacturers to retailers. The investigation officers are clothed with powers to demand the production of all documents relating to the goods under investigation and to inspect records of costs and selling prices of old and new stock, which, under the National Security (Prices) Regulations traders are obliged to preserve. As an example of this procedure I may add that withineighteen hours of the announcement of the budget increases the deputy commissioners in all States, acting on instructions f r om the Commissioner, had in hand a comprehensive investigation of stocks of certain commodities on which substantial increases in taxation were provided in the budget' proposals, and had made arrangements for a test check on prices.",62,Latkobe Shaleoil Fields
