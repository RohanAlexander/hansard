It did so because of changes by outcomes from those outlined in last year's Treasury and the joint economic forecasting budget? There are two principal reasons. The group to the economic forecast, and also first is that the coalition in opposition deliberbecause of changes in program parameters. ately undermined the budget. They tried to do They delivered different outcomes for various this in 1993 when they opposed $3 billion reasons from what was expected. worth of budget tightening measures. They Thus we concluded that to release the were unsuccessful in respect of that. In this budget starting point figure at the start of that current year's budget, they opposed $2Y2 process, or to update the forecast for the outbillion of budget tightening measures for 1995-96 and $4'h billion for 1996-97. So they some $4'h billion due to reduced real growth tried to wipe out the projected budget surplus and reduced inflation. With lower growth, of $3.4 billion for 1996-97 by opposing $4'h outlays are also increased, especially for billion worth of measures. So much for the increased expenditure on unemployment professed concern, hand on the heart, about benefits. the need to have a budget surplus. Two key questions arise from all of this. Why did the coalition in opposition oppose The first one is: is reduced economic growth the measures which at that stage they would and inflation evidence of economic failure have believed would have wiped out the and mismanagement by the previous governbudget surplus anyway? They were successful ment? I must say it is a curious development in blocking $0.3 billion in 1995-96-which, indeed when lower inflation is said to be I might note, is enough to stop a surplus this evidence of economic failure. It is what we year on the revised figures-and they blocked were trying to achieve. In fact, the mark of $2.3 billion in 1996-97. Thus, in part, the the economic success of the previous governdeterioration in the budget outcome that they ment was that we achieved a substantial and are now fulminating about was brought about enduring recovery with low inflation. The fact by their own actions. that inflation in 1996-97 is now forecast to be less than we previously forecast is clearly not Nevertheless, the major reason for the a bad thing-well, at least I would have changed budget outcomes is the change to thought so. To argue the opposite is to take economic parameters. As noted by the Rea complete Alice in Wonderland approach to serve Bank governor in an address in late economics.

BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 May, on motion by Dr Kemp: That the bill be now read a second time. bill, which will provide an additional $95.7 million to improve Aboriginal educational opportunities. I am especially pleased because this bill is the result of an initiative of the federal Labor government. In setting up the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in 1993, the former government was recognising the fact, stated in the 1994-95 report Social justice for indigenous Australians, that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people were 'the poorest, sickest, most unemployed and least educated of all Australians'. The review was established to examine the operation of the first triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP. The AEP began in 1990 as a national effort between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strategically address the educational needs of indigenous Australians. The AEP identified 21 goals under four main themes: involvement, access, participation and outcomes; particularly recognising the fundamental importance of the involvement of indigenous people at all stages of decision making. The original joint policy statement of the AEP in 1989 acknowledged the power of education to improve the quality of life for people from financially impoverished backgrounds. The joint policy statement says: Numerous reviews, inquiries and consultations conducted in recent years have all demonstrated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people place a high priority on education. They want for themselves and their children no less by way of educational opportunity than is afforded other Australians. They expect that educational processes should leave them to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to realise their individual potential, lead satisfying lives and contribute actively to the community. They look to education as a means of moving out of poverty and welfare dependency, enabling them to earn income through employment or enterprise and to manage the development of their communities. Five years after the AEP was established was a suitable time to consider the extent to which it had met expectations in terms of the 21 goals. The review praised the AEP for delivering more funding stability in the form of triennial rather than annual arrangements, for fostering cooperation between federal, territory and state governments and between education sectors, and for identifying the need for more culturally appropriate curricula. Not surprisingly, it also found that the AEP's first three years held some lessons for its future operation. In terms of educational participation and attainment, the review found that improvements, although evident, were inconsistent across sectors and systems. It found that many parents now have an avenue for becoming directly involved in their children's schooling through the establishment of over 2,500 parent committees under the Aboriginal student",120,Conclusion

173,Mr Peter Baldwin (Sydney) (10.01 A.m.),"-I am delighted to speak in support of thisMC 1324 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 support and parent awareness program, ASSPA. It also found that the cooperative national approach of the AEP had encouraged the development of Aboriginal studies and Torres Strait Islander studies as part of the curriculum in an increasing number of educational institutions. These kinds of improvements were not seen uniformly across the country, however, and addressed to only a limited extent the extreme educational disadvantage facing our indigenous population. The review made 44 recommendations designed to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's experience of education. Sixteen of the recommendations apply specifically to the Commonwealth, while others involve the state and territory governments and non-government education authorities. The former government responded to the review in September last year, announcing a package of measures which included those incorporated in this bill. The response announced the Labor government's intention to make the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program recurrent, and this measure is a key part of the bill we are considering today. It will provide greater stability of funding, as well as ensuring that funds remain commensurate with enrolments. It will also simplify funding arrangements, addressing complaints made to the review about the time spent preparing submissions. In line with review recommendation 37, the proposal is to provide funds on a per capita basis and in a way which reflects the differing costs of educational provision across sectors, and in remote and nonremote areas. I note that the government intends these changes to accompany a more accountable outcomes-focused process for the distribution of Commonwealth funds. There is no doubt that we need to continue down the path set by the previous government in placing a high priority on establishing comprehensive and up-to-date databases across all sectors of education and training so that the performance of the AEP in meeting its objectives can be properly evaluated. The previous government also obtained agreement from most states to increase their effort in Aboriginal education expenditure in order to access a pool of Commonwealth money in the form of strategic results projects. The opposition will be most interested in arrangements made with the states as a result of this bill. We would expect the government to ensure that commitments made by the states to increase effort are not permitted to lapse due to any reduction in commitment by the Commonwealth or any diminution of resolve on the part of the Commonwealth. There is far too much at stake. In closing, I would like to congratulate the chair of the reference group overseeing the review, Mandawuy Yunupingu; the deputy chair, Romina Fujii; and the other members of the reference group on the excellent job they did. I would also like to say that real improvements can be made in indigenous education if all governments work together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have come some of the way; this bill takes us further toward our goal. have taken a personal interest for some years. I am therefore very pleased to speak on this particular bill this morning. One of the things that has struck me over the six years I have been in this place is that not only here but also as I have travelled around the country-with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and with other members on the standing committee and through other outlets and avenues-I have heard many claims from different people about what the keys are to addressing Aboriginal",123,Representatives Main Committee
174,Mr Nugent (Aston) (10.08 A.m.),"As this House will know, this is an area in which IThursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITfEE Me 1325 and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage in this country. And there is acknowledged and quite clear disadvantage, by whatever indicator you care to use. When people talk about the key to addressing that disadvantage, they sometimes talk about health; they sometimes talk about housing, education, employment, the importance of land, the justice system, and so on. It seems to me that those things are all important. It is not just one of those items being the key; they all play an important part and it seems to me that it should be an interactive process. You have to improve housing and health in parallel with education and gradually develop that total environment. I know the next honourable gentleman to speak from the coalition-he comes from the Northern Territory and we welcome him to this parliament-will probably have more first-hand experience of this than I, but I have certainly travelled extensively around the country. What we have seen and heard as we go around the country, in terms of health and the delivery of educational services to indigenous people, has been generally a very sorry tale. You do not get a good education if your health is not up to scratch. If you have a middle ear infection-and in some schools that you and I have been to, Mr Deputy Speaker, 50 per cent of those in the school have middle ear infections-you have a health problem. But you have also got an education problem because you cannot hear what the heck is going on. So we need to look at education in the Aboriginal field in a broad sense. We also need to look at overcrowded housing. I have seen overcrowded indigenous housing all around this country. I remember particularly going to Maningrida, which is well known for its arts and crafts, where the average number of people per house in that community is about 38. If you are going to school during the day and you want to advance yourself and do some study or whatever, going home to 38 people in a three-bedroom house with one toilet and a shower, in a warm climate, is not exactly conducive to becoming a diligent student, even if you want to. The aspect of culture is interesting. AgainI would be interested in the comments, perhaps later on, from the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory. I remember going tYirrkala which is often held up as a model school in terms of indigenous involvement in running its own education process. It is a school at which Mandawuy Yunupingu, to whom the previous speaker referred, was a teacher some years ago before he moved on to greater fame in other fields. There was great pride, and appropriately so in many senses, that the teaching was conducted in the local language. That was culturally appropriate and was acceptable to the community, but if you went down the road and talked to the major employer in the area, which was Nabalco, the management there said, 'One of the problems we have with trying to offer jobs to Aboriginal people is that, although they go to school and they go through the school system, because they often do not have a basic command of English to the standard we need we actually cannot employ them.' So you have this dichotomy of culture and education, and you have to get that mix right. Similarly, in the home environment the problem is not just the crowding. If there is substance abuse at home and there is violence or other problems of that sort, clearly you are not going to sit down and do your homework and have the right environment in which to study. Those sorts of problems, coupled with peer pressure and so on, I think are often worse for our indigenous community than for people almost anywhere else in the country. I specifically address my comments to the parliamentary secretary, who is here representing the minister. The point I would make is. that we can talk about these education bills, but what MC 1326 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 the government has to understand and what the government must do-I said this in opposition and I will continue to say it in government-is address all of these issues because addressing just particular sectional areas is not going to fix the problem. This bill is about increasing funding until the tum of the century and restructuring the Aboriginal special programs in this area to make them more responsive. This bill is about moving primarily, in one sense, to a per capita system. It is about looking for who can best provide education. I think that is important. Often the providers may not be from the conventional sources. I think that is a more relevant factor in indigenous areas than perhaps in many other parts of the community. It is particularly about looking for outcomes and not just inputs. I have been critical of many of the things the previous government did in this and other areas but I never basically questioned its good intentions. One of the things that struck me in the life of the previous government and that caused me concern was that we did not get the improved results. I think there was too much focus on providing the inputs and not enough on saying, 'Has it been effective and have we got the right results?' SoI think that looking at outcomes is fundamental. This bill is about providing certainty for the education providers, not living year to year on short-term time frames, because you cannot organise anything properly on that basis. It is about performance and outcomes, and it has also established quite clearly an objective to achieve educational equity for indigenous Australians by the tum of the century. It is about improving the lot of indigenous teachers as well. I am not sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether you were on this particular visit, but I have graphic memories of one visit we paid to a school which I think was in Mission Beach in Queensland where outstanding Aboriginal teachers really were teachers' aides, if you like, and had nowhere to go. There was no advancement and the level of pay was derisory. Anybody who had real ability in the Aboriginal teaching field was often lost to the field because they went to other jobs where they could get better advancement. It seems to me that there are special needs in terms of improving the lot of indigenous teachers. Of course, it is important to make education culturally appropriate, and we need-above all, perhaps-to take a practical and not a doctrinaire approach. As members of the House would be aware, I have spent some years as the coalition's representative in opposition and now in government on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Reconciliation is something to which the Prime Minister has reaffirmed his commitment on a number of occasions since 2 March. In that context, let me say that next week we are going to celebrate National Reconciliation Week in this building. There will be a major function on Monday at lunchtime, co-hosted by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Democrats (Senator Kernot), and there will be a special motion moved in the House at the start of business on Monday. The reason I mention that is that you do not and will not achieve reconciliation until you have addressed many of the problems that are almost endemic in the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Improving that disadvantage, it seems to me, is one of the issues at the core and that is why bills such as this are so important. I would just remind members of the House that in the second reading speech the minister said that this bill was all about funding levels that reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1327 The bill is talking about major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997 with a new funding triennium. It is talking about cultural appropriateness and a more cost-effective, transparent and manageable system, and it would do this in two basic ways: on the basis of either per capita entitlement or strategic results projects. It is all about value for money and about getting results. As I have said before, I have never doubted that the previous government wanted to try hard in this area, but I have concerns that they did not achieve outcomes, and that is why it is important that we develop a new way of going about some of these things. In doing that, we must of course remember that we need to involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents in their children's education process. You cannot just devise a system and expect that it is going to work. Given the many tight-knit communities, it is important to involve parents because without that parental commitment-and that often is not there these days-and given some of the problems of health, housing and so on that I referred to earlier, you will not get children motivated to do the work they need to at school. We need to very much improve the preschool education level because, unless you can set at an early age the right approaches, attitudes and even disciplines to education, you will get the wrong attitude set at an early age; and if a few years later you come along trying to change the attitude of the young people to education, you will not be successful. Obviously, it must be about employing and training Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers. There simply are not enough of them in the field and we need to encourage far more people into that area. The employment and training of those workers-acknowledging that it may have to use techniques that are not necessarily standard in terms of the main community-will be important. The appropriate professional development of staff at all levels involved in indigenous education is important, and I have mentioned the cultural sensitivity of curricula as also being important. Probably more than anything else, we have to make sure that in all the things we plan and do; in all the changes we look at and the things we implement, we have indigenous involvement in how we develop the programs, in the measures that we take and in the mechanics of the system. History. has taught us that we cannot impose those things from the outside. Unless there is indigenous involvement the measures will-in all sorts of ways-not be appropriate and there will be no commitment in the communities themselves to make them work successfully afterwards. This legislation seeks to achieve for indigenous Australians literacy and numeracy outcomes that are similar to those of non-indigenous Australians. It also seeks to make sure that we regularly review progress so that we can try to achieve the objective, or get very close to it, by 2000. I do not think we are going to bring everybody up to scratch in the next four years, but we have to make significant progress. Everybody in our community, whether an indigenous or non-indigenous person, is very frustrated with the fact that all the effort and all the talk that has gone on for some years has not produced the outcome. I am not attributing blame or pointing a finger, but we all acknowledge that the improvements are not there and, therefore, people are getting frustrated. We must start to see some impact being made on some of these areas. It is important that we give priority in that process to addressing the development of sound foundation competencies, particularly in literacy and numeracy, so that we can help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make the transition from education and training, where they MC 1328 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 get those basic skills, into the work force. Until you have the basic skills, you will not get a job; if you do not get a job then you cannot afford the housing; and if you do not have the housing then you do not get the health standards. If you do not have a job and money, you get into substance abuse, because you have been sitting around doing nothing. This happens when you have time on your hands-we all know the cycle. So this bill is a very fundamental part of providing intervention at an early stage in that cycle. We all recognise the need in this area and it is no good standing up and making emotive speeches. That has happened over the years. There have been a lot of problems and mistakes made in the past. What we have to do now is sit down with legislation such as this and put in place some practical measures for dealing with the problem. This is one small part of the jigsaw. This is the educational piece of the jigsaw. There are other parts: health, housing and so on. We have to recognise the special circumstances of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians: not only their disadvantages but also the cultural differences, and we have to have them involved. This bill not only continues what was set in place before-and some of the special measures worked, and some of them did not work-but also improves what was there, based on experience. I think that is to be commended . .It is not a cure by itself, but it certainly helps. The thing that we must do, as a nation and as a parliament-the lead has to come from the parliament-is to put aside party political differences in these sorts of areas. Those of us who have worked in indigenous affairs over the last few years have tried to put aside a lot of those party political differences because, as a nation, we have a responsibility not to fail our citizens. In so many areas, including Aboriginal education, we have failed them in the past and it is important that we now address these problems. This bill will go some considerable way towards doing that, and I therefore commend the bill to honourable members. had the opportunity to speak in the Main Committee.

Mr Ted Grace--You seem very much at home. bill, which will amend the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act of 1989. The bill will ensure that a significant portion of funding to the states and territories, under the act, is paid on the basis of the number of indigenous students. It will also provide some extra money to Aboriginal education as approved by the Expenditure Review Committee. Poor retention rates, particularly at higher levels of secondary schooling, are a major factor in the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians. For example, at year 12 level the retention rate is 33 per cent compared with 76 per cent for other Australians. Current funding arrangements under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, are based on submissions which failed to provide certainty and continuity. Funding levels are not currently linked to outcomes and do not reflect levels of enrolment of indigenous students. The bill provides for a new approach to funding arrangements for AESIP from 1997. Most funding will now be provided through per capita based arrangements which will ensure that the bulk of the funding is predictable and based on changes in enrolment demands. An element of the available funds will also be set aside for strategic projects which will be time limited and outcomes orientated.",124,Representatives Main Committee

176,Mr Dondas,"I do feel at home, as the honourable member has said. I rise to support theThursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1329 The strategic results projects wiII, in general, be jointly funded by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The strategic results projects wiII deal with the major barriers to educational attainment, such as the high drop-out rates, which cannot be addressed by mainstream programs. The new formula for funding recognises the different needs of various educational sectors: preschool, primary, secondary, and vocational education and training; the greater costs involved in servicing remote communities; and the needs of non-government institutions not in receipt of funding from other government channels. The biII wiII also give practical implementation to the government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy commitments: to review all Commonwealth programs for indigenous students to assess their relevance and educational outcomes; to liaise with the states and territories to determine how to improve outcomes; to support in principle the 21 goals of the national review for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, while recognising that indigenous complaints voiced during the consultation phase were not necessarily reflected in the final recommendations; and to ensure that indigenous people have a greater voice in determining indigenous educational needs. Under current financial arrangements, funding is submission based. Based on the formula supplied in schedule 1, the territory would receive---on 1995 enrolments as provided under the Australian vocational education and training, or VET, statistics that include nongovernment VET providers-a decrease in funding for the vocational education and training sector. Based on these preliminary calculations, it is felt that this wiII result in a decrease in funding for the vocational education and training sector in the Northern Territory in the government and non-government sectors of some $3 miIIion per annum. Current funding arrangements have been intended to be supplementary to delivery funding. Historically, however, institutions have used the funds for delivery purposes. The impact of the per capita arrangements may affect the number of indigenous enrolments. This is clearly cost shifting, which the new formula is trying to address. Institutions wiII make claims of additional territory recurrent funds to maintain their current enrolment levels. The new funding arrangements wiII lead to a significant rearrangement in the relative shares of funds received by different states and territories. Transitional arrangements wiII ensure that the shift to per capita funding is as smooth as possible. However, these changes wiII negatively impact upon the most disadvantaged Aboriginal students in the remotest areas of Australia. While there are a number of positive aspects to this biII, the Northern Territory is greatly concerned that the level of funding available to the Northern Territory government school sector wiII decrease by 33 per cent, from approximately $10 miIIion in 1996 to $6.4 miIIion in 1997. Given that the government school sector has responsibility for providing education to 10,930 indigenous students, the large nature of this cut will have a dramatic negative impact on the programs which the department of education will be able to offer. However, two positive aspects of the bill which address the concerns of Northern Territory Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are a guaranteed funding base to provide employment and the recognition of greater delivery costs incurred in delivering educational services to remote areas. The major problem for the Northern Territory is that the main focus of the bill on improved academic outcomes will be diminished because the funding necessary to maintain programs which address improved outcomes wiII be greatly reduced. MC 1330 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 The reduction in funding also places in jeopardy the implementation of the Aboriginal education strategy as agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers at the meeting of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in December 1995. At that meeting, ministers agreed to continue the partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, particularly to improve outcomes for indigenous students. It will be very difficult to continue the partnership when the Northern Territory government is maintaining its financial effort, only to be confronted by a reduction by the Commonwealth. Indigenous people in the Northern Territory have been asking for some time to have their jobs as Aboriginal resource officers made permanent. The Northern Territory government has always said that, as soon as the Commonwealth makes funding permanent, the Territory would make these jobs permanent. Under this new legislation, the funding will be on a recurrent basis, and therefore the Northern Territory government will be able to offer Aboriginal resource officers in urban locations permanent employment, providing the current level of the 1996 funding is maintained. Given the important role that Aboriginal resource officers play in providing support for Aboriginal students in classrooms and the example they set as role models for non-Aboriginal students, this could be another significant step in assisting with the improvement of academic outcomes for Aboriginal students and promoting a better understanding between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Territorians. There must be a concerted effort to improve access to education and training in remote communities and to address poor health, housing and other problems that militate against educational achievement. While academic standards in Aboriginal schools are generally far below what I consider acceptable, it has to be recognised that progress is being made. With four Aboriginal principals in charge of Aboriginal schools and more in training, about 100 Aboriginal teachers and nearly 300 Aboriginal assistant teachers, we can expect the rate of improvement to increase significantly. In some isolated Aboriginal schools, the electronic classroom is already a reality, with students receiving lessons and tutorial support by computer from the Northern Territory Secondary Correspondence School. Section 10 of this bill is also very important because it acknowledges the higher costs of education delivery in remote areas, although the definition of 'remote' fails to differentiate between vastly different degrees of remoteness. I advise the honourable minister that, in terms of remote, for a primary school student the government rate is· some $600 and the nongovernment rate is $2,000. In terms of remoteness, the definition is that, as I understand it, if you are more than 300 kilometres from a popUlation base of 50,000 people you come into the remote category. We provide educational services in the major regional centres of the Northern Territorywhich are Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Nhulunbuy-and all those Territory centres are more than 300 kilometres away from a population base of 50,000. Darwin is the only centre that has a population base of 50,000. In Alice Springs and the other Territory centres, we are funded for the remote rate per student, which is $600. At places away from those Territory centres, like Borroloola-a community some 788 kilometres from Tennant Creek or, in driving time, between eight and nine hours-education services are provided at a higher remote cost, as if it were in Alice Springs. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1331 With another smaller community, Kiuna-a station 580 kilometres, or six to seven hours drive, from Tennant Creek, with a population of about 35 students-if the 35 is multiplied by the $600, it finishes up at about $21,000. With the services that are being provided by the education department of the Northern Territory, a schoolteacher at that level in a remote area would probably be on about $45,000 to $50,000 a year with overtime. In other words, it is far more expensive to provide educational services to people in remote areas, which this particular per capita table will not really pick up. I would ask the minister to evaluate that in relation to the Northern Territory and other parts of the vast outback in North Queensland and Western Australia. The important thing is that, nationally, literacy levels are unacceptable and there is strong evidence that, in some remote areas, parents are more literate than their children. In fact, to pick up the points that were made by the honourable member for Aston( Mr Nugent), bilingual education is being accepted as the conventional approach, yet there is an increasing clamour from traditionally orientated communities that language maintenance is Aboriginal business and the medium of school based education ought to be English. That is really what the honourable member for Aston was saying. Obviously if peopleand their children go to school through Yirrkala, when they come out of the education system and do not speak English they cannot find work. As the member for Aston said, the mining company is unable to employ them as they do not have a decent command of the English language. We should be looking seriously now at what languages are being taught in schools because around the Northern Territory there are a number of children aged between 18 and 25 who are still somewhere in the education system and who do not have a reasonable enough command of the English language to allow them to go into the work force. So they will always be forced to stay within their community because of the dialect that they use. The introduction of this bill should have been seen as the major step in continuing the improvements of outcomes for all indigenous students in the non-government sector. There has to be great concern about the bill's availability to address the needs of indigenous students in the government school sector. The provision of a 33 per cent cut in the level of funding available to the government school sector is probably the most damaging event to occur in the history of Northern Territory Aboriginal education. This cut will directly impact on the attainment of educational outcomes at a time when more, rather than less, funding should have been devoted to this area. Accepting the fact that the former government left the new coalition government in a financial mess, I would hope that the minister responsible for this bill will recognise the important fact that not only is the Territory disadvantaged, but other states with large rural and isolated areas are also in need of special funding consideration. As this legislation is most important to the future for those persons in the indigenous education sector, I commend it to honourable members. Committee and I am looking forward to it. I am also looking forward to speaking on the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1996 which will certainly have a very pleasing outcome for the electorate of Herbert. I want to support the bill because",128,Representatives Main Committee

179,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.38 A.m.),"This is the first time. I have spoken in the MainMC 1332 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 every Australian has a right to expect fair and equitable access to education, but for many years indigenous Australians have, in the main, been unable to live out this right. This, unfortunately, is not unusual. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lag well behind non-indigenous Australians in just about every social aspect of life. Health, life expectancy, employment and the representation in our gaols are just a few of the areas where indigenous Australians continue to lag well below the acceptable so-called 'average' standard of living. In education, the same can unfortunately also be said to be true. Someone once said that knowledge is power. It has been oft quoted, but I do not necessarily subscribe to this point of view. I prefer to believe that knowledge is empowerment. The difference is fundamental and the amendments presented in this bill further the quest for empowerment. The aim of this bill-to facilitate increased participation and improved education outcomes for indigenous Australians-is a positive action indeed. We can only increase participation rates for indigenous people if we improve access to educational facilities. It is important to do this from the ground up and to start at preschool and primary school. Immediately before coming here this week I officially opened the new Good Shepherd community school in Townsville. It was my first school opening and a very proud moment for me. Part of my speech called on the education department to facilitate more culturally relevant learning environments for our kids; environments which take into consideration the needs and requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their parents. Townsville has one of the largest per capita metro-indigenous populations in Australia. It is great to see indigenous and non-indigenous children mixing so freely. That is the great thing about children. They do not carry the prejudice and racism that older people seem to carry. Getting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people involved in the educational and teaching side is an important element not only for the provision of better, more culturally relevant education programs for indigenous Australians but also for all Australians. This then needs to be carried through to secondary and tertiary levels of education. In the end, I think one of the most important educational outcomes we all hope for for our children is, of course, employment. When I was young-and I am not saying that I am not young now-an arts degree was a pretty big deal and the sign of a very well-educated person. Today an arts degree will not get a young person terribly far. Ordinary degrees are becoming double degrees with honours. I dread to think, for my own children's sake, how competitive the job market will be when they graduate from their university studies in a few years time. Not many things in politics today seem to attract bipartisan support. I think it would be a very brave member indeed who would stand up and oppose the sensible amendments proposed in this bill. I am particularly supportive of the new section 7A which defines the object of the act, which is 'to develop culturally appropriate education services for Indigenous people.' To expand on the importance of this, I want to take you to a great indigenous school in my electorate. About 40 kilometres north-east of Townsville is Palm Island. Sister Geraldine Kearney runs St Michael's Primary School on the island. I have had the honour of meeting and being with Sister Geraldine; she has been at the cutting edge of indigenous education on Palm Island for some five years now. I was speaking to her just yesterday and she was telling me quite frankly that Palm Island, sadly, has averaged one suicide a week over the last two months. She sat with the families and attended the funerals. The most worrying part of it is that the people committing suicide are aged between 17 and 25. Some of those people have Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1333 children of their own. Of the 4,500 people who live on Palm Island, 50 per cent are under the age of 25. In Palm Island's case, when we talk about education outcomes we are talking well beyond primary, secondary and tertiary education. We are talking about life and death. I asked Sister Geraldine how important education is to the future of the people on Palm Island. 'Vital' was the simple answer she gave. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said in the second reading of this bill that·the need for quality was clear. Dr Kemp said: . . . social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people. BeforeI spoke to Sister Geraldine yesterday, she had no idea about the aims or the details of this bill. Yet, when I started to ask her about what areas of indigenous education she thought were of greatest importance, she instantly identified several of the key strategies identified by the honourable minister in his reading of the bill. 'Get the kids while they're young,' she said, 'and, with the direct assistance of parents and the island elders, provide them with a culturally appropriate education and a continuous overdose of self-esteem. In the long run, it will save lives.' Literacy and numeracy are one thing, but we cannot afford to ignore other areas of indigenous education. The development of culturally sensitive curricula on Palm Island has extended to lessons on the environment, the identifying of bush food sources, and the telling of the history and cultural traits of the Palm Island community. Importantly, it has also started to involve education in areas of nutrition. Bad nutrition habits are one of the major sources of the continued health problems suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. If we can start educating people in good nutritional habits at an early stage, then we can greatly avoid many of the health problems we see now in the indigenous population. If we can prevent certain health problems from ever arising, then we will not have to continue pouring money into funding their treatment. A proper diet can prevent many health problems, including diabetes, digestive problems, renal problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. When we talk about education outcomes in relation to this bill, it is not unreasonable to look into such positive areas as this. The problems on Palm Island are many, but education is an area where a real difference can be made. Get the parents involved. They want to be involved. When parents on Palm Island were given the opportunity to contribute to their children's education and have a say in the planning and development of the school's education program, they eagerly took it up. If we want to find out how to develop culturally sensitive educational environments, then we have to involve the parents. In the five years that Sister Geraldine has been at Palm Island, she has seen a marked increase in parental involvement in education, and that is wonderful. Parents have been involved in education surveys to establish what things they think should be included in the school's curriculum, and they have also been closely involved in the planning and development of a new school building extension. This has had a positive effect on the Palm Island children at St Michael's. They can see their parents taking an active interest in their well-being. It has also had a positive effect on the parents in that they feel they are contributing to something very important, and they are. Get indigenous elders involved. That was something else Sister Geraldine continued to stress, because the elders know the history, culture and heritage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people better than anyone else. Elders are also the highly respected members of the MC 1334 MAIN COMMIITEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 community. Just before ANZAC Day, there was an article in the Townsville press advocating veterans going to schools to talk to kids about their experiences of war-what life was like, the sights, the smells, the sounds, the home front and so on. If we are going to do that, then let us also get indigenous elders involved with indigenous education. That is what this bill is about. Already, justice programs are being applied on Palm Island and trialled elsewhere in Queensland. Aboriginal elders sit down with juvenile offenders and try to instil in them a sense of responsibility and self-respect. On Palm Island such programs are increasingly having positive effects. Give elders the support they need to get involved with education. In Palm Island's case, that support is urgently needed. About 50 per cent of the population of Palm Island is under 25 years of age, as I have already outlined. If Palm Island's elders are not given the necessary support, in a few years their generation will not be around anymore, and that will have a serious consequence for that community. Push to get indigenous people directly involved in education training. That was another point stressed by Dr Kemp and identified by Sister Geraldine. All teachers' aides and ancillary staff at St Michael's are indigenous people. They are the ones who are really teaching the children there. They are the ones who are the full-time role models for the children during the day. In the second reading speech of the bill, Dr Kemp identified the importance of the transition from education to the work force. But there are also other important transition points that cannot be ignored. We need to explore the possibility of introducing a preparatory year for all students, particularly those in remote centres, who are making the transition from primary to secondary school. In the great majority of cases in distant rural and remote parts of Australia, secondary education means travel to major regional centres. This involves separation from family and friends, boarding school and, in effect, an entire new way of life. This is definitely the case on Palm Island. In 1995, all students from Palm Island entering secondary schools had to be placed in mainland boarding schools. Four have already dropped out. They dropped out, not because they did not want to go to school, but because they were not able to handle the dramatic adjustment in lifestyle. In some cases, children in remote centres are just not ready for mainland high schools and the change in the structure of education that they come across. Primary school indigenous students have three times the literacy and numeracy problems of other students. Twenty-five per cent of indigenous students do not complete year 10. These figures can be improved by providing culturally sensitive educational environments. I believe they can be improved' by easing children of all backgrounds into high school and introducing them to that environment only when they are ready. We have preschool to introduce kids to the idea of going to school and, in certain countries, preparatory years before entering university. For many children in remote Australian communities, both indigenous and non-indigenous, a preparatory year could prove vital in making the transition to a different way of life. Having inherited the economic legacy of the ALP, the need for strict application and distribution of Commonwealth funds is more important than ever. The Australian public, both indigenous and non-indigenous, not unreasonably expect value from their taxes. A more accountable process for the distribution of funds will help to ensure that money goes to those areas where it is most needed. Greater accountability requires better planning of how funds will be spent. It also requires better consultation between politicians, the department, the Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1335 educators and the parents. We should be encouraging schools to develop needs analysis programs in consultation with indigenous parents. That is what this amendment bill is, in part, well and truly addressing. These amendments will, through the restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, contribute to ensuring that such improvements are achieved in indigenous education. I am particularly proud that this bill is outcomes oriented. For the sake of my electorate and the sake of indigenous people in the whole of this nation, I certainly commend this bill to the House. another commitment made during the election campaign. It is not the first time, and it certainly will not be the last time, we will be making good an election promise. Nonetheless, we who are committed to justice for Australia's indigenous peoples believe it to be an important promise. During the life of this government, it is imperative that we address some of the concerns and issues confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The land rights issue continues to dominate the indigenous politics debate-but it is not the whole story. If indigenous people are to enjoy their full and rightful share of this nation's blessings, we must ensure improvements in at least two other fundamental areas. Of these, health is perhaps the most publicised concern; but it is certainly not my intention to broach that issue today. The other is education. This parliament is not the first to recognise the need for action in this all-important area. Indeed, the act we seek to amend was first passed in 1989. In the seven years since it was introduced, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy has been a qualified success. For the most part, it has received bipartisan backing and has been overseen jointly by the Commonwealth, states and territories. It has produced considerable improvements in both education and training participation for indigenous people. However, there is still a long way to go. The national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples shows the need for new approaches and increased joint efforts if we are to see our indigenous people achieve educational parity with non-indigenes over the next four yearswhich, incidentally, was the goal set by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in December 1995. As with every goal set, there is a preferred route to travel. In this case, the determined course is a series of national priorities for the three years of the Aboriginal education policy, beginning in 1997. There has been agreement amongst indigenous people, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and education providers that these priorities are critical to the achievement of their goal. The priorities are wide ranging and include the development of career structures for indigenous education workers and a rise in levels of parental involvement in their children's education. Having received a very good education myself, I recognise these two components as all important. It is very difficult for educational authorities to plan and to provide the best when there is a cloud hanging over their future. Like almost all Australians, they want and need security when making plans for the future, and it is gratifying to see that this need has been recognised. This bill guarantees funding through to the tum of the century, and that will be welcome news for the education providers.",131,Representatives Main Committee
180,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (10.57 A.m.),"In seeking the passage of this bill, the coalition is honouringMC 1336 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 I welcome, too, the move to involve parents in the education process. Teachers conly do so much, and a real love of learning can be instilled by a child's parents, who can encourage creativity in their children long after the formal lessons are over. Parents are very often responsible for instilling a love of learning in their children at a very early age-at the very least, the greater their interest, the greater the child's. Another of the defined priorities is the need for indigenous children to attend preschool education programs. The national experience has shown that children who attend kindergarten or other preschool programs have a significant head start on those who do not. The forced separation of Aboriginal families over the years has led to a decline in the use of their own languages. I am very happy to see that the program will offer encouragement for students to study indigenous languages, which are very much part of their heritage and their culture. We have had hundreds of government programs in these past 20 years attempting to fix one situation or another. Some programs have been a downright failure, particularly those where governments have simply thrown money -at a problem. This we will not do. However, it is a necessary element of an election promise that this is funded fully. This government plans to do just that. Over the next four years, we will be more than doubling expenditure on this program. In all, nearly $180 million has been earmarked for supplementary assistance to the education of indigenous Australians. With this increase in assistance will come increased accountability. The funding structure of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will change. From January next year, . AESIP resources will be distributed to eligible providers on a per capita basis. This is not to say that providers will be worse off than they are today. For the first year, at least, funding minimums will be set at the current rate. But per capita spending is, in the longer term, an inducement to increase participation rates. Under the new arrangements, each eligible provider will negotiate an indigenous education agreement that identifies specific targets to improve performance in one or more areas deemed a priority. Current performance levels will be the point from which potential improvements are targeted and measured. The per capita funding should enable providers-whether they be Commonwealth, state, territory or otherwise-to address the high costs of education in remote areas and the many disadvantages experienced by indigenous students. With these agreements signed, the Commonwealth will be in,terested in participation rates and, obviously, results. The methods will be of the providers' choosing and, given the diversity of situations, I am sure that providers will go about their tasks in different ways. The annual performance reviews will judge if they have been successful in achieving their defined targets. In addition to the per capita spending, this bill also provides for the strategic results projects. These funds, which represent only a fraction of the total expenditures, will be allocated toward researching and implementing measures that will improve results across the education sector. Universities will be eligible to participate in these projects. This bill will improve the chances of indigenous people participating in and receiving a better education. An education has always been vital, never more so than it is today. Many of life's options are decided for us by the standard of education we are offered and whether we take up that offer. I believe this bill offers both opportunity and encouragement. I commend it to the House. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMI1TEE MC 1337 Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.00 a.m.)-I am very pleased to be able to sum up and conclude this debate on behalf of the government. This is a bill which keeps one of our pre-election commitments to spend an additional $143 million on Aboriginal education, and it is one pre-election commitment that obviously the government is extremely happy to keep. I take the poitlt of the member for Aston( Mr Nugent) that Aboriginal education depends on many things apart from simply educational funding. It depends upon good health and good housing, but education is what we are addressing today, and I am delighted to have the member for Aston's support. One of the glories of our nation is the tremendous efforts that have been made over the last 20 or 30 years to bring our Aboriginal people into full communion with the rest of our society. A sign of success, amidst all the gloom and doom we so often hear on this general subject, is that Aboriginal retention rates, while not good enough, while nowhere near retention rates for the wider community, are now at least at levels which would have been regarded as quite acceptable for the wider community just 15 years ago. It is sad that Aboriginal year 12 retention rates are only 30 per cent, but let us remember that this is where they all were just 15 years ago. I take also the point of the member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Dondas) about the importance of education in English. I recall a story that was once told by our friend and colleague the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) of a visit to a remote Aboriginal outstation by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. The minister came to the out-station' and he sat down and made a lengthy speech-in English, of course--explaining to the elders how important it was that their kids were educated in their Aboriginal languages. At the end of the minister's long speech, the elders stood up and said, 'Minister, are you aware of the Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter?' The minister said, 'Well, I'm sorry, I'm not.' They said, 'The Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter is helicopter, and, if you don't educate our kids in English, how on earth are our kids ever going to get on, and how on earth are they ever going to compete in the wider society?' SoI very much take the member for the Northern Territory's point; it was well made. The member for the Northern Territory also referred to what he says is a $3 million drop in funding that the territory will suffer under this bill. I want to point out that that statement is predicated upon transitional arrangements which have yet to be finalised. I am very confident that the territory government will have a strong ally in the member for the Northern Territory in negotiating the best possible deal for the territory. I also take the point that the member for the Northern Territory made that education in remote areas is vastly more expensive than education in urban centres such as Katherine, Alice Springs and Darwin. But I want to point out to the member that there are additional programs that will at least go part of the way to accommodating the problems that he so rightly refers to. This bill is establishing the principle of per capita funding in Aboriginal education. Essentially, per capita funding means that if you have the students you get the money. In other words, this is the best possible way to ensure that educational institutions are doing the right thing by their clients. Until now, funding has depended upon an annual negotiation. The trouble with annual negotiations is that you are never quite sure exactly how much money you",135,Representatives Main Committee
181,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment,MC 1338 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 are going to get from one year to the next, and you are never quite sure whether-this year, next year or the year after-your mates or someone else's mates are going to find themselves in positions of authority on the distributing panel. By moving to per capita funding we are establishing more transparency in the funding of Aboriginal education, and that is something which I think everyone in this House would applaud. As my friend and colleague the member for Sturt( Mr Pyne) pointed out, this bill also provides for performance reviews so that the providers of Aboriginal education should be subject to the same kinds of standards and performance testing which we expect of everyone else. The thing which always impresses me, Madam Deputy Speaker, whenever Aboriginal issues are debated in this parliament, is the care and the compassion which every member of the parliament brings to the subject. On this subject. I want to say how delighted I am that Senator John Herron is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. John Herron is a man of extraordinary integrity and great compassion. He is a great Australian. John Herron is the kind of person who could very well end up giving politicians a good name. When discussing Aboriginal subjects, I am always somewhat reminded of the words of Ken Slessor in his famous poem, Beach Burial. He was writing about a different subject; nevertheless, I think the words are apt: And each cross, the driven stake of tidewood, Bears the last signature of men, Written with such perplexity, with such bewildered pity, The words choke as they beginWe have struggled to come to grips with this issue-we have struggled for 208 years to come to grips with this issue-but we are getting there. When we do manage to bring about complete reconciliation, or reconciliation as complete as is humanly possible, between black and white Australians, it will be to the great glory of our nation and it will be one of the greatest days, if not the greatest day, in Australia's history. The way to do that is to remember that the things that unite us are always more important than the things that divide us. We white Australians have a lot more in common with black Australians than the newspapers would sometimes give credit for. Aboriginals' cultural memory extends back 40,000 years-and which of us white Australians can say that? They have had the stewardship of our nation for all but the last 200 years, and they will always have great honour for that. But the important thing to recall is that the average black Australian, like the average white Australian, wants to get ahead, wants a better deal for himself or herself, and in particular wants a better deal for his or her children. As my friend Charlie Perkins memorably said, 'We have got to get off our black butts, too'. That is something that is well remembered whenever we are discussing this subject. I would like to conclude by pointing to something which I think is a very welcome development. A lot of my friends and colleagues have been most disconcerted by some of the things that have happened with ATSIC recently and some of the controversy surrounding the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. They have worried that these controversies have brought Aboriginal Australians into disrepute. That is one way of looking at it-and certainly there have been some bad headlines over the last 12 months. But another way of looking at it is that there is now a new pluralism in Aboriginal politics. We now have Aboriginal people, on both sides of Aboriginal issues, standing up and speaking for themselves. It was not, as it happened, white fellows who raised some of the problems with the Hindmarsh Island Bridge; it was the Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1339 dissident Ngarrindjeri women. It was not, in fact, white fellows who raised some of the problems with ATSIC; it was people like Sharon Firebrace, Peter Yu and others, who were standing up and saying, 'We, the Aboriginal people, have got to be judged by the same standards of fairness and honesty by which everyone else is judged, and we have got to abide by the same standards of fairness and honesty which we expect to be delivered to us.' I think what has become apparent over the last 12 months or so is that some of the people whom we are accustomed to go to as spokesmen or spokeswomen for the Aboriginal people no more represent Aboriginal people than, say, the Liberal Party or the Labor Party represents the Australian people. Often we do speak for the whole of the Australian people, but more often we do not. Occasionally there is a transcendent moment when the representative of one party or one party can speak for the whole of the people. But mostly it does not happen, and one party is simply speaking for a faction, or indeed a fraction, of the Australian people. And so it is now with Aboriginal affairs as well. In conclusion, I want to indicate the government's strong intention to continue speaking to everyone in this debate-not just the people who agree with us, not just the people who disagree with us, but everyone. That is the only way that we are going to do justice to all Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 9 May. Second Reading Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (11.11 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to ensure that Australia can discharge its obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste. The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel convention was negotiated and in the chamber of December 1989. By coincidence, I actually took the bill through the House on that occasion on behalf of the then opposition. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is, for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the principal act defines waste as material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations, that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.",137,Representatives Main Committee
182,Mr Warwick Smith (Bass,"Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government andMC 1340 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion. The Basel convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is, both final disposal and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term 'disposal-. The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes have not been rejected as worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation. The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled and, as I said, in 1989 we endorsed that. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the many other countries which are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. The interpretation of the convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the convention. In the absence of these amendments, Australia will continue to be out of step with other parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the convention. In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes. The definition of hazardous waste, now to be adopted, is aligned with that in the convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act and, indeed, definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel convention meetings. In Australia a higher degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste. The bill provides for the establishment of a technical group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the ininister to decide whether he or she believes that a material falls within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated. The minister will have the power to issue evidentiary certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous waste. Also, by compiling a list of materials for which evidentiary certificates have been issued the minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not. This means, for example, that it will be possible to issue an evidentiary certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and that Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1341 it can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes. The evidentiary certificates will not be conclusive but will be prima facie evidence and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, the advice of the technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act. There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the convention and the views of our trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the convention. This would risk not only a breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all. The convention itself recognises that the hazard criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in detennining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant annex to the convention by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the technical group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments. Another key concept in the convention now adopted into the act is the definition of 'environmentally sound management'. The convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export requires that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import. The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the convention as taking all practicable steps to ensure that the hazardous waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The technical group will advise the minister to assist in the detennination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason it will include people with expertise in scientific and technical, social and economic, environmental and public health fields. The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the convention replaces the phrase in the principal act, 'dispose of safely'. In the principal act, 'dispose of safely' is defined in terms of an outcome, that is, that hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or the environment. By contrast, 'environmentally sound management' is defined now by reference to a process, that is, taking all practicable steps to prevent damage to human health and the environment. On the other hand, the definition of 'dispose of safely' appears to exclude any assessment of effluents and emissions from the disposal process. In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted and these will provide the context of the technical group's advice to the MC 1342 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill. Under the convention, the general rule is that parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non-parties. An exception to this is provided for in article 11, whereby parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other parties or with non-parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the convention. The main such agreement to which Australia is a party is the OECD decision on transboundary movements of hazardous waste destined for recovery operations which regulates transboundary movements of hazardous wastes among OECD countries. The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the convention, thus the OECD decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set oQt by the decision. Conversely, the decision classifies some materials as nonhazardous wastes, known as the OECD green list, and these materials may be traded without a pennit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into. The procedures by which the minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended once again to bring the act more closely into line with the convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the notification and consent procedures established by the convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the minister have regard to the prospect of processing hazardous waste within Australia rather than allowing export to take place. This is in accordance with article 4(2)(d) of the convention which requires parties to 'minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste.' The intent of this article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be efficient, safe and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost-effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued. The principal act already provides th-t there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to or instead of insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit for one reason or other, an insurance policy may not be paid out and in an appropriate case a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage. In other cases insurance may not be available and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements-insurance bonds and guarantees-to be assessed when the minister comes to a decision. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1343 Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently and that all convention requirements are met. Because the convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be completed by the time the amendments are ready to come into force. The act also addresses a number of aspects of the convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits-that is, for Australian consent or its denial to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal. There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill. The current system for recovery of the government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The minister has discretion to reduce these where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act. Penalties under the act have increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the convention and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements. A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealth. That is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effective. For example, identification of hazardous waste at customs barriers when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials. Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, known as the ADJR Act, has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This section is intended to extend but not limit the existing standing provisions which are provided under the ADJR Act. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and as an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The extended standing provided by the bill relates only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia, but persons or organisations from outside Australia could still obtain standing if they could otherwise demonstrate that they were 'persons aggrieved' in terms of the ADJR Act. The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups, both inside and outside government. In particular, detailed consultations have been held with a policy reference group made up of representatives of industry, environment groups, development and MC 1344 MAIN COMMITrEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 cooperation groups and unions. State and territory governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the reference group and to the states and territories and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultation an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is the prospect of bans on transboundary movement of hazardous waste from developed to developing countries. This issue was the subject of a decision at the second meeting of the conference of parties to the Basel convention in March 1994 and an amendment decision at the third conference of parties to the convention in September 1995. This latter decision, known as the ban amendment, implements an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposals from countries listed in annex VII of the convention-parties and other states which are members of the OECD and the EC and Liechtenstein-to non-annex VII countries and phases out by the end of 1997 and bans from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from annex VII countries to non-annex VII countries. In its explanation of vote at that meeting Australia said that, and I quote: It is essential parties have a common understanding of what is prohibited. and indicated that it would, and I quote again: only consider ratifying the ban amendment when the work on hazardous characteristics is completed to Australia's satisfaction. The work referred to is being carried out by the Basel convention's technical working group and is aimed at clarifying the wastes covered by the convention. It is important to note that the bill does not .implement the ban amendment. This government is yet to consider its position on ratification of the amendment, and before any decision is made on ratification the government's new process for treaty-making must be observed. The export of waste for final disposal to developing countries, however, is not generally regarded as an acceptable practice. This is now reflected in the bill. Indeed, if I cast my mind back to 1989 when this bill was originally introduced, that was a matter of concern then. Indeed, the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of exceptional circumstances is transparent, and subject to scrutiny by the community. The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than is the case at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes that may be covered by the Basel convention, and Australia's trade in them, suggest that the total trade may be somewhere between $100 and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this trade takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD's decision. The kinds of materials in which we trade with developing countries of our region include spent lead acid batteries; metal bearing wastes, such as sludges, slags and drosses; and a miscellaneous range of wastes variously containing metals, such as lead or arsenic. These are the kinds of materials which will be regulated under the amended act. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1345 Suggestions that ferrous and most non-ferrous scrap metal will be caught up under the convention are mistaken. In general, the amended act will not cover trade in products, mineral ores and concentrates; processed minerals and metals, petroleum products; and forest products, including uncontaminated waste paper, textiles or materials produced to meet comme.ICial specifications intended for recycling. ,. The distinction between wastes on the one hand, and non-wastes on the other, will be subject to consideration and advice by the technical group and it will exclude co-products, intermediaries and by-products from the definition of hazardous wastes. The technical group will also be giving priority to assisting the minister in determining which of the OECD green list materials are clearly inside the scope of the act and which are clearly outside it, with a view to the minister's reflecting this in evidentiary certificates. Consultations with all interested parties will continue, as regulations and supportive administrative arrangements are developed. Bilateral discussions between Australia and our developing country trading partners make it clear that they wish and expect Australia to abide by the rules to which so many of the countries of the world have agreed. A continued failure to do so may lead to retaliatory action by these countries which, in tum, could threaten trade far more seriously than the controls required by the convention and now established by this bill. It is clearly time, in the government's view, for Australia to give effect to the obligation it has taken upon itself, just as the vast majority of its trading partners have done. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (11.34 a.m.)-This bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is a consolidated version, as we have heard, of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995, which was introduced by the Labor government in 1995 during the life of the last parliament. It incorporates a number of amendments moved by the previous Labor environment minister. The opposition, therefore, supports this bill. As we have heard, the major reason for amending the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 was, and is still, the requirement to remedy the discrepancy that existed, or exists, between Australia's international obligation under the Basel convention and our domestic legislation. The Basel convention is based on the following principles: the generation of hazardous wastes must be reduced to a minimum; where it is unavoidable, the waste must be disposed of as close as possible to the source of generation; hazardous wastes may not be exported to Antarctica or to states which are not parties either to the Basel convention or a treaty established under equivalent standards, or to parties which have banned all imports of such wastes, and in the case of any trans boundary hazardous waste movements, the principles of environmentally sound management and disposal must be observed. The aim of the Basel convention is therefore to reduce to a minimum the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes consistent with their safe management and disposal. The convention covers wastes destined for recycling as well as for final disposal. The principal act's definition of hazardous waste, however, does not cover material sent for recovery operations. The principal act's definition of waste is confined to material which is worthless. This definition has previously been construed as excluding wastes destined for MC 1346 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 recovery or recycling operations. This means the act does not comply with Australia's obligations under the convention. The opposition clearly supports making Australia's legislation conform to the international conv-ntion as closely as possible. We also support the establishment of the technical group of scientific and technical experts to advise the minister on definitional questions. This group will provide advice to the minister on what is and is not a hazardous waste under the bill's definition of hazardous waste. The technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues. The amendment bill removes the phrase 'dispose of safely' and replaces it with the concept of environmentally sound management. Environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes or other wastes is defined in the convention as follows: . . . taking all practicable steps to ensure that hazardous wastes or other wastes are managed in a manner which will protect human health and the environment against adverse effects which may result from such wastes. We have been assured by the minister and his department that the replacement of 'dispose of safely' from the principal act does not translate to a weakening of Australia's commitment to environmental protection. We accept this assurance, although obviously we will be checking it very closely, and we also acknowledge the wisdom in our domestic legislation mirroring the international convention as closely as possible. But it should not be to the detriment of standards. However, since the opposition has actually done all the work in developing this legislation, it would like an assurance from the minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) that the amended legislation receives the administrative support that is required to see it properly implemented. This is the most important point I want to make today. I have been informed that the new government intends-and this is very alarming-to' dismantle the Environment Protection Agency's waste management branch. This is the body in the federal government which administers a number of international conventions including the Basel convention. It also develops protocols on important environmental matters such as sea dumping and agricultural chemicals. It would seem rather ironic, to say the least, that, at the very same time this parliament is passing amending legislation that will ensure Australia's law accurately reflects its international obligations, the Minister for the Environment is dismantling the arm of government responsible for the legislation's proper administration. It would be a very curious outcome indeed. Indeed, I think it would be an outcome that would be condemned widely not just by environment groups in this country but also by industry and by our international partners. Are we today creating a legal facade, legislation without the necessary administrative and technical support? I would like the minister representing the Minister for the Environment, although he is not here at the moment, to guarantee that the EPA's waste management branch will not disappear and indeed, will be resourced at the same level or better than it was under the previous Labor government, otherwise what we are going through here right now is a farce and Australia will not be able to guarantee that it can meet its international obligations. This bill has been subject to an extensive consultation process and has wide industry support, and the opposition will support it. But we do so, knowing that the whole process of meeting our international obligations will be placed in jeopardy if the government disbands that section Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1347 of the environment department under the Environment Protection Agency which is responsible for ensuring that we meet our international, let alone our domestic, obligations and I for one do not want to be seen to be party to such a farce. SoI put the government on notice that any attempt to dismantle, diminish or reduce in any way the resources to the sector will be viewed by the opposition as a significant betrayal of trust. Ms WORTH (Adelaide) (11.39 a.m.)-The government has introduced new rules to ensure that Australia does not take on international obligations without proper scrutiny in the parliament. But that does not imply that we are proposing to take our international obligations lightly. Quite the contrary: our intention is to ensure that we fully understand what international rules mean for Australia before we give effect to them. This legislation rectifies a situation in which Australia took on international rules without properly understanding their implications. As a result, the legislation that was passed has been found to be out of step with international practice and international law. We are now putting into place a more thorough legislative instrument to ensure that Australia meets conscientiously the obligations taken on almost exactly four years ago when the convention came into force. It is not only in accordance with our international obligations that the current act needs amendment. The act as it stands is cumbersome and inflexible, and needs adjusting to ensure that it can be administered efficiently and with the flexibility needed in the various circumstances that are likely to occur from time to time. The extension of the ambit of this act to include wastes for recovery and recycling is highly significant. It brings under the act a far wider range of materials than has been covered up to now. These materials include many metal bearing weights. Some of these are things such as spent lead acid batteries which are heavily traded around the world, and where most parties accept that the trade can easily involve subjecting other countries and their communities to significant environmental risks associated with secondary smelting of lead. Other materials are the secondary materials produced in metal refining. There are processes established by this act to ensure that careful attention is paid to whether these materials should be judged to be wastes or not, and whether they are hazardous or not. In general, only if they pass both tests-that is, that they are both wastes and hazardous-will they be covered by the act. These processes are necessary to ensure that the act does not inadvertently pick up materials which do not present an environmental threat and should not be regulated. Most of Australia's trade in hazardous waste, especially in the last couple of years, has occurred with other countries of the OECD. In 1992, OECD countries agreed on a separate and particular regime for managing trade in hazardous waste, using a listing system dividing hazardous waste into red, amber and green categories on the basis of comparative hazard. Under the Basel convention such an agreement is possible and the act makes provision for such agreements to be given recognition and for their rules to be established by regulation. One of the conditions is that the rules established by such separate agreements would not reduce the level of environment protection provided. This bill has been the subject of extensive consultation processes. As is the nature of things, not everybody involved in those consultations finds every aspect of the bill ideal. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the bill has been substantially improved by the discussions that have taken place on it and the final outcomes represent the most satisfactory reconciliation of MC 1348 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 competing interest that could be arrived at. Industry interests have advised that they support passage of this bill. All international instruments relating to trade in hazardous waste have been troubled by controversy on how to accurately define hazardous waste and also on the degree to which hazardous waste should be treated as a range of materials for which separate arrangements are needed. Countries of the OECD solve this problem by drawing up detailed lists of wastes and developing a control system with varying degrees of restraint, depending on how hazardous the waste is. The Basel convention set up a somewhat different system which relied on a short list of waste streams and contaminates, and a list of hazards. The trouble with this system was that it did not provide the level of certainty which countries actually needed when they were trying to give effect to the convention on a case by case basis. In September last year, at the third meeting of the conference of the parties, there was agreement that priority attention should be given to reducing the uncertainties surrounding which wastes are covered by the convention. Several meetings have now been held. Progress, has been encouraging, and at the most recent meeting of the convention's technical working group in Kuala Lumpur last month delegates arrived at a provisional listing of wastes, which goes some considerable way towards providing the certainty that Australia and other countries have been seeking. The draft lists drawn up include those agreed to be subject to the convention, those agreed not to be subject to the convention, those on which a decision has yet to be taken, and even some which perhaps ought to be subject to the convention but appear not to be. These lists as yet have no legal significance and that cannot be expected for some time. However, they do provide useful guidance to countries in making decisions about what materials should and should not be covered. I would merely note here that many of the materials of most concern to Australia have now been settled, including many now on the list of non-wastes. That has provided considerable reassurance to parts of industry. There has been criticism in some quarters of the Basel convention as a piece of international law. Most international conventions are inherently imperfect, negotiated as they are by compromise amongst countries whose vital interests all differ. On the other hand, most international conventions allow a degree of flexibility in their application. Concerns over the Basel convention will not be resolved by pointing out its flaws. They will only be resolved by working within the convention forums for a process of incremental improvement. These are the rules that our trading partners have agreed to and we must proceed hand in hand with them in the process of debate and discussion aimed at generating better outcomes both for the international environment and for Australia's trading interests. The debate about trade and the environment is a very active one and the Basel convention is a concrete example of that debate. We can use the convention in some ways as a test case in order to find solutions which provide the best level of environment protection for the vulnerable, without imposing unnecessary constraints upon trade. The debate on these issues in Australia has been a lively one and we are now well positioned to contribute to international discussions in a constructive and helpful manner. There is plenty of lively debate in Australia these days on environmental issues-and I would say so there should be. Last year there were significant protests over nuclear testing in the South Pacific arid expressions of fears and concern for that environment and the South Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1349 Pacific in general. Now we will have, and I am sure we will continue to have, community discussion and, I believe, ultimate anger as minority groups join forces in the other place to prevent the implementation of our $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Some in the other place seem to have no understanding of the good common sense of selling off one-third of one national treasure to invest in another national treasure. Such an investment would fund a national vegetation initiative to tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems; the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin through the implementation of the Murray-Darling 2001 project; the undertaking of a national land and water resources audit; the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity; and the coast and clean seas initiative to tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas. The people attempting to block these initiatives are the very ones who claim to have special interests in our environment. Environment and hazardous waste issues should be considered globally and locally. There are in my own electorate a number of local environment issues that I have addressed on other occasions. One such issue is a very important one, and that has been the dumping of over 200,000 tonnes of hazardous waste at the Australian National site at the Islington Railyards at Kilburn. The former Minister for Transport and now shadow minister for foreign affairs ( Mr Brereton) announced a $5 million clean-up of part of that site, believe it or not, three or four days before the election was announced. This happened after two years of agitation on my part; after criticism of the Health Commission in South Australia about a previous proposed clean-up; after intervention on the part of South Australia's Environment Protection Authority; and only after a report which the then minister himself in fact ordered from the CSIRO which found: In its current condition the Islington Railyards northern site area represents a potential health hazard to nearby residents and workers. The pre-election announcement was just one more political stunt, but I should put on the record that, following the change of government on 2 March, I have already had meetings with the Minister for the Environment in South Australia, David Wotton, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Sharp) and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), and have made representations to the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey). I am now quite determined that there will be proper action on this issue, action made essential after previous neglect, and made more difficult because of the Beazley black hole. I reiterate: we have national obligations, international obligations and local obligations to the environment, which is now considered to be such an important issue-and, I would argue, belatedly considered so. I commend the bill to the House. (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill make a return to the government's political agenda. It was first introduced by the previous government last year. The bill covers areas of the transportation of hazardous waste where Australia is certainly lagging behind the rest of the developed world. As the previous Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, put so succinctly in March last year when he introduced the bill, 'The existing Commonwealth legislation fails to meet our obligations under the Basel convention.' The Basel convention-as indicated by other speakers-was adopted in 1989 and ratified by Australia in 1992. It ties its signatories to a stringent code of conduct in the transportation and trade of hazardous waste-a code which we have been guilty of neglecting. As a nation",139,Representatives Main Commfitee
183,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (11.50 A.m.),"I am very glad to see the Hazardous WasteMC 1350 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 which prides itself on its integrity in its dealings with the international community, as a nation which regards its diligence in meeting its international obligations as an example from which others can learn, we cannot afford to drag our feet any longer on such an internationally important issue as the transportation of hazardous waste. Over the last 10 to 20 years, as we have become more attuned to the needs of our environment, we have been led to ask ourselves some difficult questions about the transportation and disposal of toxic waste products. This bill is another example of how we have slowly begun to educate ourselves. It is an example of the steps that we must take in order to reverse our environment's dire state of health. Some say that these lessons are being learnt too late and too slowly. It is hard not to disagree when one can see all around us the devastation of our environment continuing, seemingly unabated. I suppose only our children will know whether we have acted soon enough; whether we are now acting with enough speed to reverse our environment's decline. I think I can say, without being glib, that perhaps we would be better off to not be around when our children are old enough to answer that question. Depending on whom we talk to, we find that Australia's record on protecting the environment on both a national and an international level is either commendable or contemptible. It is true that we have led the way on certain environmental issues. The former Labor government's Landcare program was an attempt, on a vast scale, to begin the process of reversing the steady erosion of the Australian land. However, we are presently viewed with a jaundiced eye by our neighbours in the South Pacific for not supporting the Association of Small Island States' proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2005. In fact, in regard to setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have now been left behind by the western European nations and are in danger of being isolated further by the United States and Canada. In relation to the trade of hazardous waste, our recent history is similarly chequered. Per capita, between 1990 and 1993, Australia exported three times more hazardous waste than did the United States-a shameful position to find ourselves in. Those responsible for trading Australia's waste overseas have in the past taken advantage of a loophole which exists in the present act-namely, its definition of waste differs from that used by the Basel convention. Thankfully, the present bill will change this situation. In the past, under the guise of 'recycling', Australia has sent thousands of tonnes of toxic waste to darken our neighbours' doorsteps, rather than face the problem ourselves. This has all been done without contravening the 1989 act, but it is, I believe, still against the spirit of the convention. Because waste products intended for recycling were not covered by the previous act, there was no requirement for companies to report the export of such products to the Australian authorities and in tum no prior informed consent was obtained from the countries of import. Nor was there any inquiry made as to whether these wastes would be managed in an environmentally sound manner by the importing state. The environmental organisation Greenpeace has since reported that waste exported by Australia for recycling has routinely been treated by importing countries in south-east Asia in an unsafe manner which has resulted in damages to human health and the environment in those countries. I wonder, how many Australians are aware of this state of affairs? Who would not be appalled at the thought of our waste destroying the lives of others? Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1351 As was mentioned in the other House during debate on this bill, in 1994 Australia was the main exporter of lead acid batteries to Indonesia. In 1992, we exported more than 11,000 tonnes of lead acid batteries, compared with the United Kingdom's 700 tonnes in 1993. In the following year, we exported 20,000 kilograms of lead battery waste to Hong Kong. Up until now, lead battery acid would be considered a hazardous waste by anyone's definition-anyone's definition, it appears, but ours. Lead battery acid is a destructive pollutant and, if not disposed of correctly, can seriously affect people's health and safety. However, in the past we have considered such waste as a 'good, intended for recycling' and, as such, it was excluded from control under the act. Again, this is a situation which I am pleased this bill will now rectify. Yet as much as I commend the bill, I also think it raises just as many questions as it seeks to answer. It raises questions, not just about our past conduct in regard to the trade of serious toxic waste, but also it raises basic questions which reflect upon the desire of government and of the Australian people to change the way we live in order to produce less waste and in so doing, save our collective hides. While I am pleased to see that we are strengthening our position on such an important environmental issue as the transportation of hazardous waste, I think that we have largely missed another central provision of the Basel convention, and that is that the contracting parties shall: minimise the generation of hazardous and other wastes. Simply by taking a look around our cities and our towns-not just at the factories and the waste stations, but also at our homes and our local rubbish tips-we can see that this is quite obviously not happening. Our generation of waste continues without interruption. We often hear our leaders talking about the economic ramifications of living beyond our means. But I doubt that there are many Australians who understand or appreciate the extent to which we are living on environmental credit and in the process, that we are destroying our country forever. The hazardous waste bill we are debating today is just the end result of our nation's insatiable appetite. The thing that alanns me, and which the debate surrounding this bill has constantly raised, is that despite the warnings and the future global emergencies which scientists and naturalists alert us to, Australians continue to produce waste at an alarming rate of knots. Approach virtually anyone in the street and ask that person about the state of the Australian or, in fact, the global environment. More than likely, if he or she has read a newspaper or watched the television in the last 10 years, that person will say, 'Oh yeah, it is dreadful, isn't it? We have got to do something about that.' Or, the comment will be, 'Don't worry, they'll find an answer.' In a poll taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May of 1992, 70.3 per cent of respondents considered that environmental concerns and economic growth had equal importance. And 18.8 per cent considered that environmental concerns were more important than economic growth. Yet despite their good intentions, most Australians are inadvertently part of the waste-producing juggernaut. Australians may feel strongly about the environment, but we continue to buy products wrapped in excessive and unnecessary packaging. When we shop, we fill up half a dozen plastic bags, which we promptly dispose of upon returning home-and I am as gUilty as others. The vast majority of Australians have not twigged to the link between our devastated environment and our rampant waste-producing consumerism. MC 1352 MAIN COMMIITEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 When people say, 'We have got to do something about it,' most mean 'we' as referring to the government. Or, when people say, 'They will find an answer,' most mean the teams of scientists and researchers in whom they place all their trust. And yet while the government and the scientists have enormous responsibilities, part of which we are fulfilling here today, Australians have to start recognising that they can, and must, play an important role in doing something about it as well. We can no longer live our lives on this earth saying, 'Damn the consequences,' or we will find the consequences have, in fact, damned us. As evidence of this point, I would like the members present to pay particularly close attention to some of the following figures, which I have researched. In 1988, every man, woman and child in Sydney generated the equivalent of a tonne of waste. That is over three million tonnes of waste in one year. Eight years ago these figures were taken out. Considering the fact that our nation's population is growing at the rate of 1.2 per cent each year-similar in size to Wollongong's population of 220,000-this is a situation which I doubt would have improved. Rather, it is one that would have become worse. Members should also be aware that this figure does not include the 70,000 motor vehicles and two million tyres discarded by Sydney siders in that year. The domestic garbage disposed of by Sydneysiders in our bicentennial year included paper to the equivalent of one million trees-enough timber, incidentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, to build 40,000 homes; enough glass to make 200 million soft drink bottles; enough metal to construct 75,000 new cars; and two billion drink containers' worth of plastic. This was all discarded just in Sydney. From these figures, it is not surprising that it has been estimated that Sydney, in particular, will run out of landfill sites before the tum of the century. In relation to the ecological footprint, or ecological impact, made by Sydneysiders, it takes 4.5 hectares of productive land now to support each individual in this campaign of consumption. That is 4.5 hectares compared to an average of 1.7 hectares across the world. Putting it plainly, every Australian affects the environment 20 times more than every Indonesian. Sydneysiders and, I assume, all Australians have lived with what environmentalists call the myth of disposal for far too long. For far too long we have taken it as a given that we could take out of the earth whatever we wanted and we could throwaway whatever we liked and it would never affect us. Of course, the age of recycling has also well and truly begun; yet I am afraid that recycling on its own is not going to be enough. What we need to do is reduce our waste, be it toxic, hazardous or otherwise. If we can succeed in reducing our incredibly high levels of waste, then the question of how to dispose of it-whether by landfill, incineration or export-will no longer be as pressing. It is obvious that the message is just not getting through to average Australians. As I have said before, they have not yet twigged to the link between their lifestyles and the damage to the environment. We will not be able to cut down our levels of waste while continuing to live in the way to which we have become accustomed. Compromise, unfortunately, will not get us there. As with most things worth doing, there will have to be some level of inconvenience. As the worldwide respected environmentalist David Suzuki writes: This new sacred truth of raised consciousness-that we can fit saving the planet into our lifestyle-is as patently false as are the inherited ones we cling to. And it is dangerous. We can't negotiate with a faltering life-support system. We can't buy a future for our children. The only thing we might be able to buy them-if we act now-is a little time; the time it takes to embrace a new way of living, a new world view. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1353 Further to the questions the bill raises about our level of waste production, I think it also raises serious questions about the extent to which Australia wishes to lead the world on environmental matters. Does Australia want to show the flag, or will it continue, as is the case with this bill, to play catch-up, doing only the bare minimum required by its international obligations or when pressured by its trading partners or the sway of world opinion? As has been stated by other speakers, this bill is all about bringing ourselves into line with the other signatories to the Basel convention. But we are not going any further. We are not inspiring our international partners such as the United States-which, incidentally, remains conspicuously absent from the membership roll of the convention-to go further with us. We are simply doing the bare minimum required. In the second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) said: ... it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. Those rules are the ones laid down by the Basel convention. But does he not see our adherence to the convention as also being an important environmental statement to the rest of the world? Does he not see it as also being an important step in putting an end to Australia's role in the shameful environmental degradation of our neighbours through the exportation of our toxic waste? This is the sort of political approach that we need to change. And to do so we need to change opinions at ground level. The recent tragedy in Port Arthur showed how quickly politicians and governments were able to come together and produce a solution to the problems of gun control in this country. The plans devised by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) and the state premiers have received almost total support from the Australian people. Unfortunately, it took a tragedy in order to get action from our leaders and to change the opinions of Australians. Before that terrible day, most Australians recognised that controlling guns would be in everyone's interest, yet the issue failed to make political waves. The people did not ask the governments and, by and large, we failed to act. I fear that it will take an environmental tragedy on the scale of Port Arthur to bring about the ground swell of opinion needed to force the kind of action we need from government, at all levels, to solve our environmental problems. As I said, Senator Hill's second reading speech on this bill was indicative of the political mind-set we need to overcome if we are to salvage our environment. While I appreciate that the political realities of economics and business continue to tie our hands, and while I understand that blind idealism will never get us anywhere, I hope that one day we will reach the point when environmental legislation is passed not because we look bad or suffer economically if we fail to have it passed, but because it makes environmental sense-first and foremost. Perhaps it is too much of a homily, but if we do not change the way we think now, as Australians and as international citizens, those same economic ties will become like anvils around our necks as the chance to restore this country's environment slips beyond our grasp. As the opposition has stated, while supporting the bill before the HouseI am particularly pleased that we have finally got it there. I am not saying that this present government is at fault any more than the past government. But I am saying that the conventional wisdom which we always seem to put in environmental legislation before this House must change. It is about MC 1354 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 time that all of us, as both legislators and leaders, stopped to think, but most importantly to look, learn and listen to what is happening within Australia, to what people's concerns are and how we should be meeting our obligations to overcome those problems. In commending the bill, I believe we should go that step further. We should lead by example. Australia, as a country that we continually say has come of age, and Australians, as citizens who stand up and say we are so proud of our country, should not follow. We should stand up and we should lead. If it means that at times we are going to suffer for it economically, I believe the average Australian will understand and appreciate that if it is explained to them what the long-term ramifications of not taking these decisions could mean to them, to their children and to their children's children. We cannot continue to complain and to whinge when a particular bill comes before the House. The pressure must be applied continually to make sure that legislation is enacted so that Australia stands proudly as a nation; to make sure that we will lead by example and start cleaning up at our own doorstep the environmental problems we have created through industry and through grabbing the short term economic return for so many years in the past. I am not condemning the people of the past. Perhaps inadvertently, they did not understand or appreciate some of the mistakes they were making at the time. But, with the knowledge we now have available to us, I do condemn anyone today if stringent steps are not taken to make sure that we have a country we are not only proud of, but one that environmentally will sustain all future generations within this continent. I commend the bill to the House. previous speaker, the member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio), and her interest in this topic. I also wish to make a contribution on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, which is generating considerable interest in the parliament. The object of this bill, as stated in the act, is to regulate the export, import and transit of hazardous waste to ensure that exported, imported or transited waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner so that human beings and the environment, both within and outside Australia, are protected from the harmful effects of the waste. The aims of the bill are to give effect to the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes .and their Disposal, and to agreements and arrangements of the kind mentioned in article 11 of the convention-that is the article that is particularly concerned with bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements. Briefly, the Basel convention was adopted in the city of Basel i:n Switzerland on 22 March 1989. It entered into force, as they say, one year later in March 1990, and Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and many other countries that are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. If we do not do so we may find ourselves in an embarrassing situation when we send this sort of waste overseas, as we do from time to time, that shipments may be rejected at other countries. The act, when implemented, will also give greater certainty as to what is and is not hazardous waste. A technical group will oversee that and make recommendations to the minister, who will issue evidentiary certificates.",149,Representatives Main Committee
184,Mr Cobb (Parkes) (12.09 P.m.),"I acknowledge the vigorous contribution from theThursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1355 I believe total trade in hazardous waste around the world is not massive. There is about $100 million to $200 million worth each year, the majority of which takes place within OECD countries. As I understand it, something of the order of 350 million tonnes of hazardous waste is generated in the world annually. Australia, at present, does not have the facilities to deal with some of these wastes generated in the processes of making hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls-the PCBs; and the dioxins. These are found in plastics, pesticides, refrigerants, fire extinguishers and solvents et cetera, so certainly Australia, as a developed country, does have an interest in this matter. I would like to contrast the handling and the problems of hazardous waste that previous speakers have mentioned with similar problems that have been encountered with nuclear waste. There are lessons in that industry that I think are pertinent to this industry. Most radioactive waste in Australia is generated from ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We produce radiopharmaceuticals, radioisotopes and radiochemicals, which we use in the field of medicine and in many industries and for research purposes. Australia has benefited from those for some decades now because they improve our health. They are used for diagnoses in particular, as well as for the treatment of certain diseases such as cancer. They have saved lives in this country; they have enhanced the environment in the way we have been able to use them; and they benefit many industries, particularly the agricultural industry. In fact, so fast is nuclear medicine growing at present-I believe the growth rate is about 14 per cent cumulative every year-that of everyone alive today about 50 per cent can expect to have some nuclear medicine procedure, whether it be for diagnosis or treatment, some time in their lifetime. In saying all this, I want to stress that the reactor at Lucas Heights is a very small one. The total fuel load is only about seven kilograms compared with, say, a power generating plant which would have about 190 tonnes of fuel there and it is enriched to about 60 per cent uranium 235. The vast bulk of the waste that comes from the nuclear industry in Australia is not high-level waste at all-in fact, only about three per cent of it by volume, even though that contains about 95 per cent of the radioactivity. We send overseas most of the high-level waste and in that regard we abide by international treaties, not unlike the Basel convention on hazardous waste. It is the low-level waste, and the way we have treated it in an irrational manner in Australia, that I just want to make some comments on. This low-level waste is about 90 per cent of the volume, even though it is only one per cent of the radioactivity. There is of course the intermediate-level waste which takes up about seven per cent of the volume and makes up about four per cent of the radioactivity. The low-level waste comes from hospitals, laboratories, industries such as the aircraft industry and primary industry, et cetera. It is not some dreadful hazardous waste. It is mainly clothing such as overalls and goggles. The low-level waste is made up of other things such as paper and rags, tools, air filters in buildings, et cetera. It does not require special shielding during its handling and transport. In fact, it is suitable for shallow land burial. It is usually compacted into 200 litre drums-the old 44-gallon drums-or it is incinerated and the ash is put into drums. A certain amount of intermediate-level waste comes from resins, chemical sludges, reactor componeIits, metal fuel cIaddings and so on. This is also solidified and needs some shielding in concrete or bitumen .. MC 1356 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 What Australia needs is a national repository for this relatively hannless waste. Previous governments, including the present opposition when it was in government, recognised this and a search was conducted throughout Australia for a low-populated, arid and seismically stable area. In the early 1990s, eight such sites were identified. One of those sites falls partly in western New South Wales-the Olary area. It is an area of about 48,000 square kilometres, taking in Broken Hill on its south-eastern boundary. It was interesting to see the reaction to that when these announcements were first made. I have a newspaper article from the Barrier Daily Truth-the union controlled and owned paper in Broken Hill, in my electorate-of 17 March 1994. The article is headed 'Toxic waste site ""ideal'"" and it states: Mayor Peter Black has said that the use of the North Mine as a site to house low level nuclear waste should have been further explored. Mayor Black said people often confuse the tenns toxic and nuclear. He said that the North Mine would have been ""absolutely ideal"" to house low level radioactive waste material from hospitals and schools in concrete tubs underground. The article further states: Mayor Black said city council had looked at the use of the North Mine or other sites around Broken Hill to house low level nuclear waste. Council investigated the proposal on the basis of an invitation to sublJlit an expression of interest to the then Minister for Environment Ros Kelly. ""Bill Beckrogeas the local state memberopposed it and we didn't pursue it further."" Mayor Black goes on to lament: ""Now it appears other sites like Kalgoorlie and Mt Isa are now being considered and it appears we may well have missed the boat on the matter."" In a similar sense this was backed up by the city council's manager, Mr Don Best, in an article on 23 August 1994, with a similar headline 'Council chief backs Olary waste dump'. The article states: A proposed radioactive waste site to be established in the Olary region has been supported by the City Council's Manager of Environmental Health, Mr Don Best. ""I believe a radioactive waste repository could be safely established in the -lary region . . ."" He went on to say: ""It is plain that the majority of Australians are opposed to the siting of a repository in their region, not for factual or scientific reasons, but because of lack of knowledge of the true situation caused by the continual sensationalism of media reports and the weak 'win votes at any cost' attitude of most politicians who speak out against the siting of a repository in their electorates,"" he said. ""It is time common sense prevailed."" Mr Best said. ""The area of concern to the inhabitants of this city""that is Broken Hill""is the -lary region. a 48,000 square kilometres area stretching from Olary, SA, to about 250 kilometres north east of Broken Hill."" Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1357 According to Mr Best's report to Council, the city is located on the very edge of the region near the southern boundary. ""The nearest potentially suitable site in the region is about 50 kilometres from the city and most of the sites are more than a hundred kilometres from here,"" he said. He went on to mention the sorts of things that would be stored there if that site were selected-for instance, glassware, metal scraps, industrial gauges, luminous exit signs, watches, electron tubes, smoke detectors and lightly contaminated soil and so on. He drew attention to the fact that such sites have been set up overseas. He said that mainly solid wastes would be transported and disposed of at the national repository. All that is fairly unremarkable and logical to some extent in itself, but it shows the problem that we have in··this country with waste-whether it be hazardous waste or nuclear waste. Only on 26 April this year, the same paper, the Barrier Daily Truth, ran the same photo from two years ago of the mayor standing near the sign which reads 'City of Broken Hill Nuclear Free Zone' and on the same page had one headline which read 'Revolt over nuclear dumping' and another which read 'Council united against waste'. I was interested to read that the same mayor, Mayor Peter Black, said: ... it was distressing to fmd yet again Broken Hill has been placed on the short list ... one of eight sites . . . as a potential nuclear dumping site in Australia by the new Federal Government. It was the old federal government that did it, of course. The article continued: Mayor Black took the view the Commonwealth government was finding itself in the same bind as the old government, that in Sydney there were quite literally acres covered in drums containing low level nuclear waste. I rang ANSTO this morning to find out the volume of waste involved. They said it is all housed in one building about 30 metres by 10 metres, and that building contains about 80 to 90 per cent of the waste in Sydney. So it does not take up acres of ground. Mayor Black continues to say in this article: ""Truly the governments in Australia have to come to terms with the fact this waste has to be disposed."" This is quite correct. It continues: ""Equally truly, it's got to be disposed of in such a way it's not to infringe the rights, indeed the entitlement, of any community in AustraIia.,"" Mayor Black said. Council has resolved to pursue the matter vigorously, he added. that is mewould come out in full support of the position adopted historically by the people of Broken Hill. If you look at the history, he was taking a totally different attitude only a couple of years before. I raise all this to put into perspective the outrageous scaremongering that seems to inflict all of us from time to time when we talk about waste-whether it be hazardous waste or nuclear waste-in this country. We are all guilty-backbenchers, ministers, mayors of cities and others-and a lot of the comment is based on ignorance. People cynically misuse people's fear in grubby chases for votes and other sorts of things. I find that distressing indeed, if we are to have any hope of getting some sensible policy in this country. Those recent comments of Mayor Black's in the Barrier Daily Truth, I believe, came out of a statement made by New",154,Representatives Main Committee
185,Mayor Black Said He Hoped Mr Cobb,"MC 1358 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 South Wales acting environmental minister, Bob Debus, when he addressed state parliament. This was published on ANZAC Day in the Daily Telegraph Mirror this year. The article said: The Federal Government yesterday revealed that Broken Hill had been shortlistedit had only come out two or three years beforeas a potential dump for nuclear waste. This would mean that nuclear waste would have to be trucked through a number of undisclosed western Sydney suburbsto get there. He threatened to withdraw the police escort from the thing if this was done. The article continues: He said weapons-grade nuclear waste would be transported from Lucas Heights in Sydney through western Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the cities of Bathurst and Orangeon to Dubbo and Broken Hill. It continues: And he said the plan would tum Broken Hill into a 'nuclear wasteland'. We would be putting only low-level waste on the site we are talking about. If you slept beside a drum of it for a whole year, you would probably get the equivalent of about two, three or four millisieverts, virtually what people get in background radiation anyhow. If we went to Bondi Beach for half an hour and exposed ourselves, we would probably get twice that amount. He is talking about weapons-grade nuclear waste. We do not have any weapons-grade nuclear waste in Australia. It is only enriched to 60 per cent, as I said earlier. For weaponsgrade, you would need enrichment to at least 80 per cent, if not in excess of 90 per cent. He talks about turning Broken Hill into a nuclear wasteland. Even if we were taking weaponsgrade waste out there, there is no suggestion from either the previous government or this government that it would be put in Broken Hill itself. It will be hundreds of kilometres away, most likely, even if that site were selected. It is just breathtaking to see the way these things are misstated-and often deliberately, I believe. He goes on about the Howard government turning Broken Hill into the nuclear waste dumping ground of Australia. The relevant minister had not even made a statement about it at all. It is quite disgraceful and sad that we have these examples around in Australia. I mention all this because I believe that increasingly we are going to get similar sensational statements about hazardous waste. A previous state government in New South Wales tried to set up a toxic waste incinerator and find a site so that we could get rid of some hazardous waste in Australia, rather than shipping it off overseas as we are talking about in the bill today. Everybody went so bananas about it that there could be no rational debate in this country about it at all, and all political parties shelved it. I can understand the emotion, but a lot of it was based on total misinformation. If we pass the bill today, it will be a step forward. I know that it arouses emotions, irrationality and difficulties, and these will tend to increase as people become more aware of the toxic and hazardous wastes that exist in our community. In closing, I want to say that we need uniform and properly thought through rules and procedures on how we handle these wastes, both within Australia and overseas. We have to draw on the wisdom of the experts not only within this country but overseas as well. We have to have cooperation between states and between countries. We have to have a greater Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1359 understanding in the community of what we are talking about. A proper education programwhich has been sadly lacking, I believe-is a necessary part of this. We have to have greater openness and transparency and less point scoring. We need honesty in our debate and discussion of these issues. I commend the bill to the House. clear, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Cobb) said, that we need uniform legislation and we need legislation for the safe storage of waste material. The alternative, of course, is unsafe storage. I get mightily confused by those people who protest at every attempt to seek safe storage for this material but who are quite happy to leave it lying scattered around our cities. It is a nonsense. As the previous speaker said, there is a close correlation between hazardous waste and nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is an area in which I do have some expertise. In 1974, the policy of the Australian Labor Party was to mine, process and reprocess uranium. I was one of the people instrumental in changing that policy, and I thought I had achieved a great thing when we completely reversed the policy. So enthusiastic was I that I went to France at my own expense to campaign against nuclear energy because I rightly divined that Australia is really irrelevant in the world scheme of things and that we had to stop it in France. I spent many months travelling across France, standing up in picture theatres and heckling the French on the evils of nuclear energy, and standing in supermarkets doing surveys, assisted by my wife, who did the French speaking. I also visited establishments and talked to people. It took me some months to realise that what I was saying was absolute nonsense. SoI changed my mind. I have made it a policy in life that, when I am wrong, I change my mind. I have found that that policy has generally stood me in good stead. SoI came back to Australia convinced that we had made a mistake, and I have been trying to rectify it ever since. It appals me that I hear today, some 20 years later, people regurgitating the arguments I used to put-and, I think, generally not putting them as well. They are exactly the same arguments, which have no substance. In my electorate I have the Monte Bellos, where there was significant nuclear testing.in the 1950s. It is a great part of Australia. The fishing there is like none you have ever seen before, and now it looks like being a very important oil province. It is interesting that a large part of Sydney's Chinese cafe trade fish comes from the Monte Bellos, and no-one seems to be suffering ill effects from it whatsoever. I might add something from my own experience. When I was campaigning-I think it was in the election we had in the mid-1980s-there was talk about storing waste at a place just out of Southern Cross called Koolyanobbing. It was an iron ore mine that had ceased operation on economic grounds. They were talking about putting in a destruction plant there, principally for the destruction of PCBs. I arrived at Southern Cross and was met by one of the local state members. I said, 'Give me a bit of advice.' He said, 'Oppose this installation.' I said to him, 'But I do not oppose it. I actually support it.' 'It does not matter,' he said, 'oppose it. The election will be over in a couple of weeks.' I said, 'I cannot do that. I am going to support it.' I guess I was buoyed in my integrity by the fact that I knew I could survive without any votes in Southern Cross. But I went out there and said that I thought the material could be stored safely and this was what we should do, and my vote in Southern Cross, in fact, went up. SoI believe that people are amenable to reasoned arguments. Unfortunately, they tend not",157,Representatives Main Committee
186,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (12.28 P.m.),"I rise to support this legislation. It is quiteMC 1360 MAIN COMMfITEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 to get them-as the previous speaker, the member for Parkes, said-from people in responsible positions. You see this all the time. I was sitting in my office, listening to the previous debate on Aboriginal education. I must say that I do not think I have heard so much hyperbole, cant and nonsense-some of it well meaning-from speakers on either side. You have seen the reaction of John Howard, the leaderMinister of the Howard centralist government to gun law. He is raising fear in the community, putting forward things that are totally unworkable. He does not care about the end result. All he wants to do is project himself as dynamic Johnny so that he can be up there for his double dissolution, which he is expecting next year. That is a totally different reaction from the measured response of John Major in England-a man under enormous pressure, who clearly does need to raise his profile. What did they do in Britain? They sent the gun issue off to a committee, under a peer of the realm, to be discussed in all aspects. The result is that the British will know what went wrong at Dunblane. They will know why it did, whether it could have been predicted, all the ins and outs. In Australia we will not because we have taken our action-we are just going to ban guns, which will have no effect whatsoever on the outcome. Of course it will not, because. what happened in Hobart was a mental health problem, not a gun problem. I am digressing there, and I thank the chair for his tolerance. Let me get back to waste storage. I have in my electorate one of those areas designated as a suitable site for waste storage-Mount Walter. It is 70 kilometres west of Coolgardie. I remember that a few elections ago an anti-waste dump party ran in Coolgardie against the state member, on the basis that they did not want the stuff in their backyard, some 70 kilometreaway. They do have large backyards out there! The result of it was that the state member, Julian Grill, increased his majority. So, I think, if you take the trouble to explain to people the hard facts-the truth-you can convince them. Mount Walter would be a suitable site for fairly toxic waste and certainly for medium-level radioactive material. In fact, a French company, Rhone-Poulenc, is mining around the Pinjarra area and it is seeking to downstream-process, to extract from this material the rare earths, which have a clear value and a much greater value than simply in exporting the raw material. When the company first started, the argument coming from the Green movement was that we could not trust the French to ship the stuff overseas because it contained the radioactive element thorium, which of course is included in every bit of granite. I can tell new members of parliament that this new Parliament House is certainly many times more radioactive than the Old Parliament House. The background radiation here would be considerably higher than you would get in lots of parts of Australia, owing to the enormous amount of granite here and the enormous concrete platform on which this place floats-because we have built it on a geological flaw. But do not worry: the radiation is still well within any safe limits. The company was told that, because it was French, it could not be trusted to export the stuff, because the wicked French would extract the thorium and maybe make bombs. The French company said, 'Yes, we understand that. What we will do is process it here.' The argument then became, 'You must now make the wicked French take their radioactive waste with them. They can export the rare earths, but they must take the radioactive waste with them.' It was",159,Representatives Main Commiti Ee

188,Mr Campbell,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have seen the reaction of the PrimeThursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 1361 never an argument about the environment; it was always an argument about stopping any economic development or progress. I think there is always a lot of confusion in that area. Anyhow, I accept radioactive waste in my electorate. It is, I guess, medium-level waste. It would be mainly gamma-radiating and, if it is stored as proposed-in plastic containers six feet below the ground-we return, of course, to background levels of radiation. Mount Walter is ideally suited. Firstly, it has a low rainfall; secondly, it has internal drainage; thirdly, if there is any underground water at all, it is hyper-saline and there is not much of it; and, fourthly, it is geologically very stable. I have made it clear that I would be prepared to store high-level waste in my electorate, and this is a position I have always made clear to my constituents. Since they have always returned me, it would seem there is some measure of agreement there. However, the goldfields generally are booming. This is an area of dynamic growth in Australia. The same cannot be said for Broken Hill, and it may well be that this is an industry that Broken Hill needs, if it is going to continue to exist at all. Unless there are more ore bodies found at Broken Hill, it is inevitably going to become another ghost town or one depending increasingly, as it appears to be, on tourism. I left Broken Hill in 1959. I left just ahead of the police. I had not been back for many years but I was disappointed, when I went back, to see that it had become very much a tourist place, and not the working town that I knew it as. Geologically stable areas are ideal places, if you have them, for the disposal of high-level waste using the synroc technology. The Australian synroc technology is 1,000 times safer than the borosilicate glass technology favoured by the French. That is not to say that the French borosilicate glass is not safe; it is. I am convinced it is perfectly safe. It is just that synroc is much safer, although it is slightly more expensive, and it is something that I believe should have been pursued with vigour. Had the Australian Labor Party had the policy it had in 1956, there could have been be a future for it, because mining, processing and waste reprocessing could have led to the establishment of a big industry in Australia. We have the requirements that make us a very good country to look after waste. Firstly, we have stable government and a trustworthy system. Secondly, we have the best geology in the world for the safe storage of this material. Thirdly, we have the best distribution of people, as we have areas of very low population. I am sure that there is a multi-billion dollar industry that Australia could run very well, and Australia could playa very important part in providing this service to the world. That is far better, in my view, than to not know what people are doing with their intractable waste, and I think there is a lot of fear raised in the community. When you visit these nuclear power plants in Britain and France, one of the things that you notice, particularly in the cold winters·, is ponds with a bit of steam rising from them. That is where the French store their very high-level waste. They store it there for 40 years to cool it down. It is hot because of the high rate of atomic decay. I noticed that there were always plenty of seagulls floating around on the top because the water was warm. I was assured that the seagulls were at no risk because water, of course, is a barrier, being a dense material. In fact, distance is a barrier to radiation and that is the defence mechanism we use against the sun. The denser the medium, the less distance required. There was no threat to the birds and they were obviously enjoying it. The member for Prospect( Mrs Crosio) talked about Australia's responsibility and how we must act in terms of the environment. It was all good emotional stuff, with little basis in fact, but very good for grabbing the heartstrings. You have seen the situation in New South Wales, MC 1362 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 where a totally irresponsible premier stopped a mine at West Wyalong-also in the electorate of the member for Parkes. I have had a look at this mine and it is a very ordinary engineering enterprise. There is nothing difficult about it and it is very straightforward. There is absolutely no doubt that if it had any effect at all environmentally, it would be marginally a plus because it would marginally reduce the rising ground water which, of course, is the big environmental problem there. It would also create a lot of employment and a lot of wealth for Australia. There was a lot of emotion about Parkes where some birds had been killed on the tailings dam. This can actually happen if cyanide levels are not properly controlled-and the birds died. What affects populations of birds and, in fact, the population of any animal, including the human animal, is the availability of food. If 10 per cent of the bird population had died-it was nothing like that figure-that population would certainly recover in a couple of years. I think that really, we have to keep these things in perspective. I was talking to a fellow who was the third generation of a family that pioneered the Kellerberrin area, and he was adamant that the pink and grey galah, the Kakadu rosy colour, is not a native of that area. You see it absolutely everywhere, but he is adamant that it was not there until the wheat farmers came. It obviously followed the wheat farmers because there was an exponential increase in food. One of the things that I find a little concerning when these people are so concerned about the environment is that we have increased the food potential for these birds exponentially-for all the cockatoo family, basically-but we have decreased the habitat so they tend to overcrowd existing trees. Their method of survival is to ringbark around their holes to protect themselves from goannas and, because they are nesting there in such numbers on the few remaining trees, they are tending to ringbark those trees, and the trees are dying. Yet, if you were to say, 'Let us commercialise these birds. Let us sell them to reduce their numbers,' you would meet with instant white-hot anger from a lot of these people who profess. to have real concern for the environment. I guess that that is very much the nature of life. What we do need here is good education. It appals me. I received a letter from grade 5 at a certain school where every student in the class had written to me, begging me, as their member of parliament, to do something about greenhouse gases which were enlarging the hole in the ozone layer. This obviously came from the teacher. I wrote back to every kid individually and said, 'If you ask your teacher, she will tell you that this is wrong and that you do not know what you are talking about. The greenhouse gases have no effect on the ozone layer.' I hope that by this mechanism we are able to educate the teacher. I am concerned about the misinformation that is made available through our education system, and which often appears to be supported by governments. There is, at the end of the day, no real alternative to having scientific and rational discussion on these matters. I am all for that. There should be much more of it. As I have said, if I am shown to be wrong, I will be very happy to change my mind. This bill is a common sense bill. In my view, it does not do a lot to look at the economic advantages that can be achieved by these measures. But I do want to say just one thing: the hyperbole we have been faced with from the 'Paul Howard' centralist government about selling Telecom to fund the environment is an intellectual disgrace. If you want to do something about the Murray Valley-and we certainly need to do something about the Murray Valley-it really does have to have an economic base. There is certainly no doubt in my mind that the mass Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1363 planting of Eucalyptus camaldulensis has the capacity to lower the rising ground water level. It will be effective only if there is an economic base for that. What we should be doing is seeking to establish a timber or a paper industry based on those trees. It is young trees that suck up water. If we can keep turning those trees over, we can keep pressure on reducing that rising ground water, which is the main basis of the problem with the Murray Valley. But, of course, giving an economic basis to it is often seen by the environmental movement as tawdry, and it will, therefore, most likely be opposed. to the committee that we would normally expect to adjourn in something like 12Y2 minutes. However, the intention is for this bill to be completed before we adjourn. Therefore, while we have four more speakers, which is in total 80 minutes, and I have not the slightest desire to impinge on the rights of members, I would like to suggest that, if possible, they might restrain their eloquence and perhaps not take all of their time. Ms JEANES (Kingston) (12.48 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that I will not express my eloquence overly in the committee at this time. The purpose of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is to bring the existing legislation governing the trade in hazardous wastes into line with our international obligations under the Basel convention and with the practices of our trading partners. The issue of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes raises significant moral questions, which the Basel convention attempts to address. Developed countries should not be profiting from the practice of dumping their hazardous wastes on developing countries, as those countries have a reduced capacity to deal with the wastes. Whilst the economic and social advancement of many developing countries must, indeed, receive the greatest possible assistance from Australia, we have a responsibility to provide that assistance in a manner which does not compromise the ecological integrity of those countries or the health of their people. In fact, many of the world's developing countries are paying a very high ecological price for their economic advancement; and their consequential social advancement is, therefore, significantly compromised. They also pay a very high price through the exploitation of workers whose health and, indeed, whose lives are put at risk for rewards that are often negligible. Since 1989, when the initial bill was enacted, Australia has found ways to circumvent its obligations under the spirit of the convention. We have transported hazardous waste on the basis that we are exporting materials for recycling. Australia is not currently required to notify the country of destination or obtain its consent under existing legislation. Nor is there any effective requirement on the exporter to ensure that the materials will be dealt with in an environmentally responsible manner. One of the materials we are exporting is lead battery waste to the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. I will use this as an example of the shortcomings in the present act. There is considerable anecdotal and scientific evidence of lead contamination around lead acid battery recycling factories in Indonesia. I would like to quote from a recent Greenpeace report about the effects of a local lead processing plant on the surrounding community. The report, dated March 1994, says: Clouds of smoke from the factory have been descending on the community since (the company) began operation. Waste water from the plant is discharged into local waterways, which are used by villagers to irrigate their rice fields. Local residents complain that ashes from the factory often fall in their wells",160,Representatives Main Committee
189,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"BeforeI call the next speaker, I would point outMC 1364 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 and on their food, and that the effluent from the factory is draining into the local irrigation system. Many villagers complain of being sick, that everybody has a cough, and half of them cough blood. Tests performed by the Indonesian government on a sample of workers in the industry found that they had blood lead levels in the range of 40 to 80 micrograms per dec-litre. Honourable members will remember the outcry in the Australian community in 1993 over blood lead levels and their health consequences. The National Health and Medical Research Council revealed that new research indicated that previously accepted blood lead levels of 25 micrograms per decilitre had been too high and that an alarm should be raised when blood lead levels reached 10 micrograms per decilitre. The Australian community was angry in 1993 when it was realised that we had a problem with lead levels in our own children. Yet Australian companies are transporting hazardous wastes to countries where the processing of the materials contributes to the poisoning of their environments and their people, some of whom have blood lead levels up to four to eight times higher than the level we find acceptable. It is unconscionable that we should be outraged at the lead levels in our own children, but continue with practices that contribute to the lead poisoning of children in Indonesia or any other country. The minister's second reading speech summarised the major features of the bill. But one of the most important features is that it will require. exporters of hazardous wastes to ensure that the waste materials will be managed in an environmentally sound manner which protects human health and the environment before exportation is permitted. This is a significant advance to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the Basel convention and I commend the bill to the committee. I would just like to suggest that the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell), might wonder why the birds would come back after 10 years if they were going to continue to drink the same water which would no doubt have the same levels of cyanide in it. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (12.53 p.m.)-The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is an important bill in that its main objective is to improve the regulatory regime relating to the transportation of hazardous wastes. It is a bill that the opposition does not oppose. When I reflect on the consumer society that we live in and ponder the enormous wastes that are generated by our modem industrial processes, I am reminded of a brief poem that I once read in a provincial newspaper. This poem was written to the 'Letters to the Editor' column by a writer who was lamenting the environmental damage caused to a hill formation where red scoria had been mined for public and private road construction. It was a very simple poem that went like this: They've mined the hills for our highway construction Our roads have been built on nature's destruction When the councillors voted they were all well intentioned But a scar ridden landscape-well nobody mentioned! It is a simple poem but, in its simplicity, it encapsulates the position that Western economies are in today. We are all well-intentioned in our consumption patterns. We believe it is our birth right to enjoy the high material standards of living we have here in Australia and in other Western Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1365 countries. But nobody really wants to think too much about the consumption of non-renewable resources or to talk too much about the pollution of our precious environment or the generation of hazardous waste materials. It is a sad reflection on our modern industrial society that we are only now coming to grips internationally with the problems associated with our own economic development. Western countries have a long and regrettable history of exploitation in less developed economies. Today, Western multinational companies are engaged in a range of exploitative practices relating to labour and the environment in underdeveloped economies, and-as has been mentioned in this debate today-the trade in chemical waste. This particular bill will give tighter domestic effect to international conventions which have been negotiated by Western countries to this point in relation to the transportation of hazardous wastes. One of the more objectionable practices in recent times by Western companies has been the virtual dumping of chemical waste products in countries which do not have the appropriate infrastructure to store or handle poisonous wastes. I am very pleased that the amendments in this bill do provide for greater transparency in the process whereby ministers make determinations as to whether hazardous waste may be exported to another country for final disposal. This debate is in a sense a timely one, as there is a very important community debate occurring in my electorate at this time, relating to a decision by the Victorian government to relocate the Coode Island chemicals complex to Point Limas. As members may recall, in August 1991 a disastrous fire occurred at the Coode Island chemical storage facility, which prompted the then Victorian government to undertake an extensive review of alternative sites in Victoria for the construction of a facility to replace the Coode Island chemical waste facility. The Coode Island review panel nominated several sites as being the most appropriate ones for the transfer of the Coode Island facility, and one of those sites was West Point Wilson which was eventually determined to be the site of the east coast armaments complex to be relocated from New South Wales to Victoria. Interestingly enough, when the Coode Island review panel examined these issues, the site at Point Lillias was not one of the sites recommended in that review; yet the Kennett government has determined that the Coode Island facility will be relocated to Point Lillias. That decision has certainly excited a great degree of local opposition. The Coode Island complex has had· some improvements done to it after the fire, and it is now regarded as being safe. Many people in my community in Geelong are asking why, if it is so safe, the facility cannot be turned into a state-of-the-art facility where it is-located close to chemical industries in Victoria-and not moved to the Geelong area, where there are significant environmental, heritage, economic and transport concerns. I would like to briefly go through some of those concerns. As far as the environment is concerned, the area around Point Limas is a significant wetland area with saltpans and salt marshes. It is one of the remaining underdeveloped areas of Port Phillip Bay. As far as Corio Bay is concerned, it is a shallow bay and it has sluggish tidal movements that would worsen the effects of any unintentional spills from a complex at Point Lillias. The wetland areas around Corio Bay and the Point Limas area have international conservation status and are an important habitat for migratory wading birds, such as the double-banded plover. The area is protected under the Ramsar agreement, which is an MC 1366 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 international convention with between 80 and 90 signatory nations. Of particular concern to the environmentalists is the threat to the orange-bellied parrot, which one of the rarest birds in the world with only 200 of them remaining in existence. The community is also concerned that the dredging and shoreline filling works will cause significant environmental damage. Keep in mind that the original Coode Island review panel did not even rate Point Lillias as one of the five major recommended sites for the relocation of the Coode Island complex. There are significant transport concerns with the Point Lillias site. The chemicals that are to be stored there would have to be transported from Melbourne and this would mean significant truck movements, estimated to be in the order of 100 to 200 a day, along the Princes Highway. That particular highway is estimated, at the turn of the century, to be a pretty clogged highway-if I can put it in those terms-and the additional truck movements on it will not only cause congestion problems but also pose a significant environmental threat in their own right. As for the heritage concerns, they have been articulated by the Aboriginal community. There are significant Aboriginal sites in the Point Lillias area. Community groups are really angered by the state government's lack of consultation or interest in local concerns of Aboriginal and other groups. In an economic sense, the Point Lillias project is not a desirable development because it is located some three to four kilometres from Avalon airport, which is currently up for sale. There are some very interesting developments being proposed for Avalon airport that involve the creation of a clean-green production zone in the environs of the airport and the establishment of a dedicated airfreight facility there for the export of perishable foods directly into Asian markets. That particular concept involves the development of the Avalon area as a clean-green production zone for perishable foods and flowers. The big marketing angle for that development will be the clean-green image of the foods that are produced and exported through Avalon. The Point Lillias chemicals complex some five kilometres from the runway may stifle the potential economic benefits that could accrue to the region and, indeed, to Australia from the development of the Avalon complex. I think that here we have a contrast in the styles of the Commonwealth and state governments when it comes to these very significant matters. As far as the Commonwealth relocation of the Newington armaments depot to the Point Wilson site is concerned, we have seen an exhaustive process of consultation with the local community and evaluation of the appropriateness of that site. This contrasts with the Victorian government which has just plucked. Point Lillias out of the air in ignorance of the recommendations of the Coode Island review panel that listed five potential sites and did not even rate Point Lillias on that list. There has been a real environmental evaluation by the Commonwealth of the effects of its proposal. That extensive consultation has taken place with environmental groups, the local community and other interested parties, and what has emerged in the Commonwealth's proposal to relocate the Newington armaments depot to Point Wilson is a project which has won the acceptance of environmental and community groups in the Geelong region. On the Victorian state level, we have seen a farcical environmental effect statement. Basically, the gun has been held to the head of the community. This particular environmental effects evaluation process, which the Victorian government has been engaged in and which ended last Friday, can only be termed a farce. The decision has already been made, and the environmental effects evaluation panel is just really going through the motions. Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1367 I really want to conclude on the point that we have here in the Point Lillias relocation proposal and in the ECAC proposal a real contrast in the way governments ought to go about community consultations on these very sensitive propositions. I think that this is a very important bill that is before the House today and I am pleased that it is winning bipartisan support from both sides of the parliament. It is a bill which is long overdue to ensure that we have in place domestic mechanisms that conform with international conventions relating to the transportation of hazardous wastes. conflicting instructions from various forces around this place, so I think that what I will do first is place on record my personal comments about certain things about the present conduct of the Main Committee. Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that you have been placed in an invidious position in earlier having to advise speakers ter-I think you used the words 'contain their eloquence'least pleased that the word 'eloquence' was used. I am a bit concerned· that you were placed in that position so early in the session about the conduct of the Main Committee. It is a bit difficult for me, as a third person, to make comment on what has actually happened, but I understand that there was not strict agreement about that course of action. In fact, it was only coincidental that I came up here to listen so that I could more properly play my part in the debate and I sensed that perhaps the debate was carrying on. I then went back to my room and it was when I was in my room that you by your comments confirmed that the debate was to go on. CanI just take this opportunity to place on record that I and, I believe, other membersespecially of the opposition-who have placed their names on the speakers list have done so with a genuine desire to enter into the debate on the legislation, and that, if we are to see this Main Committee operate properly, I hope that we will see continuing cooperation about the hours of sitting and like decisions. Having said that, because I don't know in the tactical sense what my next move could appropriately be, despite suggestions that I should not be speaking at this stage, I will proceed to enter into the debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, my comments were not reflective on you or a direct criticism. I know directly by personal experience that when you are sitting there sometimes you are not aware of what is going on. That is proper, because you are here to make sure that standing orders are upheld. There are other agreements that are made about the conduct of the Main Committee and in the last parliament it was as a result of those agreements that the Main Committee was able to be so successful. I am not sure whether there was any reason why this bill had to be completed today or whether it could have been held over to next week's sittings of the Main Committee. I will now talk about the bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996. The Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989. Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. This bill aims to end some discrepancies which have emerged during the operation of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, an act designed to give effect to the Baselconvention in Australian law. One such discrepancy is the definition of what constitutes hazardous waste. Th.ese amendments will ensure that the definitions used",163,Representatives Main Committee

192,Mr Jenkins,"Often people would have invited me to contain my verbiage, so I am atMC 1368 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 in Australian law meet those that the convention intended and that Australia is no longer out of line with international opinion on this subject. One of the problems of the previous definition of hazardous waste was that it was confined to material deemed to be worthless. This definition excluded wastes exported for recycling or for recovery. Because Australia does not require approval for these types of exports, followup inquiries are not undertaken about whether the waste is to be treated in an environmentally appropriate way in the destination and transit countries. This is in clear breach of the Basel convention. The convention specifically calls on signatory countries to prohibit exports when they are not going to be treated in an environmentally sound manner once they have left the exporting country. Amending the definition of hazardous waste to include recycling exports will make certain that these are subjected to the same level of scrutiny. Even if Australia's environmental legislation and monitoring programs were the best in the world, Australia would always, to a large extent, be dependent on the environmental actions of other nations. That is why it is in our best interests to see that international standards are adhered to in other countries as well. In a global context, there does not seem to be much point to handling hazardous waste in an environmentally sensitive manner if the waste is then exported to a country where it leads to untold damage to the environment. Technical terminology is an important issue in the operation of any convention. It is especially important that definitions and standards are uniform so that the intent of the convention is not undermined. Obviously the government acknowledges and accepts the importance of uniform definitions and standards enough to put this amendment bill up. I take this to mean that the government accepts that there is a role for the Commonwealth when it comes to establishing standards and definitions and, indeed, measuring outcomes against these criteria. With talk of handing powers back to the states on a whole host of issues, including the environment, sadly the government does not appear very committed to this concept. At the same time as the House debates a bill about world standards of the disposal of hazardous waste, talk continues about the Commonwealth devolving environmental responsibility to the states. Abolishing organisations like the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, which has a vital role to play in monitoring standards across the nation, will only make achieving uniform standards that much more difficult. An argument is put that, so long as you have a national standard, it is really irrelevant whether the Commonwealth or the states do the monitoring and policing of that standard. This argument contends that, as long as a national standard is in place, the state environmental protection agencies can be responsible for the monitoring and the Commonwealth agency can be abolished. However, the experience in Victoria would suggest that there is a definite need for increased, rather than decreased, involvement of the Commonwealth in these matters. Mr Deputy Speaker, I might need some guidance here.

194,Mr Jenkins,"Yes. There is a risk component to the process I am about to embark upon,Thursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1369 Mr Warwick Smith-No. briefly, I would like to thank you for your comments and I would like to advise the committee that the chair was not aware that the proposition to continue beyond 1 p.m. had not been agreed by both sides of the parliament. I should also point out that while the standing orders provide for the Deputy Speaker to fix the time of meeting, and although the convention is that we meet from 10 a.m. till 1 p.m., there is no fixed time of ending. The convention is one o'clock. Once we start, the proceedings may continue, and will continue, until there are no other speakers or there is no quorum. So the one obvious option for both sides of the House is to withdraw a quorum at any time they want to do that. I am not advising that you do that, but I thought I should, in fairness, tell the committee that those are the options open to you. The present situation is that you have the call-the honourable member for Scullin-and leave has not been granted for you to move the adjournment. I was nearly caught short on even getting the call was that I was trying to seek advice about what I could do under the standing orders to adjourn the debate and protect my right to be involved in it. One of my real problems is that I believe the honourable member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson) who is to follow me was led to believe that because the debate was to be adjourned he would be able to speak on this matter in the Main Committee next week. As the honourable member for Reid and I have a friendly rivalry about the numbers of speeches that we are able to make, he would understand that my trying to make sure that he got to speak is against the rules of that contest. Having said that, I will bat on. I just might add that it is a bit difficult even to use the quorum option as I would be the member of the opposition who would make the quorum if I stayed here on my feet. I was talking about the acts of the Victorian EPA. For example, about two years ago, a study of Melbourne's sewerage system was completed by the sewerage review project team of the environment group, Environment Victoria. It found that very little is actually known about the content of the hazardous waste that is being pumped into Melbourne's sewerage system. This was in part because the monitoring undertaken by the state authority, Melbourne Water, was claimed to be infrequent. Furthermore, the sewage was only tested to quite a limited range of traditional factors, like the pH level, and it neglected more harmful substances. Melbourne Water's licences to pollute are specific on the concentrations allowed to be discharged but there are no indications of total amounts pumped into the sewerage. Environment Victoria claims that it is simply not known how much aluminium, arsenic, cobalt or manganese, among other substances, there are in Melbourne's sewers. The point of this example is to illustrate that if the Commonwealth expects to hand back environmental responsibility to the states, it is going to be sorely disappointed by the adequacy of work carried out by these state authorities in monitoring standards. I hope that the government can be convinced to accept the value of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and national forums for intergovernmental cooperation, like",168,Representatives Main Committee

These institutions at a Commonwealth level do have an instrumental role to play and should not be sacrificed because of some kind of bizarre, ideological whim on states rights. At a time when the government is attempting to berate the opposition by quite inappropriately and misleadingly linking the sale of one-third of Telstra to a commitment to the environment, there are currently some interesting reports appearing in the media. I note with interest and concern that funding for key programs dealing specifically with the area of hazardous wastes is set to run out at the end of the financial year. The programs affected include the national pollutant inventory, which would specifically force industry to give detailed information about types and amounts of hazardous waste that they create. As part of its 'all things to all people' strategy before the last election, the coalition promised to maintain the existing environmental programs funded by the previous government. If these very substantial and worthwhile programs are allowed to be wound up because the government will not devote funds to them, that really exposes their true colours on environmental issues. Attempts to create some kind of false link between Telstra and the environment will not give the government any amount of credibility on environmental issues then.

204,Mr Cadman,"If the honourable member were to seek leave to continue his remarks atThursday, 23 May 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1371 already sought leave to adjourn and for consideration of his remarks at another time, and permission was not granted by the government. it a try. to continue his remarks at a later timeto continue my remarks at a later time and move that the debate be adjourned. Mr Warwick Smith-Leave will be granted, but let me say that when the question was put for the adjournment, I was acting on the remarks from the chair when you indicated to speakers to truncate their remarks because we were going beyond one o'clock. There was no discussion with me, as minister at the table, from any party-government or opposition. I was relying on your remarks. SoI accept the adjournment. Mr Leo McLeayMr Deputy Speaker, before you put the question, could I continue on the remark made by the minister. I put it very clearly on the record here that this committee has operated in a consensual manner. Both the government and the opposition had agreed that this debate would, as usual, conclude at 1 p.m. If it is anyone's intention to change that, it gets done by consensus. My colleagues and I are part of that consensus. We had not agreed that this debate be continued past 1 p.m., and certainly not to 1.40 p.m. We had another speaker on this which would have meant we would run into question time. We have no intention, ever, of letting this continue close to question time because we have people who have other things that they have to do in the run-up to question time. If there is an intention to keep going after 1 p.m., then we need everybody to be part of that plot, not just one-half of the place. I inform the committee that the chair, through the clerks, did receive advice from the parliamentary liaison officer that it was hoped that that would continue. I raised the question. There were no government members available or wanting to speak beyond one o'clock but opposition members did continue to rise. I agree totally that the whole spirit of this committee is to work in a sense of consensus and cooperation. I might just expand on the remarks I made earlier so that everybody is quite clear that, once this committee starts at the nominated time, whether it be at 10 o'clock in the morning or four o'clock in the afternoon, the business of the committee can finish only by one of four means: the lack of a quorum; the House rises; the committee runs out of business; or there is a motion to adjourn. this occasion. However, I place on record my delight that, in the atmosphere of the Main Committee, we were able to come to some resolution on this. It is now not a precedent that will cause upset in the way that the Main Committee is conducted. In the spirit of the way that the Main Committee operates, this was resolved in that spirit.",170,Representatives Main Committee

212,Mr Jenkins,"Just on an indulgence, it is ironic that I was the meat in the sandwich onMC 1372 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 23 May 1996 Mr Leo McLeay-I put on the record that, when we next convene, the government will be moving the extension of time for the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Jenkins) so that he can have his full time in this debate.
