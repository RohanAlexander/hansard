4,Mr Deakin,"that original Act of 1904. limits the tests which we have to applyI speak for honourable members on this side-to the new departure of the Minister of Home Affairs-and I shall so allude to it, because we are not aware as yet, though we ought to have been informed to what extent similar effect or the same effect is being given tc a similar or the same ruling in other Departments. VVe are equally unaware of any methods or machinery which are being devised for the application of this principle, either in his or in any other Department. A good deal of questioning has left us still greatly in the dark. We must wait for the reply which the Prime Minister will make in due course, when we shall hope that light will be let in at last to all the corners of this question, that there shall be no dark corners which shall not be irradiated before he resumes his seat. While the general intention and plan of the Government and their supporters are clearly understood, there is still very much that is open to definition, and that needs definition badly. Our preference granted in 1904 authorized the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, by its award or by order on application at any time, todirect that, as between members of organizations of employers or employees, and other persons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equalThat was the clause creating a new power, prior to that unknown to our statute-book. But important conditions followed. The first of them provided that before preference was granted the proposal to allow it should be advertised far and wide, specifying the industry and the industrial matter in which it was proposed to permit such preference, so that all persons and organizations interested should be heard before the Court. Then the Court shall, in manner prescribed, hear all such persons and organizations so appearing or represented. There followed provision for a judicial trial by this high tribunal of that issue, which invited by public notification a challenge from any persons aggrieved. coupled also with certain limitations of the power of the Court. A preference could only be directed if the Court, in its opinion, believed that the majority of those affected by the award who had interests in common with the applicants were in favour This of its introduction. And, finally, in order to prevent abuses, after this action had been taken, a very important condition was inserted, which endowed the Court with a permanent power of supervision over the working of this new endowment, by way of preference. Moreover, the Court could at any time be appealed to, and could at any time amend or recall the grant of preference, if in its opinionthe rules of the organization are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to or continuance in membership, or that the organization has acted unfairly or unjustly to any of its members in the matter of preference. not appear in the Bill which the honourable gentleman introduced. they evolved by natural process during the debates. As I have said, the combined efforts of the three parties resulted in a general agreement embodied in that particular clause. Consequently, the preference to unionists, which the public had in mind up till very recently, has been that particular preference, originally designed in ] 9Â°3'4As a matter of fact, it has been most materially and vitally altered since then by legislation of this Parliament; but of that alteration, in my own experience, a very insufficient and imperfect knowledge obtains outside. That was manifest during a recent campaign Preference to unionists, associated with these conditions, with a power of the Court not only to grant, but to recall its decision, if necessary, was, in my experience, in the public mind generally, when one addressed any audience on preference to unionists. man read the provision against political tyranny by a union? 'It is provided for in a different clause. I have been reading only from section 40 of the Act of 1904. I turn now to section 55, dealing with registered associations, which are authorized to ask, to obtain, and, if they obtain it, to exercise this power of preference. After a provision that employers or employees may register any assoThis was ciation of not less than 100 members, the section proceedsProvided that no such organization shall be entitled to any declaration of preference by the Court when and so long as its. rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character.",13,Preference To Unionists

Still, keeping to this 1904 declaration as to preference, it must be remembered that the ban against political energies and activities is immensely cut down in the same clause, in regard to all matters which come home to the workers. It does not prevent unions from obtaining preference, who may have adopted provisions in respect to any political matter providing for the preservation of life and limb; compensation for injuries or death; sanitation; the sex and age of employees; the hours of labour; the remuneration of labour ;. protection of salaries and wages ; or other conditions similarly affecting employment.

15,Mr Deakin,"May I ask the honorbar to the granting of preference to unionists. We find ourselves confronted to-day by a law which is still in its operation notice. a new law, and of which the terms and extent and licences are as yet unrealized by the great majority of the public. I have already called attention to the effect of the alterations which have been made in section 55 of the principal Act. I was not speaking altogether without book when I said that the public did not appreciate which were made by Ministerialists in the principal Act, because in the measure .which was submitted to the vote of the people at the referenda, quite as muchI think a great deal more-stres s was laid on the amending Bill. This, in place of a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, transferred to this Parliament absolute authority over all matters relating to labour and industry, including preference to unionists. This can now"" be granted without any judicial process, under a legislative Act. If that power had been conceded by the people, our Court of Conciliation and Arbitration might have 'been obliterated. At all events, supreme power in these matters and many others would have been placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. That would have made it easy for the present majority behind the Government in both Houses, before this Parliament had closed its sessions, to transform, out of all recognition the whole of the industrial legislation now on the Commonwealth statute'book or on the statute-books of the State Parliaments. 41 Hear, hear"" will accompany my next statement, which is that the reply given by the electors to the proposal was an emphatic 41 No."" The people, apparently, realized at the last moment that they were on the -edge of a gulf. The fall was to a depth which had not been explored, the effect bf which they could not foretell. They preferred to wait until they could see the full results of the last advance they had made. They wished to see their new path clear and plain before them, instead of shutting their eyes and taking a leap into the unknown. Consequently it is not possible now for this Government or its majority to take advantage of any new authority. They must content themselves with the powers they already have. These require all industrial disputesto be; judicially dealt with by a Court after due In their own amending Bill the Government last year went as close to the constitutional limits as was possible. They endeavoured to make the Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed last year much stronger than the parent Act. By new subsection 2 of section 9 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1910, passed at the the amendments instance of the present Government, it is directed thatWhenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention or settlement of the industrial dispute, or for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society preference shall be given to members of organizations, as in paragraph a of subsection 1. Fortunately, as the Court was to decide when it was "" necessary,"" the judicial power remained. That power was reluctantly allowed to continue only when it became patent that otherwise the whole Act would be risked. Now, the Governor General's Speech to Parliament at the commencement of this session contained this suggestive paragraph' A Bill will be introduced for the purpose of giving the public servants of the Commonwealth the right to appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. "" Public servants "" there certainly includes the whole of the permanent public servants. We have not yet heard from Ministers exactly what they have done. We have not yet heard from Ministers exactly what they intend. We have not yet seen their Bill or their instructions, except in one Department. Perhaps it will be necessary to examine it before we can gather whether "" public servants "" under this new measure will be made to include those who are temporarily or casually or otherwise employed by the Government, or whether the term relates only to permanent servants. Parliament not havingbeen informed, it is impossible to say what the promise implies. AU that I wish to ask is : This being a pioposal of the present Government for the present session in regard to public servants, which is to give them the right to appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, why are the Government now passing over that very mode of appeal in relation to those who are temporarily employed ? According to an official statement to which I shall presently refer> some of the temporarily employed appear to be almost permanently employed..",15,Preference To Unionists
16,Mr Webster,"Hear, hear.",16,Preference To Unionists
17,Mr Deakin,"I hope that thatBut why have the Government not been content to make all grants of preference to unionists through the machinery of their own new Bill? Why is there to be a striking difference in procedure ? Why, without waiting for their own measure about to be laid before Parliament, to be shaped and disposed of as their majority deem advisable, have they taken in a hurry the administrative step which has brought this question into its. present position of prominence and urgency? For what reasons are any of our public servants excluded from the operation of this new Bill? Certainly, if the permanent public servants are to be included, much less opposition would be offered to the proposal to place the temporary or casual employees in a similar position. In regard to the permanent employees it will be sufficient to discuss the proposal when it arises. I propose not to divert now from the single and straightforward path before me on this motion. But it is a question which cannot be left unasked, and will, I hope, be answered by the Prime Minister in due coursewhat, if any, distinctions are to be made between the several classes of public servants in the matter of the grant of preference, and the reasons why such distinction should be made. . At this stage, however, the immediate issue is complicated by no such difficulty. We can rely upon the plain circular of the Minister of Home Affairs, with which, after some pressing, he was good enough to favour us the other evening. That instruction of the Minister was important from several points of view. Not the least was where he directed-I am looking at his own order-that "" absolute preference is to be given to unionists."" In both the original Act, ancl the amending Act of 19io, the condition is that the grant of preference is to be given to members of unions, ""other things being equal."" The Minister of Home Affairs has deliberately omitted those words from, his order. He has directed that absolute preference is to be given to unionists. It appears to me that those words can have no other meaning than that the Minister's order as to preference is perfectly independent of any such qualification. The Minister's present silence gives assent to that plain reading of his plain language-that preference is to be given to unionists. It is understood that while the Minister proposed to grant that preference without qualification of any kind being taken into Mr Deakin. consideration, except the fact that the men were unionists, he objected to the very natural interpretation of his chief officer, who added to it, by way of interpretation, that in dismissing employees non-unionists were to go first. The Minister took some exception to that reading. Judging by his demeanour at the present moment I should say that no more revelations are to be permitted from that source. Consequently 1 shall assume that the Minister's statement of last week still stands, and that his order -the order absolute-doe s not apply to dismissals. Evidently he intends the absence of the qualifying words which were all important in the original Act, and which were retained in the amending Act. Apparently, they disappear at this juncture because of the Minister's enjoyment of the issue of what may be termed Napoleonic bulletins to the ofiicers of his Department. I trust, however, as he admitted one error of interpretation on the part of the officer, that he has corrected that. If there be any lurking error in the other interpretation, which appears perfectly plain on the face of his order, he should not delay to make it public. orable member will condone the military flavour in his order. admire is his sudden acquisition of a bashful reserve never manifest on any previous occasion. make the Minister blush. from a gentleman in his position. Here we are faced by a situation not of our own creating in any way. The Minister has sprung it upon his Department, which has sprung it upon the public, while for his own part he simply took the bit in his teeth, and bolted. Since then he has been a more silent, possibly a sadder, and, let us hope, a wiser man. With the little light at present afforded us, we are obliged to ask, "" Over what classes of public servants is this ukase to apply?"" Although it is not for me to press the Prime Minister unduly for information, 1 hope that in the course of his absolute remarks we shall have some fairly trustworthy figures showing the number of persons to whom the order will apply. That question becomes of considerable interest when we learn from the report of the Public Service Commissioner that there",16,Preference To Unionists

On an occasion like this, I allow as much latitude as possible; but I must confine honourable members to something near the question. The interjection by the Postmaster-General was distinctly out of order. order. The motion covers any and every matter relating to the public ""interests-to the Public Service, and the relations between Parliament and the Public Service. .Therefore, the engagement of every man employed, the manner of his appointment, the conditions under which he is appointed, and all particulars of that kind, are covered by the motion. Nothing can possibly be wider than a motion which relates to what -is prejudicial to the public interests; such a motion cannot be widened by any stretch -of the imagination. I submit that the honourable member for Ballarat is in order in dealing with an aspect of the Public Service and of public employment. tude I am merely following the practice -of this Chamber, and a practice laid down by the late Sir Frederick Holder. That gentleman, when specific motions of this kind were before the House, confined the discussion strictly to the questions raised. On the present occasion, the honourable member for Ballarat distinctly stated, in his opening remarks, that he intended to ' confine himself purely to the question -of preference to unionists. He went -on, however, to deal with another question altogether with a report referring to the employment of certain temporary hands. I desire to allow ample latitude; and the honourable member was -enabled to make the remarks he desired. likely to turn on the question whether this, -or some other Government, had employed the larger number of temporary hands. That is not the question before the Chair; the question is that of preference to unionstances of applying it to numbers of men ists; and, beyond a casual reference to them, other matters cannot be introduced. when called to order, was not in any way necessary for my argument, but was merely repeated by way of courtesy to the Postmaster-General; the ruling of the Speaker is no deprivation to me personally. The -quotation from the report of the Public ""Service Commissioner seems to me to be in -order in so far as it throws light upon the classes of persons who, known to us up to the present only under some vague classification, are now subject to the order of the Minister of Home Affairs, which my motion condemns. There are employees described as temporary, some described as casual? and there are yet others outside. Are these all to come under the ukase of the Minister of Home Affairs? There is another important point which I offer to honourable members opposite as an argument of weight. In an application for preference to unionists, to a Court with continuing control, we have a body which arrives at a decision judicially after close inquiry, and is able to vary that decision should any changes make that necessary. In the present instance, on the other hand, we have a great number of temporary employees under the Home Affairs Department who are to be selected on a new plangiving absolute preference to unionists. The mere fact of their unionism will put them into positions without regard to the other qualifications required for the posts. And all this is to be done away from the eye of a Court or of the Public Service Commissioner, merely by the direction of what are termed acting officers. These, if they are"" to know anything of the men, must be in the localities in which they are employed. The gangs employed may be anywhere in Australia or Tasmania. They may be in the Northern Territory, or in Federal territory under Commonwealth control. The parties may be of any size, small or large, and may be drawn from widely differing districts. But some selection must be made by these acting officers, and made by methods which we can only surmise. Trieste officers' are now to be given, not an authority to select the best men available, but a direction to grant an But then the discussion seemed absolute preference to every man who claims to be a unionist, and against whose claim no disproof is forthcoming. Is not the whole principle of selection revolutionized by the extraordinary circumscattered here and there over this whole continent. Because of their remoteness these groups must be in only intermittent communication with officers of standing? Is not the whole principle of preference to unionists revolutionized by its being rendered absolute and unconditional ? Is it not threatened by its administration being intrusted to individual officers themselves temporary in different parts of the Commonwealth, but clothed with authority to",19,Preference To Unionists

58,Mr Deakin,"What I was saying,employ or not to employ; with the right to declare whether men shall remain in a particular district where their families may be, or whether they must leave it to seek work elsewhere? Is it not evident that this authority will be capable of being abused to an extraordinary extent, owing to the scattered nature of the works that the Commonwealth will be carrying on, and the unqualified responsibility imposed upon individuals never selected for their capacity or responsibility, for discriminating? What we not unnaturally require, in these circumstances, is a clear and specific assurance as to the means by which this machinery is to be made to operate, at least in some rough and ready way, with justice as between man and man. We require, also, some security that there shall be afforded those who are unfairly treated an opportunity to have their case reconsidered by some competent officer not too remote from them. These are the very essentials-the AB C-of honourable employment. They are the essentials for the proper conduct of business, and surely the Commonwealth Government is not going to depart from them.

That is why a unanimous House agreed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in 1904. It agreed further, that in consideration of the sacrifice of the right to strike, the workers should receive in exchange preference to unionists when granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. That was the sole reason which brought over scores and hundreds, and even thousands, outside these walls, who had been absolutely opposed to that principle previously, but who, with the great aim of industrial peace and justice before them, were content that sacrifice should be made since that was the wisest course to pursue in order that justice might be done. a single instance of it, showing that the provision is a dead letter. league of mine will, no doubt, take up that very point.

The record of the Court up to date, considering all the difficulties by which it has been surrounded, is very remarkable, and very creditable. I wish to avoid all divergencies. Surely we are met here together on an accepted basis of agreement. However we may differ about means, I trust we have no serious difference with one another as to ends.

We seek justice between the different applicants. If I could quote him again, the Public Service Commissioner, a little lower down than the passage read, refers to the evidence taken by the Postal Commission as calling for and justifying some such reformatory and precautionary action. This, then, is the point at which we have arrived in discussing the question : Has this preference for unionists been introduced at the proper time, in the proper manner, and with the proper safeguards? So far as we know it at present, it has been satisfactory in no one of those respects. We have been complained of for questioning Ministers too much, but we are still in darkness about the all-important conditions on which it is proposed to confer this very important power of granting or refusing employment, for exercise, anywhere and everywhere.

This new policy has been sprung upon us in a fashion most likely to create suspicion and arouse opposition, although it should have been launched in a manner which would have disarmed many of its opponents, leaving the chief consideration whether the best practical methods had been adopted. But we have now to discuss it under a cloud of heat and excitement not of our generating, which I hope will not long obtain. As it is we have to make the best of a bad job. We have to face this question. When we have once discovered what are the definite proposals and has been practical working of this new proposition, we shall be in a position to debate it, and, so far as we can, to endeavour to re-shape it wherever necessary to meet the circumstances of the situation. As it is at present before us, it represents a transformation so wholesale, violent, and unprecedented, and, as applied to Australia, it appears so impossible, that I fear that the task of dealing with it fairly upon which we are about to enter is one of the most complex with which we could be confronted. The whole situation is complex. Surely a new departure of this kind might better have been taken by degrees, and with caution, instead of by a header of the Minister of Home Affairs. don County Council introduce this fifteen years ago? ago; and they have continued its operation ever since. A number of other municipalities have done the same. site have been industriously trying to discover precedents. isters that the London County Council, and many other municipal councils, have had experience of the operation of a principle of this kind. bodies are no doubt very useful, but any one who proposes to apply the methods of an English County Council to the government of the Continent of Australia is providing for himself a very difficult proposition indeed. so far. Municipal methods are often such as could not be adopted even by the State Governments. It is possible that methods adopted by thÂ» State Governments could not be adopted by the Government or the Commonwealth. Questions of area, diversity of interests, distribution of population, and many other matters, must be considered. A principle which might be .applied with brilliant success by the municipal council of a great metropolis might be utterly hopeless if applied to a vast region extending through many degrees of latitude, and embracing many and varied conditions for many and varied employments. the Minister of External Affairs judges himself, and not me, by a remark of that kind. To every one else, it is obvious that these comparisons can only be made with the utmost caution. gestion as to the unprecedented character of the proposal. members opposite can say or do would completely meet this case, though several things which they might invent or imagine might appear to do so.

There is far more hope for those who are engaged in our industries in the consideration of The experiences of such the new methods of work which Mr Winslow Taylor has recently developed in an important volume, which is likely to mark an era in industrial history. He shows that an increase of wages up to hitherto unexpected rates is perfectly possible without sacrifice of the workmen by the adoption of scientific methods of training and production.

134,Mr Deakin,"I ' accepted the prinwould take us much too far afield, although it is strictly germane to some most important features of the present industrial situation. While the methods of preference and of fixing rates of pay in a general way condition industry, they cannot do anything to inspire, invigorate, or develop it. They impose conditions, many of which are necessary, though some, no doubt, are unwise or impossible, which our industries must accept or replace. Sooner or later those which are sound and wise will be sifted out and adopted. But we must go much beyond this if we are to maintain in our industries an effective development Those engaged in them must unite in mastering the new scientific processes by which their physical labour is reduced, but by which intelligence in its application increases remuneration, while the fruits of the industry are enormously multiplied. This progress will benefit the worker, as well as the employer. But in Australia, when our protection through the Tariff has already been overtaken by the increase of prices on every hand, we shall put the whole of our industries in a most parlous state by the introduction of new restrictions, raising the cost of production without any increase of protection against importations so as to provide a means of developing our industries and of employing more labour. It is perfectly true that the conditions of labour need examination. We have a Court which exists for that purpose so far as inter-State disputes are concerned. There are growing up throughout the Commonwealth State organizations of an industrial character dealing with these problems so far as they can. But if a limit is put upon the expansion of industries where will be the prospects of our young men, 01 for the future of Australia. We have now to deal with the special ukase issued by the Minister of one Department ancl its effect by, reaction upon our industrial enterprises. Although it -touches the industrial life of Australia at many different points, the same rate is apparently to be applied without qualification to all kinds of employment, and to all places within the Commonwealth. I say that while it is proper and legitimate to adapt restrictions of this kind to one part of Australia, they must be entirely unsuitable and illegitimate if applied in the -same way in another. Yet the ukase of the Minister of Home Affairs goes forth from his Department affecting the whole of Australia. That is one of the most serious considerations to be borne in mind when dealing with his minute to his officers. the honourable gentleman on the other side of it now. other side there can be. I conceive myself to be arguing in support of a doctrine which all in this House must support, although they may approach it from different sides. We may adopt diverse means of reaching the same ends. Al l depends on the growth and progress of our industries, and in this connection we cannot overlook the universal state of unrest in our industrial life. Every day we have news of fresh disturbances, and the last from Tasmania implies an industrial disturbance of most appalling dimensions. I say nothing about its cause or merits, but it is of appalling dimensionsa crisis which we cannot hear of without alarm and apprehension. Until these disasters-for they are disasters-w e might fairly term the difficulty which has arisen at Mount Lyell a national disaster-ca n be coped with speech ? far more than Protection-whic h comes first-to the proper organization of industries, carrying with it proper responsibilities, and amongst these first and last the acceptance of fixed standards of efficiency. A minimum wage, as I argued the other day, is in itself a humane and necessary thing. But a minimum of efficiency is very properly required for a minimum wage in all bodies of organized labour. Without that minimum of efficiency there can be no claim on the part of the individual to a minimum wage. In Germany the trade unions take these matters into their own control, placing the attainment of a high degree of efficiency amongst their chief objects. Their certificates, as we know, are accepted over the whole of Europe-and , indeed, everywhere else-as the hall-mark of efficiency. Wherever a workman is possessed of a German certificate, that marks his grade and quality. By that means the trade unions in Germany not only increase the productive power of the nation, but raise their own status, expand their influence, while at the same time improve the condition of the workmen. thing in Australia.",25,Ministerial Members Hear Hear

It is the confusion of political principles-which , in themselves, may be perfectly sound-wit h principles of industrial organization-which , in themselves, may also be perfectly sound-that destroys both, to a large degree, when they are blended.

In other words, we must be either a far less important nation industrially, or a far less important nation politically.

However, I commenced my remarks with a determination to adhere as closely as possible to the subject-matter of my motion. That is the only reason why I am stating the position dogmatically. Not until our industrial and political organizations stand side by side, each of them determining its own sphere of action and its own course, and each consisting, doubtless, of the same men who, whilst agreeing politically, may differ on industrial matters, as they are entitled to do, or who, whilst agreeing upon industrial matters, may differ politically, as they are also entitled to do -no t until we obtain that severance, which is consonant with perfect freedom in both spheres, can we hope to see either of. them attain the height which they could reach. If there be one principle upon which the existence of the State, as a State, depends for full fruition and for the accomplishment of its best ends, it is that it should draw no distinctions whatever between its citizens. That is to say,, in politics, in religion, in matters of private opinion; in all concerns in which human freedom can be extended, the State should deliberately stand aside, treating every unit as absolutely independent entitled to make its own free choice, and to follow its own rule. Until we obtain that absolute freedom of judgment and criticism on the part of the whole community in respect of all matters of State-unti l we obtain it unbiased by any partisan associations or any other influences than those whose purpose it is to infuse into our legislation those humanitarian principles which shine here more conspicuously than they do in any other .part of the world, with the exception of Germany and Denmark, we shall not develop upon sound lines. Speaking broadly, the humanitarian element in our legislation must never be lost. But our legislation must make no distinction between citizens which is not imposed upon it by the necessary needs of their citizenship. Consequently, this industrial principle of preference to unionists, when applied by a political body or by political action discriminating between its citizens, is unsound and indefensible. Its justification can only be found when, in industrial affairs, it is balanced by the sacrifice of the right to strike-apparentl y that right has never been sacrificed, and but for its agreed sacrifice the original preference to unionists would never have been incorporated in our law. Use can be made of such preference only under judicial methods and by purely judicial means when strikes have ceased, and when a properly-constituted tribunal regulates the wages to be paid and the hours to be worked in any industry in which disputes arise, and in which the organization is based upon just principles and methods. Thence come the only just and secure preferences. Otherwise a distinction drawn between one citizen and another because one does or does not belong to a union, would justify a similar distinction being drawn because one does or does, not belong to a particular church.

That is the fundamental peril underlying the action which has been taken by the Minister of Home Affairs. Well-intentioned in its industrial sphere, it could never be more out of place than when coming from a representative of the people, acting on behalf of the whole State, because it cannot be his duty, as Minister of State, to discriminate in employment between those who belong to a union and those who do not. I repeat that a similar distinction might be made with equal justification in regard to the question of a man's religion. challenged on the one, he may, with equal propriety, be challenged on the other whenever it suits a particular faction to do so. Honourable members opposite might just as well claim that the State should grant a preference to the members of a friendly society.

If the State is to stand on its own feet, it must stand apart altogether from considerations of political colour or religious creed, or of industrial discrimination between those who shall be employed by the State and those who shall not. No nation of free men and women will submit to anything else. Honourable members opposite may think that the price of principle is worth paying; but I am sure If he may be that, in the end, it will prove to be too high. I have said, perhaps, as much as is necessary now on that general part of the subject, and I have no desire to attempt to develop it at present. But I believe this proposal of the Minister of Home Affairs, as launched, to be contrary to those basic principles of freedom which he himself has often professed in this House, and that the discrimination by the State simply on account of the industrial organizations to which men belong cannot be justified in reason, and is certainly not just. It makes against the liberty of individual citizens, which in these days of State co-operation and State action we must take more and more care to preserve in all their vitality.

The regrettable circumstance is that honourable members opposite do not look far enough forward. The fates are not exhausted by this latest step. Finality will not be reached by this discrimination which is being exercised in this way in a particular Department. No doubt, we shall hear in a few minutes what changes have been sanctioned by the Government as a whole. What has already been done marks an important turning. The first was taken when the Arbitration Act was emasculated. Now another step has been taken. It has been done by means of the administrative power of Ministers. By an executive act they are politically discriminating between ""industrial organization and non-organization. But the harm will not cease when the members of organizations have received full value for their subscriptions. As I have said, I have always favoured, and still urge, the foundation and extension of industrial unions for industrial purposes. But you are administering to them the poison of politics when you take an administrative step by means of which you sacrifice the safeguards of political freedom of judgment and action which have hitherto prevailed. I venture to say that you will find the mistake you have made before long, ancl will regret it. You will also regret that any change that was deemed necessary was not made deliberately, quietly, calmly, on full information after debate in Parliament, everybody knowing, everybody being able to criticise, and by a well thought out scheme at last completed after mature consideration and deliberation. Thanking the House for having listened so patiently, I conclude by submitting the motion. detain the House long, and in the brief time that I shall occupy I shall deal with only some of the questions touched upon by the Leader of the Opposition. His motion is one of censure, though he admits that it is couched in limited terms. It says that what has been done by the Government is "" not in the public interest."" But it is singular that, although the honourable member argued that what has been clone is objectionable, he did not point out arise. If evidence of that statement be wanted, I will give his exact words. Towards the close of his speech, the honourable member said that this thing which we have done is only a different means of reaching the same end that both sides desire. will be a different thing altogether. an injustice to the honourable member. It is quite true that he said that his method would be a different method. The honourable member might bring down a different proposition; he might state it differently; he might introduce it differently ; but he said that the object that he had in view was entirely the same as ours. Opposition said that the Act of 1904 represented our view. for Kooyong says thai the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Act of 1904. What did his leader say in 1910?

The answer wasNo. Commonwealth law now provides a means of determining this question.

This policy will be pursued until we see some better method ; the Government are not bound to any fetish in their administrative or legislative action. We shall look at circumstances as they arise, and, with our best judgment, do the best we can for the people. I am sorry I must trouble the House for a few moments with further quotations. The honourable member for Ballarat, as reported in Hansard of 21st September, again addressed me as Prime MinisterMuch uncertainty prevails among honourable on this side as to the area over which the proposed new preference to unionists is lo apply, and the methods of its application. Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of making a statement which will remove the doubt and anxiety in this regard ? My reply wasI am surprised that there is doubt and anxiety. The proposal is not a revolutionary one, but merely a straightforward and honest statement of policy. Instead of favourites being appointed at the nod of the Minister, as under the old system, the officer whose duty it is will consider the fitness of the applicant for the work' to be done. The honourable member for Flinders then askedW ill he receive instructions from the head of his Department to give effect to the policy of the Government?

I repliedI f the responsible officer wanted a man he could ask him whether he was a unionist or not. Then, in reply to further interrogations I said that no man who is a unionist should be sorry or ashamed to say so, and so, forth. Let us now turn to the honourable member for Parramatta.

If the honourable member would like to have the names, I shall be pleased to supply them. report ? script of the shorthand notes before me, and can lay it on the table of the House. Unfortunately, the heavy cold under which I am labouring renders it impossible for'me to go on. I wish only to say that the policy of the Government is preference to unionists, and that that means the employment of unionists, other things being equal, in preference to non-unionists. It also includes the granting of reasonable facilities for workmen to become unionists. I am tempted, in conclusion, to quote from a writer who I know is a favourite of the honourable member for Angas, as well as the Leader of the Opposition. I refer to John Stuart Mill, who, seeing far beyond his own day into a time perhaps ahead of our own, wrote-The form of association which, if mankind continues to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work people without a voice in the management, but the assoStates, and that the Prime Minister seems ciation of the labourers themselves, on terms of to have forgotten that the Government, of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations and working under managers elected and removable by themselves. Here we have the managers of the business of the Commonwealth, elected by the majority of the people, and elected with the full knowledge that they were in favour of preference to unionists. The work being carried out by the Ministry as an Executive is their own. They are ih control of it, and they feel themselves in duty bound to give preference to unionists. On that the Government take their stand. Whether the people approve or disapprove our policy in this regard will influence neither us nor those of our supporters who believe in the principle, for we have had too frequently to pioneer causes which were unpopular and more often misunderstood. The object of this motion, I have no doubt, is to cause our policy in this respect to be misunderstood, and to be misunderstood for purposes which I need not dwell upon. There are two incidents about to happen in different parts of the Commonwealth in connection with which a misundernot. standing of our application of the principle may be of use to our opponents; but certainly no good purpose has been served by the indictment launched against us to-day by the honourable member for Ballarat. sure I am expressing the feeling of honourable members of the Opposition when I s.iy we are exceedingly sorry that the Prime Minister is not' in the best of physical health, since the occasion is an important one, and we have been particularly curious to know what defence would be set up by the Ministry to the action taken by them. With a good many statements made by the Prime Minister this afternoon I fully agree, but scarcely one of them is relevant to the motion. The question at issue is one of principle, not of degree, and admits of being dealt with within the limits of a short speech. Before putting the issue as it occurs to me, I should like, however, to refer to the reference made by the Prime Minister to the action of the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of 1904. Dealing purely with the difference in the method of application before I come to the question of principle, let me say that preference to unionists, as provided for in the Act of 1904, applied to which the Leader of the Opposition was at the head, resigned rather than agree to the insertion of that principle. It is somewhat significant that one reason why the Deakin Government resigned was because the principle of arbitration was extended to the servants of the State. It was considered by the draftsman of the Bill that preference to unionists was essential to the principle of arbitration, as it was included in the Bill; and it seems to me to be a complete reply to the reference made by the Prime Minister to the attitude then taken up by the honourable member for Ballarat that he refused to agree to the States, who would be bound by the principle of preference, being kept within the purview of the Act. We have not had from the Prime Minister one statement as to how, as between unionists, he is to apply this principle, or as to what safeguards can be applied. The Act of 1904, as amended by the Act of 1910, still contains some safeguards as between the nonmembers and members of unions affected by it.

Unionism is not essential to the fixing of wages by Act of Parliament under the Wages Board system. representation on the Boards. member's pardon. of employers endeavouring to elect the representatives of the employees, and of those endeavours being only frustrated by the unions. can assert anything; but it is impossible, without going into each particular case, to say whether or not duress has been brought to bear upon employees to make them elect or prevent them from electing particular persons. The fact remains that unionism is not required at all as part of the system of fixing wages by Act of Parliament through Wages Boards in the States. Neither in South Australia, nor wherever else a fair system of Wages Boards holds, is unionism recognised as an instrumentality, nor is it, or preference as an inducement to it, necessary. Let us come to the question raised by the introduction of preference to unionists hereunionism? Is it not to coerce, to bring pressure to bear upon, the employers? I am speaking apart from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to the machinery of vvhich unionism or organization is necessary. upon the Commonwealth? Is it by one section of the employees combining? Is it not rather through the suffrage? Who is the employer? Is it not the State? The ballot-box is the means by which people impress their views upon Parliament in order to prescribe what the wages ought to be. Even if to-morrow the principle of bringing the public servants within the Arbitration Act were established-and I understand that that is part of the policy of the Ministry-n o organization would be wanted in order to enable disputes between public servants and the Commonwealth to be submitted to an Arbitration Court. You must have organization as between private employees and employers, because it is impossible for the employees to have proper representation of their case before the Court unless the particular class of employees affected can be identified. There you bring in the organization; but in the case of the Public Service the class is differentiated already by the Act of Parliament. They are the men who are in the employment of the Public Service. The class is identified at once, so that organization is absolutely unnecessary in order to apply the principle of arbitration to the Public Service. Besides, it can never be a partial application. Whatever is done within a class ot ihe Public Service must apply to all. You cannot have, as you have now under some awards of the Arbitration Court, some employees bound because they are members of the organization, and some not because they are free labourers. Hence one may admit to some extent the expediency of acknowledging the principle of preference to unionists in connection with private arbitration ; but it is absolutely unessential when dealing with the employees of the State, because, in that case, you cannot prescribe one rate of wages for employees who are members of an organization within the State service, and another for those who are not. Whatever rate is laid down by the President of the Arbitration Court must be applicable to every class within the service. shadowed by statements in this House, the wages to be paid to the Public Service are to be fixed by appeal to the Court of ArWhat is the object of bitration, I contend that organization such as exists for the purposes of the Arbitration Act is not essential.

229,Mr Glynn,"We could pass an Actof the submission? with the proposal to bring some of the public servants under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and the point I make is that it is not indispensable that they should be organized. The Prime Minister has stated that the honourable member for Ballarat failed to show that the policy of the Government is opposed to the public interest. Now, I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs, early in August, 1910, informed the State officials intrusted with the duty of supervising Commonwealth work that, other things being equal, preference must be given to unionists, with the result that a man who had been in the employ of the State for part of the week, became incapable of working under the direction of a State official, for Federal purposes, for the remainder of the week, because he was not a unionist, and not eligible for Commonwealth employment. Subsequently, the Minister directed that the rate of payment for labour should be ios. a day, when, at the time, a State Government was paying 8s. and 9s. a day. Painters to whom, under the Minister's minute of August, ios. a day had to be paid, were awarded only 8s. 8d. a day by the determination of the State Wages Board. Is it conducive to the maintenance of industrial peace to force State officials, who are our agents for the employment of men to carry on Commonwealth works, to pay ios. a day for work for which their own Government only pays 8s. 8d. a day? word of complaint. day, and find that there has been a good deal of trouble. The Minister's definition of tradesman in connection with building contracts covers men who are really labourers. I understand that some of the unions hold that all men working on a building are tradesmen, and entitled to the highest rates, although the Departmental officials may regard them as unskilled labourers. working for the South Australian Government, are paid one rate for part of a week, and when transferred to a Commonwealth job, a higher rate for the Test of the week. The Prime Minister tells us that he is going to apply the Arbitration Act test to unionism, but will that work? The Arbitration Act deals only with industrial unions, and the large labour unions, such' as the Australian Workers' Union and the Barrier Labour Union, are not so registered. demand preference. nised ? Minister to say that the provisions of the Commonwealth Act are the test. Under that Act, if a union can be represented by another union, which is registered, it may be regarded as registered. But most unionists belong to unions which are not registered, and cannot be registered. If preference is to be given only to members of unions registered under the Commonwealth Act, two-thirds of the unionists will be excluded. that will be done. of the arbitration law can be applied. There are organizations which cannot be registered, because they are not industrial, but political. local. registered, because they may become parties to an industrial dispute. That was decided in the Jumbunna case. Apparently, then, the unionists to which preference is to be given are those who do not represent one-third of the unionists. Is that democratic? How many workers altogether are members of unions? Not one-fifth or not been a one-sixth of the total number. Coming over in the train last night, I was reading a report about the strike which recently took' place in England. I do not desire that honourable members should be under any misapprehension, and I therefore say that I believe the workers in most cases were fighting a splendid cause in Engr land. I understand that the Manchester men were asking merely for a minimum' wage of 20s. a week for unskilled labour. Under the conditions of At present, such men, when modern society, such a demand must find support from every reasonably minded man I saw the statement made in connection with the big strike that took place of railway employees that, the total number of unionists affected was 75,000-the number had declined in three years by about 15,000while the total number of railway employees affected by the question of arbitration and",35,Ministerial Members Hear Hear

There a unionist minority of one-fourth or one-fifth took action affecting a total number of workers estimated at 608,000. pressing no opinion as to the justice of the demands made by strikers in the railways and tramways in the Old Country. In some cases the wages paid there approximate very closely to ours. As the Minister of Home Affairs has said, the London County Council did grant preference to unionists, though the public always resent interference by strikes, or any demand of the kind with an organ of government. The London County Council pay wages which, in some cases, run up almost to the rates paid in Australia; but a miserable pittance of 20s. per week was the height of the ambition of some of the strikers in the Old Country, and the grant of that wage would have brought about industrial peace. I have not had time to go fully into the subject, but from figures I have seen, I believe that the proportion of those who, as unionists, would be entitled to preference here, is not more than onesixth of the whole. union, there can be no preference; that is obvious. preference to unionists against employees of the same class who are not unionists. The principle of Democracy does not justify the Government in declaring that in the Public Service, which rests upon the votes and taxation of every one in the community, an absolute preference must, by departmental practice, be given to one-fourth or one-fifth of the persons applying for employment, as against all the rest. I say that, under the proposal, the choice must rest on unionism, and on unionism alone, because it is utterly impossible to test the relative capacity of applicants. day? and the departmental authorities take them as they come. It is impossible before employment to test them as to their capacity.

I am exgentleman mean to say that it is not a matter of common knowledge that the best men are those who are members of unions ? ber will say that, he will say anything. opinion on that point one way or the other. I have read a good deal about the necessity for "" slowing off,"" in order to widen the field of employment. I have heard it said in connection with contracts for buildings that unionists do not now give 60 per cent, of the results that were obtained some years ago. That may or may not be true. I have no report from a Commission to which I could turn for disinterested testimony of the kind, but what I say is that we are not to assume that unionism will always give us the best men. While I sympathize with the contention of the Prime Minister with regard to men who keep out of unionism;, when it is the only power that can be used to enforce their demands, I say that that cannot possibly apply to Commonwealth employment, and I therefore do not see the relevancy of the contention. When I consider the disproportion of unionists as compared with those who do not belong to unions, and the absence of any ground of necessity for the grant of preference in the way proposed, I believe that such a thing is absolutely unjustifiable. The principle we ought to look to in all appointments in the Public Service is 'personal merit, and if the law is to be changed as between man and man it should be after an appeal to the electors on the point and by an Act of Parliament. venient preference provided for in the honourable gentleman's own union. member will not contend that a man who is trained professionally under some curriculum is in the same position as a man who has had no such training? man cannot say that the standard laid down proves efficiency.

The proposal now made is to put a ban upon a certain number of applicants because they do not happen to belong to unions. That is absolutely undemocratic. A departmental distinction is to be made between classes in the community. It is inexpedient and unnecessary. It is not necessary for any purpose of enforcing demands against the State. It will not be required as part of the machinery of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, .if, as the Government propose, Public Servants are to be brought under that Act, and it ignores the democratic principle of the Wages Boards established in the States. I understand that on Government contracts the rate of wages adopted is that prescribed by the Arbitration Court, where there has been an award of the Court, or the determination of a State Wages Board.

I am sorry that this principle has been introduced, and without wishing to say anything invidious to my honourable friends opposite, I think I may be allowed to say that it seems rather most in a state of chattel slavery, and a political and party move than one considered essential to the proper regulation of labour. It is the policy always enunciated and adan heroic battle to defeat a system which vocated by this side. Lord Acton's French Revolution, a statement of the principles which ought to operate in a State as between the various classes who were applying for its protection. He savsA man's most sacred property is his labour. It is anterior even to the right of property, for it is the possession of those who own nothing else. Therefore, he must be free to make the best use of it he can. The interference of one man with another, of society with its members, of the State with the subject, must be brought down to the lowest dimensions. Power intervenes only to restrict intervention, to guard the individual from oppression, that is, from regulation in an interest not his own. Free labour is one of the first conditions of legitimate Government. That is, freedom from arbitrary discrimination between persons who belong to the various classes, ancl he saysThere is an implied contract that no part shall The departure which has been taken by the Ministry is unnecessary, and is unjustifiable upon Democratic grounds. Perhaps its true significance was expressed by the Prime Minister when he said, "" It is the only way of doing it "" whatever that may mean. Doing what?

If that be his meaning, I say that the principle of preference to unionists is absolutely deserving of the wholesale condemnation which has been heaped upon it by the Leader of the Opposition. desire to take my share of blame-if there be any blame to be distributed-for the policy of the Government in regard to this question of preference to unionists. VVe are here as representatives of the great industrial organizations of the Commonwealth. Why should not unionists be granted a preference?

261,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [6.2],"I was grinding the people of that country down into a condition of slavery. The history of Great Britain in that connection is only a repetition of the history of ancient Greece and Rome. At one period in Rome, trade unions were encouraged by being granted a preference. But a time came when the Government of that"" country attempted to crush unionism, and from that day may be traced its decay. It is true that there were other causes which contributed to that result, but the real cause was that the people were in a condition of slavery. Had unionism been fostered in ancient Rome, it would have prevented the chaos which ultimately overtook that Empire. We of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic race should be encouraged in our endeavours to prevent racial decay. No race has struggled more to .uphold its supremacy than has that to which we belong. was fighting for the markets of the world. power at the close of the Crimean war we found that competition was so keen that the cry raised was, ""The race to the strongest. wall."" These were the conditions under which the present industrial system was established. From that period up to the present time, it has made great strides. It has reduced the hours of labour, raised the standard of living, and exerted a beneArbitration Court, but when you boil the ficial influence upon the whole civilized community. Trade unionists in every country are an unselfish class. They ask nothing from the employer that they are not willing to extend to every employ! in the industry with which they are associated, irrespective of whether or not he belongs to their union. It is because we have sacrifortunately, therefore, the employer can ficed our time, our home comforts, our money, and any ability that we may have, in endeavouring to improve the social conditions of the people, that we say the time has arrived when a preference should be granted to unionists who have done so much for the country. The objection has been raised that these unions are political in their objects. I do not regret that cirnon-unionist the fact that there is room for' cumstance. 1 rather welcome it. In what direction has their political influence been exerted? It has been exerted to establish an eight-hour dav throughout the Commonwealth. That influence has been behind all legislation for the benefit of the country. It was the trade unions which fought for the Factories Act, the Early Closing Act, the Old-age Pension Act. the Compensation to-Seamen Act, and for laws Mr Riley. relating to the betterment) of our coal miners., All these measures have had the stamp and approval of the great trade union movement. Unionists should not be sneered at merely because they have political aims and aspirations. We are not going to fight as we have done hitherto, with one hand tied behind our backs. We must use our political power. The more of that power we exert the better will it be for the country. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of political unions. He has been in politics all his life, and if he chooses to devote himself to politics, why should not the working classes do likewise, and thus endeavour to make the conditions of life better? I had the honour of occupying a seat on the New South Wales .Industrial Arbitration Court for a period of three years. I was elected by 70,000 trade unionists, and during that period I had an At one time Great Britain opportunity of dealing with case after case in which a preference was granted to unionists. A great deal has been made of With the advent of steam the point that the Court had power to say under what circumstances this preference should be granted. It is quite true that in nearly every award it was provided that, so The weakest must go to the long as the entrance fee to a union did not exceed a certain figure, and so long as the contributions to it did not exceed a fixed sum per week, other things being equal, the unionist should have a preference. That may be the law laid down by the whole thing down, it is the employer, not the Court, who decides on the engagement of a man. When a man presents himself for employment, the Court is not there to see justice done. The employer has the right every time to say under what circumstances he shall engage an employ^.

If a unionist presents himself together with a non-unionist, and the employer does not want to employ the unionist, he has only to say that he does not wish to engage a man at that particular time.

The. principle worked well, and during the existence of the old Arbitration Court in New South Wales-and it lasted for over six yearsthere were fewer strikes than has been the case since the Act went out of operation. Why? Because preference operated in nearly every industry. Therefore there was industrial peace. Many of the strikes that have since taken place have been on account of the friction entailed by the employment of non-unionists. We are advancing to-day, and because we are advancing our opponents are becoming suspicious of us. I remember the industrial conditions that prevailed when I was a boy. A man who was a bootmaker worked in his own home, with the boots he was making on his knee. His tools were his own. He was not compelled to work in a factory, as workmen are to-day. He was not obliged to go to work at the ringing of a bell or the blowing of a whistle, and to knock off at the prescribed regulation time. To a large extent the manufacturer in early days was his own employer. He held his own capital. All these things have changed. To-day we have the spectacle ot great factories being controlled by a few individuals. Under this system there are fewer opportunities for industrial workers to become employers. Indeed, there are fewer opportunities for workmen to become foremen or managers. are conducted under one management under one roof. This has taken place because of the introduction of labour-saving machinery, which has enabled wealth to be produced more rapidly. But one of the consequences has been that the best intellects amongst the workers, which used to be drawn from the industrial class to serve as foremen and managers-and eventually, in some instances, to become employers of labour-n o longer have such opportunities open to them. On account of these changed circumstances, men who formerly would have left the ranks of labour to become supervisors for those who employed them now find scope for their abilities by becoming secretaries and presidents of shares ?",39,Ministerial Members Hear Hear

Every man upon it has been connected with a union, and has earned the confidence of his fellow-workmen. All these men have had practical experience of the life of the industrial classes. No man can rise to the position of a union leader who is not a man of sound moral character, and who is not sober and decent in all his habits. No man who has f ailed to rise to a good position in the trade union movement has received the endorsement of any union in a candidature for Parliament. Of course, we have had men who have slipped member going to connect his remarks with the subject of the motion? preference should be given to unionists. I can assure the House that the country is quite safe in the hands of unionist leaders, and we are not satisfied to be mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, as we have been in the past. speeches by unionist leaders-incitement s to try to connect them, and very strongly, too. murder. member for Wentworth said things just as bad the other day. ber ought to hear some of the speeches made at the Employers Union and never published.

Unionists do not want this prePublic Service any man who is not a unionist, but because they desire to lift the non-unionist up to an equal standard of comfort and civilization. As regards the statement made by the Minister of Home Affairs, I clo not believe that the Government should allow an order to be issued at the present time, with the view of injuring any person in the Public Service. Every non-unionist in_the Public Service should receive immunity from the order; but in the case of men to be engaged in the future, preference should be given to unionists in the interests of the country and the men themselves. being equal."" equal."" We would give them an equal opportunity to join a union. The honourable member has made an interjection for which . I am very thankful. He and those associated with him are closely allied with banking. He knows well that the men who are engaged by banks are the smallest-paid and the longest-worked men in the community. Notwithstanding that they have so much collar and starch about them, they are the white slaves of the banking institutions. able member going to connect these remarks with the motion? If the unionists could organize the bank clerks into a union, with a preference to unionists, they would not be under the dictates of the bank directors, vvho say that their employees shall not get married until they have a certain salary. Employers talk about preference. Where is a preference given to a man in a bank when he wants to take unto himself a wife? He has not the opportunity to marry, except in certain circumstances. Another point I wish to make is that the employers always exercise a preference in selecting their employees. They never accept the first man who comes along y but they discriminate between men,''and When a strike has ceased, take those who are the strongest and most alert.

284,Mr Riley,"Yes, sir. I am going to time as a young, fresh man, the employer exercises a preference-h e takes the better man. The Government believe that unionists are the best men, and, therefore, ought to be preferred. I am very pleased that they Have decided to give preference to unionists, and I believe that the principle will be honestly and fairly carried out. Sitting suspended from 6.26 to 7.45 p.m. The speeches from the Government side seem to be directed to show that unionism is a very desirable thing. But no one on this side is supporting the motion with a view to showing that he is in any way opposed to unionism. We all recognise, as I certainly do, that it is right for a freeman to join with other free men to protect his own interests. If such a right were denied me, I should think I was forfeiting that freedom which I regard as inherent in all of us-the right to combine to further the interests of those with whom we are associated, or to further one's own interests. That, I suppose, is the foundation of all unionism. There may, of course, be other . motives in other individuals. No one is actuated by quite the same motives as his fellows; but to further the interests of our associates, and our own interests, and, probably, to a lesser extent, the interests of humanity, is an inherent right. The honourable member who last addressed the House did not, so far as I can gather, say one word in reference to the motion, which is a protest against the preference to unionists, in the Government Departments, given by the Government, which we consider unjust and oppressive. That is the only question to which I desire to direct my remarks. I could, of course, as honourable members before me have done, dwell on other issues; and it seemed to me that the Prime Minister desired to avoid to a large extent the question immediately before us, and to make it one of opposition to unionism. As a matter of fact, however, the question that we are now discussing is that of preference -to unionists in Government Departments. able gentleman supported in 1904! gentleman was a member of the Government at that time. tomed to that sort of interjection. I was -never in a Government that proposed to [30 ] give preference to unionists for employment in the Government Departments.

I do not believe in preference to unionists; but there was no reason why I should leave the Government which introduced preference to unionists to those outside the Government service, in a modified way, and under judicial supervision. I consider that preference is contrary to the natural instincts of man. However, I know that anything I may say tonight-and I shall not say very muchwill not have any effect on the votes of honourable members opposite. They are as solid as cast-iron. Why? Because they are pledged to vote as the Caucus dictates. when I was in Western Australia the other day I read a newspaper letter-no t a speech-writte n by the honourable member for Coolgardie in regard to a matter of controversy then engaging the attention of the people of that State. I do not know that the honourable member for Coolgardie is a great favourite with honourable members opposite; I gather that he is considered rather dangerous, and for that reason was not selected to be Minister of Home Affairs when the present Government was formed.",41,Ministerial Members Hear Hear

""When I rise to speak, I speak to the subject, and the honourable member can rely upon me to cover the ground. I have explained what I consider to be the principle underlying preference to unionists. have shown that the formation of unions was neeessary for the carrying out of an Act of this Parliament. I claim now that this Parliament should give preference to its own employees as unionists for carrying out the laws it has passed. The question is asked whether the Ministry are acting in this matter in accordance with the will of Parliament. I go back again to the Conciliation and' Arbitration Act of 1904, which has been in operation for seven years. We have deliberately said in that Act that it is desirable to have arbitration, and to have industrial peace. Unions are necessary for this-purpose, and it is desirable, therefore, to encourage their formation. If that is good for the private employer it should be good enough for the Commonwealth as an employer, and we should set the best example. longer exists. the amendments which were made in it in 1909 and""i9io. soul out of it. examine them. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that in the matter of preference to unionists the only difference between the present Act and the Act of 1904 is"" that the restrictions contained in the original Act are not in the Act as it stands at present. What is the chief restriction that has been removed, and the removal of which causes honourable members opposite so much anxiety? It is that which said that unionists should get preference, providing they did not use their funds for political purposes. they are almost of equal importance. removal of which honourable members opposite object to. The other restrictions which were removed were restrictions which made preference to unionists impossible. I honourable shall confine my remarks to the restrictions concerning political actions by unions. The Prime Minister has pointed out that we on this sideare not concerned about the political opinions of unions. We know that there are some unions the members of whicli are almost unanimously opposed to us politically. It I is remarkable that, in the opinion of honourable members opposite, preference to unionists is a good thing, and the formation of unions is desirable, until they become political organizations. It is desirable to encourage unions to protect their interests against those of the employers, but as soon as they become political, and may have the power to unseat certain honourable members, they become bad. Then we see the honourable member for Ballarat and others like him turn their backs upon the principles they profess to believe in. may call that argument, but it is sheer nonsense. Opposition cannot get away from it. Preference to unionists has been conceded, from the first attempt to ar1904 no bitrate between employers and employees, by this Parliament. Briefly explained, it means that, if two men are applying for a job, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, the unionist shall be employed, other things being equal. If that be tyranny, if that means starving men, I would point out that somebody is going to be tyrannized over or starved. If the unionist is not to be employed, fhe non-unionist must be.

In tbe meantime, I accept the Minister's assurance that his minute does not mean the dismissal of men. Honourable members opposite are very sorry that it does not. They have been endeavouring to stir up party strife. The reports in the newspapers have borne such headings as "" Hitting non-unionism,"" and ""Coercion of Labour Party."" Paragraphs which have appeared in both morning papers have been almost identical, and have been headed ' ' Union Domination,"" and "" Public Protest,"" with the words at end "" Apply to Mr J. T. Packer."" These newspapers which make so much fuss and talk about hitting back and coercion, do not employ any non-unionists. The majority of the men who write these articles are members of unions, and no non-unionist sets up the type in which these arguments are given to the world.. There is no talk there about preference to unionist's, and tyranny, and all that sort of thing. Summed up, the position of the Labour party is this: We believe in attempting to bring about indusOpposition was rather severe on the Ministrial peace. We realize that with the growter of Home Affairs; but the right honoring organization of capital on the one side, able gentleman himself was infinitely more and of labour on the other, industrial war, like international war, will be more grievous every year. The advancing science amongst the nations, and the increase in armaments, will make international arbitration absolutely essential. The same thing applies in the industrial arena. Holding that the community generally should be considered in this matter, that employers and employees should not be left to fight out their individual battles, at the expense of the rest of the community, I believe in passing Arbitration Acts, and ende'avouring to make them possible. One of the essentials to rid of that end is that unions shall be formed, and that they shall approach the Court, and shall be responsible to the Court and to this Parliament. Holding that belief, I must say that when men outside who helped to make the unions possible by joining them, and thus make arbitration and peace possible, approach the public Departments for employment, if they are capable of doing the work they should get preferential consideration as reward for their aid in the carrying out of these laws. Therefore, I stand behind the Government in this action, not because it is tyrannical, as is said ; but because it is consistent with the principles laid down in the Arbitrafears of the Leader of the Opposition, that the power will be used, not to tyrannize over anybody, not to deny to any person the right to earn a living in the country, but to carry out the principles of the Act passed by this Parliament. -There has been launched by the Leader of the Opposition, in an able and a comprehensive speech, an indictment against the Government; but, so far, there has not been any attempt at an answer. We regret that, through ill-health, the Prime Minister was unable to deal fully with the stinging indictment; but there has not been any attempt on the part of any other Minister to answer the grave statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. Particularly did we expect from the Minister who is chiefly concerned, and who is mentioned in the motion of censure, some explanation as to what he meant when he issued this all-important minute, marking, as it does, a very serious departure. The Prime Minister complained that the Leader of the severe on his colleague when, on the evening of Thursday last his circular was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, When the Prime Minister was asked whether he confirmed or repudiated the minute of his colleague, he asked for time for further consideration.

423,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [8.57].,"'Affairs, and one which the Prinie Minister was not prepared, on behalf of the Cabinet, to adopt. ing what took place here. First of all, it was obvious to everybody that the Prime Minister was shocked by the circular; and when he was asked if he adopted it, he said at once that he would have to consider it. There could be no more severe condemnation of the act of the Minister of Home Affairs than the statement of the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition has said that, as regards the general principle of preference to unionists, under certain conditions and safeguards, there is no objection on this side of the House. We can appeal to our career as evidencing the sympathy which we have at all times had with legitimate trade unionism. But the position now is that the old-time trades union, which rendered yeoman service to the community when engaged in the pursuit of the legitimate object for which they were formed, have been supplanted by political organizations. our opponents have said the same thing. that statement, I say what has been affirmed in the strongest possible language by your own supporters, and particularly by the honourable member for South Sydney, and by the honourable member for Corangamite. Those gentlemen have avowed with satisfaction that what were previously trade unions are how political unions. It would be doing themselves and their intelligence a gross injustice to dispute so obgreater success for an industrial tribunal? vious a fact. I shall, therefore, take it as admitted by honourable members opposite that trade unions are political unions. that? unions, the design and object of this new departure of preference is to show favouritism to a class who are supporting Labour members and the Labour Government. It is a departure which means ""spoils to the victor,"" and ultimate corruption, innocent as it may appear at the present moment. It is a departure which means that this Government are going to assist their own political supporters at the expense of others by this administrative act. What is the argument by which this position is supported? members opposite say that unionism is essential to the maintenance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; and, to a limited extent, that is so. I . remind honourable members, however, that that Act is a Federal measure, and applicable only to InterState disputes, but with that, aspect of the question I shall deal a little later. The object of that Act was to provide a peaceful industrial tribunal; it did not mean fhat everybody was to become a trade unionist. There are scores and hundreds of industries which would never have to resort to this tribunal, simply because the relations between employers and employed are satisfactory. I emphasize the fact that, under the scheme of the Constitution, industrial affairs are a matter for settlement by the States; and that principle was reaffirmed by overwhelming numbers on the 26th April last. We have, therefore, to go to the State industrial tribunals, for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful settlement of local differences; and I may say for Victoria that unionism is not essential to the existence of Wages Boards, and is not"" recognised so far as those Boards are concerned. This system of Wages Boards was instituted, not only with the object of securing industrial peace, but with the further object of providing for the workers a share in the benefits of the fiscal policy of Victoria. Wages Boards were instituted in 1896, and for the next ten years industrial strife and strikes were practically unknown in this State, because employers and employed were able to meet together, discuss their differences, and arrive at a reasonable agreement as to wages and conditions. Could there be any It is clear, I repeat, that unionism is not essential to arbitration or the settlement of industrial dispufes. South Wales? honourable member.

Law and order must be secured at all hazards, and any man who is an enemy of law and order is an enemy to his country. is the honourable member responsible for that act? murder, I am. The honourable member for Corangamite, in an acrid speech, sought very hard to justify the policy set forth in the departmental memorandum by the Minister of Home Affairs. I invite honourable members to examine his logic. already given my views as to unionism not -being essential to arbitration, but this is the a disastrous ending. Suppose that, as one logic whereon the honourable member bases his justification for the policy in the memorandum by the Minister of Home Affairs : He says that because in our Arbitration Act the principle of preference to unionists is acmitted to the Minister, what would have knowledged for the purposes of arbitration, that principle can therefore be introduced, as has been done by the Minister of Home Affairs, by acts of administration. Let us consider for a moment the absurdity of the proposition. The Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out the particular class of preference to unionists, 'hedged with certain safeguards, which originally was provided for. He has shown how, by the amending Act of last session, that principle was watered down to its lowest extent. made for a judicial preference to unionists. In other words, if , in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention or -settlement of the industrial dispute, for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society, the learned President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, after closely investigating the character of the dispute before him, and especially tbe whole of the circumstances of the industry, may, on those grounds, grant preference to unionists. But what provision is made for a judicial investigation in the proposal which we now condemn? It is too absurd to contemplate. The Prime Minister has said that, "" a l l things being equal,"" preference is to be given to unionists, but what a hollow farce such a suggestion is! The officers of the Department will in practice take the political colour of the Minister for their guidance in carrying out this principle and the only real qualification will be unionism. The Director of Public Works most truly and properly interpreted the meaning of the Minister of Home Affairs, whose instruction was : First, "" Absolute preference to unionists;"" second, "" A list of non-unionists in employment to be prepared and submitted to me.'' That is subject to only one interpretation-that in dismissals non-unionists should go first. There is no qualification of the phrase "" absolute preference,"" and so a system of patronage, a system of favouritism, is being re-introduced in this insidious fashion into the adminstration of our affairsa system totally opposed to the whole principle upon whicli our Public Service Act was founded. While it may have I have this innocent beginning, I venture to predict that if it is permitted to go on, it will have of the leading acts of the last Administration, we had issued an edict that absolute preference was to be given to non-unionists, and that a list of unionists was to be subbeen the result? We should have been branded as the most corrupt and debased of Ministries. We should have been accused of doing it with the design and object of showing favour to those who, it might have been alleged, were supporting us. If a ukase of the kind had been issued by the late Government, there would have been a whirlwind of indignation throughout the length and breadth of the place, and my honourable friends opposite would not have been able to restrain the violence of their In that Act provision is feelings. Is that not an exact parallel to the present case? Are we not justified in viewing with much concern an act by which the great principle of equal opportunity, and employmenf according to merit, is being departed from ? I , therefore, join in the strong protest which we are now making against such a departure, feeling that it is founded on the worse of precedents; that it has as its design and object the rewarding of Government supporters; and that it",53,Finlayson I T Is Not Retromove Will Be The Passing Of A Bill Direct

Probably when honourable members opposite see me get up to speak on the question they say to themselves, "" Here .is another man who is opposed to tbe poor worker, ' and to unionism,"" but let me disabuse their minds at once of that idea. I do not think there is any honourable member on either side of the House who has more sympathy with the bond fide working man than I have. a practical way by coming over here? way, both here and outside. There is no reason why I should have an atom of antagonism towards the working man. I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and have never had time to get one there since. I have done, perhaps, just as much hard work as those honourable members who sit upon the Ministerial benches, and I know what hard work is. I see one honourable member smiling, but I can assure him that I have done my share of hard work-rea l solid "" yacker,"" and not playing at workin my time. I have worked for jQ$o per year, which was probably below the union rate, and I did not work any eight hours a day. If anything, it was eight hours before dinner, and eight hours afterwards; and for this I got ,Â£30 and the run of my knife. .1 did not belong to a union; but I have always been an upholder of the principle of unionism. Union is strength, and I believe it is right that men should combine in unions to protect themselves; but I do not believe in unionism run mad. I have supported unionism nearly all my life. I suppose I was one of the first to put up a union agreement in a shearing shed. That was in Micalago shed. Although not compelled to do so, I always supported unionism; but there came a time when unionism expected too much, and in the pastoral industry we had the spechas excellent legislation for fhe settlement tacle of a general call-out of the shearers. That gave us a bit of a sickener of unionism. The unionists did not give us a fair deal, but, of course, they expected us to deal fairly by them. I have absolutely no opposition to the principle of unionism; but we aire discussing now the question of preference to unionists to obtain work, and to make a living, over those who do not think fit to combine in unions. I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition on one point. Of course, we, on this side, are free to dissent from the opinions of our leader, and are not bound to accept what he says as the only doctrine. I disagree with him, in so far as he approves of preference to unionists under the Act of 1904, which provides for the application of the principle, subject to judicial inquiry. I do not approve of that at all. I object to preference to unionists in any shape or form. It is class legislation of the very worse description. I do not see why one set of individuals should be given preference over another, or why a. small minority of the workmen of Australia should have preference over the great bulk, because the unionists are only a minority. I should not grant preference to any class, section, or creed. Men should be absolutely free. We are supposed to live in a free country. The dictum of honourable members opposite is supposed to be that the government shall be carried out "" By the people for the people."" That is the doctrine that they are always preaching; but their creed really is, "" Government by the Trades Hall for the unionists."" No one but a unionist is supposed to have a right to get a living in this country. Honourable members opposite would really like to see those who do not think fit to band themselves together in unions, and take the union ticket, starving and dying in this country, no matter whether they are honourable citizens or not. What constitutes good citizenship according; to my honourable friends opposite? Is it the possession of ability and uprightness? No. The seal of a good citizen with them is the holding of a union ticket, the being branded with a union label. member favour strikes? a strike is in the best interests of the people I am in favour of strikes, but it would be hard to prove that.

When the Prime Minister said that responsible officers were not to take any cognisance of whether men belonged to a political organization, he was burking the real question, because he must know that, in giving preference to unionists, the Government propose to give preference to those who support them in politics. The honourable member far South Sydney told us that these organizations are now political. I say, therefore, that it is wrong for a responsible Minister to give preference to the members of them. We know which political party they support, and the Government are proposing to give preference to the men to whom they owe their political position. It is an attempt to force my money being used for the employment as many as possible into these unions, with the knowledge that when they have joined them, pressure will be brought to bear upon them to vote for the Labour party. members of trade unions use their influence as unionists to get certain legislation on the statute-book. told us that they are now political bodies. The Prime Minister, in answer to an interjection, made a statement to which I take great exception. He said in effect, that all men outside unions are "" skulkers."" representation. The Prime Minister was quoting what the honourable member's Deputy Leader had said. went on and used the same words himself. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman intended to be abusive to me or not, but he told me that I was "" obvious."" I object to be called any of these names. I should like to direct attention to what might happen in the near future when some big national works are undertaken by the Labour Government. Let ""us suppose, for instance, that in a short time the Government will undertake the construction of the transcontinental railway. We know that members of the Labour parly are in favour of the construction of public works by day labour. We may take it that this railway will therefore be constructed chiefly by day labour. This will mean the spending of some millions of money and the employment of tens of thousands of workmen. I should like to know whether this principle of preference to unionists is going to be enforced throughout in the construction of this great work. the slightest difference, since there is hardly a railway man who is not a member of a union. members opposite will realize what it would mean when they come before the intelligent and enlightened electors of the Commonwealth at the next election. I do not think that the taxpayers will approve of their money being used in this way, for the employment of members of a small section of the community. It is the taxpayers' money that will be used in the construction of the transcontinental railway, and all the great national works proposed.
