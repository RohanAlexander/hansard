3,"Upon Which Mr Higgs Hadi Moved', By","The Governmeut, in the statement which they have presented to the Parliament and the country, have made ample provision for work to engage the attention of honourable members during this session, and to give effect to all their proposals, we should have to remain here considerably after the date on which this Parliament will expire by effluxion of time. Doubtless, however, many of the measures set out in the Ministerial statement have been put there, as usual, chiefly for political window-dressing purposes, and. with due regard to the fact that, at the very latest, an appeal must be made to tlie electors within the next nine or ten months. Much of the legislation foreshadowed in the statement may be necessary, hut I venture to assert that publie attention to-day is focussed not on proposed' amendments of laws already in existence,: nor upon the introduction of new 'Bills, but-wholly on the question of the hi»h cost of living. The question is onethat intimatelyaffects the people of Australia to-day. We have been in recess for six months. signed eight months ago, but the people find that instead of a reduction in the cost of living having taken place since then, there has been going on all the time a gradual but steady increase. During the war the people put up as well as they could with increased prices, realizing that, in time of war, there were many inconveniences to which they must inevitably be expected to submit. While they were unable, in very many cases, to meet the requirements of their households, in consequence of the inflated prices of the necessaries of life, yet.they were presufficient for their own requirements, pared, bppause of their loyalty, to.submit without protest to the additional prices they were called upon to pay, They naturally thought that, with the signin? of the armistice, there would be snme improvement in the condit ons of : living; but to-day they are greviously disn DpoirtPd. peace we were to have a new world. to'd tV-at the cersation of hosti!itie« would masses is made equal to the increase in usher in a new world; but the actual position is that the conditions of life are gradually becoming worse. The great majority of the people want to know the reason fer this. They desire to know whether there is to be no safeguard againet profiteering. They wish 'to know what we as legislators-wha t the Government-ar e doing since this deplorable state of affairs is permitted to contmue. Tho inflation of prices bas been allowed to go on from the very outset of the war. The Commonwealth Price Fixing Board such as it is, has proved of no avail. The honorablo member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming),'speaking last night, said that that Board had interfered considerably with business operations. He appeared to be anxious that price-fixing should be immediately abolished in order that greater scope might Be given to those who have been making additional incomes during the war. He desires that the pastoralists shall have the utmost freedom to obtain as much as they can for their wool. He desires that the wheat farmers shall be free to get as much as they can for their wheat, and The armistice was that the pastoralists who provide the meat of this country-the price of which is about three times more than it was before the war-shal l also have a better opportunity to secure as much as they can for their stock. The position we have reached is that, although we are living in a land of plenty, and are able to produce considerably more than is required for our own consumers, the local prices of. everything that we produce have to be fixed on -a parity with prices obtaining elsewhere. They have to be on a parity with those ruling in countries which cannot produce countries where, in consequence of the ravages of the war, prices have increased to a phenomenal extent. Here, in a deliberative assembly, we are invited to permit the prices of all that is produced in a land flowing with milk and honey to remain on a parity with those obtaining elsewhere. If that is the way in which we are to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth, then, in the name of all that is good, let us see that the purchasing power of the the cost of living.

6,Mr Charlton,"Yes : we were evenvalent of the increase in the cost of necessary commodities. If that were the position taken up, it would not be so bad, although it might be harmful to people in other parts of the world. We know that since the outbreak of war the cost of living has increased materially. In my own State it has increased to the extent of something like 51 per cent., whereas the increase in wages amounts to only 26 per cent. Thus the purchasing power of the workers has been reduced by 25 per cent. While that is so, while their purchasing power has thus been whittled away, they are called upon to pay prices fixed on the basis of what our produce will realize elsewhere. Under any form of good government such a thing would not be permitted. I believe that at the commencement of the war every one should have been called upon to make some sacrifice. It should not have been left to the men who went to the Front to safeguard our liberties to bear the whole burden. We who remained were not justified in profiteering or permitting profiteering to be carried on. This Parliament was not justified in permitting increases to be made in the cost of necessary commodities to the dependants of our soldiers. We are now told, however, that the high cost of living must be allowed to continue. I have looked in vain for one proposal in the Ministerial statement to meet this very urgent matter. There is not one reference to it. Everything in this connection is to continue as it is to-day. The Government fully realize that high prices are prevailing and yet during the four years in which, under the War Precautions Act, they had the fullest power to deal with any matter concerning the welfare of Australia, they took no action. They now declare that peace is with us, and that there is no longer any need for the War Precautions Act, or for any attempt to regulate the prices of commodities to the people, and they are going to leave the matter in the hands of the States. One State may take action in a certain direction, another State fol'ow a different course, while some may take no action at all ; and thus the people may get no redress. themselves refused this Parliament the power to deal with these questions. true the people did so at one time, but it cannot be denied that from the commencement of the war the Commonwealth Parliament and Government have had full power. was on this side, and tbe honourable member was supporting the Government, what did that Government do more than the present Government have done to deal with this question? time the Labour party was in power before the disruption, we provided for the necessary machinery, but we were not there long enough to put it into operation. on this side for two years and a half. kind. The honourable member is aware that as time went on, increase after increase took place; and I should like to know what his Department has done in the way of regulating prices. I recommend honourable members to read the Groceries Report by a Commission altogether independent of this House. That report <tntps that price-fixing in this connection haa been of no avail. Without consulring the report, I would like to refer to the' operations of the Vacuum Oil Coninmv. Kerosene, which is absolutely essential in country districts for public and private lighting and other purposes, has trebled in price during the war, and the prifp of benzine has also increased. The Commission reported that this particular pompuny, which regulates the distribution of oil, applied to the State Commodities Board on three different occasions for permission to increase the price, and on ench occasion tbe request was granted. Subsequently the control of this commnditv was taktn over by the Commonwealth; and what did we do? We Granted the request' of the company to still further incrense the price.

Then, thinking that this looked huge, the company by some means increased their capital from £800,000 to £1,600,000. do not know in what way the increase of capital was effected, but, even with the capital doubled, the profit was 30 per cent. pany double its capital when 75 per cent, of excess profits had to be paid under the War-time Profits Act? drum I cannot answer.

The honourable member knows, however, that the War-time ProfitsA c t is about to disappear. years'. to disappear, and although we are supposed to receive certain excess profits from these Combines, I do not think we have received them up to the present. The position is that these high prices have been established, and there is no machinery to reduce them; and these Combines, which have been making huge profits, w ill continue to do so without returning any part of them to the Public Treasury. We are simply handing the matter over to the States to do the best they can; the Commonwealth is done with it . That is the muddle in which we now find ourselves in regard to the cost of living, which is a burning, paramount question to the public. We here, as a Parliament, are making no endeavour to meet the position, but are simply getting r i d of our responsibility. Instead of l i e representatives of the people governing this country, we find all great trading and business concerns which supply the people's commodities forming themselves into combinations, In one year the when they are able to fix prices as they please. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) said yesterday that the manufacturers had increased prices more than had I other people, and held that that was due to the "" go-slow "" policy of the workers. It ought to be remembered that the InterState Commission, in its report, states that there are combinations in every State without exception, of persons engaged in wholesale trade. These persons decide who shall j o in the combinations, and, T h a t is a conunaccording to the report, they are so powerf u l that the manufacturers are practically in their hands. The report further states that these middlemen make more profits than do the manufacturers of the goods; and if the manufacturer wishes to deal direct with a retail storekeeper, pressure is brought to bear upon h i m , and he is told that if he deals w i th people outside the particular combination, the necessary action w ill be taken to prevent him . tised for years. we ought to take advantage of the power for another two we have to prevent it .

38,Mr Charlton,"Woo l is requiredin regard to wool has happened in regard to other articlesLast night the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) said that less wheat was being grown to-day because of the lower prices the farmers were likely to obtain. The inference to . be drawn from his remark is that wheat-growers ought to have more latitude to enable them to get better prices. As a matter of fact the farmers have never hadbetter prices for their wheat than they have ob-. tained during the last few years. Mr. CHARLTON member, who is a wheat-grower, supports my statement. honourable member's friends are promising the farmers a better price if the Government are turned out. farmers have been getting the best price they have had for years past, the honourable member for Robertson wants that price increased. My view is that there is a less area under crop, not because the farmer is not getting a fair price for his wheat, but because of his uncertainty as to the future. In face of the fact that we have almost two seasons' wheat on hand at present, how can he feel justified in sowing more ? He does not know at what moment the Wheat Pool mav disappear, or when the wheat harvested next season may be got r i d of-whethe r the wheat on hand has first to be removed. other parts of the world may result in his having no market for his wheat. In these circumstances he is not prepared to accept the risk, and is utilizing his land for other crops until such time as it may be profitable to grow wheat again. If I were a farmer that is the way in which I would view the position. able member would have £20,000,000 worth of plant lying idle and the sons of farmers unemployed. but it would only be one of the many other troubles which have arisen out of the war conditions. that the reason given by the honourable member for Robertson that the farmer is not getting a fair deal is not correct, and that it is the uncertainty as to the future of wheat which has caused a decrease in the area under cultivation. In these 'modern days we have made provision whereby we can store our surplus products in a way which is not very beneficial to the people. There was a time when we used to say that if we could possibly preserve what we had over the necessary market requirements, the people would get the benefit, but we find, now that we have our cool storage places, and can put in an abundance of everything, The honourable that the people are very often short of things which are kept in cold storage, and kept there, too, for the purpose of exporting them at high prices. the purpose of keeping up prices here. Although the any one contend that that is good government? Isi t in the interests of the people? I s it what the people expect? We talk about extremists in the community, but I venture to say we are doing more to make men and women extreme by our action or in action in regard to the cost of livin g than was done by anything ever attempted in this country before thewar. Everywhere one goes, not only the poorer people, but the middle class people, who used to be in f a i r l y good circumstances, complain about the cost of living, and want to know what Parliament Furthermore, good harvests in is going to do for them.

That is really my argument. honourable member said. position now is that they have a perfect right to fix any price they like. On 2nd May, 1919, the following prices obtained:-Stouts, 13£d. per lb.; good, lOifd. per lb.; lights, 10id. per lb.; kips, 10^d. per lb.; and calf, best salted, Is. l i d . customers the benefit of what they had in per lb. The price^fixing order was repealed on the 14th May, 1919, that is, in the same month, and on the 16th of that month the prices were:--Stouts, 16d. to 18|d. per lb.; good, 143d. to 153d. per lb.; medium, 14d. to 15jd. per lb.; lights, 133d. to 14d. per lb.; and kips, 12jd. to 14d. per lb.

Thus, there were two advances in about a week. This meant that poor people, who were already paying exorbitant prices for boots, had to nay big increases, and we who control this matter permit these -things to happen. of 5s. per pair in your own district. many little ones are going barefooted today, not because their parents wish it, but because, after denying themselves for three or four years waiting for the war to end, they still find themselves unable to purchase necessaries for their families? Boots must be done without in many cases, and little children, in this cold weather, have to go to school barefooted. The average export price in May, 1916, was 23s. per hide, which, assuming that a hide weighs 50 lbs., works out at about 6d. per lb. If honourable members compare that price with the figures I have quoted they will see the great increase thar has taken place. Here are some of the letters sent by firms dealing in these goods. On 15th May, 1919, at the time the rise took place, the following circular was sent out by McMurtrie and Co. Ltd.:Owing to the Federal Government having removed the restrictions on prices of hides and leathers, tanners have notified us large increases in prices of all upper and sole leathers. VVe intend giving our clients the benefit of all the stock made fromrecent prices of leathers, but w ill only accept orders subject to prices ruling on the date of despatch. That notice was sent to everybody in the trade, to prove that it was not the firm's fault that they were compelled to increase prices, but that they would give their stock. Another letter from a wholesale firm notifies an increase in the wholesale price of "" gents' mineral harvester csks."" from l is . 6d. to 13s. lOd. On top of that the merchant has to add his profit, and in some cases there are two profits, as he has to distribute again to the retailer. The same letter shows that the wholesale price of bluchers is now 14s. 3d. We used to get them for 6s. 6d. The workers, especially those who follow mining, must have them, and honourable members can guess that by the time the workers receive them they are not less than f l per pair.

The workers would be prepared to accept a substantial .reduction in wages if their earning power was sufficient to buy them all the necessaries of life, to keep their wives and families in decent eomfort, and provide a little for a rainy day. Increased wages follow the increased prices all the time. It is not the increase in wages that raises the prices. It is because prices are raised by those who have control of commodities that appeals are made to the Arbitratio n Court and other authorities, and in that way the workers get an increase, but what they get does not correspond to the increased cost of living. agreed that merely to increase wages does not solve the problem? is another letter among many that have appeared recently, to show the feeling in the country:THE COST OF LIVING. Sir,I feel it incumbent on me, after receivday all sorts of Combines, which decide ing tlie following letter, to add my quota to a subject that should receive the widest prominence. The letter is from a firm that has always supplied me with the materials of my trade:-""Dea r Sir,-Although sole leather has risen 2id. per lb., wo lot the sides sent yesteraccumulate more wealth. day go at old price. leather will be 2s. 3d. per lb.

When people feel inclined to complain of soaring prices of boot repairing, let them remember that they are caused tlirough the unchecked export of our raw materials. As with leather, so with meat, wheat, and other commodities. We have to be contented for food with superannuated working bullocks, and milk cows, while England gets our prime cattle.

The profits of the middleman are, of course, passed on, in the form of charges, to the consumer. All this is the result of our laxity i u regard to the question of price fixing. I regret that it is so, and I recognise that I shall have to accept my share of responsibility in. this connection when I face my constituents.

During the recess, which has just closed, the honourable member for When they enlisted for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) and. myself were invited to receive a deputation from tihe Returned Soldiers Association in reThey have gard to this matter. Unfortunately, at the time appointed to receive the deputation, the honourable member for Newcastle wasi l l in the hospital. Consequently, its members laid their case before me. They affirmed that every person who had been interned during 'the war should be deported. In reply, I told them that while my sympathies were w i th our returned soldiers in many matters, I did not believe that any man or woman should be deported from this country u n t i l after he or she had been given a f a i r trial. We find now, though it was previously unknown to many of us, that a Nothing whatever. I belarge number of internees have been deported. The public knew nothing about this. We do not know whether they ought to have been deported or not. Some of them may have been good citizens of Australia. Many people were interned who were undoubtedly good citizens of Australia. Honourable members may ask, if so, why were they interned? There were some poor people who during the war were unable to get employment, and That is a position which asked that they should be interned for their protection. They were unable to obtain employment because, in many cases, the workers of Australia refused to work alongside men of enemy nationality. Such men had nothing to do but ask to be in terned. They had to live somehow. ber say that the Government are deporting those men? it is quite possible that they are. If we had a public inquiry in these cases we should know",27,Statement

They have lived here for years, some of them have married Australian women, and have reared families. Some of them have been interned because they could not obtain employment. I say that it would be wrong for any Government The fact that there is no public inquiry in these cases leaves a doubt in the public mind as to what is going on. How many people in thi6 country knew that hundreds of persons were being deported ? I am a member of this House, having, perhaps, special means of securing information, but I was uot aware of it. I had no idea that men were being deported in the way they have been I was under the impression that some t r i bunal would be established, that a man would be put on his trial, a charge made against him, aud an opportunity given bun to defend himself. If he were guilty the tribunal could deal with him. It is only because of a recent happening that we have been made aware of what has been going on. I say that this is stirring the people from one end of New South Wales to the other. Even persons opposed to Labour in politics have been surprised to learn that a man could be put on board a ship, carried .to America, brought back to Australia again, taken aga n to America, and again returned to Australia. We never should have known what was done with this man if he had not commenced a hunger strike. That is what brought the matter before the public. Why did not the Government place this man on his t r i a l , and give him an opportunity to defend himself? that anv man who would make the statement that the men who went to the war were lower than dogs should not be allowed to remain very long in this country. But I do not hesitate to say that such a man should be put on his trial. should know whether the evidence brought against him was correct. We should know whether he actually did say such a thing. How many times have assertions been made which, when probed, have been found to be without foundation ? How many men are charged in our criminal If they are, a and police Courts on what appears to be sound evidence, but which, when it comes to be sifted in Court, is shown to be a fabrication, and there being no justification for the charge against him, the man put on his trial is honorably acquitted ? Why not give this man, and other men similarly placed, the same chance? Why have not the Government done in this to deport such people. matter what is recognised throughout British history as the proper thing to do, and that is when an individual is charged ' with any offence to give him the right of"" trial? If a man is proved upon trial to have done anything against the best in terests of the country, we can punish him. That course, however, has not been followed in connection with men who have been deported. Should not the Government, in the case of Freeman, have endeavoured before deporting h i m, to find out whether he was an American citizen or not? Their action goes to 6how that the whole business has been undertaken hurriedly and without consideration. The Government took it for granted that this man was an American citizen, and that they would be able to land him in America, and sso get r i d of him. When he reached Americai t was found that he was not an American citizen, and the authorities there refused to allow* him to land.

If it is found, upon his trial, that a man has done anything against the interests of the country, he can be punished accordingly. I hope that the Government will take some action in regard to this matter. I received a letter only this afternoon from the Acting Prime Minister, in which he states that so far as Paul Freeman is concerned, no further action will be taken to deport him until it is ascertained whether or not he is an American citizen. A f t e r the man has been twice sent to America and returned, the Government propose to ascertain whether he is an American citizen or not. That is ridiculous on the face of it , and surely one would naturally expect that before they sent a man to America the Government would know whether he was an American citizen or not.' I now come to the question of soldiers' homes. This is a very important matter. I was under the impression last year, when the War Service Homes Bill was under consideration in this House, that everything would be done to expedite the operation of the measure. TheB ill was passed in December, and yet nothing was done in regard to appointments under it until four months later.

I have triea to turned soldiers upon the basis of prices expedite their business, but the Deputy ruling to-day,, then in the event of a Commissioner in Sydney states the position when he says that no work at all is being done there under the War Service HomesB ill . The Government should have done something to bring the Act into operation more quickly, so as to give relief to returned soldiers. I venture to say that, in regard to the matter of soldiers' homes, we are again going to ask the returned soldier to pay a lot more for his home than he ought to pay for it. We 'are going to advance him money on which he will have to pay not more than 5 per cent, interest, but, in addition, he must pay rateand insurance, and, accrding to the period within which he arranges to make the home his own, he must pay off each year a certain amount of the capital expended upon it . It has to be remembered that since the war commenced the price of building materials has increased substantially, but it is proposed that we shall value the soldiers' homes on the basis of existing valuations, which are considerably higher than they were before the war. The prices of iron, tiles, and bricks haye all been greatly increased. The Commission went fully into the matter, and made a recommendation with which I heartily agreed. The report statesWith regard to the amount of nnancial asrate of 15 per cent, on constructional cost. It also considers that the rate for subsequent On the basis of a 15per cent, allowance by The officer in comparison may be shown:-Actua l cost for vears; for land valued at £100, 2s. 3d.; house, If money is advanced to rereduction in two or three years-possibl y amounting to 15 per cent -tb e unfortunate soldier must continue to pay for thirty-seven years, or until he has wiped out his loan, that additional percentage. I strongly agree with .the recommendation that the Government should make a reduction of 15 per cent. If that is not done, it will be found in a few years that a house which costs a soldier £ 6 0 0 today can then be built for £500 or for £450, whereupon the soldier tenant will be taxed for a long period upon the in flated values, with which he had nothing to do, which were brought about during his absence, and which we who remained behind should have prevented.

The report comments"" The president said that no member has ever broken the rules."" That is an interesting statement! I will quote furtherTlie price of common bricks rose from 45s. per 1,000 in 1014 to 50s. in February, 1917, at which figure it remained stationary up to the time when evidence was given, though the president of tlie association, popularly known as the Brick Combine, forecasted a further rise at the beginning of this year (1919). This rise has since been announced in the press, and amounts to 2s. Od. per 1,000. The number of bricks ordinarily used in a brick cottage of four rooms and kitchen. &c, is said to be about 35,000, and therefore the added burden on this account since 1914 would be £13 2s. Od. The report sets forth , further, that there are Combines in connection with timber, For everything necessary to the construction of a house, Combines exist to-day. There is a Combine in the manufacture of roofing tiles. The State Brickworks in Sydney are selling their output at a much lower price than the Combine,.and are making nevertheless a splendid profit.

The Works sell common bricks at 38s. 6d. per 1,000, as against the Combine price of' 50s: per 1,000. The Works price in 1914 was 35s. The maximum output in any one year has The whole of the output is virtually been 38,000,000. The output in 1917 (a strike year) was 28,000,000. The estimated output for 1918 was 42,000,000. The present capacity for output is 44,000,000, but there is room to double the Works. A total sum of £87,669 has been advanced by the Government, of which £20.000 has been repaid out of profits. Operations began in 1911, and the financial results, according to the Auditor-General's report, 1918, have been remarkable. He states"" Accumulated profits at 30th June, 1918, were £23,622 8s. 9d., or 26.94 percent.; reserve for renewals, £27,489 15s: 6d„ or 31.30 per cent., amounting in all to £51,112 4s. 3d., or 58.30 per cent, of the capital employed.

Should we therefore charge them a rate of interest based upon in flated values, just because profiteering has been rampant while they were gallantly'fighting for us? Why should they be asked to pay at a rate in excess of 1 what would have ruled had there been no war? The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) repeated last night a statement made to him by a. member of the Australian Workers Union at the Front, in which the latter said he was done with Labour because Labour had failed to send reinforcements during the war. Australia made a magnificent effort. In comparison with Belgium, Canada, and the United States of America, Australia suffered far more in casualties. We had more men in the firing line than Canada. France, and a division of 10,000 in Egypt, so that, practically, we had six divisions, while Canada had only four in the firing line, although Canada has a population of 8,000,000 and Australia's is only 5,000,000. In consequence of our war activities we have a war debt of £285,000,000. We also paid the British Government for the maintenance of our troops; Canada did not. In view of this great effort made by Australia there can be no justification for statements of the kind I have mentioned, simply because we differed on the question of conscription. In the light of all that has happened, I am pleased to think that I was against conscription, and, as f a r as the boys at the Front were concerned, their vote shows that they were divided on the issue. The vote was almost even, and if we bear in mind that the great majority of the ofiicers, the nurses, and the doctors, as well as others engaged in fairly good positions, were in favour of conscription, it is quite reasonable to believe that a majority of ing the other day to a minister who acted as chaplain at the Front, and he informed me that at the last elections the question which our soldiers were called upon to decide was whether they were in favour The housing problem is vital of the Nationalists or the Labour party. Unfortunately, they did not know which side represented Labour and which side the Nationalists. One gentleman, when moving a vote of thanks to me for attending a meeting and explaining matters in connection with the soldiers, said he was among those who assisted in the taking of tiie ballot in France, and when one soldier came forward he was asked whether he intended to vote for Labour or the Nationalists. His reply was, "" I do not know, but if you can tell me where M a t Charlton is I want to vote for h i m . "" The men did. not know the names of the candidates. dier knew a good man when he saw one. me. My name was not on the paper, and he wanted to know where I was. The names of the candidates should have been printed on the ballot-papers. If that -had. been done it is quite probable We had five divisions in that many of the boys would have voted differently. The honourable member for Robertson also stated that the soldiers were satisfied with the'treatment they were receiving. All I can say about that matter is that I must be a most unfortunate member, because for the past three years I have been receiving letters from soldiers day after day complaining of -the treatment meted out to them. I am not going to say that all of the complaints were justified, but I do say that in many cases they were, and I 'know that grievances were rectified when they were brought before the responsible officials. My point is that the soldiers should not have been obliged to consult anybody; they were entitled to absolutely fair treatment.

But at this eleventh hour, and before this Parliament expires, that, instead of bothering about a lot of questions on the business paper, many of which are of comparatively minor importance, they should endeavour, as f a r as possible, to devise some means whereby -profiteering shall be stopped, and the interests of the men who ""fought for us safeguarded.

[3.50] I shall not occupy much time with any references I may have to make to the so-called no-confidence side of this debate, the only relieving feature of which is that it is running side by side with the discussion of the Ministerial statement. The Government have no reason to complain of the dramatic attack that has bean made upon them. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Higgs), in submitting his no-confidence motion, was tame, respectful, and absolutely harmless. He appeared to be indulging mer'e.y in a little cleaning up, and to be tickling the Government with a political feather duster.

I followed him with considerable interest, particularly when he was dealing with the high cost of livinga question that has to be faced not only here, but in every part of the world and in most countries is being faced to-day. This no-confidence debate is not going to effect any important alteration in the cost of living. It would be infinitely better for this Parliament to get straight to work on solid questions,' rather than to be occupying its time in debating an attack on the Government which every one in the House and outside of it knows will be utterly futile. Mv honourable friend ( Mr Charlton), in connection with the charges of neglect that he made against the Parliament, and particularly against the present Government, was appropriated reminded that the A d ministration which he supported was in power for a very considerable time after the outbreak of war, and did practically nothing to re'ieve the situation.

I do not approve, however, of many of the efforts that have been put forth with this object in view. In many directions, instead of reducing the cost of articles of consumption, they have increased them. They have had a worrying, unjustifiable, and harassing effect, particularly on the smaller traders of the community. Although made doubtless with the best of intentions, the badly conducted operations that have been launched have often increased, rather than reduced, prices.

The honourable member for Hunter said that profiteering and Combines should be dealt w i th in a proper fashion. of livin g we should produce more food. one important phase of this question, but I am endeavouring to deal -with it as it presents itself to us to-day. The point raised by the honourable 'member has not been mentioned by the Opposition, but if we could get to work and produce more food the position would, undoubtedly, be improved. I should have liked to hear my honourable friend ( Mr Charlton) mention the present wicked, unjustifiable, rebellious strike against society in Australia -to-day, which is going to accentuate our troubles with regard to the cost of living. Australia is looking on, and I am quite willing to await its decision with regard to the existing strike and its effects on the general community. Dealing with the question of Combines and profiteering, I have thought for some time that since we have in existence an Inter-State Commission, with scarcely no essential duty coming under that designation, it would be wise if , in reconstructing it , the Government were to convert it into a Board of Trade. It consists of competent men, and the cost of living, the effect of Combines, and other associated questions could be dealt with by it . . Bonrd of Trade. but I think the Commonwealth Board of Trade should consist of men such as those No t at now constituting the Inter-State ComTliese struggling traders attach a mission, and should not be a mere appendage to many other things. The Inter-State Commission could take under its control many matters that are now dealt with by the newly-created Board of Trade. My desire is that questions affecting trade and the cost of living generally should be dealt with by men of the highest capacity and experience, and wholly' independent of political control. It is not my desire that the Commission should be created a Board of Trade to harass the little traders. That should for m no part of its functions. Instead of having a harassing, oppressive, tiddly-winking attention to details in all directions, I should like to see the Inter-State Commission given the general control of all trade. W it h such a jurisdiction over trade by highly qualified men it would be possible very readily to nip out all the ills, and competition in the ordinary sense would rectify and adjust all trading operations in detail. Unfortunately, we have only been tinkering with this business. In some instances, it seems to me, we have been, employing men merely for the sake of finding them billets. We have been employing men devoid of training in general trade principles and wholly unfitted for this class of work, with the result that their inexperience has led to expression, involving in some cases the absolute ruination of struggling traders who were making, not excessive profits, but only a bare living. I wish to refresh the memories of the Opposition with regard to what has taken place in Connexion with the profiteering of which we hear so much. Some Combines are ridiculously misrepresented, but it cannot be gainsaid that Combines are growing seriously in Australia, and are exercising oppressive power' over what ought to be freedom of trade. This, again, should be dealt with by men of experience and high character working, not in haphazard fashion, but upon definite principles. The honourable member for Hunter made a very unhappy reference in this direction when he talked about the operation of the Wool and the Wheat Pools, and dealt with profiteering carried on in a good many businesses connected with the war.

If honourable members have regard to the work of the Inter-State Commission in all the States of the Commonwealth, and the ransacking of various trade operations, they do not discover the f r i g h t f u l profiteering we hear about in this House from time to time, and particularly on the public platform, where it is used, possibly, more for political purposes than with the idea of relieving the people who are struggling under high prices. I desire to specially refer to the investigation by the Inter-State Commission as to mills and factories, that have been turning out enormous quantities of clothing and other necessaries for the Defence Department during the prosecution of the war. What does that investi-. gation show ? It simply shows that during the war enormous profits have been made. that the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) gives me his endorsement, because I wish to tell him that his When the pet enterprise created a flat rate. correct. solutely correct.

111,Mr Richard Foster;,"There' isbe changed ; but great assets that hav>> cost hundreds of thousands of pounds cannot be set aside with a wave of the hand. I desire the people of Australia to know that this flat rate has been created by institutions that were inaugurated by the Commonwealth Parliament and Government. Sir ROBERT rers have turned their capital over two and three times in the year. fact remains that they possibly earned the capital cost of their institutions in about three years. That is really good business for the owners, but I remember that the Government this year, at all events, are collecting 15s. in the £ 1 out of the profits, except from Commonwealth factories. I simply mention this to show the people of the country that in the face of all the humbug about profiteering by the ordinary trading community, we have one of the most flagrant examples in Government Departments which fixed the flat rate. Why all this humbug and hypocrisy about outside traders? If this flat rate is not set aside in normal times, the poor, unfortunate taxpayer will kick up a row, and it is about time he d i d . Let our Woollen and Harness Factories, and our public works, all face the test »of open competition, for that is the way to reduce exorbitant profits. Reference has been made to what are described as the iniquities of the Wheat Pool. It is said that because we had an abundance of wheat, we ought to have given the people in this country a cheaner loaf. To begin with, the people of this country, during the last five years, have been getting the cheapest loaf in the world by a long way. sumption had been reduced another shilling per bushel, the difference in the cost of livin g during those five years would have been infinitesimal; ana* we have no right to say that one section of the primary producers is to be called upon to find a cheap loaf for the people of Australia. has'hardly any protection, although those comprising it have to go right out into the wilds and subdue the forests, and be responsible for tbe creation of the greater p a r t . of the wealth of the country. I s there any reason, sense, or justice in asking those people to'provide a cheap loaf?. The principle was recognised somewhat when wheat for home consumption was fixed at4s. 9d. per bushel, though recently, since the value has goneBEST -Some manufactuup considerably, it has been raised to 5s. But if we desire to interfere with the course of trade, and give people a cheap loaf, why not do as the Imperial Government did, when, through the food controllers, they set aside £50,000,000 to give the people of the United Kingdom a cheap loaf. in the case of sugar. so. I do not think that honourable members opposite, and amongst them the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), who is one of the fairest and best, would go into an agricultural community and tell the wheat-growers that they can afford, through the Pool, to give the consumers of this country a cheaper loaf. The honourable member to whom I have just referred also said that the creation of the Wool Pool was on wrong lines, and that it was iniquitous;-o r words to that effect-that all the men responsible for its management were interested in the business. As a matter of fact, that was one of the happiest things that was ever done; we obtained the services, not only of men interested in the business, but men of the highest experience and qualifications in that business, and we thereby reached a point of efficiency that was simply magnificent. This Pool was a great enterprise, affecting the biggest in If the price of wheat for home conterest in primary production in Australia, and the services of these expert men, particularly during the most strenuous part of the war, when, financially speaking, our resources were approaching breaking point, resulted in untold millions coming into Australia.

The Australian farmer, like the wool grower, although the disposal of his product has been so well managed, and although he has been saved from what would have been black ruin if the Pool and the connection with the Imperial authorities had not existed, is getting less for his produce than the farmers of any other country have received. got if it had not been for the Pool1 have got nothing. He would have been in the Insolvency Court; in fact, we would not have had enough money to keep the Insolvency Court open to deal with him. Let us face the matter squarely, for many misrepresentations have been made for political ends, and should be nailed down every time they are made. the Government's business to nail them [386] down. There is a good reason why the Australian farmer got less during the war than the farmers in other parts of the world. He could not have been paid more than he received. Over and over again quotations as to the value of wheat on the other side of the world have been mentioned. It has been pointed out in the House that the Imperial Government have paid the .Argentine Republic, Canada, and the United States of W h a t about it? America often nearly double what the It was Australian farmer has received; b u t they could not help paying these prices. They had already bought our wheat here, b u t submarines were operating everywhere, and every available ton of shipping that could be commandeered was taken overnot to operate out here, b u t to operate closer to Great Britain. They were a l l wanted there. The Imperial authorities wheat they obtained in the Argentine, Canada, and the United States; but if It only the prices had been double they would have been obliged to pay them, because the wheat available in those countries could be got at, whereas our wheat could not be got at so easily. But Great Britain bought ourwheat-million s of tons of it-and all this time has been paying interest on the amount of money This wise step spent in the purchase. Ib is said that if the operations of the Australian Wheat. Pool had been on business lines the Australian farmers would have had a share of the big prices obtaining elsewhere. It was impossible. During the last two or three years I have had more work in correcting these falsehoods in South Aus=trali'a than I would care to have in the future. It is said that our people have not been generously treated by the Federal Government. As a wheat-grower, I consider that the treatment the producer has received in regard to the price of his H o w much would he have wheat has been all that it possibly could have been . in the circumstances. The Imperial Government bought 3,000,000 tons of our wheat, and not only paid interest on the amount of the purchase money, but also incurred a very large expenditure in preserving the wheat.

I am satisfied that when the last 600,000 bags of the 3,000,000 tons purchase reaches England, it will have cost the Imperial authorities nearly £2,000,000 in interest, in charges for preserving the wheat, and in the cost of re-treatment. means a net profit of £4,500,000 to the Imperial authorities. honourable' member knew -what the freights were he would be staggered. freights are he is the only honourable member who does. formation I received the other day I find that instead of freights dropping they keep flying up.

It was a staggering revelation to me to realize that the New Zealand Government were offering .a guarantee of '6s. per bushel, but when I looked into the position I understood what it meant. It was not an offer to the producers to induce them to grow wheat for the purpose of export; the Government had to give every inducement to the producers of New Zealand to T h a t has to be proved. grow enough wheat to feed the people of the Dominion. In fact, New Zealand has had to come to Australia for wheat. It is not a wheat exporting country. do about the matter, but men The price of 9s. 2d. came about in the United States of America because President Wilson thought that the war was going to last a considerable time, and he made an appeal to the farmers of America, as a patriotic duty, to grow more wheat, and he guaranteed them 9s. 2d. per bushel for the two seasons following America's entry into the war. The people of the United States of America, of all people in the world, can accommodate themselves to changed conditions. When wheat is soaring up in price they have the ploughs out i m mediately. When the price of wheat is down to bedrock, a big proportion of the farmers get out of the business.

That has been rectified at last. When the latest addition to the -personnel of the Wheat. Pool-was brought about by popular election in each State of a farmer represent-* ing the wheat-growing interests, they had an interesting meeting in Melbourne. If Mr Clement Giles, of South Australia, is to be regarded as a correct authority, everything was disclosed to them, they had a thorough investigation, and he assured the farmers that the Australian Wheat Pool humanly possible in the way of watching the interests of the farmers.

We have in iSouth Australia the truly co-operative principle. There is a Farmers Union of more 'than thirty .years' standing. and works now in concert with John Darli ng and Company, and a l l the other big wheat buyers, pretty 'well from A to Z. There cannot be such awful robbery of th© farmers by those firms in our .State, if the farmers' own institution, wibioh has Ibeen going ahead recently by leaps and bounds, is prepared to work with them. An enormous proportion of the farmers of South Australia are members of the union, and if 'their own institution is robbing them, they must be a mighty lot of fools to keep it going, and to double and treble its membership. In the absence of any well-conceived scheme, I believe in going back to the old channels, because the conditions will be totally different when we have to deal with a, competing world, and the wheat business is about the most risky of any so far as price is concerned. There is the i least stability about it . We have to face the world's markets, w it h one time a glut and another time a scarcity. Very often in a country like Australia, particularly in those portions affected by drought, it seems to happen most uncannily that there is a very high market for wheat when we -have had a seed time, but not a harvest. We have all these things to face, and men who have had the longest experience in the wheat trade must admit that it is absolutely indispensable that wheat should be handled by men with the highest expert knowledge.

Further, they were to extend the principle of co-operation from the shipping here to the receiving in the Old World, and the retailing to the consumer, so that thore should be no mistake as to Australia's article, which has developed into something equal to the very best, equal even to that Danish product which has been leading the world. In fact our butter is often sold as Danish, and we do not get the benefit of the transaction.

We require economy in administration, economy in the matter of efficiency, and economy in the elimination of waste.

We have pretty well cleaned up the resources of Australia for loan purposes, and we have done it so thoroughly that any further withdrawals of capital from developmental activities would, in my opinion, bo a very unwise policy to adopt. Of course, it is all righ t when the money is here, and the day w ill assuredly comeas has been demonstrated during the war -whe n Australia w ill be able to push her own barrow, or, in other words, to raise .all the loan moneys she may require. But that time is not yet. Just now, with all the financial strain upon her, and w it h the certainty that further enormous demands w ill be made for the purposes of repatriation and for the strengthening of new industries which have been created during the war, we need all the money that we have, because practically every penny of it represents working capital. Just here I desire, as a public duty, to express my opinion of the work which has been done in England by the PrimeM in ister ( Mr Hughes), because there have been so many attempts made to detract from the services which he has rendered. I believe that when we come to hear from him first hand all the results of his work there, Australia will be delighted. But no unbiassed man, even in the light of what I prehe has read in the public prints, w ill deny that the Prime Minister possesses a unique personality for that particular work, and' that he thoroughly held his own in the company of the very biggest statesmen of the day.

But in a work of such magnitude, and involving such enormous expenditure, the Minister requires to be exceedingly caref u l . I have sufficient confidence in him to believe that when he gets a valuable opinion he will be guided by it . Not only has he made the scheme very much more perfect by his recent action, b u t he has certainly made his own position much easier. He has removed from himself a load of responsibility that he ought never to have carried. I know of the cases of two men who were looking for farms. In one instance the valuator valued a property upon which a returned soldier was placed at £1,600. It was bought at that figure, when local opinion emphatically declared that it was not worth £1,000. On the other hand, a farm was valued by the official valuer at £ 7 5s. per acre, whilst a farm twice the size in the same neighbourhood was sold a few days before a t £ 1 5 per acre. If the Local Committees were, in the first instance, asked to submit valuations, and those were checked by the official valuer, some effective work would be done.

There are Scotch people in South Australia, and although she 'held the Northern Territory for many years, it never cost her a penny piece, because the expenditure was kept as a separate account fro m the beginning to the end. South Australia held the Northern Territory as a trustee for Australia to keep Australia white. There were some South Australians who were Scotch enough to wish to sell the Northern Territory. South Australia could have sold it , and for a mighty big price, but it was not sold, or Australia would not be white to-day.

The States were notonly richly provided for -temporarily with regard to their proportion of Customs revenue, but they had-as they expected to have-a n assurance of practically every other source of revenue. I remember when tlie income tax question was discussed in the Convention. That was regarded as a form of taxation which should become available to the Federal Treasurer only in time of great emergency, such as during the war which has now been concluded. Except in such urgent circumstances, the field was to remain clear for State interests. To-day, however, we see the whole area of taxation practically appropriated by the Federal authority. The States have been .left as bare as they possibly could be. cure that. a phrase of the Federal Treasurer, . ""strangulation, leading to Unification."" I am against both, and for good reasons. The great developmental problems of production still rest with the States, and are not a Federal concern. In the past ten years those questions have enormously increased in importance, 'and yet we # are only upon the fringe of development. If the States are robbed, we cannot hope to have a strong and healthy Commonwealth. The latter must depend for its life-blood upon the vigorous health and prosperity of the six States.

The Minister concerned, when approached by the press, stated that he had reduced the price-fixing restrictions, and that the people should be satisfied that the Government had done their utmost to keep the prices of foodstuffs within bounds; and, that had they been living in Great Britain, France, or other countries, they would have had to pay much higher for their commodities. With regard to a country like Great Britain, where the whole machinery of production was engaged in the output of war material, and where all the foodstuffs had to be imported from countries overseas, including North and South America and Australia, it must be obvious to any thinking pereon that the cost of commodities landed in. Great Britain would be inevitably higher than the price of those same commodities in the land of their production. Yet the Government appear to have taken as a basis for their actions here the prices ruling on the other side of the world. Why should we have to pay 2s. 6d. per lb. for butter when there were no overhead charges, such as freight and the like, to be added to the cost, as in Great Britain? It is beyond my comprehension. are not paying 2s. 6d. per lb. in Australia; and, secondly, the price is very much more in England. and that is an outrageous price.

But one individual cannot supervise the operations of all the Boards. Of course, the latter are doing the best they can in the interests-so they tell us -of the community. Actually, their activities are in the interests of themselves and of those with whom they are associated.

This, too, in a country which produces more butter per capita than' any other place in the world. I do not blame the farmers. If they can find a Government pliable enough -to allow them to do these things, good luck to them. Buti t is up to those who are administering the distributive supplies of this country to see that this condition of affairs does not continue. The same may be said of our meat supply. No doubt many honourable members remember when Australian mutton was selling in London at l£d. and 2d. per l b . , while the price in Australia was 3d. and 4d. per l b . I am not quite sure of the position at the present time. I believe meat now brings big prices in the Old Country, hut I do know that we are sending it under export contracts to Great Britain at 4 | d . per l b . If that price pays the producer the Australian consumer should be able to get it at the same price; .but he has to pay 9d., 10d., or Is., or any other price that the retailer likes to charge. This position is absolutely incompatible with good government. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mir. Foster) said the Defence ment had set the pace in the manufacture of clothing. of the Clothing Factory has been in the hands of the National Government over two years, and therefore the Government must be solely responsible for any change in prices. Not iong ago several honourable members made a tour of inspection of the Factory, and ascertained that it was possible to manufacture coats for the soldiers at 27s. 6d., suits for 30s., and splendid flannels for 8s. 6d. I venture to say that if any person entered any private retail establishment chase a flannel of similar quality to that manufactured in the Commonwealth tory, he would be charged from 17s. 6d. to 18s. Mr Wallace. has set the pace, and is able to manufacture at the prices quoted, we can easily understand how private firms, operating on somewhat similar material and charging enormously enhanced prices, have been able to make such huge profits. Most of these increases have occurred since the advent of the National party. Two and a half years ago living in this country was f u l l y 60 per cent, less than at present. One might quote almost any article in every day use in support of this -contention. I mention clothing as one example. In 1917 I paid nry tailor £ 5 10s. for a suit of clothes which I regarded as of exceptional quality. Yesterday I went to the same tailor for another suit of the same material, and he told me he could not make it under £ 1 2 10s., as the cost of material had risen from 12s. 6d. per yard to 52s. 6d. per yard. wool-grower gets exactly the same price as before. the profit? years the cost of material has increased by approximately 400 per cent. Something should be done to control prices. The Minister for Trade and Customs apparently is satisfied that prices here must bear some relation to prices in the Old Country. But I maintain that is not the correot method. We appointed Commissions to inquire into the cost of production of various articles, and surely Departon the information so obtained we ought to be able to fix upon a price that will be The administration satisfactory to the producer, the manufacturer, and the consumer. If the Gofor vernment were determined to do anything in this direction, they could do it . I should like now to refer to another matter mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield.

It is quite true that after due inquiry some are not valid, but in the majority of cases they are. It is lamentable to read in the columns of the daily press from day to day long lis'ts of advertisements asking for employment for returned soldiers. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr. Yates) informs me that the other day he noticed in the Age newspaper between 130 and 140 advertisements from returned soldiers seeking employment as labourers. There is any 'amount of Avorki n Australia. The honourable' member for Wakefield says that what we want is in creased production. Well, the best way to increase production is to put on more labour ,and, as f a r as the returned soldiers are concerned, I think it would be quite an easy matter to place them. No doubt money w ill be required to develop this country; but what is wrong w i th a proposal to start building a railway to the Northern Territory, a work which would absorb the surplus labour in all the capital cities of the Commonwealth? I do not see why we sliould economize. If ' we can raise loans of £50,000,000 for the prosecution of a war, and if in four years we can spend over £200,000,000 in-what I regard as sheer economic waste, I do not see why we should not spend another £200,000,000 in the development of the country, ""thereby enabling us to provide the interest on our war expenditure. If any business man finds himself in difficulties he does not, as a rule, sit down, and do nothing, but borrows money fro m his friends in order to embark in another business venture, in. which he expects to recover his losses. The Government of a country should be conducted on the same lines. If necessary, we should spend £100,000,000 on developmental work, such as irrigation of suitable areas, railway lines to open up country and speed up production, so that we may pay off our huge war indebtedness. This would be much better than giving sustenance to returned soldiers and tryin g to displace men already in employment by introducing .returned soldiers to their jobs. This is about all the Government aTe doing to-day. If it is possible to push a returned soldier into some one else's place, they do it'. But that is not the way to increase production. On the contrary, it is the way to create a great deal of discontent, which must lead to trouble in the future. I notice that .reference is made in the Ministerial statement to the industrial unrest that exists a't the present time, and that something must be done to combat it. I heard the Acting Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Poynton) remark last night that the seamen had held up the Commonwealth for about six weeks now, and that the country was practically in their hands. I am. not quite sure that the seamen are controlling this country, but I do know that they have grievances which should be adjusted, and I know also that it is within the power of the Government to adjust them. is available for them, and you say you believe in it . of arbitration at all. It is a question of securing certain improvements. in conditions, which, I understand, no Judgei n Australia can legally order, as well as fixing responsibility with regard to compensation. It has been said that the seamen .have repudiated the principle of arbitration. I deny that, and say that if there has been any repudiation of that principle, the blame must rest upon the Government and their supporters. When I wa3 elected to this Parliament, in June, 1917, all. the leading papers in Australia were publishing articles dealing with the growing industrial discontent and the unpatriotic attitude, as they termed it , of trade unionism, and it was said that it would be all the better for everybody concerned when the tug-of-war came. At about that time, the Australian Workers Union got an award in respect of the pastoral industry, and I remember how all those who were interested in that industry on the employing side denounced the Judge. . It was even rumoured that action was to be taken to secure his removal from the Bench.",49,Robert Best Th E Price Is Is Had To Pay Mighty Big Prices F Or The

Quite recently, the fruit-growers in New South Wales have protested that if H is Honour gives the Australian. Workers Union the conditions they are asking for , they might as well go out of the business, and they are organizing the whole of the country for the purpose of repudiating the award if it should be given. Then, again, we have all received circulars from the fruit-growers of Tasmania demanding the abolition of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. been the attitude of the employers righ t through the piece. Yet they now urge that the seamen should go to the Arbitration Court to obtain the conditions for which they ask. I am not going to say whether or not that advice should be followed. declare that the seamen, in failing to avail themselves of the Court, are flouting the law. ever, to what happened some twelve months ago, when the Inter-State Commission inquired into the price of meat, and brought up recommendations upon which the Government said they would take, action to fix prices. That announcement was no sooner made than a deputation of butchers, stock and station agents, and pastoralists from all over Australia assailed Parliament House. The Sydney to Melbourne express ran in four divisions to accommodate these men, who desired to interview the Leader of the Government. f u l l of pastoralists, stock and station agents, butchers, and others, who practically took 'possession of Parliament House, and demanded that the Government should appoint another Commission to inquire into the subject. The responsible Minister promptly said, "" V e r y well; we w ill have another inquiry."" A second inquiry duly took place, and when it was was freely found that no other conclusion could be arrived at than that the original recommendation should be adhered to, it was decided that the price of meat should be fixed. I do not know what followed in this State, b u t ' the graziers and farmers of Muswellbrook, New South Wales, passed a resolution that if the Government persisted in fixing prices as proposed they would put no more money into the war loans. strike, and would not send any cattle down to the saleyards. Sydney Morning Herald of 22nd J u l y last contained the following statement bearing ou that point:Fixed prices for meat come into force on 29th July. Waggons for carrying stock to the Homebush sales are ordered in advance. The following figures may be significant as indicating the feeling of those, who send stock to That has market:-Fo r 25th July, Thursday next, 309 sheep .and 130 cattle waggons have been ordered. For 20th July, the day-when fixed prices become operative, 69 sheep and 30 cattle waggons have been ordered; and for the following Thursday, 19 sheep waggons and 8 cattle waggons. Supporters of the Government Por a fortnight, then, Ave were to have 88 waggons of sheep sent to the Homebush Saleyards, as compared w it h over 300 I would draw their attention, howwaggons sent down in the previous fortnightly period. The graziers and farmers defied the Federal Government, and went on strike, but nothing was said of their action. I did not hear that any of them were prosecuted, or that any of their stations were taken from them. The Government practically said to these men, "" If you w ill not obey the law, you can do as you please."" And they have been doing as they please ever since. Now, however, that the seamen are not prepared to avail themselves of the existing artibration t r i bunal, the Government say to them, "" Go Bourke-street, so to speak, was to the Arbitratio n Court, or we w ill starve you and the community generally."" In justice to the people, the Government should make a move in the direction of securing for the seamen some of the-concessions for which they are asking.

242,Mr Wallace,"T h a t is so. Theaverage worker on shore has to-day. No Court could deal with their demands for compensation to their next of kin in the event of their succumbing to influenza contracted while in the discharge of their duties. The Government, however, could determine the matter by bringing the Navigation Act into operation by proclamation, and amending that section of the Act which covers such questions. The seamen's strike has not been sprung upon the people. It has been threatening ever since the last award made by the Court in December last.. The men were dissatisfied with that award, and told the officials of their union that unless something better were obtained trouble would occur. The officials endeavoured to have the matter rectified. In February last there was a strike in Sydney, as the result of which fifteen or. sixteen vessels were tied up. We endeavoured to obtain men to man the ships, and I said to some of the boys, "" You are asking for a big thing, and you cannot expect to get it in five minutes. Will you be content if I obtain for you an undertaking that what is known as the insurance clause will be inserted in your articles?"" They agreed to my proposal, and after the deputation which had waited upon me on the subject retired, I communicated by telephone with, the Comptroller of Shipping, Admiral Clarkson, asking if he would be prepared to insert in ships' articles a provision that, in the event of any seaman contracting pneumonic influenza in the course of his employment, he should receive wages either until his recovery or his return to his home port, and that in the event of his death, compensation to the extent of £500 should be granted to his next of kin. That was not an unreasonable request, but the Comptroller of Shipping turned it down. I advised the men of his decision. They were dissatisfied with it , and determined to fight this battle to a finish. Who will say that the request was unreasonable? Most of our shore workers are protected to some extent against injury sustained in the course of their employment. Certain provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act cover the case of men who contract pneumonia and other complaints while employed in freezing works and other factories of the kind. The seamen are asking that the same principle shall be extended to them. The people generally do not know that if a seaman who had shipped from Melbourne were taken ill on reaching New South Wales he would be put ashore and sent to a hospital; that as soon as he was put ashore his wages would cease, and that when he came out of hospital he would have to find his way back to Melbourne as best he could. The position is the same in regard to a seaman who ships here for a voyage to the other side of the world. If. he took ill he would receive his wages as long as he remained on ship-board, but as soon as he was put ashore, because of his illness, his wages would cease. No wages would be forthcoming until he rejoined his ship. Clarkson .agree that the seamen should be paid wages in such circumstances? told me, in February last, that he would not agree to the insertion of a clause in ships' articles providing for compensation. made further concessions. aware he has not. Does the honourable gentleman think that a compensation clause, covering illness that may occur to a man while on board ship, should be inserted in ships' articles? the Court will decide. decide it. The honourable gentleman knows very well that the owners of seven different vessels agreed to insert this clause in their articles, and to allow the seamen an additional 35s. per month. These vessels were not under the direction of the Comptroller of Shipping, since they were running to F i j i and New Zealand. One of them, however-the Riverina-wa s taken off the New Zealand run and placed in the Sydney-Hobart trade. As soon as she went on the Tasmanian run her men were deprived of the additional 35s. per month and the compensation clause. This shows that it",51,Robert Best Th E Price Is Is Had To Pay Mighty Big Prices F Or The

248,Mr Wallace,"The Court cannotis the Government who have refused all along to grant these concessions. fight. a political fight. The ship-owners were quite prepared to make these concessions'. The Inter-State Central Shipping Board consists of Admiral Sir William Clarkson, Comptroller of Shipping; David Hunter, Deputy Comptroller of Coastal Shipping, C. H . Hughes, Dnion Steam-ship Company; C. M . Newman, Howard Smith CompanyL i m it e d ; E. Northcote, Adelaide Steam-ship Company; D . York Syme, junr., Melbourne Steam-ship Company, and J. Turnbull, Australian United Steam Navigation Company. should be inclined to say that there was a conspiracy between the and the gentlemen concerned but for the fact that six members of the Shipping Board are representatives of companies that were paying the increased wages and granting the desired conditions. being so, the only influence operating against the granting of the increase sought must be that of the Government. It is to be presumed that the Shipping Board carries on its deliberations justas other boards do, and that the decision of the majority is carried into effect. Thus, if six or seven members of a board of nine are willing to concede certain conditions, it appears to me that Admiral Clarkson must have been prevented hy the Government from granting them. Admiral .Clarkson asserts in his statement that seamen r u n no more risk of contracting pneumonic influenza than does the average individual who works on shore. That is an absurd statement. He might as well say that medical men or nurses attending influenza patients r u n no more risk of contracting the disease than does the average man ashore. Seamen are confined to a small space on shipboard, and if a case of influenza occurs, it is likely to spread like wildfire. out on a troopship, the whole of the men practically would be affected. professional man, in the discharge of his duty, has to leave his head-quarters in .Tasmania, which is a clean State, to come to Victoria, which is infected, would he not expect to receive some compensais a political tion for the risk he ran? That is all that the seamen are seeking. It undoubtedly was It is repugnant to the British' sense of fair play that a sailor, who leaves his wife and children here, and ships for an American port, should ibave his wages stopped immediately he takes ill and is uut ashore. The Government should not hesitate to say that the conditions for which the men ask shall obtain, not only during an epidemic, but in normal times. we did increase the rates in the case of those who shipped from a clean port to I an infected port, so faT as overseas shipping was concerned. tleman amuses me'. The Government wished to lay. down certain conditions. Their attitude in this regard is ""very much, like that which they took up when That the seamen asked for a bonus where they served on vessels operating in the war zone. A f t e r negotiating with the Government for about eighteen months, we secured tbeir approval to the payment of a bonus to the crews of vessels operating in certain latitudes. A man, however, had to be an accountant in order to determine in these circumstances when the bonus commenced to apply and when it ceased. The Government took fifteen months to make up their minds to grant us this bonus, and it was no sooner approved than the Armistice was declared, with the result that it was not paid for even a month. The Acting Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Poynton) now says that the authorities agreed to the payment of in creased wages to seamen shipping for a voyage from a clean to an infected port. We do not ask this concession on account of the influenza. If a seaman contracts illness tlirough no fault of his own, he is entitled to wages unti l he is returned to his own port and cured, and in the event of his death, £500 is not too much to pay to his next-of-kin. The Navigation Act should be proclaimed, and the necessary T h a t is so. "" If a amendments made to meet the position that has arisen.

The sleeping book"" than had any previous five Liberal Governments. passed not only the Defence Act, but the Commonwealth Bank Act, and dozens of other Acts of benefit to the community. In a comprehensive piece of legislation like this it is certain some things must be overlooked, but we may assume that if it were in operation, and a Labour Government were now in power, there would be no hesitation in amending it , and proclaiming it in order to meet present difficulties. The Navigation Bili came before the Federal Parliament in 1905, and the Labour Government did not come into power until 1910; and it was between 1910 and 1913 that the measure was passed. If the Labour Government had not come into power the Act would never have been passed at all. Government did not proclaim the Act? the Act was not proclaimed, at the request of the Imperial Government, on the ground that British shipping would be required to carry foodstuffs on the other side of the world, and the succeeding Governments? the fact that British vessels would be engaged in carrying foodstuffs elsewhere, the British Government thought it might be necessary to induce vessels of neutral countries to carry on the Australian trade here, and it was feaTed that relations with neutral countries might be strained if their vessels were compelled to pay Australian wages. It was on this ground that the Imperial Government requested that the operation of the Act should be postponed. However, the war is now Navigation Act over, and the Act ought to be proclaimed. What would be the use of the seamen going to arbitration when it is known that the Judge of the Arbitration Court could not make it obligatory on the ship-owners to improve the existing accommodation on the vessels. Indeed, it is very doubtful whether the present Government have authority in some cases. It is only necessary to go on board some of the big passenger ships to see how abominable is the accommodation proaccommodation is in some cases not The Labour Government fit for a dog. Imagine a man turning into a bunk 6 feet by 3 feet wide and 4 feet between bunks, which is, as some one has said, too big for a coffin and too small for a grave. In some vessels the bunks are ranged by the ship's side in the extreme bow, where the space is most cramped, with probably a table that is lifted out of the way when not in use, so as to leave room to move. These conditions obtain on boats like the Wyandra, and they ought to be altered. Of course, some of the boats have excellent accommodation for the seamen, and all should be on the same plane. mean hanging up a lot of shipping Which is now urgently required? now been hung up for six weeks, during the seamen's strike, and nothing has been done in the way of remodelling the accommodation. labourers on the vessels, I suppose? on the vessels now. Members of another organization are painting and cleaning the passengers' and ofiicers' quarters, and it is possible they may have given a coat of paint, or acoat of tar, to the seamen's quarters. In practically 90 per cent, of the smaller passenger boats on the coast of New South Wales the accommodation is inadequate for the number of men they carry; further, in some cases the forecastle is below the wiater line, with the closets and lavatory accommodation at",53,Robert Best Th E Price Is Is Had To Pay Mighty Big Prices F Or The

These lavatories, and so forth, are ventilated from the deck, and if the wind is in a certain direction' the air first gets into the lavatories, and the effluvium is carried into the forecastle. If a seaman protests against such conditions he gets the "" sack""; and this has been the state of affairs for many years. Por four years the seamen have not asked for any alteration in their agreement; and they are the only workers in that position. Our sailors are said to have done great work during the war in braving submarines and other perils; and all they ask now is for some compensation. arbitration ? ber, as a legal man, knows that the Court has no power to enforce any alteration in the accommodation. tial extent it has. pretty safe to assume that the honourable member would accept a brief from the ship-owners to fight the seamen on the question. All the seamen ask is good accommodation. They contend that the Navigation Act, as it applies to accommodation, should extend to all ships owned OT controlled by the Associated Steam-ship owners within six months after the agreement has been signed, and that would give the ship-owners sufficient time to make the necessary alterations. If such an agreement were made to-day or to-morrow, it would lie with the Pederal Government to put the Navigation Act into operation. The Government have already promised to proclaim the Act, and why not do it Tight away, and thus remove one of the greatest difficulties in the way of a settlement? All that the seamen ask, in regard to compensation, is thatThe provisions of the Commonwealth Seamen's Compensation Act shall apply to all vessels signing articles in Australia. An insurance guarantee of £500 to be paid to the next-of-kin of seamen dying whilst in the service of the employer. Wajres to accrue during sickness and until the seaman is returned to his home port, and is cured and fit to return to work. The demands of the seamen can be made applicable to all ships only by providing for them in the Act itself. Should the Judge of the Arbitration Court make an award in. the matter of compensation, it would prove null and void if the seaman received his injury outside the 3-mile limit; whereas, if the Act were amended as I have suggested, it would apply wherever the ship might be. There are other anomalies that require removing. Almost every newspaper has expressed surprise at the demand for a six-hour day in port, urging that it would mean the overthrow of industry and create a precedent that would cause every other union in Australia to apply for similar terms. It must be remembered, however, that what is asked is only for. a six-hour day in port. A ship trading to New Zealand, and five or six days at sea, may arrive in port at 7 or 8 o'clock at night; and it is known that a majority of the married men do not live on the water front. Many married seamen have built homes, the mortgage on which they are paying off, and as these places are some distance from the water front, if the men cannot leave their vessels until 6 o'clock at night, they are not able to reach their homes until 8 or 9 o'clock. If they are obliged to be on board again at 7 o'clock in the morning, they must leave their homes the night before or rise at 4 o'clock in the morning. All they ask is that while in port their day's work shall begin at 9 o'clock in the morning and terminate at' 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Ait sea they are prepared to work eight hours a day, and if a ship is in distress, or if anything should happen to jeopardize the safety of passengers or cargo, they are prepared to work anynumber of hours, as they are required to do by our maritime legislation, in order to save life or property. their leisure time as people on shore can do. want to leave their vessels at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, so that -they may have a i ., j chance of going among the shops and mak-",54,Robert Best Th E Price Is Is Had To Pay Mighty Big Prices F Or The

As regards that part of the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace), in which he defined the position of the seamen, I personally, and I am sure all honourable members on this side, sympathize w i th him fully in the views he has expressed. I feel much indebted to the honourable member for the explanation he has given, and the facts he has placed before the House. So far as I could gather from the speech, the principal complaints of the seamen are that they do not think the Arbitration Court has power to do what they believe ought to be done at present -that is a charge which the honourable member curiously enough brings against the present Government, although If a i l to see how the Government can be held responsible for ' it in the remotest degreeand that most of the things which they desire to have done could be achieved if the Navigation Act were brought into force. prehended the honourable member clearly. The best reply to those statements is that it is the intention of the Government to amend the Arbitration Act to make it more efficient, and also to make what, I understand, are vital amendments in the Navigation Act, and then to proclaim it . is very good as it is. Navigation Act was introduced three times by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), it is surely unnecessary to add that it is probably the best Act ever passed by any Legislature. Seeing that the Arbitratio n Act is to be amended and strengthened as soon as possible, and that the Navigation Act requires some adjustments, and that the Government'are going to attend to these matters, any charge against the Government in connection with the present most unfortunate seamen's strike absolutely falls to the ground. I have the fullest possible sympathy with, all the aims and aspirations of those British seamen who manned our Inter-State boats I and the British Pleet during the war. No man with a drop of British blood in his veins can ignore the enormous services rendered by the men of the British mercantile marine in saving the Empire, Australia, and tbe Allies from destruction. I cannot deal with, all the matters discussed by honourable members opposite during this debate. In their attempt to damage the Government, the Opposition have "" surveyed mankind from China to P e r u "" ; they have compassed land and sea, and sought everywhere for a stick to beat the Government with . Graziers' Gazette. profitable reading the honourable member has ever done in his life. I urge bim not to be weary in well-doing, and to other honourable members on the other side, I say, "" Go thou and do likewise.""

This afternoon I listened with rapt attention to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. Wallace), who most violently attacked the wool-growers of Australia, and, by implication, the Government, because they had received far too much for the Australian wool clip.

But, as a matter of fact, neither charge can be sustained. No one in this House deplores more than I do the high cost of living, nor -would do more to p u t an end to it if any practical way out could be shown; but I am here to refute the charge that the high cost of living in Australia is in any way. due to the high price obtained for Australian wool. able members of the circumstances which surrounded the acquirement of the Australian wool clip by the British Government. It has been said that the wool-growers! as the result of the war, got an enormous price-fa r higher than they were entitled to. Before the war began, Australian wool was realizing a very high price. indeed, in the early part of i.914. gradual rise in the price of wool for several years. I am not giving averages, which seem to me to be often used to a great extent to destroy facts. I attended wool sales in Australia in the early part of 1914, and in London a little later, and I know the price of wool had been advancing, and was very high before the war broke out. was sold the price had reached 33id. .at Geelong. ing to the outbreak of war is conveniently forgotten by all those who are so ready to attack the wool-growers, and to speak as if growing wool and meat was some crime against society. in this House with absolute .ferocity, as if I were a criminal, because I grew wool and produced meat. I may be over sensitive, but that is the impression left on me. One of the first effects of the war was a heavy fal l in the price of wool. Eor the first clip shorn after the outbreak of war the Australian -wool-growers had to take a very low price indeedmuch lower than they had been receiving before. price 1 wool sold at that price. It is of no use to mention individual prices, because there are infinite gradations in wool. at that price ? For instance, some greasy wool last week I would remind honorwould be sold up to 30d. and 31d., while other greasy wool would be sold down to 4d. Wool varies, so that it is idle to quote amy particular price, unless the quality is mentioned. Next a sudden demand for wool set in . I have been in this industry for forty-five years, and a l l my life I have .seen constant fluctuations in the price of wool. Woolf e l l too low after the outbreak of war; then there was a reaction, and the price began A very high price, to improve. To those gentlemen who say that we asked the British Government U p to 18£d. too much for our wool, to the disadvantage of that Government and of the consumers of woollen goods in Australia, I should like to point out that when we were asked to name a price at which we would sell the Australian clip to that Government, wool had, by the ordinary process of competition confined to British and Allied buyers, reached a very high price indeed. As a matter of fact, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) reminded me, the value of wool, created by the honest, fair, and open competition of buyers who wanted it , was greater, when the price to the B ritish Government was fixed, than the price we -fixed it at. A good deal is said about combinations and people who enter into combines and trusts. The wool-growers of Australia have never entered voluntarily No one suggests that. into any combine w it h regard to the I have been assailed price of their wool.

The idea underlying this move was that the complete control of the clip would enable them to better serve the interests of the Empire and of the Allies. We were asked two questions-first, we were prepared to sell our wool to the Imperial Government; and, secondly, if we were so prepared, would we name a price which we considered fair and satisfactory. one amongst us desired our wool to be sold in that fashion, we immediately intimated our willingness to allow the Imperial Government to buy the whole of the clip, and to do what they liked with it. We also endeavoured to arrive at a price which we considered would be fair and equitable in all the circumstances After a little consideration, a price was named, and everybody who knows anything about the matter will recognise that it was agreed upon in a fair, moderate, and honourable spirit, th© wihole question being viewed not merely from the stand-point of the Imperial Allies, hut 'also from that of the wool growers and the consumers of wool in Australia. the Imperial Government without any bargaining or haggling whatever. is the nearest approach to what can scarcely be termed-even stretch of imagination-a into which the wool-guowers of this country have ever entered. It was not our desire that system of disposing of our wool by public from. That system was altered in deference to tbe wish expressed by theImperial authorities, and we fell in with their desires. It has been stated by the Opposition that in some way or other the high prices realized by Australian wool growers are responsible for the high cost of living in the Commonwealth. utterly point, I must make a brief ence to a letter read by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr wool grown in the Commonwealth. Mr Jowett. Wallace) to the effect that a certain Australian manufacturer had experienced great difficulty in obtaining wool. So great, indeed, was his difficulty that he alleged that it would pay him. better to get somebody to buy the wool he required in London, land to send it back to Australia, than ,to purchase it here. whether I have no hesitation in saying that my honourable friend has been most grossly misinformed. I do not for a moment doubt his own bona fides. No member of this House would do so.. But the gentleman who supplied him with that inforNotwithstanding that not mation supplied him with something which is absolutely false. As the statement is such an astounding one, I will ask my honourable friend to furnish this House with the name of the author of the letter. never get any more wool supplied to him. the most preposterous and outrageous one that the human mind can conceive. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr .Riley) knows that. However, since this charge has been made, I may be permitted briefly to explain exactly the position which obtains to-day. Every bale of Government and of the wool in Australia has to be examined by two sets of experts, one representing the seller, and the other the Commonwealth That price was accepted by Government, which acts as the buyer. Every manufacturer in Australia, if he This cares to take the trouble to ask for it , may be supplied with a list of every apby the wildest praisement. He will be given either ""combine "" twenty-four or forty-eight hours' notice, and he will then be at liberty to go to any wool-store in the Commonwealth and select, at the appraised prices, every lot the time-lhonoured of wool that he requires for manufacturing purposes. He thus has an. absolute preauction should be departed ference. the wool has been sold to the Imperial Government. one of the conditions of the sale.

No t only has every Australian manufacturer the first right to select any bale of wool at the appraised price, but as a matter of fact he can purchase it at a little lower price than can the Imperial Government. So much for the extraordinary statements which have misled the honourable member for West Sydney. It has been urged that in some way or other the alleged high price being realized for Australian wool varied from the commencement of the scheme t ill now. as my honourable friend reminds me, has never varied. But we are nevertheless told that it is responsible for the in creased cost of clothing. I was very much interested when the honourable member for West Sydney related how, at a period subsequent to the acquisition of the'Australian clip by the Imperial Government, and when our own manufacturers were in a position to buy wool in the way I have mentioned, he had purchased a suit of clothes for £ 5 5s.,' and was subsequently asked £ 9 9s. for a similar suit. but I did not pay it . my honourable friend to purchase that suit at £ 9 9s. as soon as possible, because a great many of my own friends have had to pay much more than that. But A t what price? my point is that at the time the honorA t the price which able member bought his suit for £ 5 5s. the Australian woollen manufacturers were paying exactly the same price for their wool as they are paying for it now. Consequently, if the price of woollen garments made from Australian cloth has advanced during the past three years, that advance is obviously not due in the remotest degree to the price paid for the wool. ber is now raising a very big question. the Government to deal with it ? sently point out how, in my opinion, that duty may be discharged. But the honourable member for West Sydney has practically confirmed everything that I have said. I believe that he paid a visit to the Oommonwealth Woollen Factoryi n Geelong on the same day as I visited it in company with other honourable members. There, cloth is manufactured out of good Australian wool, purchased in exactly the way I have described, namely, at a price slightly lower than that paid by the Imperial. Government. The wool is bought by the Commonwealth, and is manufactured in Geelong under probably the best industrial conditions from the stand-point of wages and hours of labour, obtaining in any part of the world. I was informed on very reliable authority that that cloth was despatched to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, where it was manufactured into suits of clothes, which' were given to civilian soldiers, with a cap thrown in , at a cost to the Commonwealth Government of 30s. Thab being the case, when my honourable friend has to pay £ 9 9s. for a suit of clothes, I ask h i m who gets it ? Certainly not the wool-grower. it. able member for Maranoa( Mr Page) w ill confirm my statement. All the charges, therefore, which have been hurled from the Opposition benches at my defenceless head, and at the heads of all the wool-growers of Australia, are absolutely baseless.

In reality, the whole object of every one of the combines and trusts is to prevent competition, and thus to raise prioes or prevent them from falling , and to prevent the consumers of Australia from getting a f a i r return for their money. There is no doubt whatever about that. Honourable members opposite are under a false impression regarding myself, because I grow wool and produce meat in a fairly large way. It is my desire that every man, woman, and child shall have as ample a supply aa possible of warm clothing, and shall be as well fed as possible. -unti l I was drawn into this political vortex-to endeavouring to grow in Australia as much wool and wheat as possible. AlthoughI have been criticised very severely, not so much here as elsewhere, because I do these things on a large scales I fai l to see that it is any crime to increase Australia's production of wool and of food. I wish to say that throughout my business life I have been fighting these combines, trusts, and associations in every possible direction. B ut do they disappear because one or two individuals combat them ? Do they cease to enlarge their sphere of operations ? No. They are encompassing us round about. The consumers of Australia, and also the business people who are not in the combines, find it absolutely impossible to escape their exactions. What is the position? The Commonwealth Government and the members of the party on this side will do their best, if I understand them aright-and , if not, I shall no longer remain a member of this party-to bring in such measures as will stamp out these combines, trusts, arrangements, associations, and honourable understandings. But this cannot be done without an alteration of the Constitution. It is quite impossible without that. shall be very much disappointed if before very long steps are not taken by. the Government and the party behind them, supported, I hope, by my honourable friends opposite, to bring about such an alteration of the Constitution as will, if taken proper advantage of, enable us to stamp out these combines, associations, and trusts. straight way.

I stand for the utmost possible abundance of things good for the people of Australia, and things which are good to export to the rest of the world.

It is my belief that unless an honest effort is made to check this movement in prices, ' the people, at the very first opportunity, will change the whole aspect of this House, and change the Government also. They will be justified in doing that. No subject of greater importance the cost of living could be debated in this House.

But what has happened? In the Botany district to-day the wool top industry stands idle, and 800 hands have been discharged, because the Wool Committee entered into a compact to secure for the Government 65 per cent, of the profits of the industry, and some dispute arose as to the division of the profits, with the result that a law case is pending, and all the employees of the industry have been out of work almost since last Christmas. a bold policy, if they wanted to see these industries manner, tbey should have brushed Mr P. W. Hughes aside and put in 'charge a manager to control the work, pending a Afr. Riley. decision w it h regard to the law case. H a d that course been taken, the Government would have made hundreds of thousands of pounds, because wool tops are bringing a splendid price at the present time, and P. W . Hughes and Co. have enormous quantities of tops stored in Sydney. Other countries of the world, including Great Britain, are calling out for tops, but cannot get them, because these people are not allowed to export from than Australia. The whole thing is in a state of muddle, and ^reflects no credit on either the Government or the Wool ComThe Government should mittee. WeI t is interesting, also, to learn how the Wool Committee is controlling the sheepskin industry. When the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs' at the outbreak of the war, I brought under his notice, by introducing a deputation, the fact The honorthat certain people were exporting large quantities of sheepskins dry to America, thus limiting employment in Australia. Mr Tudor immediately took action to He may think prevent further exports, with a result that the skins were treated within the woolCommonwealth. But what has happened since then?

There is thus an inducement to dry the skins and send them Home. In the interests of the Commonwealth, the Government ought not to allow such a system to continue, since it has led to hundreds of men in every 'State being thrown out of employment.

No country can progress in the absence of a strong works policy calculated to develop its resources: There are many other important subjects in respect to which we as a party would like the Government to legislate. Having regard to the distress prevailing in all the States, I think that the Government should be prepared to hand over to the noble band of men and women now rendering assistance to the poor who are stricken down w it h ' influenza all the surplus blankets and flannel in the possession of the military authorities. It would be far better to allow them to distribute these blankets amongst the sick poor of the different States than to sell them in large quantities by public auction, allowing a few men to make a fortune out of them. the honourable member suggests has already been done. it. Sir blankets are to be distributed. the right direction. thousands of military blankets here during the present week. Government should consider the desirableness of distributing the surplus flannel and blankets now held by the Defence Department amongst the poor who have been stricken with sickness. I come now to the question of the Federal Capital. It is all very well for representatives of Victoria, who are able to return to their own homes every evening, to try to prevent the building of the Federal Capital, but I would remind them that one of the conditions on which New South Wales entered the Union was that the Seat of Government should be established in that State. The compact then made has beeu complied with to a certain extent by the selection of the Federal Territory. We have in the Canberra district 900 square miles of some of the finest eountry in New South Wales-countr y possessing all the essentials to the building up of a large city. ready been spent on the Federal Capital? been expended on the purchase of land, and that money must remain idle unti l the land is put to use. It was determined at the outset that no part of the Federal Territory should be sold by the Commonwealth, but that the leasehold system should apply to it . It was thought that when the Seat of Government was moved to the permanent capital a large population would follow and take up leaseholds, with the result of a growing rent roll that would, in a few years, mean a big revenue towards the expenses of government. Money has been spent at Canberra on, amongst other things, a dam across the Cotter River, two great reservoirs for an adequate water supply for the city, a power plant sufficient to light the whole place and supply power for all the factories that may be erected, and brickworks. Mr .SAMPSON:-Has the honourable member estimated the cost of moving the Parliament to the Federal Capital, and T h a t will be a step in I expected some Victorian members to ask questions of the kind, because., no doubt, they are very comfortable in Melbourne.

If we are honest in this matter, and anxious to f u l fil the compact made at the inception of Federation, it would be easy to find ways and means; but, of course, it is always open to honourable members to throw obstacles in the way.

I hope that honourable members opposite will carefully consider their vote on the question before them, and not support a mere empty, sounding programme of words, without any real substance. For the reasons I have given I shall vote for the amendment. listened with great interest to the speech of the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), and, apart from what he said about the Federal Capital, I take great exception to most of his statements. The honourable inember made a vigorous . attack on the Government in connection with the increased cost of living. pointed out that at the beginning of 1914 all dairy products, such as cheese, butter, honey, eggs, ham, and bacon, were very cheap, and that in 1917 they had doubled in value. He claimed that that was owing to the fact that the Labour party was in power early in 1914. As a matter of fact, it was a Liberal Government that was in power early in 1914, and the Labour party cannot claim any credit for the cheapness of living at that time. No honorablo member opposite has pointed ont a remedy for the high cost of livin g of to-day. The Labour party was in power in 1915-1916, when the factors which have brought about the increase in the cost of livin g were in operation, but no special legislation was introduced to deal with them. The only power which this Government possesses over the price of commodities 'is given by the War Precautions could have been extended, but as soon as the armistice was signed the Opposition to a man clamoured for its repeal. To show how inconsistent they are, several of them are now claiming that the Act should be continued in force in order to deal with exploiters. The real reason why the price of commodities increased so much in 3915-1916 was that in that period Australia had one of the biggest droughts on record. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) will bear me out when I sav that the dairy herds of the coastal district of Queensland and New South Wales were practically wiped out by the drought, and if , as the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr. Riley) says, the price of milk, butter, and cheese has gone un, it is owing to that cause. The drought was so severe that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Tudor), who was then Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, repealed the fodder duties in order that the cab-drivers of the Y a r r a [9.19] I electorate might obtain cheap chaff from New Zealand. ber in favour of deporting Australians? ing with any criminals, spies, or enemies of my K in g and country.

432,Mr Pigott,"When Australia andto the liberties we prize so much, and which we have enjoyed so long. It is time that the eyes of the people were opened to this fact. The honourable member for ""West Sydney( MT . Wallace) said this afternoon that the graziers of Australia went on strike when the price of meat was fixed. He said tliat there was a big agitation in Melbourne, and he spoke of a big deputation to a Minister in the Queen's Hall. He was right in saying that there was a deputation. honourable member was wrong when he said that, as a result of that agitation, the Government had a fresh inquiry made. As a matter of fact, the second inquiry had already been held. The honourable member also gave us figures as to the truckings for Homebush and Flemington. from the Sydney Morning Herald. Sydney Morning Herald says. Let the honourable member go to the meteorologist, and ask how many inches of rain fell about that time. It so happened that the breaking of the drought synchronized with the period to which he was referring. A t least, the drought did not completely break, but copious rains fell throughout New South Wales at that time. The honourable member knows what happens when a drought occurs. A grazier sends all his prime sheep and cattle to the market; in fact, he sends away all his forward stores in order to clear his paddocks; but once the rain falls there are immediate withdrawals of stock from sale. That is exactly what happened on that occasion. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) says that the Government have neither plan nor policy, and have done nothing for repatriation, but the Treasurer has pointed out that £21,370,050 has been provided for interest, .sinking fund on the war debt, for tvar pensions, and for repatriation. It is said that comparisons are odious. If we compare the performances of the present Government with those' of the Labour party, we find the comparison very odious indeed. The first War Pensions Bill was introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia, who has made this attack on the Treasurer ( Mr Watt). He was Treasurer of the Labour Government of the day. Hansard, page 8309, 22nd May, 1916, shows that that liberalminded Government thought 5s. a week a sufficient pension for the children of men who died for the Empire at the Front. 100 per cent, less then than it is now. .Treasury was not depleted then.

On that occasion the Liberal Opposition, of which I was a member, protested against the Government proposal, and some of the better members of the Labour party joined in our protest. We moved that the amount be increased to 10s. per week. The present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) opposed us. Therei t is on record.

Let us see what the honourable member who attacked this Government so violently on the Repatriation scheme vesterday did when he was Treasurer. which the Labour Government thought fit and proper to vote'for repatriation in the Estimates of 1916, as shown on page 8141 of Hansard, was the magnificent sum of £250,000, which, spread over 250,000 soldiers, meant an allowance of £ 1 each -At 31st May, 1919, 2,460 had completed back in 1916 ? number fighting at the Front, and we could assume that they would come back. A great many were already back at that time. On that occasion I .ridiculed the proposition, and said the day would come when we would have to spend £50,000,000 in tliis direction. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). referring to me, said that as a financier I would realize that my proposal meant about £2,500,000 per annum for interest., and asked by what for m of taxation I proposed to raise that money. When I made the proposal, the honourable' member nearly fainted to think that that colossal sum would have to be raised, yet the time has» come, as I predicted, when we have to spend that amount for this purpose. Only recently Senator Millen said that his great housing scheme for returned soldiers would, before it was completed, absorb fullv £50.000,000. That would be in addition to all the money required to pay war pensions and other charges to meet fche needs of the soldiers. Honourable members have all received a little book from the Repatriation Department. Fromi t I take the following facts:Total number of members of the I want no side-trackAustralian Imperial Force returned to the Commonwealth, 31st May, 1919 .. .. .. . . 150,284 Total number of men discharged from the Australian Imperial Force. . 111,563 Total number' of applications to Department of Repatriation under all headings .. .. . . 177,478 These applications were submitted by separate applicants .. . . 94,030 Total number of applications approved under all headings, as follows:General assistance .. 100,307 Placed in employment .. 4*2,470 Approved for vocational training .. . . 7,513 150,350 Employment -Out of 47,200 applications, The amount 42,470 were placed in employment.

Vocational Training -Of 13,507 applications for vocational training, 7,513 courses were, approved. courses nf training, and 4,222 were pursuing their training courses. Yet in the face of this we are told by the honourable member for Capricornia that the present Government have neither plan nor policy so far as repatriation is concerned. A number of criticisms are hurled at the pastoralists by many members, who speak from the Opposition benches,' and the Leader of the Opposition once referred to them as piratical profiteers. The pastoralists, taking them right through, are not making very big fortunes this year in many parts of Australia. A l though the price of wool is fixed at 15£d., which is 60 per cent, more than the price before the war, yet in the year 1912 the clip for Australia was 726,406,825 lbs., while the last available figures given by Knibbs show that for 1917 the clip amounted to only 547,702,295 lbs. This would leave a shortage of wool to be distributed amongst the pastoralists of Australia, equivalent to 33$ per cent. Now, the increase in the price of this commodity, on the oasis of the sales effected to the British Government as compared with the price obtained before the war, amounts to 60 per cent.

Therefore, they are worse off than they were before. ber ought to be writing prospectuses for mining companies. He is the greatest juggler with figures I have ever known.

I wish the Minister to give some sympathetic consideration to these drought-stricken districts in the western parts, of New South Wales. We do not approach him, cap in hand, but we do ask him to urge the Central Wool Board to pay to these settlers the 10 per cent, which was deducted from the last wool clip and also from the three clips which have gone to England. If an announcement could be made as to the approximate amount that w ill be represented by our 50 per cent, share of any profit which may be derived in excess qf 15^d., in accordance with the terms of our sale to the Imperial Government, the financiers of New South Wales and other parts of Australia would be willin g to that way the position would be materially relieved. Again, I think a more .equitable method should be devised of taxing these pastoralists upon their pro. fits than that which is provided under our War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act . In that Act we followed the lines laid down in the BritishA c t by taxing the average profits made over a period of three years. orable member ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.""] leading industry of Australia alive, some consideration must be extended to the settlers in our remote rural areas. The biggest drought on record has struck most of the settlers in New South Wales within the past twelve months or so. I know of one station in the Tullamore district where the people have been obliged to have water brought by rail 80 miles to W ill the honourable the nearest railway station, and then have it carted a further distance of some 20 miles, at an appalling cost. In order to keep their sheep alive they have had to mortgage all the property that they possess. Having done this, they are now called upon to pay, perhaps, £3,000 in taxation. The Government, I repeat, should extend to these men sympathetic consideration, otherwise they will be financially wiped out. I interviewed the Commissioner of Taxesi n regard to this matter only a few days ago. He pointed out to me that the fault did not lie with him, and that our Land TaxA c t , our Income TaxA c t . and our War-time Pro-, fits Tax Assessment Act made some provision for granting relief in such cases. He stated that these men could apply for an extension of time within which to pay the sums demanded of them, and that he would then be in a position to investigate their claims. I ask the Treasurer to hint to his officers to give the case of these men sympathetic consideration. When men have gone out to the back blocks, and have done pioneering work, leaving the amenities of social l if e and the enjoyments available to the people of the big cities, and have faced ruin from droughts, something may well be done for their relief. I hope that the Government assist our pastoralists, and in w i ll take this view of the matter, and give these people the relief for which they are asking.

455,Mr Pigott,"If we wish to keep thenot going to say that the present Government have done all that might have been done to assist the men on the land engaged in growing wheat. I say that much more could be done than has been done; but I wish to institute a comparison between the position of the wheat farmer under the Labour Government and under the present NationalGovernment. The Labour party established the Wheat Pool in 1915. I think that it was established a little too early, as more wheat might have been sent away in the ordduary course in the earlier stages of the Avar. In 1915, however, the Wheat Pool was formed, and the fanners' wheat taken into it. The point I wish to drive home is that the Labour party, when in power, took the farmer's wheat, and, by way of a first instalment, gave him 5s. 6d. per bushel. The farmer had to wait for twelve or fifteen months before he got another, instalment. We aTe told by the Agricultural Department of New South Wales that it costs 4s. 2d. to produce a bushel of wheat in that State. So that, when the Labour Government gave the farmer 2s. 6d. per bushel, they called upon him to work at a loss of something .like Is. Sd. per bushel. He had storekeepers and others to pay, and it is little wonder in the circumstances that a great many farmers went out of wheat growing. came into power, one of the first things they didwas to increase the amount of the wheat farmers' first instalment. I was very proud to learn, only a few months before the last harvest, that the National Government had determined to give these needy and deserving men a first instalment of 4s. 4d. per bushel. out of wheat-growing. the honourable member that, so far as the interests of the farmer are concerned, the difference between the Labour Government and the National Government is the difference between 2s. 6d. ancl 4s. 4d. per bushel for wheat. member explain, how it is that men are going out of wheat farming under the National Government? going out because they do not get enough' for their wheat; but what must have been their position when they received only 2s. 6d. per bushel under the Labour Government? That nearly killed them. They have been struggling for years, and they are only now barely recovering. Another point to be remembered in this connection is that, whilst one would think that the wheat farmer should be given some control of his own interests, under the Labour Government there was not a single farmer on either the State or Central Wheat Boards. There were some politicians, there were some school masters, and there was one bookmaker. I do not think that he had ever seen wheat growing in his life. , his name. We are discussing a vote of censure, and it is just as well that these matters should be cleared up. I am not in the habit of dragging such things into the daylight, but when Ave are attacked by the party opposite, it is only right that the country should know where we stand. I point out to' the House and the country that under the Labour Government the wheat-growers had their business managed by people Avho knew nothing When the National Government whatever about wheat. The wheat business Avas quite foreign to them. It would haA'e been just as sensible to make a chimney sweeper Governor of the Commonwealth Bank as it Avas. to put some of the men selected by the Labour Government in control of the affairs of the Avheatgrowers. When the National Government came into power, a representative of the farmers Avas appointed to the Central Wlieat Board, -as a result of a good deal of fighting on this side, but of none on the opposite side. Honourable mem» bers may search Hansard, and they will not find in it a single suggestion from the, party opposite that the Avheat farmers should be represented on either the Central or State Wheat Boards. there had been a drought. orable member for South 'Sydney says",74,Robert Best Yes And The Providing For Tbe Administrative Staffs

463,Mr Pigott,"That is so. The honthat we have had no drought. I am reminded hy his statement that Mr Fisher on one occasion spoke of the biggest drought we ever had as a "" l it t l e drought."" Travelling through my electorate the other day, a man said to me, "" We are having another of Fisher's ' little droughts'."" When the National -Government, came into power, honourable members on this side, and particularly those in the cross-bench corner, who have the interests of the agriculturists at heart, fought strenuously and continuously until the Government gave way, and to our satisfaction and the greatsatisfaction of the farmers, the wheat growers are to-day f u l l y represented on the Central and on the State Wheat Boards. sented, in the opinion of the honourable member? would leave the matter in my hands, I think I could please the farmers better than they have been pleased by some of the ajipointments that have been made, but I am comparing their position now with their position under the Labour Government. To my mind, one of the most regrettable things in connection with Australian industries is that, as the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) knows, many of our farmers are going out of wheat-growing. . of wheat-growing under the National Government supported by the honourable member. out very much more quickly under the Labour Government, but they have very much less reason to go out of wheat-growing under the present Administration . I point out that the area under wheat has been very considerably reduced. 3915-16, thc area under wheat was something like 12,4S4,512 -acres; and in 1917-18,-this area was reduced by something like 3,000,000 acres. That is an -appalling fact. The one thing -we need in Australia is increased production. We have big liabilities to meet, and we have our soldiers to repatriate; and I say that the crux of the whole business in Australia is increased production, especially primary production. B y the increase of primar y production we may solve all the difficulties we have to face; we may reduce the cost of living, and by exporting our primary products bring wealth into the country, and so be in a position to reduce our national debt. I know that the Government are beset with great difficulties. I was talking to the secretary of the Central Wheat Board to-day, and asked him if it were possible for our farmers to get more for their wheat. I asked whether they might get something like the price ruling in Canada at the present time, which is 9s. 2d. per bushel? He pointed out that the great' difficulties whicli the GovernA r e they f u l l y reprement had to face were in connection w it h freight. He said that it is known that the sum of £14 per ton has been refused for freight from Australia to Europewhich is equal to 7s. 6d. per bushel of wheat. He informed me that the Argentine, had fixed a. minimum price of 6s. 6|d. per bushel for export The fixed price was removed, and the market has since fallen to 5s. l l £ d . The business done at the fixed price was small. Australian sales announced this year. have amounted to 152,000 tons, averaging 5s. lOd. per bushel f.o.b. Of this, 29,000 tons have been sold c.i.f., averaging 6s. 7d. per bushel f.o.b.; and 123,000 tons f.o.b. have been sold, realizing 5s. '7#d. per bushel. That w ill give an idea of the almost complete absence of charterable tonnage. The rates of freight paid on the 29,000 tons have been, on Government steamers, S5s. to 105s. per ton. That accounts for the high price c.i.f. sales. It is a remarkable fact that wheat which realized""6s. 7d. per bushel was sent abroad in Commonwealth boats for whicli freights at S5s. and 105s. In per ton were paid, whereas freights were refused by ships from foreign parts amounting to £14 per ton. I desire the Government to consider the condition of the people who have settled in the country, and to give them every possible encouragement.

467,Mr Pigott,"They started to gowill have centred in Sydney ere long, and the whole of the people of Victoria w ill be residing in Melbourne. I have prepared some illuminating figures in this ' regard. In 1909 the population of Sydney was 605,900; and the people in the country districts of New South Wales totalled 1,007,999. In .1918, Sydney's population had increased to 792,700, while that of the remainder of New South -Wales totalled 1,137,540. The increase for the past ten years in Sydney amounted to 186,800, and, in the country, to 129,541. In 3909 the population of Melbourne was 573,255, and of the rest of Victoria, 703,767. In 1918 the people residing in Melbourne numbered 723,500, and the country residents numbered 707,25S. That is to say, the population of the whole of the rest of Victoria is now about 16,000 less than the total in Melbourne. 191S the population of metropolitan centres throughout the Commonwealth had increased by 450,630, whereas the country total had increased by only 245,888. We have only to proceed in similar fashion for another fifty years and the whole of the Australian people w ill be congregated in metropolitan centres. I presume that then, instead of eating wheat, we shall have become cannibals. I am a f i r m believer in co-ordination with a view to the saving of money. A t considerable trouble I have perused recent Estimates of the various States, and I have consulted also the Pederal Estimates. ments the States spent last year £S6,275; the Pederal Department cost £53,700. A hint might well be taken from the action of Tasmania. tional representation was introduced in that little State the Pederal boundaries and Pederal rolls were adopted. There is but one electoral roll in Tasmania, and enrolment is compulsory. The one operation of placing an elector's name upon the roll suffices both for State and Federal purposes. The electoral system is carried on to-day in Tasmania at half the former expense, and thus the people are saved considerable taxation. Mr Knibbs, Statistician, Mr Pigott. His Department is costing £15,013, and in all the States somewhat similar work is being done by State Statisticians at a cost of £32,117. If any honourable member has sufficient patience to read Knibbs' Year-Book, and then compare it with the volume issued by the New South Wales Government, I venture to say he will find that f u l ly 75 per cent, of the information is common to both. I believe a saving of at least £20,000 a year could be made by incorporating all the work in one volume under one statistician. I might mention also the matter of immigration. We have an Immigration Bureau controlled by the Federal Government, and similar bodies under the control of the several States, all for the common purpose of encouraging peeple to come to Australia. To the Federal GoIn vernment it matters not if an immigrant settles in New South Wales, Victoria, or any other of the other States; he becomes a citizen. of the Commonwealth. I m m i gration sliould be controlled by one autliority. A t present this work is costing Australia £38,602. There is also serious overlapping in the activities of the Agents-General and the High Commissioner. Last year the Agents-General of Australia cost the taxpayers of this country £40,307, and the expenditure on account of the H i g h Commissioner was £48,841. TheH i g h Commissioner is housed in magnificent oflices, and I feel quite' certain that the whole of the work oould be satisfactorily discharged by h i m with , perhaps, the In their Electoral Departhelp of a few extra clerks. I am proud of the fact that there is no more loyal citizen than I claim to be. 1 pay the highest tribute to my K in g ; but When proporwith all deference I think the time has come when the Governor General should perform, all the duties which pertain to the high office of .the King's representative, which is the link that binds us to the Empire. .The State Governors cost the States £42,485 a year, while the Governor General costs the Commonwealth £26,875. I come now to Taxation Departments. I cannot see why one Department should not control the whole of our taxation the Commonwealth machinery. I made a big fight over this is' doing very good work. question in Sydney with the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Holman), who said that it was impossible to have taxation matters under the control of a Federal Commissioner, because the State Governments ' tax incomes at their source, while the Commonwealth tax is on the distribution of profits. I feel satisfied that this matter is capable of satisfactory adjustment, and that Mr Holman's answer was no reply to the argument. The present system is an expensive luxury. I find the Taxation Departments of the various States cost £12S,705, and the Federal Taxation Department £273,067. I know a man who has business interests in six different States, and has to make out separate returns for each State. Another gentleman, a former member of this House, told me that he had interests all over the Commonwealth, and was obliged to appoint an accountant, at a salary of £400 a year, to make up his returns, and to watch the amendments of the different Acts introduced by the several State Governments. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) , has remarked that it costs some taxpayers more, in the employment of accountants, lawyers, and agents, to make up their returns than the amounts actually paid in taxation. The remedy is to have only one Department, and to have all taxation payable on one day. In thi-? wav I feel quite satisfied that an important saving could be effected. This is a very serious matter. Right through my electorate I meet people who tell me they do not know how they are going to meet the heavy taxation that has beenjmposed upon them during this period of drought. The total amount paid for all these services by the States is £368,495, and by the Federal Government £417,496, or a total of £7S5,991. I estimate that, w it h amalgamation in the direction I have suggested, there would be a saving of at least £250,000 a year. We also have the Commonwealtli and State Savings Banksi n competition. In the town in which I live there is a Commonwealth Savings Bank on one side of the street and a State institution on the other side. tion,' do you not?'

The same objection applies to this competition of savings banks, because they belong to the same set of people. would you close up? The deposits could be distributed equally. By closing one set of Savings Banks a very considerable saving could be made. There is only one other matter to wihich I desire to refer. In the Woman's Journal which I recently received, there appeared an extract from Liberty and Progress dealing with Pederal and State taxation, and from it I make the following quotation, showing the number of employees in the service of the Commonwealth and the States, and the salaries paid: . No. of Employees. Salaries. Commonwealth . . 43,043 .. £6,348,409 New South Wales. . 78,009 .. 10,270,388 Victoria. . 44,575 . 6,212,567 Queensland . . 28,974 . 3,766,164 South Australia . . 20,166 .. 3,233,200 Western Australia . . 17,084 . 2,602,883 Tasmania. . 4,259 . 638,850 236,092 . £33,072,411 I venture to say that by a co-ordination of the work of the State and Pederal Departments-by the several instrumentalities of government working in perfect harmony we could save at least £10,000,000 of this expenditure. A strong, determined effort should be made by the State and Federal Parliaments to bring about this harmony, which is so much needed, and which would do much to relieve the people of the heavy burden of increased taxation to which they have to submit to-day.

473,,"Y o u believe, in competiMr LYNCH -Ho w many of our partymember, at all events, has not. I await with pleasure his explanation of the Government's failure to bring down proposals to deal with the situation in Australia to-day. Those of the Ministerial party who have spoken have been eloquent in their attempts to point out what the Government have done for our soldiers. To my mind, however, those who promised the earth and all therein to our soldiers when they were going to the war are uot showing now by their works that they intend to redeem their promises. They have not shown by their actions during the war, or by their dealings, either with the soldiers or with those dependent upon them at home, that they have any real care for the men whom they helped to send oversea to fight for what' they said would make the world safe for Democracy. It was said of the unionists who went on strike in the early '90's that they were ""lion s led by asses."" It appears to me that our soldiers might be aptly described as lions misled by the financial foxes of this""-country. They have certainly been misled by the vultures who have battened on the necessities of their dependants, who in tur n have been provided for only by the savings and sacrifices of the men to whom these promises were made. What has been done for these men ? As a case in point, let me refer to the manufacture of tweeds. That was an industry, we were told, that would find employment for a number of returned soldiers. We were informed that cloth made here by returned soldiers was being purchased at 15s. per yard and retailed at something like 19s. per yard by firms who were prepared to receive unlimited orders for it ; yet it has been considered unnecessary to continue that industry. . Lately we have had in the Queen's H a l l an exhibition illustrating the various ways in which our soldiers might be suit : ably employed. But we find that those who made so many promises to members of the working class who went away to fight for Democracy and freedom, and for all the other things which they were told they would be fighting for, have so far forgotten their pledges that many returned soldiers to-day are engaged in breaking stones, in road making, and in The honourable other work of a similar kind.

It is on a par with the statement made yesterday by the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) that during the last three weeks the Seamen's Union had been ruling this country.
