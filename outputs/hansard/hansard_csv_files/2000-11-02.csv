164,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (5.59,"22072 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 Thursday, 2 November 2000 ----Shipping: Foreign Vessels Aged Care: Accommodation Places Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.40 a.m.)-The protection of our coastlines is a responsibility for all of us, but it is particularly a responsibility for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The ships that work our coast must be safe. The Australian shipping industry has a high record of safety which is not shared by all in the international shipping community. The minister has failed to identify a pathway for the Australian shipping industry and has embarked on a program of increasing the numbers of foreign vessels in our waters-foreign vessels near our precious coastlines and our marine life. Recently, Four Corners broadcast a program focusing on the sinking of the Erika, a 37,000-tonne, quarter-of-a-century-old vessel that broke up off the coast of Brittany. Tom Mangold explained the environmental reality of this disaster: Slowly at first, some above and some below the water, a great black blanket of oil drew its tidal cover toward the coast ... a poisonous veil moving remorselessly towards one of Europe’s most fertile fishing, shellfish, marine wildlife and tourist environments. The effect on birdlife was heart breaking: They die very slowly, their elegant plumage caked in toxic filth. Death is a long slow choking nightmare followed by drowning as the birds natural waterproofing is eaten away-at the end a lifeless oily rag. It is by good fortune only that Australian coasts have not faced the environmental damage that France faced with the sinking of the Erika-an experience they are facing again with this week’s sinking of the Ievoli Sun. In 1991, the Greek tanker Kirke fell apart off the West Australian coast. If we continue to allow foreign vessels on our coasts, it will only be a matter of time before it is our fishing, our shellfish, our marine wildlife and our tourist environments that are destroyed. The minister must pay attention to the shipping part of his portfolio before it is too late. He must act to protect our coastlines. In the time remaining to me, I want to refer briefly to the issue of aged care beds in Tasmania and, in particular, in the northern planning region. It is no secret that the demand for aged care beds has far outstripped supply. I am constantly hearing complaints from constituents who wait for inordinately long periods of time to access aged care facilities. It is not just my interpretation of the situation; the department’s own report identifies shortfalls in the number of beds in the northern Tasmanian planning region. The national target for bed numbers is 90 beds per 1,000 people over the age of 70. Fifty of these beds must be low care or hostel beds. According to the department’s June figures, we have instead 34.4 low-care beds per 1,000 people over the age of 70 in the northern planning region. So if you want to assess this government by its own benchmarks in terms of provision of hostel beds, it is failing. Unfortunately, this will come as no surprise to those families who are waiting for horrendously long periods of time to access an aged care placement. If the Minister for Aged Care is going to set these targets, then the Minister for Aged Care needs to actually meet them. It is unacceptable that the most vulnerable in our community are neglected by this government. Tasmanian facilities provide a very high standard of aged care, but we have to",105,Taxation Laws Amendment Bill The Answer Lies In The Beginning For All Of Us

Parramatta Electorate: Cancer Research meeting parliament and a focus on the knowledge nation, higher learning and research, I want to mention to the chamber two outstanding women from the electorate of Parramatta and two outstanding organisations. Judith Hyam was the wife of Lord Mayor Allan Hyam before her untimely death from cancer on 21 August 1990. She was a woman who gave of herself incredibly generously to the City of Parramatta, as a councillor in her own right and as patron of numerous local organisations. Such was her influence as salt and light in the community that a group of her close friends decided to establish the Judith Hyam Memorial Trust for Cancer Research following her death. Over the past nine years, that group, where many start but do not finish the race, has continued enthusiastically to raise funds for the benefit of cancer research. In particular, I want to acknowledge the chairman, Des Kennedy; John Ball, the vice-president; Diana Mahony, the secretary; and Roger Ralston, the treasurer. They represent five blokes and 32 ladies who had no previous experience in fundraising, but who, every week, faithfully go out, raising about $70,000 a year for cancer research. The critical thing they did was not dispense it year by year but put it into a trust fund, and it has continued to grow each year. That trust fund has now accumulated over $500,000, which brings me to the second outstanding woman in my electorate. Claire Flasching is a woman who is a PhD student, and she works at the Children’s Medical Research Institute of Westmead. That institute is carrying out the most inspirational work. Claire Flasching, in particular, is looking at the first stages of cell division, when the chromosomes are broken down into telomeres. Those telomeres shorten at the point of cell reproduction. In cancerous cells, they shorten too much to the point where the cell becomes dysfunctional, and those cells are retained and they continue to accumulate as a dysfunctional, dead part of the cell. Claire is examining what it is about these telomeres that causes them to shorten in this way, and the exciting part of her research is that there is a mechanism which is only present in cancerous cells. She is looking at developing a treatment for cancer which will only affect cancerous cells instead of all of the other healthy cells in the human body. That work is being carried out in the memory of Judith Hyam only because of this inspirational commitment by these 37 men and women of Parramatta. SoI want to applaud Claire Flasching, I want to congratulate the Children’s Medical Research Institute and I want to commend the Judith Hyam Memorial Trust Fund for Cancer Research. (Time expired) Telstra: Service Standards Paralympians share instalments due, we witness more evidence of the decline in service that Australians have been complaining about since the government decided to float the telco. The decision by Pacific Access, a division of Telstra, to not include the Ipswich White Pages with the Ipswich Yellow Pages has outraged the community of Ipswich and regional centres around Australia. The separate White Pages and Yellow Pages for Ipswich have always been well used and patronised by locals and business. The decision to just simply bundle Ipswich City in with Brisbane is an insult to our region. Ipswich is distinct and separate from Brisbane and should not be treated with such disregard from corporations such as Telstra or the division of Pacific Access.",106,Representatives Main Committee

People have always made good use of the combined White Pages and Yellow Pages for Ipswich and used this resource as a good tool in finding local products. Having these books combined, specifically for Ipswich, has always made finding phone numbers for our city more convenient. We will now simply have to wade through two books of the White Pages, which are several inches thick-an inconvenience many will not welcome. Telstra and this government have betrayed and lost sight of regional Australia and are slowly eroding the identity of rural sections of the community. Our identity is being hijacked by organisations that have no sense of history or community and are only concerned about the cost-cutting and shareholder profits. The recent downturn in Telstra2 shares has left a poor taste in the mouths of ordinary mum and dad investors that have trusted the government and Telstra to deliver good on their promise of share value. Instead, they have seen the value of their investment go down. The further sale of Telstra, if the government had their way, would result in further decline of the service standards already criticised by the Besley report. Telstra should concentrate on its real markets in regional and rural Australia and on people who rely on the White Pages and Yellow Pages for their region, instead of playing speculator with companies like Pacific Century CyberWorks and Solution 6. The decision to treat Ipswich in this shoddy manner is something that the local community will not forget and does very little for the goodwill towards the flagging giant. If this is the road to privatisation, then it sounds a very loud warning to regional Australia about the effectiveness that this company would have in a fully privatised market. I do want to say congratulations, though, to Telstra for supporting our Paralympic athletes and supporting the games. Congratulations to all our athletes for beating the rest of the world. It is a most incredible result that we saw from our paralympians, and I would like to thank all of them. In particular, I would like to thank Greg Ball, who won a gold medal in the cycling sprint. He is a wonderful athlete, a champion athlete and a member of my community. I certainly congratulate him and his family for their pursuits in the sport and congratulate all other paralympian athletes. They really are champions who are at the top of their field. I think all Australians were served very proudly by their efforts. We will remember them as they have certainly made their mark in history. Telecommunications: Mobile Telephones Telstra and the ACA, led by Max Jennings and David Higginbottom from Telstra and Francis Wood from the ACA. The CDMA network was rolled out in 15 months-quite a remarkable effort. CDMA was inevitable, given the situation we were put in by the previous government, which turned off the analog mobile phone system on 31 December last year. In the subsequent year of extension, Telstra met its deadlines three months ahead of schedule. It is interesting that analog covered 93.8 per cent of people in their homes and seven per cent of the landmass of Australia; digital GSM, 95.4 per cent of people in their homes and 6.5 per cent of the landmass; but, interestingly, CDMA, 97 per cent of people in their homes and 12.5 per cent of the land mass. It now covers 960,000 kilometres, as against 540,000 square kilometres with the analog technology. Soon it will also roll out along a number of highways: Highway1 has largely been covered from Port Douglas through to Adelaide, and soon it will go out along the Sturt, Hume, Princes, Cunningham, Western and New England highways. It is hoped that then, if there is money still left after that from the $25 million fund to roll that out, some highways such as the Burnett highway, in my area, will also be covered.",107,Representatives Main Committee
168,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.49 A.m.),"Last night I attended a very interesting briefing byThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22075 Last night was interesting, but a lot of people still do not understand that analog gave fortuitous coverage in difficult areas because of the technology, whereas GSM and CDMA are edge of the cliff technology-when you get to the edge of the signal it stops. This can be overcome by a thing called a patch cord, which is a small aerial fixed to a metal surface to boost the receiving capacity of the handset. There needs to be a lot more education about that. Although this coverage is 12½ per cent, as against seven per cent with analog, it is no good if you are in an area getting the signal before and you are not getting the signal now. I call on Telstra and the ACA to make sure there is an education program in that. The other thing I would like to say is that I do not believe that we have reasonable equivalence in some areas. I call on the government to look at some program, perhaps a black spots program, so that we can fill some of those gaps. If we do that, this new technology will work very well for the whole of Australia. Isaacs Electorate: Car Insurance Policies Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (9.52 a.m.)-I want to talk about a practice in the motor vehicle insurance industry which is causing concern for a number of my constituents and which appears to be most unfair. The practice is one where the insurance company has a legal right to retain all of an insurance premium where a car is written off after an accident, regardless of how long the policy would otherwise have run. A family in my electorate brought this practice to my attention. The person concerned, a woman who happens to be an invalid pensioner, was left out of pocket to the tune of around $1,000 following a car accident in which she was involved. This is despite the fact that the accident was not her fault and despite the fact that she held comprehensive insurance. The bulk of this $1,000 was the cost of a new insurance policy. Early this year my constituent renewed her comprehensive insurance policy on her car, paying a premium of almost $750. One month later she was involved in an accident and the insurance company deemed her car a write-off. As I said before, this accident was not her fault-the other driver admitted fault. In due course the other driver’s insurance company paid up and my constituent purchased another car, again with a loan. At this stage my constituent set about taking out insurance on this replacement car. She contacted her insurance company, expecting that, as she had renewed her policy only one month before the accident, she would be entitled to a refund of the unused portion of her premium. She wanted to use this refund, or credit, to put towards the cost of insuring her replacement car. The insurance company said no, this would not be done. The policy she had taken out stipulated that no refund of any part of her premium would be made in the event of a car being written off. My constituent was forced to find another $750 to insure her replacement car. She has now had to pay $750 twice in a few months. Approaches to the insurance company and the Insurance Council of Australia have not shed any light on why this practice is in place. This incident was highlighted on radio recently and the Insurance Council of Australia was asked to explain why the practice is in place. The council advised that the policy is commonplace, but would not or could not offer any explanation. There is no question about whether or not this practice is legal. The question is: is this practice fair? It seems to me that this practice is most unfair. It is unfair that a policyholder should be asked to fork out two lots of insurance premiums within a short space of time. In this particular case, it hurts a person who is not well off and who is doing her best to support herself and get off the pension. Since this matter was raised publicly, I have been told of a number of similar incidents. It is obvious that this is not an isolated case and that there are some variations on the theme. It is obvious that these policyholders are forced into playing a game with their insurance company. The game is: heads, you win; tails, I lose. 22076 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 I have written to the Insurance Council of Australia, asking them to explain the practice. I have also asked the particular insurance company concerned to make an exception in this woman’s case and to play fair: to reimburse her for the unused balance of her premium. I have written to the Treasurer for his advice about the fairness of this practice, and I am looking forward with interest to the response from all of these people. Hume Electorate: Woodlawn Mine and, more specifically, the former Woodlawn mine workers who are waiting patiently for the entitlements that they should be getting. One hundred and sixty Woodlawn mineworkers were retrenched in March 1998. Under a unique scheme of arrangement with the administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the $6.5 million of unpaid entitlements can be paid to those 160 workers. The arrangement sees the workers’ payments coming ahead of other creditors’ entitlements. This is the first time this type of arrangement has been contemplated. The deal is subject to the New South Wales government approving the proposed Woodlawn waste management facility. The approval process has been long and politically manipulated to avoid criticism by Sydney Greens-notably, the Total Environment Centre-who are opposed to the approval of the Woodlawn waste management facility on ideological grounds. So far, a detailed environmental impact statement was prepared and displayed in February 1999, and a commission of inquiry was held in September 1999. This reported to Minister Refshauge in January 2000, concluding that the project could be approved. It is a modern, environmentally friendly waste facility which will use bioreactor technology to generate green power for northern Sydney putrescible waste. The minister then said that he would wait for the findings of the Wright inquiry into alternative waste management technologies and practices before deciding on Woodlawn. The Wright inquiry report was released in early June 2000 and was favourable to a Woodlawn approval. The minister is still sitting on that report. The minister then called for a further inquiry into Sydney landfill capacity and needs, again to be conducted by Mr Tony Wright. The minister received a final report from Mr Wright but is yet to release it publicly. In the absence of a definitive decision on the project from Minister Refshauge, the payout arrangement is in jeopardy. There are no merit issues preventing the approval of the project. Time is running out for the Woodlawn mineworkers. It is ironic that, with the New South Wales government failing to support the Reith entitlements scheme, they are still blocking an entirely private sector initiative to pay out the Woodlawn mineworkers. That, of course, has been the subject of a public statement by the New South Wales branch state secretary of the TWU, Mr Tony Sheldon, who said in the Goulburn Post not long ago: There has now been a series of inquiries and reports into the redevelopment of the Woodlawn mine site and all of them have indicated the proposals endorsing our plan to see all of the Woodlawn mine workers repaid. He went on to say: Now that Minister Refshauge has received this independent report from Tony Wright, there is absolutely nothing to prevent him from authorising the Woodlawn redevelopment proposal which will immediately release the worker’s outstanding legal entitlements ... To date we had the scrutiny of a detailed Environmental Impact Statement prepared and displayed ... the time for members’ statements has concluded.",108,Representatives Main Committee

170,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,Thursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22077 Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 19 June, on motion by Fran Bailey: That the House take note of the report. Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services on what is an unemotional and very informative report on where we should go with the introduction of GMOs into Australia. GMOs are a product which, of course, has created a great deal of debate, perhaps even fear-GMOs have been labelled Frankenstein foods. All sorts of emotive and emotional statements have been made, most of which are misleading, and to have the committee take the opportunity to prepare a report which sifted the wheat from the straw, so to speak, and put in place a report that is a great reference document on this issue is certainly beneficial. I congratulate the chair of the committee, the member for McEwen, and the deputy chair, the member for Lyons, on their work and guidance on this report. I also congratulate the secretariat of the committee. I pause there, however, to say how disgusted and disappointed I was with the independent report from the member for Calare. The member for Calare has made a statement that has denigrated one of the members of the committee by making the assertion that that committee member put his commercial interests before those of the committee and parliament. It is a statement that I challenge the member for Calare to make outside this House. If he is so sure that that is the case, that would be the honourable thing to do. To suggest that this was a lay committee of the Commonwealth parliament supplemented by one member with specialist GMO understanding but, ‘worryingly, with strong GMO commercial interests’ is a slur on the committee, on this report and, worse of all, on the member for Moore. It is a slur that I will take time to put straight right now. At no stage did the member for Calare raise that issue in the committee, at no stage did the member for Calare ask the member for Moore whether or not his commercial interests presented a conflict of interest and at no stage was this issue raised until we read it in the report. Those comments are typical of the populist rhetoric that not only come on regular occasions from the member for Calare but run right through his dissenting report. If the member for Calare wants to politicise an issue to the detriment of this parliament and Australia, he should at least have the courage to go outside this House to make that statement and face the full consequences of what he says. At no stage did I or any member-and I am sure the member for Braddon will back me in this-see any indication that the member for Moore was doing anything except his duty to the parliament. In fact, I saw that on the occasions when the member for Moore had any commercial interests in GMOs, decisions were taken to the detriment of those interests and were supported by the member for Moore. The member for Moore brought to that committee an intellectual capacity second to none. His understanding of GMOs and his ability to judge the sort of information we were being provided was of great benefit to the committee. He had expertise that we did not have. I must also commend the member for Bruce, who came to the committee with specialist expertise. Such people give up their time to assist committees like ours to produce reports which have credibility. And this report has credibility. The report makes a fundamental recommendation: that we continue with the introduction of GMOs and GMO technology to Australia, but with stringent regulation, constant and cautious monitoring and public reporting. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government increase funding for research into the potential benefits and",110,Representatives Main Committee
171,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (9.58 A.m.),"Firstly, I congratulate the House of22078 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 risks, including the environmental, health, social, economic and ethical risks presented by genetically modified organisms, and that it ensures that funding for research into improving agricultural productivity and sustainability is allocated equitably across all areas of research. GMOs offer all production industries great benefits, but agriculture probably has the most to gain. Of course, the medical profession has already taken full advantage of GMOs, and I will come back to that. With the introduction of GMOs to agriculture there is also a great opportunity to do something about some of the environmental issues which our government, supported by the opposition, are trying to deal with at the moment-salinity, for one. The opportunity to use genetic modification to produce plants that are able to reduce salinity is just one example. Genetic modification first occurred, to the best of our knowledge, in the grain industry about three and a half thousand years ago. Man, from the time he sought better varieties, has manipulated the genes of plants, has cross bred plants, has cross bred animals-to produce the mule, for example. There is nothing new about genetic manipulation. What is new with this more scientific approach-through singling out genes and taking them from one variety to another-is the accuracy of the result, which is now so good that it is predictable. Before you would run trial plots of thousands and thousands of crosses, and at times you would throw all of them away but most of the time you would throw all but two or three away. Those times are almost behind us. As to the advances that we have had to plough through in producing better varieties of grain, better performing livestock and better performing fruit and vegetables, those tedious, expensive and slow processes can be put behind us with gene technology. The result is a product which is more consumer friendly, cheaper to produce and safer on the environment. In the end it will advance mankind’s ability to feed itself as it faces the challenges of an exploding population. I note that the current census in China is predicting that its population is now 1.3 billion. These people will have to be fed. If we continue to place greater and greater pressure using traditional means of agriculture and traditional varieties on our soils and our environment, we will get ourselves into an unsustainable process which cannot support life as we know it. GMOs offer us the opportunity to break out of that cycle and to produce varieties which will ensure that these burgeoning populations are fed. I have a great deal of difficulty in handling some of the hysteria that surrounds GMOs for the simple reason that, as I said, GMOs, in terms of being taken or ingested by people, are not new; in fact, medical science has been using GMO technology for decades. Insulin and inoculations like hep B vaccines have all been genetically modified. I am at a complete loss to understand why representatives of organisations like Greenpeace-most of whom, I would hope, have had some sorts of vaccinations-are happy to use GMOs in a medical sense-they are directly injected into your body-yet are making this extraordinarily huge fuss about foods that are produced as a result of GMOs. That is just populism. Greenpeace are trying to create an issue which gives them a profile, not an issue which shows leadership and has the best interests of mankind at heart. We saw this sort of hysteria at the turn of the century when cars were first introduced. If you drove a car, you had to have someone walking in front of you, waving a red flag and ringing a bell. We know that cars are dangerous, that they kill people, yet we have dispensed with all of that hoo-ha. We know that GMOs are safe. There is not one skerrick of scientific evidence that indicates that they are in any way a danger to health, yet we are allowing the progress of this technology to be tied down by emotional claptrap. We need to have a rational approach to ensure that the consumers’ interests are taken into account and that the buyer of Thursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22079 the product sees the benefit to him or her. In the same way that the buyer has seen the benefit of the automobile, they will see the benefit of the GMO. That will take time and I accept that, in this debate, as the report says, we need to take the time, we need to take the expense, to explain to consumers the benefits of GMOs. We need to explain to them that, unlike other new substances which science is continually inventing, when you change the product genetically you actually have something to compare it with. If you produce a new substance, you have nothing to compare it with. But if you produce a genetically modified orange or tomato, you can compare it analytically and chemically with a non-GMO tomato. If the answer is that they are both the same, they possess the same properties and neither contains toxins, then I have some difficulty understanding what the argument is. That ability to compare apples with apples is something that I think has been overlooked in the GMO argument. In the few minutes that I have left I would also like to talk briefly about two other important areas. The committee’s recommendations on the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator are ones I have a great deal of support for. The office is going to be at arm’s length from government but will report regularly to government. It is important that it is free of political interference, that it is free to do the job it has to do, which is to monitor and regulate GMOs and ensure that the rules and regulations relating to GMOs are abided by. It does not need any political interference in that, but it does need to report back to us. The issue of labelling, however, is a more contentious issue with me: I see little sense, in today’s litigious society, in insisting that all products containing GMOs be labelled. IfI were a shopkeeper, and I knew that I would be held liable if I were to sell a product that contained GMOs that the manufacturer had not labelled, my way of avoiding that would be to label all my products in my shop with, ‘May contain GMOs’. That way I would be protected from any court case. It would have made far more sense to me for those companies which want to market GMO-free food to be the ones that label their product. By doing that, they could make a statement which not only was a selling point but also they were obviously prepared to defend in a court of law. And there will be court cases over products that, for some reason or other, are alleged to contain GMOs. To tie the food industry down with overly onerous labelling legislation to no avail and with no information to the consumer-because, as I say, what we will see is a proliferation of labels which say, ‘This product may contain GMOs’seems completely unproductive and non-beneficial. If we are committed-and I am committed-to giving the consumer information that a product possibly contains GMOs, a far simpler way would be to mark the product as not containing GMOs. That would then give the consumer a great opportunity to decide whether he or she wanted to try that product-take it for a test drive-to see if it came up to their expectations and buy it again or not buy it again. That is the solution in this debate on GMOs. It is a case of monitoring them tightly and getting the information out there where the consumers can judge for themselves because, in the end, if the consumer does not want them we will not produce them. (Time expired) report Work in progress: proceed with caution-primary producer access to gene technology. I was happy to be a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services that produced the report; in fact, it is the second report of a rather hard-working committee, other members of which are now present. It was very interesting for me from the point of view of being very much a layperson in terms of primary industries. I must say right from the outset that I concur with the previous speaker, the member for Groom. I was surprised by the comments recorded in the dissenting report which implied",111,Representatives Main Committee
172,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.14 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the22080 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 some type of conflict of interest on the part of the member for Moore, whom I personally get on very well with. Two things came through in having his expertise on that committee: his tremendous professionalism and his ability to offer information which, I believe, was totally balanced. I was very surprised to read those comments and I cannot understand why that implication is there in the first place. I, too, take exception to that. I also take exception to the fact that, as a member of the committee, I never saw anything in this dissenting report come out before I read it. I was privy to a lot of the discussions that took place, both prior to and during the composition of this report, and I certainly do not remember the member for Calare offering his views in terms of dissenting on or debating a number of these issues in any substance at all. SoI was very surprised to see it-and I am sure other members of the committee will have their own comments on this-and I would have thought that, in terms of open and frank dialogue on the terms of reference of this committee, we would have had that. But to imply any type of conflict of interest on the part of the member for Moore is, I think, totally unfair and unjustified and I am sure that it is truly a slip of the pen rather than anything else. On the work itself, the title-because I think there is something in the title of any reportWork in progress: proceed with caution was very much the summation of what the committee was about. It does say in recommendation No. 1-if I may enlighten you with that so you know exactly what I am saying here-that the committee recommends the continued use of gene technology. I appreciate that, for some people, that is very much like a tick. In my home state, when they got hold of this report, they were jumping up and down and saying how disappointed they were that we had given a tick for gene technology, as if we just let it pass without any consideration for caution. But I think the title of the report says it all. Recommendation No. 1 then goes on to say ‘but only with stringent regulation, constant and cautious monitoring and public reporting’. If we debated anything at great length, it was the whole question of caution. I have never been part of a committee, both prior to and during this parliament, that spent so much time considering the importance of making sure that, if we have particular systems in place, they are highly regulated and that we do this for the purposes of public health and the environment, rather than from just the industry point of view. The fact that we agreed that the authority for this be held in the portfolio of health rather than in the industry itself is very important. We were at great pains to ensure that the regulation was right. In actual fact, looking at the Gene Technology Bill 2000 and the members who spoke to it, again, the major area of disappointment for most of the people on the committee was that it was not as stringent as we recommended in this report. I commend the committee for its caution and I also commend the report to anybody who is looking at this issue. The first few chapters of it are an excellent summation of the so-called pros and cons in this debate, because it is certainly not an easy subject. In my home state of Tasmania, this question is not the emotional claptrap that the previous speaker referred to. In Tasmania, it is taken very seriously and it is not just full of emotion; so much so that the Tasmanian government has placed a moratorium on the release of GMOs in the Tasmanian community and the testing thereof. That moratorium is in place until Tasmania has had its own parliamentary investigation into this issue and has also created a panel of experts to look at this question and report in the middle of next year. It is interesting that the terms of reference for the Tasmanian parliamentary inquiry, whilst duplicating some of the terms of reference for our own inquiry, are more wide ranging, and I would like to share some of those with you. First and foremost, the terms of reference involve the economic costs and benefits for Tasmania and individual industry sectors in relation to genetic modification in primary industries. That, of course, would be regarded as very much a Thursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22081 precautionary approach to this issue. As well, they involve market opportunities and associated strategies for Tasmania as a producer of genetically modified and non-genetically modified products. I must say that this report, Work in progress: proceed with caution, is keen to ensure that, in any educative and research programs, the Commonwealth supports equally the promotion of, or the investigation and research into, GMOs and the risk and benefit analysis, as it does with non-GMOs. I think that was lost in some of the very quick reactions to this report. Another term of reference relates to the environmental risks and effects of the use of genetically modified organisms in Tasmanian primary industries. One of the points is that, although you may have a national regulatory body and conditions set out in terms of risk assessment, each environment is different. You would have to conclude that the Tasmanian environment is very different from the Australian mainland, and it is very important that that risk analysis takes place in the context of the Tasmanian environment. The next term of reference involves social and ethical issues surrounding the use of gene technologies. There is no doubt that that is very important. Indeed, a lot of emotion is involved as well, and I would agree with the former speaker that it is very important that we try to have a rational, balanced debate on these issues. Another term of reference refers to assessment processes for genetically modified food, the application of genetically modified techniques on non-food crops, and the risks and benefits of the use or avoidance of genetic modification in non-food primary industries in Tasmania. Again, a specific targeting of the regulations and the risk analysis which has blanket coverage nationally. The next term of reference relates to an assessment of proper strategies for primary industries research and development in Tasmania. That is at the heart of the parliamentary investigation into GMOs, and the appointment of a complementary experts group to give input to both that parliamentary inquiry and to the government so that it may come to some conclusion in terms of its policy. We did not actually investigate the prospects of opting in and out of the regulatory regime, although it was raised. It was felt that the legislation itself might take care of that. The Tasmanian government, in its submission to the Senate inquiry which reported yesterdayand unfortunately I have not had much time to review that, but other speakers here may well be able to comment on it-dealt at length with the possibility of opting out. I know that the Tasmanian government is now in discussions with the Commonwealth, trying to look at the discrete situation that exists in Tasmania and its desire to ensure that it can market itself as it sees fit in terms of the provision of agricultural product, et cetera. One of the major recommendations in this report is that an important, open, clear educative process takes place in terms of public education. There was concern that Biotechnology Australia would become a statutory authority. The purpose behind that was to try to keep it at arms length from the industry, where it was seen, as part of its charter, to be promoting biotechnology and, some would argue, in particular GMOs. I know Biotechnology Australia is moving around the country providing forums on genetically modified organisms. Unfortunately, they did not make it down to Tasmania when we thought they might-there was some suggestion that perhaps the climate was not right for that-but I am assured that they will be there early in the new year and that it was a question of clashing with the Olympics and other events in Tasmania. The important thing is that people are educated in it. It is all right to say, ‘This is the new technology, this is the new world, this is the new wave, and we will go ahead because for heaven’s sake the average punter is pretty ignorant.’ If the average punter is ignorant, there is a reason for it. Why are they ignorant? We have this technology moving at a much faster rate than people are willing to accept straight off. There is a suggestion of scepticism towards 22082 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 science, particularly big company science, and the provision of goods and services that they tell us are best for us. So we need to heed that call very seriously. This report clearly indicates that the educative process must be independent, it needs to be comprehensive, and we need to ensure that it is very much Australia-wide. For that purpose, my Senate colleagues, Senator Denman and Senator Sherry, and I, issued a ‘Food for thought’ survey in my electorate of Braddon in the north-west of Tasmania. I commend such a survey to anyone in their electorate. We truly tried to make it as objective as we could. We set out what the Gene Technology Bill 2000 set out to do and we asked people a certain number of questions. I would like to share some of those results with you because I think it is relatively enlightening, and certainly in line with the purpose of trying to find out how people feel in order to target those things. We asked, ‘Do you think genetically modified crops should be grown in Tasmania?’ We had a response of 3,000 to this, and in my electorate that is a sizeable sample. I accept that maybe those people were very interested and that is why they returned their answers. However, in their answers to that question 13.3 per cent said yes and 75.9 per cent said no. We asked, ‘Do you support the Tasmanian government’s one year ban on growing genetically modified crops in the open?’ to which 79.7 per cent said yes and 16.5 per cent said no. We asked, ‘Do you think there should be a total ban on growing genetically modified crops in Tasmania?’ to which 71.9 per cent said yes and 18.4 per cent said no. We asked, ‘Do you support labelling of genetically modified food products?’ to which 95.5 per cent said yes. We asked, ‘Would you buy genetically modified food if it was cheaper?’ to which 11.3 per cent said yes and 75.1 per cent said no. We also asked, ‘Do you think you have enough information on genetically modified organisms?’ I ask the chamber to take note of this because 12 per cent said yes and 83.7 per cent said no. Finally, we asked, ‘Do you think there has been enough public debate about growing genetically modified crops in Tasmania?’ to which 9.7 per cent said yes and a whopping 82.4 per cent said no. I know that is a state specific issue. I’ll bet you 1,000 quid that could be replicated throughout Australia. The question is not so much whether we should have GMOs and do people support that, the question is whether people are educated enough, do they know enough, to be able to say confidently, ‘I have had my fourpence worth, I think I understand it and I am prepared to support that.’ This report clearly indicated that we were concerned that people did not feel part of the process, did not feel ownership of it, and I think it is very important that as a community we do that. It is not the same as taking insulin and having that administered for health purposes. When we talk about food we are talking about something very important. (Time expired) of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services inquiry into primary producer access to gene technology, even though there were quite a number of hours spent listening to submissions and to the different viewpoints on this matter. It certainly was a very positive committee that worked very well together. Too often the public accuse politicians of knee-jerk reactions and of not having the vision to look ahead at the problems that face Australia. This committee can certainly be congratulated for being ahead of public opinion in coming up with suggestions for inquiries. The first inquiry was into infrastructure in rural areas, and that was started well before it became a huge public issue. And we started the inquiry on gene technology 18 months ago, which was well before a lot of the public disquiet was happening, so we were ahead of the times. The fact that we have come up with 37 very reasonable recommendations and that the report is titled Work in progress: proceed with caution gives a very strong view of what the committee thought. It believed that it should go ahead, but that",113,Representatives Main Committee
173,Mr Secker (Barker) (10.29 A.m.),"It has been a pleasure being a member of the HouseThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22083 we need to be cautious, which is very understandable because there is still some disquiet out there. That was mentioned quite interestingly by the member for Braddon with his survey. A lot of this relates to the fact that not enough people know enough about the issue or understand it, and so, as with anything else that is new to them, they are still a bit scared of it. That is an understandable reaction. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, for the opportunity to speak on this matter because it is of great importance. My prediction is that, in one way or another, it will affect every person living in the world, now and in the future. It is about a very important part of our history, concerning genetically modified organisms, otherwise known as GMOs. During the Industrial Revolution, it was often said that ‘it wouldn’t last’ and that we would never find jobs for those who lost their jobs to machines. That not only proved to be wrong but failed to see that economies would grow as a result of machines and would provide more jobs in other areas. When the motor car arrived on the scene, many said that only the rich would be able to afford this new toy. Of course, Henry Ford proved them all wrong with his new way of manufacturing on the production line, which has since been refined even more. Plane travel was seen as unnatural and something that, again, would only be used by the rich. Again, they were proved wrong, with air travel almost a commonplace occurrence for nearly all people in Australia and many people all around the world. It is interesting to note the comments from the past and, with the wisdom of hindsight-which we would all like to have-note how people can be wrong. Some decades ago the head of the famous computer company IBM said that he thought there would be fewer than 100 computers worldwide and that we would never see computers in the home. How wrong he was, and he was meant to be an expert. We have had the Industrial Revolution, the motor car, the aeroplane and the computer age, but many people are failing to recognise the next revolution of biotechnology, which encompasses genetically modified organisms, known as GMOs. There is a lot of misinformation surrounding this issue, with a lot of hype in the media-with such misleading terms as Frankenstein foods and so on. It has disturbed me to see such shallow reporting on this issue, but not surprised me. I am sure the Deputy Speaker would also not be surprised by the reporting. The use of gene technology has, I believe, a huge potential to benefit the primary producers and the consumers in the electorate of Barker and elsewhere in Australia, and I will refer to that later. I think the production of agricultural products will certainly benefit from the fact that we can use fewer chemicals and can do it more economically and efficiently. It will certainly help us, globally, in the problems of feeding the world and developing those countries which presently cannot feed their own. Firstly, I want to rebut the scaremongering from some of those groups who continue to keep their heads in the sand and refuse to look at this subject logically. As a committee, it was not so much that we were forced to but it was part of our duty to look at this with an open mind and, hopefully, with some logic, and rationally. But there are people who continue to oppose this genetic technique that is not only more precise than traditional methods of plant and animal production, but, because of that preciseness, safer because of the greater predictability. For example, if we were trying to introduce a frost resistant gene to a wheat variety by traditional methods-and that would be very important for my electorate, which has suffered quite badly from frosts in the last couple of weeks-we would be trying to cross about 30,000 different genes. This would lead to greater unpredictability and slower progress. By the use of gene manipulation, biotechnology, genetic modification-whatever you want to call it-we 22084 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 can insert that one frost resistant gene instead of trying to cross 30,000 genes, and thus get more preciseness and predictability. There are also the scaremongers who will say that the process of inserting a fish gene into a wheat species is somehow unnatural and we should not think about doing anything like that. This mantra fails to recognise that all living matter is made up of DNA building blocks, whether it be fish, wheat or humans. It is readily acknowledged that humans and apes have 98 per cent of the same genes and those DNA building blocks. Even though we look quite different, we are 98 per cent alike. The people who oppose this new technology because of the suggestion that it is unnatural do not take into account the fact that diabetics have been using insulin that has been genetically engineered for at least 16 years in Australia. The long-term effects of that have proven to be quite safe. We certainly do not hear diabetics complaining about genetically engineered insulin. There is no doubt there is good reason for that. I refer to the dissenting report by the member for Calare. Like the previous speaker, the member for Braddon, I found it quite strange that in the 18 months of this inquiry not once did we hear him debate these issues. Not once did we hear the sorts of things that are in his report. By his own admission, he suggested that we should be looking more at the spiritual rather than the scientific reasoning behind this. That might be fine for someone like Senator Harradine but I thought it was a new direction for the member for Calare to be suggesting we should be looking at the spiritual side of things. I found it quite bizarre. I have also had a quick look at the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on the Gene Technology Bill 2000 tabled in the Senate yesterday, which I found to be not only bizarre but also loopy and totally misinformed. are obvious benefits from the application of biotechnology-he sees benefits in the health sector-the jury is well and truly out in the agricultural and food sectors. I frankly fail to see the difference between organisms that are injected or ingested for health reasons and those we eat. The same thing happens: it is absorbed into our system, whether it is through injections, tablets or whatever. I fail to see that that rationale can be used. He says that the committee is of the opinion that applying gene technology to agriculture can benefit farmers, consumers and the Australian environment and economy. He goes on to say that he could not agree with the evidence. I and the rest of the committee certainly found that the evidence was absolutely overwhelmingly in favour of that conclusion. While he may disagree with it, I find it very hard to see how he has come to that conclusion. He suggested that arguments that it would be unethical not to develop GMOs if they will contribute to alleviating world hunger or to resisting natural catastrophes are really a form of moral blackmail. I find it very strange reasoning to say that, if we argue that it is good that we are doing this because we are trying to help to feed the world, it is moral blackmail. I find that again a most bizarre conclusion for him to come to. Then he supports the Organic Federation of Australia Inc. where it suggested in its evidence to the committee that drought resistant and salt tolerant plants may lead to weeds moving into areas where they have not previously been able to become established. The problem and weakness in that argument is that apparently it is okay to have drought resistant or salt tolerant plants by traditional breeding methods, but not genetically engineered. So they are saying that they are attacking the process with an outcome that is achievable by both types of breeding. There is no logic whatsoever in that argument. I will refer to some of the other recommendations and points that were made in the committee report. Paragraph 2.20 states that no less an authority than the CSIRO-I think there is no better-respected scientific group in the Australian environment-has said:",116,Representatives Main Committee
174,Mr Sidebottom,Except for the opt-out.,118,Representatives Main Committee
175,Mr Secker,"Except for the opt-out. The member for Calare also said that, while thereThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22085 There are already domestic and international indications of environmental benefits from less pesticide use (as in the case of Bt cotton) and replacement of rather potent herbicides with more benign herbicides for herbicide tolerant crops … To counter that, the loonies in this world say that genetic engineering will cause us to drench our crops with chemicals. They go completely against the evidence. They try to tell us that we are going to drench chemicals all over our crops as a result of using GEs, whereas the evidence showed completely the opposite. As a member of Australian society, I get a bit concerned when people accept such ridiculous statements. This report recommended the continued use of gene technology, but only with stringent regulation, constant and cautious monitoring and public reporting. As the member for Braddon said, some people might say that that is giving you a tick, but in actual fact it is saying, ‘We are proceeding with caution. We have just got to make sure that we have the proper regulations in place to ensure that the consumers and the population of Australia are not only brought along with it but also feel safer in the fact that there is a regulatory body out there trying to ensure that we get it right.’ The report recommended also that we increase funding for research into the potential benefits and risk presented by GMOs. Again this committee supported that very strongly, and it is very important that we did. The report said later, in 3.15: Medical applications are regarded as the most acceptable use of gene technology because individuals can see a direct benefit to themselves. I think that will be the crux of the question in the future. In the end, consumers will have to want to purchase those products and feel safe about doing that. Until they do that, it is not going to happen. That is why we have to have strict regulations. It is important that we also recommended very strong public education campaigns funded by the Commonwealth government to recognise and address environmental, cultural, ethical and social concerns about GMOs. Recommendation No. 9 states that we should give equal prominence to information about the risks and benefits of GMOs. That shows that we are not just gung-ho on one side or the other. We are saying that to bring everyone through we have to be up front, we have to be out there promoting or knocking, showing both sides of the argument so that people can make up their own minds.

However, I do have some concerns about the report, and they have been outlined in the dissenting report by the member for Calare, Mr Andren. I will discuss these issues later in my contribution to this debate. From the outset, I support the comments made by the member for Barker, the member for Braddon and others when they condemned the member for Calare, not for making an observation in his dissenting report that casts a slur on a committee member, but for never raising his concern when the committee’s terms of reference were outlined or during the inquiry. The member for Calare, for whom I have some regard, ought to give an account of why he chose, when the time came to table the report, to raise such an issue. From all the information that has been provided to me in respect of the committee member to whom he referred, his concerns, observations and opinions are completely unfounded. I hope that, when the member for Calare makes his contribution to the debate on this report, he redresses the matter, because I do not believe that it is in the public interest to leave the matter as it stands in his dissenting report. But as I said, there are elements of his dissenting report with which I agree. I spoke in the House on 10 August 1999 about my concerns regarding genetically modified food and where we are going with it in this country. It is against that background that I am making this further contribution to the debate today. What is gene technology? Gene technology includes a range of methods that control, modify or delete characteristics of a plant or animal or transfer desirable traits from one species to another. According to the Work in progress: proceed with caution report, particular benefits of utilising gene technology include the possibility to breed crop and animal varieties which (1) are better suited to specific environments-for instance, may be able to make a crop resistant to drought; (2) are more disease and pest resistant as well as being able to withstand herbicides; (3) will be able to keep for a longer period of time; and (4) will be more productive with lower chemical, labour and energy input costs. I will argue later that these benefits may be spurious. It has been argued that there could be some environmental benefits from fewer pesticides and herbicides-reducing the health risk to farming communities from being overexposed to such chemicals. However, there are a number of risks and negative impacts of gene technology that may affect the environment, give rise to health issues, have an enormous effect on social and economic conditions and give rise to ethical considerations. I would like to discuss some of these implications. With respect to environmental risks, firstly, gene technology may cause ecosystem disruption and species extinction through cross-pollination of GM crops with non-GM crops. Secondly, gene technology may cause further chemical pollution of the environment. Thirdly, weed species may develop resistance to herbicides being used on GM crops and become ‘superweeds’ only able to be controlled by potentially harmful herbicides. There is already some evidence of this occurring in other countries. Fourthly, pests may develop resistance to particular genes and may therefore not be controlled as they are at present. Fifthly, the evolutionary fate of inserted genes into organisms is unknown, meaning scientists are not able to foreshadow or predict the full impact of genetic engineering on our environment. The health impacts of consuming GM foods include: firstly, allergies to foods could increase, and this has happened in the United Kingdom since the introduction of GM soy beans; and, secondly, GM foods should be tested to see if they are safe to consume and to work out any lasting health consequences, and this may not be occurring at present to the extent necessary.",119,Representatives Main Committee
183,Mr Murphy,"No, I do not want to get too carried away, but he is a great representativeThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22087 The social and economic impacts on primary producers and rural communities include the fact that the high yields promised by using GM crops may not occur. They are likely to impact on farm incomes in rural communities, as it is feared that the use of GM organisms may exacerbate current trends which have seen a fall in the price of agricultural products. They may also affect farmers who wish to have non-GM crops or organically grown crops in the case of cross-pollination. They may also suffer serious problems if pest resistance increases. Finally, there are the ethical considerations. The first is that there are grave concerns about transferring genes between species that do not normally interbreed, particularly when human genes are involved. The second ethical concern is whether the development of genetically engineered crops and animals offends the religious and moral sensibilities of Australians. This is a debate which really has not occurred in the community. I would like to congratulate the committee again, particularly in relation to recommendation 2 that the Commonwealth government increase funding for research into the potential benefits and risks presented by GM organisms. This government must not decide to allow the use of such genetically engineered products unless it is scientifically proven that it is safe for consumers to use these products. To allow otherwise is contrary to the public interest. I endorse recommendation 11 as I believe that, while there is a need for greater involvement from the private sector in gene technology research, the Commonwealth government must continue to fund gene technology research in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. I also support recommendation 4 that all public education campaigns funded by the Commonwealth government recognise and address the environmental, economic, cultural, ethical and social concerns of the consumer. Such a campaign would need to be impartial and weigh the benefits and risks equally. I would like to also give the member for Braddon another plug. I thought that the survey of his electorate which he mentioned was a pretty good initiative. I happen to hold the beliefand my wife Adriana does too-that the best food actually comes out of Tasmania in terms of quality and purity. Fran Bailey-Some of it comes from Victoria. McEwen and the member for Barker. Some of the best food and wine comes out of Coonawarra in his electorate. You are quite right, but I have a soft spot in my heart for Tasmania and the people of Tasmania. I do not think the quality of the food that I have enjoyed there is surpassed anywhere else. I do take the point that a lot of good stuff comes out of Victoria and also South Australia. This is a great survey. It is interesting. I am sure it reflects the concerns of most people because I have had concerns coming into my office about the need for genetically modified food. I know things get a bit hysterical when people talk about three-winged or three-legged chooks. It is little wonder that this concerns people. The member for Braddon sent out a survey. He asked his electorate: Do you think genetically modified crops should be grown in Tasmania? In reply, 13 per cent said yes, 75 per cent said no and 10 per cent did not know. I am just rounding these figures. If you are going to do the arithmetic it might not quite add up to 100. He also asked: Do you support the Tasmanian Government’s one year ban on growing genetically modified crops in the open? In reply, 79 per cent said yes, 16 per cent said no and nearly four per cent did not know. He asked: Do you think there should be a total ban on growing genetically modified crops in Tasmania?",120,Representatives Main Committee
184,Mr Murphy,"Yes, and I am sure it also comes from the electorates of the member for22088 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 In reply, 71.9 per cent said yes, 18.4 per cent said no and 9.7 per cent did not know. He asked: Do you support labelling of genetically modified food products? This was the subject of the contribution I made on the adjournment debate in the House on 10 August 1999. In reply to that question, 95.5 per cent said yes. Irrespective of where we end up in this country with genetically modified food, obviously labelling is critical for the people that we represent because in that survey only 2.8 per cent said no-and you would have to wonder about them-and 1.7 per cent do not know. The member for Braddon then asked: Would you buy genetically modified food if it was cheaper? In reply, 11.3 per cent said yes. That is interesting, isn’t it, when we know that most people are driven by the hip-pocket nerve? per cent did not know. He also asked this question: Do you think you have enough information on genetically modified organisms? Only 12.9 per cent said yes, 83.7 per cent said no and 3.4 per cent did not know. He asked: Do you think there has been enough public debate about growing genetically modified crops in Tasmania? In reply, 9.7 per cent said yes, 82.4 per cent said no and 7.9 per cent did not know. I think the member for Braddon, who is sitting here, said he sent out 3,000 of these surveys. about five per cent of your electorate approximately? a lot of people, including those in my electorate. There has been a rapid uptake of GM crops such as canola, cotton and corn over the last few years-particularly in the USA, Argentina and Canada. In Australia, people who support genetic engineering of organisms have brought the debate into the public eye. However, thus far it has been somewhat partisan and the Australian community as a whole has not had the opportunity to really form views, particularly in regard to moral and ethical standards on this issue. It is extremely important to ensure that all public education takes place so that consumers are aware of all the benefits and risks of ingesting such products. I will now say something about the honourable member for Calare and particularly about the spurious benefits to farmers, consumers, the Australian environment and the economy of using GM organisms. The member for Calare wrote this in his dissenting report: Introducing genetic technology in Australia if done at all, should only be done with the ‘utmost caution’. I will support him there. Further, I agree with the member for Calare that the ethical considerations must be further explored. The example that it would be ‘unethical not to develop GM organisms if they will contribute to alleviating world hunger or to help resist natural catastrophes’ is a fallacy. This is because economic, social and other considerations come into play. A classic example was given by the General Manager of the Environment Protection Authority in Ethiopia. He said: There are still hungry people in Ethiopia, but they are hungry because they have no money, no longer because there is no food to buy.",121,Representatives Main Committee

190,Mr Murphy,"That is quite an indication, and I would think that reflects the concerns ofThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22089 So the member for Calare, I think, has got it right there. Finally, the member for Calare-in relation to the trend against consuming GM products in Europe, Japan and other places-has suggested that traditionally and organically grown crops are still enjoying a growing demand. In fact, in January 1999, the largest shipment of canola ever was exported from Australia because we were the only country that could guarantee non-GM canola. That is great. Surely it is in Australia’s economic and health interests to ensure our produce remains traditional or organically grown to give consumers a choice. As the member for Calare said in his conclusion, the moral and ethical aspects of this genetic engineering have not been properly debated within the wider community. He said: Australia risks surrendering its unique ‘clean’ agricultural status in a too hasty marriage to an unproven technology. Australia should be ultra-cautious in facilitating any genetic pollution of its agriculture and not give ground as it has in quarantine protection. I finish where I begin by congratulating the member for McEwen and all the members of the committee who did a great job in providing more information. Quite obviously, recommendations 2, 4 and 11 are very dear to my heart and must be pursued by the government, because that is what people are saying. It is quite plainly reflected in the member for Braddon’s survey results, and I want to give him very special credit once again for the great job he did in providing that information to the parliament. Work in progress: proceed with caution, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services into primary producer access to gene technology. As a supplementary member of that committee for the purpose of this inquiry, I had my first experience of this committee. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the chair and all members of the committee for working together in a constructive manner about an issuewhich is really a series of issues-that has a large interest in the future of primary production and also in other areas of gene technology, which is widely recognised as being one of the major industries of the century we have just commenced. I would also like to congratulate and thank the secretariat of the committee for their work. There is no doubt that this is a complex subject that required a lot of us to get up to speed very quickly about matters that we did not know an awful lot about. That is not unusual for a parliamentary committee; that is what parliamentary committees do. But I think that all those involved can be congratulated on producing a very useful report. No-one should see a report like this as being definitive; no-one should see it as being the be-all and end-all. It is another part of the debate which needs to occur in Australian society about what we do with respect to the implementation, regulation and development of this technology. It is certainly a subject very worthy of parliamentary scrutiny. Yesterday in the Senate the Senate Community Affairs References Committee also delivered a report on the proposed legislation that the government now has before the Senate with respect to the setting up of the gene technology regulator. That report was called A cautionary tale: fish don’t lay tomatoes. Looking at that report and our report, it is interesting to see that there are quite a few similarities, although not so much between the recommendations, since that report examined a particular piece of legislation whereas this report went through a wider ranging set of issues. But, in terms of the debate, the witnesses that were seen and the issues that were raised, there was a great similarity. TodayI would like to focus on some of those things. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, the Senate committee and, from what I can tell, the major parties, and even the minor parties, agree on a few things in this field. We agree that there is a need for regulation in this industry, because we all see that this is an area where there is not only significant opportunity but also a degree of risk and that caution is required for the development of this",122,Representatives Main Committee
191,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.00 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to be here today to talk further about22090 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 technology into the future. We also agree that there is a need to better educate the public about what is occurring in this field. That goes not only to the question of general information but also to ensuring that the good stories as well as the bad stories get out into the community so that there is a much better understanding of what can in fact occur with this type of technology. There is also concern that the regulation is regulation that ensures guarantees and certainty for all of those involved in the production process and that the regulator ensures that whatever is done is being done with an understanding of what is being achieved. I think that is something we are all in favour of. We have just been joined by the member for Calare. I will not comment on what was said earlier; I actually did not catch that. I will make a couple of comments briefly about his dissenting report, which I referred to earlier. This is a lay committee; there is no doubt about that. Parliamentary committees are. There are very few things about which a parliamentary committee can claim significant expertise with respect to a particular inquiry. That is not what parliamentary committees do. Parliamentary committees are about gathering information, making recommendations and being part of the debate but not the end of the debate. Certainly, this report should be seen in that light. There are a few points I would like to emphasise on the need for information out in the community. It is clear that a lot of people do not have much knowledge of genetic engineering or genetic technology. It is also certain that it is moving ahead at a tremendous rate. Earlier, the member for Lowe referred to the member for Braddon’s survey of his electorate. That survey is informative to a degree about the fact that there is a need to improve information sources for people as to what they will be doing. One area of the legislation that has had significant debate in recent times is the issue of Tasmania and the concerns of the Tasmanian government. I am hopeful that Tasmania’s concerns can in fact be resolved with the Commonwealth and that that will occur in the next little while, in order to ensure that we do have a strong, tight national regulatory regime. There are still some issues to be resolved; but from talking to some of the people involved I am hopeful that that can be taken care of. There are regional differences within this country which need to be taken into account, and there are circumstances where particular regions could capitalise on aspects of being seen to be clearly non-GM. That is something that any country ought to be conscious of, with respect to developing a diverse and productive agricultural sector. The point which has to be maintained with the legislation is that it needs to have that flexibility and it needs to be approached with goodwill on all sides. That is actually occurring. Certainly, the Senate committee report yesterday made a range of practical recommendations as to what might be done to adjust the legislation in a way which will be more in keeping with those sorts of concerns. Although the ranking government senator on that committee basically went totally feral last night with respect to that particular report, the fact of the matter is that at the end of the day a range of the concerns that she had will not be found to be accurate or a concern to others, even within her own party. I am confident that a lot of the concerns that have been raised about that legislation will be resolved. It also highlights that, in the same way that there are disinformation campaigns occurring publicly regarding gene technology at the same time that there is ignorance in the community with respect to gene technology, there is also the situation where some involved in the science have approached this area with a certain arrogance and an unwillingness to even feel the need to explain, or an inability to be able to do so. That has not helped the debate, either. Industry has to look to the question of how it behaves with respect to this field. In the same way that some of the companies involved are doing some very important research and are developing some very important products, they also have to be very conscious that they in Thursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22091 themselves are very much on trial with this technology. If they do not do the job properly, farmers will have a lack of confidence in what occurs in relation to themselves, the community-and by this I mean consumers-will also have a lack of confidence in the technology in terms of what is produced and therefore consumed, and all of that will then lead to the way forward for this type of technology being a lot rockier than it needs to be. I am confident that reports like this-which do go through a lot of the issues that are involved and do provide a range of recommendations that government can and ought to take up-do provide a part of that ongoing public process. I believe the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report yesterday will play another part of that role. There will be ongoing debate in the community and parliament as the bill is further considered in the Senate. If the Senate amends the bill again-as I suspect it may do-that will lead us to more debate in the House, and that can only be a healthy thing. At the end of it, I am hopeful that we will get what this report calls for and needs: a situation where we have a regulator that is trusted and there is confidence in what it does; where there is greater public exposure of the issues with respect to this technology; and where consumers as well as industry can feel some confidence. That in itself will be a good thing. The one thing that is clear is that this technology is going to be a major part of the way forward over this next century. We have to be able to take into account and benefit from the advantages that it will bring, while at the same time being aware of and alive to the fact that there are risks that have to be very carefully managed. I commend the report to the House. said most of what I wanted to during the debate on the Gene Technology Bill 2000 in the House, but I have heard some comments made this morning about my dissenting report. The member for Groom, if I understood him correctly, seemed to insinuate that in questioning the supplementation of the parliamentary committee by the member for Moore-who has commercial interests in the area of gene technology-I was in some way casting a smear on his character. I certainly was not and I withdraw any inference, if that is the interpretation. The member for Braddon also referred to my minority report and suggested any mention of the member for Moore’s membership of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services was perhaps unintended and a ‘slip of the pen’ I think he said. Let me put on record here again what I did say. In the introduction to my dissenting report I said: Throughout the inquiry it was apparent to me that a lay committee of the Commonwealth Parliament (supplemented by one member with specialist GMO understanding, but worryingly with strong GM commercial interests) was ill-equipped to reach conclusions and recommendations on: “the future value and importance of genetically modified varieties” as required in the first term of reference. I stand by those remarks. I said that I had no dispute with the good faith of those committee members who reached the conclusions and recommendations they did. I certainly did not wish to cast aspersions on the character of the member for Moore. I was simply stating my concern that a member retaining a strong commercial interest in an area under study by a committee of this parliament should be part of that study-whatever the expertise they may bring to it. The same might apply to any member who retains a commercial interest in any area-whatever the background-and is then required to be objective about an issue under inquiry or debate. For instance, we have an inquiry of the parliament under way into regional radio and, no doubt, television. IfI held shares in a country radio station or, indeed, in Prime Televisionwhich I do not-and it was under study by a committee of this parliament, even given that it was one thing only and it was a declared interest, I would certainly question my ability to take part in such an inquiry. There is no way, I believe, that the perception of independence can be maintained if those sorts of situations arise. It was only in relation to that sort of area that I",123,Representatives Main Committee
192,Mr Andren (Calare) (11.10 A.m.),"I did not intend to contribute to this debate, having22092 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 used one word to describe my worry that such an involvement was there, given the enormous commercial push in this industry, which is an area the general public has so much lack of understanding of and evidence about. The member for Braddon seems surprised that I wrote a dissenting report. I think it was reasonably understood through my questions during the inquiry that I was less than convinced by some of the arguments-as, indeed, were some of the other members-presented during the inquiry. I decided to write a dissenting report-which seems to have captured the imagination of several speakers here this morning-because I believed the debate needed to be maintained. To some degree that is exactly what has happened. That is what the report has done, what the dissenting report also has done and, indeed, what the Senate Community Affairs References Committee’s report has done, although I have not had a great deal of time to examine that. But that is the sort of dissemination of information that still needs to be done-I think in a major way-and that is why one of the recommendations of mine and others was that there be a moratorium of some substantial period until a lot of these issues are resolved. Rather than the dissenting report coming out of the blue, as was suggested by one speaker, I indicated to the chair and the committee secretariat that I was seriously considering writing a dissenting report as the inquiry was about to wrap up. I do not know where the member for Lowe was-he certainly was not on the committee. I do not know where he gets his information from, but I told several people that I was going away with the evidence and that most likely I was going to write a dissenting report. The deputy chair was well aware of my intentions. The member for Barker took exception to some of the concerns I raised in my report. He seems to have an understanding of the benefits of gene technology that I certainly do not and that a vast number of people out there in the community do not. That is why they are concerned. I admire his insight and understanding, if indeed he does have that special knowledge. If my minority report generates more debate, that is healthy, because there is no way that I can totally sign off on the benefits of gene technology-and I do not think that any member of this parliament can, certainly not without the sort of forensic examination and detail that needs to be put into the way this bill, in particular, will be administered. The member for Braddon spoke of a survey in his electorate showing something like a 79 per cent opposition to the introduction of GM products at this point. The Tasmanian government introduced its own moratorium. The Western Australian government is or was considering likewise on certain products. WasI really out of step? Given the level of opposition, doubt and-yes-cynicism about the commercial interests driving this technology, wasn’t it my duty to not sign off on a unanimous report in this highly complex area? I was trying to tease out the concerns of particularly non-GM producers and organic producers, and some of the arguments about the international impacts on emerging economies and the downside of this in terms of traditional agriculture that I do not believe had beenalbeit inadvertently-properly teased out in the inquiry. I tried to contribute to that. I have upset a few people along the way, no doubt, in attempting to tease out the whole story on this incredibly complex issue. During my contribution to the debate on the Gene Technology Bill 2000, I expressed concerns about the independence of the proposed regulator, especially given the imperative that he or she be selffunding after mid-2001. I am pleased that the Senate committee report on the bill recommended that the regulator be established as a statutory authority, consisting of a board of three people who will take ultimate responsibility for decision making. I was proud to be part of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services inquiry and I certainly admire everyone who was on it. I thought it was an Thursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22093 excellently run inquiry. It came out with a heap of stuff that I was very supportive of. However, I certainly did not write the minority report just to be perverse. I wanted to tease out some of those other arguments, because I think this is an area that requires far more debate than it has had so far. The medical associations of both Australia and Britain say that health and environmental consequences are yet to be assessed. That haunted me through this whole process. Here were experts in this area asking that there be far more examination of these issues. SoI was not prepared to sign off on the unanimous set of recommendations, although I thought-and I still believe-that many of those recommendations were very sound. On that note, with any slur on the member for Moore totally unintended, I stand by my dissenting report. FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (11.18 a.m.)-by leave-With the very limited time that is available to all committee reports when they are tabled in the House-and I acknowledge that I spoke to the report of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services Work in progress: proceed with caution-primary producer access to gene technology when I tabled it in the House-I wish to now spend a couple of minutes on it. I will not take up a lot of the time of the Main Committee. I would firstly like to thank the member for Calare for coming in to the Main Committee and addressing some of the concerns that were raised by other members of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. I thank him as a valued member of the committee for clarifying his remarks in regard to the member for Moore who, during the entire committee process when we were working on this particular inquiry, was a very valuable member of the committee, and we certainly valued his expertise. While the member for Calare is still in this chamber, let me say that the fact that he wrote a dissenting report is fine; everyone has a right to do that. This report is not a definitive report. We are a group of individual members of parliament who came together on a committee and who used all of our own expertise and abilities to question issues, to tease out a number of those issues and to make the recommendations. In the introduction to his dissenting report, the member for Calare said: From the outset I was uncomfortable with the terms of reference for this inquiry. As chair of this committee, I pass on to the member for Calare that, if he has any concerns about any particular terms of reference, he should go directly to either the chair or the secretariat and make those concerns known, because during the 15 months of the inquiry the member for Calare did not make those concerns known to me. But I do thank him for coming into the Main Committee this morning and clarifying some of those points and for being a contributing member of the committee. I will wrap up just a few points in the few moments that I have. I think that each of the members of the committee, in speaking to this debate, have really summed up the underlying principle that the committee came to, and it is reflected in the title of our report Work in progress: proceed with caution. I have already said previously that I believe we have had three great revolutions in our society. We have had the Industrial Revolution, and there was no stopping that; we have had the information technology revolution, and there was no stopping that; and we certainly have the biotechnology revolution, and I would say that there is no stopping the development of the science. But the second part of the title of the committee’s report-‘proceed with caution’-underlies all of the recommendations that the committee made on this topic. That has been reflected not just in the contribution to this debate by committee members but also by other members of parliament who have an interest in this issue. Some of the key issues that members have raised in this debate have been about the need for regulation-for it to be open, transparent and accountable-and I think that the legislation 22094 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 which was introduced into the House following this report has certainly picked up on a lot of the issues that we raised in this report. Another matter was evident from the member for Braddon’s survey that he referred to this morning. I would think that if I were to conduct a similar survey in my electorate, I would probably not get very dissimilar results. The results of that survey showed that there is a great need for information. People simply do not have sufficient information about the whole issue of gene technology. The issue of labelling was raised. We have addressed this in the committee’s report and we stress the importance of labelling for genetically modified products. I will take a minute of the Main Committee’s time to add to the question of labelling for genetically modified products the whole question of country of origin labelling, which I guess has been a hobbyhorse of mine for a number of years. A simple regulation P90 needs to be changed, and I would think that if ANZFA can tackle this whole question of labelling of genetically modified products, it surely could address country of origin labelling. As chair of the committee responsible for this report, I would hope that this report is stimulating debate and that is going to generate more discussion in the community and provide information. I have already had a number of organisations and individuals contact me to say, ‘Thank you for providing so much information in this report.’ If this report generates more discussion, if it provides recommendations and suggestions to government which we believe are critical and if it provides information to the general public, then the committee has done an excellent job in producing this report. I appreciate the time. I have taken up, Mr Deputy Speaker. I seek leave to continue my remarks on this topic at a later time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Motion (by Fran Bailey) proposed. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Goods and Services Tax: Petrol Prices government is showing to motorists, especially to country motorists, with the rip-off of GST on fuel prices. Australians, on average, use 50.6 million litres of leaded and unleaded petrol per day. They use 36.3 million litres of diesel and 5.2 million litres of autogas per day. Is it any wonder that fuel prices and the GST are of major concern to motorists not only in my electorate but all over Australia. I have done some basic calculations using those figures and estimate that motorists in my electorate of Bendigo are paying the federal government around $60,000 a day in GST on their fuel purchases. On current prices of fuel in the Bendigo electorate, the GST slug on motorists adds up to a colossal figure of around $20 million a year-a $20 million a year ripoff. That is how much GST people in Bendigo are paying, and they get nothing for it. The government refuses to honour its commitment to fund the duplication of the Calder Highway in spite of Bendigo motorists paying an extra $20 million a year. I quote figures which show that, at the moment, unleaded petrol is selling at 98c a litre in Bendigo; $1, or 100c, a litre in Castlemaine and Heathcote; 99c a litre in Maryborough; 101.9c a litre in Wedderburn; and $1.01 per litre in Inglewood. In coalition territory it is selling at 105.4c a litre in Mildura; $1 a litre in Swan Hill and $1 in Elmore. These are staggering prices, yet the federal government not only does nothing about them but actually profits from them. Is it any wonder there is a massive upsurge in public hostility against this government?",125,Representatives Main Committee
193,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.26 A.m.),"I rise to express my anger at the contempt thisThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22095 Before the last election, the government solemnly promised that the price of petrol would not be increased by the GST. But after the election was over, the language shifted to saying that the price ‘need not’ rise because of the GST. What is happening is that the government is cashing in on the increases in oil prices that have been inflicted on Australian motorists. Originally, the government promised to fully offset the effect of the GST on fuel prices by making appropriate reductions in excise. It has broken that promise. We have had all sorts of pretexts from the government, but it has actually done nothing. Firstly, it claimed falsely that pensions and welfare payments depended on the revenue from fuel taxes and the GST. Now we are told that the whole budget surplus depends on the huge fuel tax rake-off and that interest rates will rise if this is touched. We are even being told that the government miscalculated over the cost of rebates on private health insurance and compensation to older people for the effect of the GST on their savings. Now we have the Prime Minister laying down the law to the premiers and outlawing any debate on fuel prices, taxes and the GST at tomorrow’s meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. Everyone knows that the present level of excise and GST on fuel is the responsibility of the Howard government, yet the Prime Minister wants to shift the onus for relief onto the shoulders of the states by demanding that they cut prices. This is the federal government that says that it makes ‘all’ the tough decisions. What rubbish! The breach of promise over the GST on fuel is a rerun of the broken promise over liquor. Again, the coalition promised that the price of liquor would not rise, and we had the breweries and the hotel industry running publicity campaigns against the government’s deceit-just as we are seeing the RACV and the AAA running their campaigns right now. Country people are hit hardest by the GST rip-off. Country people use public transport less than city people, and they travel longer distances. They have to pay freight for goods in and out of the country, and they pay more for fuel. On top of all of that, like all other motorists they have double taxation-a tax on a tax. This is nothing short of bushrangery. Poor old Ned Kelly was hung, yet this government gets away with highway robbery while National Party members sit in this parliament and do nothing about it. They beat their chests out in their electorates, pretending to represent the interests of country people, but they do nothing about it when they come into this parliament. They are really just Liberals in gumboots. Time and time again we see them stand up in their electorates, appearing to be in touch with their people, but they are not. I am reminded of that wonderful old Kenny Rogers song called The Coward of the County. Well, National Party members will undoubtedly go down in history as ‘The cowards of the country’. James Cook University James Cook University, Australia’s tropical university. When we came into government there were some very great difficulties for James Cook University, particularly in relation to problems that the former administration had caused with debt. The current administration inherited some $30 million worth of debt and it was a very difficult problem for the university. But there have been some great initiatives over the last four years and I would like to point to those. The first was the establishment of the medical school at James Cook University. This was Australia’s first new medical school in 25 years. Really, it has been a magnificent result for the university in establishing the medical school. James Cook University is considered now to be the next sandstone university in the country. It has got that kind of status due to the establishment of the medical school. The building is almost finished; it is due to be finished by the end of the year. The facilities are just first class. In fact, the purpose-built facilities will be the envy of every other medical school in the country. It is also interesting to note the way",128,Representatives Main Committee
194,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.30 A.m.),"I would like to inform the Main Committee about22096 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 the students were chosen. It was terrific. For the 60 places at JCU there were nearly 900 applications. Of course, they were very careful to select students on the basis of those who would make good doctors, not those who were the best academics. Following the establishment of the medical school, James Cook University was the only university in this country that was referred to in the federal budget. I am pretty proud of that, because I was able to deliver 450 new growth places for that university which, as those who are aware of the finances of the university will understand, was warmly welcomed by the management of the university. We were the only university in the country to get new growth places. They have been applied to the best benefit of the university and its community, and that has been a great result. The next initiative that I was pleased to be associated with was the very recent solution to the bandwidth problem. I was able to fix the bandwidth problems that the university was suffering and at the same time fix the bandwidth problems of every other regional university in the country. I really appreciate Professor Bill Lavery’s assistance in that project. That brought JCU in line with the technology that is available to the capital city universities when previously James Cook University was somewhat disadvantaged. That is now fixed. We are not resting there-we are proceeding to send James Cook University further ahead. There are some pretty interesting partnerships that are being established, and some very good possibilities. The first one I refer to is the reef CRC. There are three CRCs at James Cook University. The reef CRC is putting a lot of effort into establishing a tropical marine science institute which will be a world leader. That builds on the marine science at James Cook; the ancillary marine science evolved from the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville and also the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The prospect of a tropical marine science centre of excellence in Townsville is something that is very exciting and something that I am strongly supporting. Another proposal relates to a possible partnership with CSIRO. Currently, CSIRO has a facility very close to James Cook, but I think there is every prospect of moving CSIRO onto the James Cook campus. We are not talking about bringing the two organisations together but about co-location. That will allow James Cook University scientists and CSIRO scientists to rub shoulders, to swap ideas, to work for the benefit of science in general and their organisations in particular. I believe there is a great opportunity there for that co-location to bring big benefits to the north, and particularly to James Cook University. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Air Traffic Control my concern-indeed, very real fear-both for people who are travelling on planes into and out of Sydney airport and for the people in electorates such as mine around the airport. In spite of the government’s rhetoric on 1 April 1998 in what can only be seen as an April Fool’s joke, when the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development put out a press release headed ‘Resolution of Badgerys Creek issue within site’-what a farce-some 2½ years later we still have no decision. We have prevarication from this government, and we have the document which I released here on 11 February, the briefing that was given to country mayors, state members and federal members, which suggested that the transforming of Bankstown to the airport of choice for regional New South Wales is the reality in terms of the plan that this government has for Sydney airport. Also, we have seen six breaches of the movements cap at Sydney airport, a legislated cap that means nothing: on 22 June, 81 movements; 23 June, 87 movements; 26 July, 83 movements; 22 August, 81 movements; 1 September, 82 movements; and 19 September, 81 movements. What response do we get from the department about the breaches of this cap of 80 movements? We have a letter which says:",129,Representatives Main Committee
195,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.35 A.m.),"I rise in the Main Committee to put on recordThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22097 When this occurs there will be an offsetting reduction in actual runway movements for other periods of the day. What a joke! But it is more serious than that. Yesterday we saw an accident at Sydney airport to China Eastern Airlines flight MU-561. There are more and more near misses at Sydney airport as the airport runs above safe capacity. Now we have an extraordinary plan by Airservices Australia, which is undertaking a project to investigate the feasibility of closing the remote terminal control unit at Sydney airport so that the airspace around Sydney-and Perth, Adelaide and Cairns, which are also part of this plan-would be controlled from either Melbourne or Brisbane. This would leave the control of this airspace over the Sydney basin in the hands of controllers located at an interstate centre. If this were to occur, there would be no local management structure left in place to deal with the many issues that affect Sydney airport-safety, the implementation of the long-term operating plan, the cap of 80 movements an hour at the airport, the curfew. This is a disaster. Residents around Sydney airport will simply not cop the shutting down, effectively, of air traffic control facilities around that airport and its being controlled from Melbourne or Brisbane, which would have no concern for the residents around the airport. I have been written to and contacted by air traffic controllers at the airport who are scared about this proposal, not just for themselves and their jobs, but because of the implications for safety around Sydney airport. We saw yesterday the reality of the danger. If the airspace over Sydney and affecting Sydney airport were controlled from Melbourne, no-one in Melbourne would have the slightest interest in the noise issues affecting Sydney. The minister must intervene. He must stop this feasibility study and he must say that this plan is simply not on. Once again there has been no consultation with the Sydney Airport Community Forum, chaired by Dr Brendan Nelson and appointed by this government. It is ignored on all the big picture issues related to Sydney airport. We, the residents in the community around Sydney airport, have given notice that the time for dialogue is pretty close to being up. We have been responsible and there has been cooperation over the management of the airport-for example, during the Olympics-but this proposal is dangerous. It is unsafe. It is secret-none of the public or the community know about it. After this speech they will know and they will rise up against this plan. I call upon the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to actually make a decision on something: to make a decision about Sydney’s second airport but also to make decisions relating to how that airport operates, in the interests of not just those who fly into and out of Sydney but those residents who live around the airport. (Time expired). South America: Visit Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.40 a.m.)-I was very glad to hear the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler, speak about airports because I will touch on airport policy in just one moment. I want to speak today on a recent visit to Brazil and Argentina when I was very proud to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that travelled to enhance trade and export opportunities. The visit resulted from a report that was provided to the parliament by the committee. Basically, the report dealt with our relationship with South America and with increasing our export opportunities. I found that it was an increasing area of opportunity generally and with both Argentina and Brazil. When you look at countries such as Brazil, which has 170 million people, and Argentina, which has close to 40 million people, and at towns such as Sao Paulo, in Brazil, with 20 million people residing in it, you see the enormous scope and opportunities there to enhance our trade opportunities. At the moment, with both countries, Australia receives about 0.5 per cent of trade. It has been a historical situation that we have tended to look to the north, with 22098 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 Australia particularly looking to Asian countries to expand our trade opportunities, when we should look at countries like those in South America as well. One of the many things we did on the very extensive 10-day visit was to visit mining companies, agricultural companies and industry to look at opportunities to increase our trade. A number of areas emerged, including agriculture, medical technology, IT and tourism, and also students and business activity. But one of the things that is greatly hampering us in areas of Brazil is a lack of an air agreement. I want to touch on that because one of the big problems relates to the activities of the previous government in this area. In the mid-1990s the Brazilian authorities visited Australia with a view to conducting an air agreement between both our countries. They were treated very shabbily and very poorly. There was a breakdown in relationships. What happened was that a delegation arrived, they were met by a low ranking official of the department and they were further repudiated by the aviation minister at the time, Mr Laurie Brereton. The relationship between Australia and Brazil in terms of aviation has deteriorated ever since. I visited Air Brigadier Grossi, along with our Ambassador, Garry Conroy, and it was very clear that it was going to be a very tough call indeed. We went through all the trade opportunities that exist between both our countries and the fact that visitor visas out of Brazil have increased from 7,000 to 10,000, which makes it is a very lucrative market. At the moment you cannot fly into Brazil, you have to go Buenos Aires. Qantas flies into Buenos Aires twice a week. There is no possibility of going on to Brazil with any Brazilian airline carriers. We spoke to Brigadier Grossi about the possibility of a code share arrangement with Qantas and one of the Brazilian airways. I have been in sales for 22 years and I do not think I have ever had such a tough call, because, despite his hospitable demeanour, he picked up a letter that related to the previous government and their shabby treatment of him, threw the letter down to us and basically implied that we had some way to go. That type of shabby behaviour by the previous government puts us back so many years in terms of trade and export opportunities. I did the very best that I could, but clearly the Brazilian authorities felt affronted, they felt that they were abused and not treated properly, so it was really the highest diplomatic snub that they could have been given. I hope that my visit helped to allay their fears. We do want to do business with South America. We do want to increase our export opportunities and have mutual benefits for both countries. We were very keen to promote our relationship. We have much in common in terms of climate and multiculturalism which we can further expand on and explore. I hope that Brigadier Grossi will look upon the visit favourably and that we will get closer to ensuring that we can establish the enormous amount of trade with Brazil which is just waiting to be opened up. I hope he will forgive the previous government, that he will proceed with greater enthusiasm to open up relations and that we will have a bilateral agreement. (Time expired) Members of Parliament: Entitlements institutions. World wide, there is a trend whereby people are losing faith and trust in public institutions. This does not just apply in the area of politics; it seems to be happening across the board. In particular, this parliament is suffering. We are now working in an environment of distrust and cynicism. I think it is very hard to do our job effectively if MPs have two challenges: first, to try to get the trust of the public; and, secondly, to try to persuade them to our point of view. So it is a difficult environment and, in many ways, democracy has entered a crisis. This has been provoked recently, of course, by the shameful telecard scandal. This reflects very badly on the current government. Most of these entitlement scandals have come from Howard government ministers. More generally, though, I think there is an issue for those on",130,Representatives Main Committee
196,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (11.45 A.m.),"I wish to address the issue of trust in our publicThursday, 2 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22099 both sides of the House. We need to address the overall problem. I believe in the public administration rule that bad behaviour is a product of bad culture and bad culture is a product of bad systems. So to fix the bad behaviour, what we as parliamentarians need to do is fix the bad systems. There used to be something of a Mexican stand-off in this parliament regarding entitlements. That ended the night Senator Ray stood up in the Senate and quite rightly ripped into Mal Colston. It could not go on any more. Since then the system has, bit by bit, melted down. Travel allowances, travel entitlements, telecards, mobile phones, self-drive cars and even petrol cards have come into the public eye and increasingly under public scrutiny. The system is bad. It has three fundamental flaws. Firstly, it blurs public and private use. I pointed out in the Daily Telegraph last Friday that, to pay for a private call, I need to find a telephone box-MPs have that many telephones and telephone entitlements. Secondly, these entitlements are open ended. I do not know of any other part of the public sector where openended entitlements sit cheek by jowl with capped entitlements. It should be under the one budget. Thirdly, the system does not encourage accountability or responsibility. There is no effective system of cost control. If, five years ago, the member for Flinders had been responsible for the cost of running his office, there is no way in the world that telecard would have got out of his sight and then out of control. I argue very strongly to fix the system. Fix the system and thereby fix the culture and the behaviour. There are three steps to be taken in fixing our system and restoring public trust in parliamentary institutions. The first is to aggregate and cap our various entitlements. The salary should be kept separate but there should be a global budget for MPs in running our electorate offices. I believe this would be good for our constituents. In my electorate of Werriwa, we have a very heavy workload, particularly with migration and social security constituency work. I would love to be able to save in some expenditure areas and employ a fourth staff person to give vital service to our constituents. I would love to have that control. But there is something of a paradox. I have been elected here, with other members, in theory, to run the country, but we do not even have the power to run our own offices and office budgets. It would be good for us, and good for our constituents, to have a system which aggregates and caps the entitlements and passes on responsibility to the MP himself or herself. The second reform is strong auditing. I support the initiative of Senator Faulkner-an initiative that this government should support-to introduce an independent auditing system. If we had a capped global budget, that independent auditor would obviously run us through a very rigorous process every 12 months. Any problems would quickly come to light and the member would need to be directly accountable for those particular issues. The third reform is to normalise our superannuation arrangements. Parliamentary superannuation as a generous entitlement made sense when we alone in the community faced job insecurity. But now, in the new economy, job insecurity is all over the place. There is hardly an Australian who feels secure in their workplace. For that reason, why should parliamentarians have a different set of superannuation rules from the general community? I would like to see the system normalised to move towards the 55 years preservation arrangement, first and foremost, and then, over time, to normalise the other details of the scheme. Of course, it cannot be made retrospective. This could easily apply to new members of parliament from the next election and, over time, parliamentary superannuation would be brought into line with that available to the rest of the community. That measure, along with the others I have mentioned, would rebuild trust in our democratic system. Let us get to the bottom line: trust is the glue between elected representatives and the public which makes democracy work. Democracy is not working. We 22100 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 November 2000 are all diminished by this. I would like to see all parliamentarians join in a healthy debate about how we can fix the system and, ultimately, fix the problem. Member for McEwen: Webpage FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (11.50 a.m.)-I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate today. I want to take the opportunity to announce that the magnificent electorate of McEwen has actually finally joined the information technology age. Last Friday we launched in Seymour, up in the Central Highlands section of the electorate of McEwen, our webpage. The address of that webpage is www.franbaileymp.com. We have tried with this webpage to be perhaps a little different from many members of parliament; we have tried to make the webpage an extension of the office. One of the difficulties for any member of parliament having a very large and diverse electorate like ours in McEwen is to be able to get around. It does not seem to matter how accessible you make yourself. I have a fantastic staff and a mobile office, and I seem to spend more time in my car than anywhere else, like a lot of other members with very large electorates. How can we provide information on a 24-hour basis? The only way is to do it electronically. So in McEwen we are now doing that. We are doing things a little differently in that each month we are featuring a small business from the electorate. New small businesses starting up take a risk. Usually they have done all their homework but it is still a risk setting up a small business. What can I, as the local federal MP, do to assist? I can provide information right across the electorate about the business and the sort of service that people can expect from that business. It is, if you like, giving that business a bit of a kick-start. We are also featuring personalities from the electorate. These are going to be persons I would usually describe as the quiet achievers in the electorate. They do not normally receive any accolades for their work. They do not receive awards and recognition from local or state governments or, indeed, from the federal government. They tend to be people quietly working away in their communities. In fact, they are the people who keep the rural communities especially ticking over. In this initial month of our launch of the webpage we are featuring Mr Vinny Long. Vinny is a pensioner who lives up in Mansfield. In the last couple of years since he retired Vinny has been collecting parts to bicycles. He rebuilds bikes. He gives them away to kids whose mums and dads cannot afford to buy them a bike. So far, Vinny has given away more than 2,000 bikes. I have actually warned his wife that by giving Vinny this profile and this access on the webpage they are likely to be inundated with bike parts. This could be a bit of a problem because the garage at the back of Vinny’s home is pretty well full to capacity with bike parts at the moment. However, that is what he loves to do and so this, I think, is an important feature of being in touch with people working at the very grassroots of our electorates. One of the other features of the webpage-apart from providing an up-to-date account of what I have been doing around the electorate and what different community groups have been doing, and providing links to a number of government pages, local government and community organisations-is a community notice board where people can advertise events in their electorates. There is also a feedback section where people can contact me and let me know what their concerns and issues are. In fact, there is a hot issues page-and certainly in my electorate petrol is a hot issue. It also describes some of the hot issues that we have been able to sort out, like the traffic lights in Kilmore, that affect the day-to-day life of people and are important. It is just another arm of the office, an extension of its accessibility.

The time allowed for debate has expired.The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Rebates and Grants Schemes (Question No. 1284) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 April 2000: Does the Government currently differentiate between geographic areas in the application of (a) tax rebates and (b) grants schemes relating to tax compensation; if so, what are the details. (a) For information on zone rebates, I refer the honourable member to section 79A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. (b) For information on the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme, I refer the honourable member to the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999. For information on the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, I refer the honourable member to the Fuel Sales Grants Act 2000. Health: Emphysema (Question No. 1501) Mr Laurie Ferguson-asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) What is the estimated incidence of emphysema in the Australian community and how many deaths each year are attributable to the condition. (2) Is the incidence of emphysema linked to particular demographic characteristics; if so, what groups are at increased risk of contracting the disease. (3) For the latest year for which data is available, what level of Commonwealth funding is provided for research relating to emphysema. (4) Which institutions received funding for emphysema-related research in the period 1998-2000 and how many grants were obtained by each institution. (5) Is emphysema designated as a priority under the Government’s National Health Priority Areas: if not, why not. (1) The latest ABS National Health Survey (1995) provides prevalence (number of people who have a disease at a point in time) rather than incidence (number of new cases) of certain medical conditions. The prevalence of bronchitis and emphysema are collected in a single category. The Survey found that 777,835 (4.3 per cent) of all Australians reported that they either suffer from long term or current bronchitis and/or emphysema. The ABS (1998) reported 575 male and 287 female deaths caused by emphysema. (2) There is no available Australian evidence to suggest whether the incidence of emphysema is linked to particular demographic characteristics and therefore particular groups that are at increased risk cannot be established. (3) The following amounts have been provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for research relating to emphysema in the following years: 1998-$335,000 1999-$165,000 2000-$474,000 (4) The following institutions received funding from the NHMRC for emphysema-related research in the period 1998-2000: 1998 Repatriation General Hospital1 Grant",135,Representatives Main Committee

The six NHPAs account for 70 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia, comprising 81 per cent of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and 57 per cent of life lost due to disability (YLD). Although the antecedent factors for emphysema are similar to asthma it was considered that extending the concept of the NPHAs to be more inclusive would put at risk efforts to improve the burden of disease for the majority.

The National Health& Medical Research Council (NHMRC) provided research funding of $51,941 in 1998 and $163,561 in 1999 into lower back pain. In addition, the NHMRC provided funding of $154,062 in 1998 and $89,710 in 1999 for research into back pain and pain associated with disc damage and disc disease. The NHMRC also provided funding of $155,130 in 1998 and $205,497 in 1999 for research into pain and pain relief, covering both acute pain such as during and after surgery or trauma, and chronic pain such as that resulting from back injury or cancer.

202,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Disability Discrimination Act: Federal Court Applications (Question No. 1753) (1) In the Federal Court in (a) 1997-98, (b) 1998-99 and (c) 1999-2000 how many applications concerned disability discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act. (2) How many applications referred to in part (1) resulted in an award of costs against the (a) applicant and (b) respondent. (3) Has his attention been drawn to research which identifies the extent to which the prospects of costs being awarded against applicants in disability discrimination matters deters potential applicants from commencing proceedings in the Federal Court; if so, how does the Government propose to address this barrier to disabled Australians achieving access to justice. (4) Has his Department conducted any evaluation of the impact of the legislative changes in the Human Right Amendment Bill 1988 on disabled Australians; if not, is an evaluation planned. (1) The legislative provisions which allow for applications to the Federal Court concerning the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 were amended from 13 April 2000. Applications under the relevant legislative provisions before and after that date need to be considered. Until 13 April 2000, the Federal Court usually only dealt with matters alleging unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 if an application to the Federal Court was made under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for judicial review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s original determination in the matter. Between1 July 1997 and 30 June 2000, a total of 19 applications were made to the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 concerning allegations of unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. A further avenue for applications to the Federal Court related to the enforcement of a determination by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The relevant legislative provisions commenced on 28 June 1995. Between 28 June 1995 and 30 June 2000, only one application was made to the court under Division 3A of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The application was discontinued. Three other applications were made to the Federal Court under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 between 1997-98 and 1999-2000. Two were dismissed on the basis that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction to deal with them. Since 13 April 2000, the Federal Court has had jurisdiction under section 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 to hear and determine allegations of unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. In the period 13 April 2000 to 30 June 2000, the Federal Court received 48 applications alleging unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.

As applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for judicial review of the original Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determination can be made by either party, the applicant in the Federal Court proceedings may have been the respondent to the complaint before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The only application made to the Federal Court under Division 3A of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 between 28 June 1995 and 30 June 2000 was discontinued without costs orders being made. Of the three other applications made to the Federal Court under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 between 1997-98 and 1999-2000, costs orders were made against the applicant in two matters. No costs orders were made in respect of applications under section 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, alleging unlawful discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, in 1999/2000 as no matters were determined by the Federal Court in that period.

Such research has been identified in several investigations and reports, including: J Cabassi, “Out of Reach Barriers to access and effective use of anti-discrimination remedies for people living with HIV and HCV,” HIV/Aids Legal Link, Vol 10 No 2, June/July 1999; the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996; the Access to Justice Advisory Committee report “Access to Justice: an action plan”; P Williams et al, “Report of the review of scales of legal professional fees in federal jurisdictions”; the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Report “The costs of justice”; and the Australian Law Reform Commission Reports “Cost shifting: who pays for litigation”, “Litigation cost rules” and “Managing Justice: a review of the federal civil justice system.” Issues relating to the possible deterrent effect of costs on potential applicants in disability discrimination proceedings were raised during consideration by Parliament of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No 1) 1999 (as it then was). The Government noted the Federal Court’s wide discretion with regard to making an award of costs and considered that the standard regime should apply to unlawful discrimination matters in the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Service after amendments made by the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act (No 1)1999 commenced operation on 13 April 2000. The Government also decided to review the operation of the costs regime on unlawful discrimination proceedings within three years of the operation of amendments made by the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act (No 1)1999. Initiatives contained in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 1999 will assist in reducing costs for litigants in unlawful discrimination proceedings. These measures include: providing that the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Service are not bound by technicalities or legal forms; and introducing a special arrangement whereby complainants suffering financial hardship can apply to me for assistance to pursue unlawful discrimination complaints. Additionally, the Federal Court of Australia Regulations 1978 and the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000 have been amended to ensure that the only court fee which will apply in unlawful discrimination matters is a nominal filing fee of $50. (4) My Department will review the operation of the Federal Court’s costs regime on human rights proceedings under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 within three years of the operation of the amendments made by the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 1999. Goods and Services Tax: Defence Portfolio Compliance (Question No. 1772) Mr Hatton asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Is the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Service Tax. (2) What action did the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000. (3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister’s portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign. (1) Yes. (2) The Department of Defence put in place a Tax Project Office to review relevant departmental policies, business processes, systems, services and contracts and to oversee implementation of The New Tax System. (3) Overall, the Defence Budget should realise a positive outcome from the introduction of the New Tax System. There has been no negative impact on services. Goods and Services Tax: Health and Aged Care Portfolio Compliance (Question No. 1773) Mr Hatton asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Is the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax. (2) What action did the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000. (3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister’s portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign. (1) In June 2000, the chief executives of all agencies within my portfolio were asked to provide me with written confirmation that they would be able to comply with The New Tax System from 1 July 2000. I received such assurances from each agency.

The Committee:",138,Questions On Notice
205,Mr Moore,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,140,Questions On Notice
206,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:assumed a responsibility for the whole implementation across the Department; had responsibility for overseeing work to be done in organisational units on the GST; provided advice to organisational units about GST implementation issues and work requirements; raised implementation issues and questions with the GST Implementation Team; and advised the Secretary and the Department’s Management Committee on progress against the GST. The Advisory Committee was continually provided with updates of the Department’s GST project plan and associated risk management strategy. This ensured that identified milestones were continually being met and that any variance against the project plan was appropriately identified. In relation to agencies, the Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) GST Implementation Unit forwarded during 1999-2000 a series of comprehensive monitoring surveys to all agencies to monitor their progress in relation to financial, taxation and business issues associated with The New Tax System. A summary of the results of these questionnaires was forwarded to the Department to ensure that each agency was on target to meet all requirements. (3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reforms by agencies is the responsibility of their respective chief executive officers or boards of management (as applicable). While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, the reforms are not expected to reduce the level of funding of agencies in this portfolio in real terms. University of Melbourne: Student Accommodation Funding (Question No. 1783) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) What funding did the Government grant to the University of Melbourne for the purpose of providing student accommodation in (a) 1973-74, (b) 197475, (c) 1975-76, (d) 1976-1977 and (e) 1977-78. (2) Is the Government aware of the University of Melbourne’s plans to sell houses purchased for the purpose of providing student accommodation; if so, is the Government aware of what the University intends to do with the proceeds of those sales. (3) Has he, his advisers or his Department discussed the sale of these houses with the University of Melbourne; if so, what are the details. (4) What alternative strategies is the Government putting in place to ensure the adequate provision of affordable student accommodation for University of Melbourne students. (1) The States Grants (Universities) Amendment Act 1976 indicates that the Commonwealth agreed to refund the State Government dollar for dollar, if it contributed between $34,722 (non-indexed) and $416,666 (non-indexed) to the University of Melbourne for non-collegiate student housing (i.e. accommodation which does not include colleges or halls of residence), over 1973 to 1975. The States Grants (Universities) Acts for 1996, 1997, and 1998 do not mention the availability of Commonwealth funding to the University for the purposes of non-collegiate student housing. The University’s records show that between 1973 and 1978 it received a $500,000 grant from the Australian Universities Commission for the provision of non-collegiate student housing. This grant was supplemented by an escalation grant of $40,000. The University contributed further amounts towards the provision of student housing from non-government sources. This amount is slightly lower, possibly due to indexation. (2) The sale of the houses will help generate the income necessary to fund a Student Housing Bursary scheme available to all eligible students, not just the small number who rented university owned houses or apartments.

(4) The University of Melbourne advises that its Student Housing Bursary Scheme actually increases the number of students who can receive assistance. Students on Youth Allowance who have to live",140,Questions On Notice
207,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:away from home to study may also be eligible for Commonwealth rent assistance. In addition, the Commonwealth provides institutions with a block operating grant which includes a capital component. The capital component for the University of Melbourne this year is $15.6 million. Universities have the discretion in using the funds to meet the needs of students through allocation of capital funds to student accommodation. Legal Aid: Victoria (Question No. 1790) (1) In determining the 2001 budget for Victorian Legal Aid, were the views of the Victoria Legal Aid Community Consultative Committee taken into account. (2) Did the budget process acknowledge the committee’s concerns about the increase in unrepresented litigants, the extra burden on legal aid partners, for example private solicitors, community legal centres and other community organisations and, what the committee perceives as denial of access to justice to disadvantaged Victorians. (3) If the budget process did address the committee’s concerns as described or in any other way, how were they addressed. (4) If the budget process did not address the committee’s concerns as outlined or in any other way, why not. (1) I am not aware of any representations made by the Victoria Legal Aid Community Consultative Committee to the Government prior to the Budget. However, in determining the 2000-01 budget for Victoria Legal Aid, the Commonwealth took account of the conclusions of the Legal Assistance Needs Project. Phase Two of the project looked broadly at legal aid needs and in doing so, the consultants conducted interviews with key stakeholders which included a range of appropriate groups such as legal aid commissions, National Legal Aid, private law firms involved in the provision of legal aid, the National Association of Community Legal Centres and a large number of community legal centres. Whilst the Victoria Legal Aid Community Consultative Committee was not specifically consulted, similar concerns to those expressed by the committee were raised by other stakeholders and this qualitative research was included in the report on Phase Two of the study. (2) As mentioned above, in determining the 2000-01 budget for Victorian Legal Aid, the Commonwealth took account of the conclusions of the Legal Assistance Needs Project. That project addressed key stakeholders’ concerns by, amongst other things, highlighting the areas of demand for legal aid, the problems in accessing the legal aid system and issues surrounding unrepresented litigants. (3) Key stakeholders’ concerns were addressed by the Government in its recent announcement of a funding boost for legal aid commissions of $63million over four years. The additional funding is being distributed according to the planning model developed as part of the Needs Study. The study concluded that Victoria had been receiving a disproportionate level of funding compared to other jurisdictions. The study’s findings are supported by the fact that Victoria had accumulated excess reserves of more than $5million out of its Commonwealth funding. (4) As stated before, account was taken of the key stakeholders’ concerns. The Commonwealth is unable to justify the continuation of legal aid funding arrangements that are based on historical distributions and levels of funding. Those arrangements did not take account of the need for equity across the states and territories and did not provide a justifiable basis for future distribution of legal aid funding. Atomic Test Participants Cancer Incidence and Mortality Study (Question No. 1793) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:",141,Questions On Notice
208,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:",142,Questions On Notice
209,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) What is the agreed timetable for the completion of the Atomic Test Participants Cancer Incidence and Mortality Study. (2) Is there an independent Steering Committee for the study; if so, who are the members of the Committee. (3) What sum, if any, did Defence spend on the study in 1999-2000. (4) What is the estimated funding allocation for the study for (a) 2000-01 and (b) subsequent years. (5) Through which Budget appropriation item is the study being funded. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) A timetable has not been agreed. Before the study can begin a nominal roll of participants must be compiled. That requires access to historical data, which was protected by the Epidemiological Studies (Confidentiality) Act 198 1. A Regulation made under that Act on 10 August 2000 will enable release of the relevant data to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs which will be coordinating the study. Arrangements are now being made for the transfer of this data to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (2) An independent scientific advisory committee will be appointed shortly. (3) Nil. (4) Estimates of the funding allocations have not been finalised. However, it is likely to involve at lest several hundred thousand dollars in the current fm*ancial year, and in the subsequent financial year. (5) The Department of Defence will contribute to the study through the Defence Department Appropriation. Judiciary: Overseas Service (Question No. 1796) (1) Which Australian judges and former judges have served as judges in overseas countries. (2) In what country and for what period has each judge served. (1) (i) I am advised by the High Court as follows: At the time of his swearing-in as a Justice of the High Court on 6 February 1996, Justice Michael Kirby was President of the Court of Appeal of the Solomon Islands. However, he did not sit as a member of the Solomon Islands Court of Appeal after being sworn-in as a Justice of the High Court and he resigned the appointment a few months later. The following former Chief Justices and Justices of the High Court were members of the Privy Council: Chief Justices Term of Office Sir Harry Gibbs 1981-87 Sir Garfield Barwick 1964-81 Sir Owen Dixon 1952-64 Sir John Latham 1935-52 Sir Frank Gavan Duffy 1931-35 Sir Isaac Isaacs 1930-31 Sir Adrian Knox 1919-30 Sir Samuel Griffith 1903-19 Justices Term of Office Sir Ninian Stephen 1972-82 Sir Harry Gibbs 1970-81 Sir Cyril Walsh 1969-73 Sir William Owen 1961-72",142,Questions On Notice

211,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Chief Justices Term of Office Sir William Windeyer 1958-72 Sir Douglas Menzies 1958-74 Sir Alan Taylor 1952-69 Sir Frank Kitto 1950-70 Sir Edward McTiernan 1930-76 Justice Herbert Evatt 1930-40 Sir Owen Dixon 1929-52 Sir George Rich 1913-50 Sir Frank Gavan Duffy 1913-31 Sir Isaac Isaacs 1906-30 Sir Edmund Barton 1903-20 Sir Garfield Barwick was also a Judge ad hoc with the International Court of Justice between 197374. Sir William Webb, a former Justice, was President of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East between 1946-48. I am also advised that several former Justices of the High Court have been appointed to overseas courts following their retirement from the Court. For example, Sir Anthony Mason, Sir Gerard Brennan and Sir Daryl Dawson were appointed to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal; Sir Harry Gibbs was appointed to the Court of Appeal of Kiribati and Sir Anthony Mason, Sir Gerard Brennan and the Honourable John Toohey were appointed to the Court of Appeal in Fiji. In addition, Sir Ninian Stephen was appointed to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. However, as records are not maintained of appointments held by retired judges after they retire, the foregoing information may not be complete. (ii) I am advised by the Federal Court that the following judges and former judges of the Federal Court hold, or held, commissions on overseas courts: Judges The Hon Justice Bryan Beaumont The Hon Justice Marcus Einfeld The Hon Justice John von Doussa The Hon Justice Peter Heerey Former Judges The Hon Robert St John The Hon Trevor Morling The Hon Justice James Burchett (iii) The Chief Justice of the Family Court has advised that he is of the belief that there have been no judges of the Family Court who have served as judges in overseas countries in the period since his appointment to the Court in 1988. (2) (i) I am advised by the High Court that: Justices of the High Court who were Members of the Privy Council sat in London. Sir William Webb sat in Tokyo as President of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Court records do not disclose when the members of the Privy Council sat in London nor when, or where, Sir Garfield Barwick sat as a Judge ad hoc of the International Court of Justice. (ii) I am advised that the following judges and former judges of the Federal Court, while judges of that Court, served as judges in the overseas countries and for such periods as indicated: Judges Name App’t Court Country Sitting Period The Hon Justice Bryan 1997Judge, Court of Appeal Tonga N/A Beaumont 1997Privy Councillor Tonga N/A 1993Acting Judge, Supreme Court Vanuatu6 wks The Hon Justice Marcus 1996Judge, Supreme Court Eastern N/A Einfeld Caribbean 1996Judge, High Court of Justice Dominica N/A The Hon Justice John von 1998Acting Judge, Supreme Court Vanuatu N/A Doussa Acting Judge, Supreme Court 1997Acting Judge, Supreme Court Vanuatu N/A 1993 Vanuatu6 wks The Hon Justice Peter 1992 Judge, Supreme Court Vanuatu4 wks Heerey Former Judges Name App’t Court Country Sitting Period The Hon Justice James 1994Privy Councillor Tonga N/A Burchett 1993Judge, Court of Appeal, Tonga N/A The Hon Trevor Morling 1992-93 Member, Court of Western2 wks Appeal Samoa 1992-93 Judge, Supreme Court Tonga2 wks 1991-92 Member, Court of Western N/A Appeal Samoa Member, Court of Vanuatu 1991-92 Appeal N/A Member, Court of Tonga 1991-92 Appeal N/A The Hon Justice Robert St 1980-82 Chief Justice, Supreme Court Western N/A John Samoa Roads: West Shepparton Bypass (Question No. 1805) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: Has the Government undertaken work on the cost of a West Shepparton by-pass or alternative road; if so, what is the nature of the work undertaken and the associated costings of the road work. The Federal Government’s planning contribution to date totals $4.9 million. The Victorian Government undertook a full and complete bypass study of Shepparton, which identified three possible alignments, the central, western and eastern route options. The Victorian Government is undertaking further planning work on the western route option. The Federal Government is waiting for details as to why this is necessary.",143,Questions On Notice

Defence: Bulimba Base (Question No. 1814) Mr Bevis asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) Are contractors and their employees permitted to obtain meals from the Army personnel canteen at the Bulimba base in Brisbane. (2) Were the costs for these meals previously the same to all permitted to purchase there. (3) Who made the recent decision that meals charged to Army personnel and public servants at the Bulimba base in Brisbane would cost $3.40, while those charged to other workers at the base would cost $7.40. (4) When and why was the decision made. (5) Is it a nationwide decision or peculiar to the Bulimba base. (6) How are prices determined. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. Defence contractors (meaning their employees) are permitted to purchase meals from Service Messes at Bulimba base. (2) No. Prior to 3 July 2000 there were different rates for Australian Defence Force personnel, civilians and contractors. (3) The Department of Defence. The rate of $3.40 applies to dinner at an Other Ranks mess. The equivalent rate for non-Defence personnel is $13.75. (4) The decision to extend the subsidised meal rates to civilian employees was made in the context of negotiations for the new certified agreement covering civilian employees of the Department of Defence. The agreement was certified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 3 July 2000, and the new rates for civilian employees took effect from that date. Civilian contractors’ employees continue to be charged the full cost of all meals. (5) Yes. The practice is nationwide. (6) The casual meal rates for Australian Defence Force members were set in 1977 at 85 per cent of the daily rations and quarters charge for other ranks, with an increased rate where steward service is provided for senior non-commissioned officers and officers. The meal rates have been adjusted periodically in line with movement in the food component of Consumer Price Index. The non-Defence rates are based on the actual cost of providing meals in messes. The non-Defence rates include labour, utility and other overhead costs in addition to the ration costs. Both sets of rates have been adjusted for the abolition of Wholesales Sales Tax and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. Health: Cervical Cancer (Question No. 1816) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) What are the methods available to detect cervical cancer. (2) Is there a method available which is 100% accurate in detecting cervical cancer; if so, what is the method; if not, what is the most accurate method for detecting cervical cancer and what percentage accuracy does the method have. (3) Has his attention been drawn to a pamphlet distributed by the Pap Smear Register which says pap smears are no longer the most effective method of detecting cervical cancer. (4) Has his attention been drawn to an adjunctive test known as ThinPrep Pap Test. (5) Is ThinPrep Pap Test listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule; if not, why not. (1) Australia’s cervical cancer prevention strategy is based on screening using the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test to detect precancerous abnormalities and allow treatment before any malignant changes occur. Over recent years, a number of new automated and semi-automated devices have been introduced. There is currently no sound evidence to suggest replacement of the Pap smear test by any other test. The national screening policy has been agreed by all Australian Health Ministers. The policy is kept under review and there is a National Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of all States and Territories and professional experts to advise the Government on policy issues. (2) No. The Pap smear test is a screening test, not a diagnostic test. All screening tests have inherent false positive and false negative rates. Definitive diagnosis of a lesion must be made by histological examination of tissue from the cervix obtained by biopsy. The Government’s strategy for screening of cervical cancer is aimed at encouraging two-yearly Pap smear testing, and increasing participation in the screening program. This approach has reduced the incidence of mortality from cervical cancer by around 40% over the last decade and it is anticipated that mortality rates will continue to decrease. Currently, it is estimated that regular two-yearly Pap smear screening detects approximately 90 per cent of squamous cell cancers of the cervix in the screened population. (3) No such pamphlet has been distributed through the New South Wales Pap Smear Register although the Department of Health and Aged Care is aware of a promotional pamphlet endorsing the ThinPrep test, in addition to a Pap smear test. This pamphlet has been distributed by a private pathology practice in New South Wales to clients scheduled for a repeat Pap smear test. The promotional material is also available to the public on request. (4) Yes. (5) No. The manufacturers of ThinPrep have not applied for Medicare funding. The ThinPrep test is also not endorsed under the National Cervical Screening protocol. This decision is based on advice from the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee (AHTAC) that the conventional Pap smear test remains the most cost effective screening test for preventing cervical cancer by the detection of its precursors. Medical organisations or companies marketing diagnostic tests must apply to the Commonwealth Government for listing of such tests on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). This is done through the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), which provides advice to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on the strength of the evidence relating to safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of new and existing medical procedures and technologies, and under what circumstances public funding should be supported. To date MSAC has not received an application for ThinPrep listing. Department of Health and Aged Care: Salary and Staffing Levels (Question No. 1832) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 16 August 2000: In 1999–2000 in the Minister’s Department, what was the (a) average salary paid in each Australian Public Service salary band and (b) average staffing levels (average number of employees) for each band.

(2) Has an added administrative burden been placed on general practitioners and other health care professionals; if so, does this extra administrative burden result in health professionals paying the Government GST and then claiming it back and actually delivering zero revenue to the Treasury.",147,Questions On Notice
215,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Did the Government promise to make small business operations easier; if so, will it heed the Australian Medical Association’s repeated calls to make the GST compliance administration simpler for health care professionals; if not, why not. (1) In line with the Government’s policy outlined in A New Tax System, most health services are GST-free. (2) No. (3) Tax reform has provided a range of benefits to small business including lower business costs and simpler reporting and payment arrangements. Making taxable services provided by medical practitioners to other registered businesses GST-free would not significantly reduce the compliance costs of medical practitioners, but would increase the compliance costs of hospitals and other medical centres that contract medical practitioners to provide services to their patients. This is because these entities would be required to differentiate between their GST-free acquisitions (from medical practitioners) and taxable acquisitions when preparing their GST return. Human Rights: Former Heads of State (Question No. 1841) Dr Theophanous asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 16 August 2000: (1) Is he able to say what are the implications of the House of Lords’ decision in relation to the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, with respect to the international pursuit of those who have indulged in political murder, torture and gross violation of human rights. (2) Is he able to say whether a precedent has been set which can be applied to other leaders who abuse their powers in the way Mr Pinochet is alleged to have done. (3) Is he also able to say whether Governments and human rights organisations around the world will be able to pursue leaders who abuse their power in the future. (4) What are the implications of the decision for alleged war criminals other than those in leadership positions such as Mr Konrad Kalejs. (1) The decision of the House of Lords in the matter of Spain’s request for the extradition of Senator Augusto Pinochet (see [1999] 2 W.L.R 827) is a significant development in the jurisprudence of national courts on the immunity of former Heads of State covering official acts undertaken while a serving Head of State. This is a jurisdictional immunity which is a bar to proceedings before the courts of other States in relation to such acts. The House of Lords was called on, in dealing with the issue of double criminality for the purposes of Spain’s extradition request, to address the question of whether Senator Pinochet had immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom in relation to acts of torture for which he was alleged to have had responsibility while serving as Chile’s Head of State. As the crimes allegedly committed by Senator Pinochet came within the scope of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (to which Chile, Spain and the United Kingdom were parties), the House of Lords analysed the Convention to establish whether it affected the immunity which he enjoyed as a former Head of State. As the Convention dealt with torture committed with the involvement of “public officials”, the majority came to the view that the negotiating States could not have intended that officials could plead immunity in relation to official acts as a bar to being tried by the courts of States Parties. This would have frustrated the implementation of the Convention, which relied on prosecutions in the courts of States Parties. Accordingly, the House of Lords found Senator Pinochet could not have recourse to immunity as to official acts and was liable to the criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom in relation to the crime of torture.",148,Attorney General S Department
216,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,149,Attorney General S Department
217,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The implications of the decision of the House of Lords for other States will emerge over time. While the decision is not binding on the courts of other States, the standing of the House of Lords will ensure it is a persuasive authority. (2) As noted in the answer to (1), the decision of the House of Lords does not create a precedent which is binding on the courts of other States. (3) The capacity of the international community to deal with persons who commit international crimes, whatever position they occupy, will be greatly enhanced by the International Criminal Court. The establishment of the Court has been a major multilateral and human rights objective of the Government. The Court will have jurisdiction in relation to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes (committed in international or internal armed conflicts) and aggression. The Court will only have jurisdiction over crimes which are committed after the entry into force of its Statute. The Statute makes clear that the Court is intended to be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions. It will operate where a national jurisdiction is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution of persons alleged to have committed crimes. Critically, it will be the Court which determines whether a national jurisdiction is unwilling or unable to deal genuinely with alleged crimes by way of investigation or prosecution. Article 27(1) of the Statute provides that the Statute applies “equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity”. Article 27(2) further provides that: “Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.” Article 27 reflects the long-settled position that an international tribunal may deal with a person whatever their official capacity who is alleged to have committed international crimes. (4) The decision has no implications for alleged war criminals other than those in leadership positions. Family Court: Tasmania (Question No. 1853) Ms O’Byrne asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 August 2000: (1) How many family law court matters are (a) waiting to be listed for prehearing conferences, (b) listed for prehearing conferences and (c) listed for trial in (i) northern and (ii) southern Tasmania. (2) When will the appointment of a Federal Magistrate in Launceston be made. (3) What proportion of the Launceston magistracy program will be exclusively allocated to family law matters. (1) I am advised by the Family Court that the following family law matters are (a) waiting to be listed for prehearing conferences, (b) listed for pre hearing conferences and (c) listed for trial in (i) northern and (ii) southern Tasmania, as at 31 August 2000: (a)(i) 97 (ii) 74 (b)(i) 5 (ii) 5 (c) (i) 24 (ii) 32 (2) The appointment of a Federal Magistrate in Launceston is expected to be announced shortly. (3) The Federal Magistrate who is to be located in Launceston will exercise all of the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. No restriction on the proportion of time that the Magistrate can spend on particular types of matters is planned. The proportion of time spent on different kinds of matters will",149,Attorney General S Department
218,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:depend on the type of matters filed with the Service. However, it is anticipated that a significant proportion of the Launceston Magistrate’s time will be spent on family law matters. Iraqi Kurdistan: Human Rights (Question No. 1886) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 30 August 2000: (1) Has the Australian Government’s attention been drawn to (a) gender discriminatory provisions of Iraqi family law and of the civil code still operative in Iraqi Kurdistan, (b) the forced closure of the Independent Women’s Organisation Office and Shelter in Suleimania on 21 October, (c) the murder of an estimated 500 women in the area controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, due to concepts of honour killings on behalf of family and males, and (d) the murder of Nasrin Aziz Rashid by male relatives after she was deprived of the Shelter’s support; if not will his department investigate these matters. (2) What measures does Australia undertake to ensure that a degree of UN assistance is conveyed to non-Government organisations in Iraqi Kurdistan, particularly those facilitating womens rights. (3) Will Australia intervene to seek assurances as to the protection of Kazhal Kider, Surma Rasool Mina, Layla Ismail, Niyan Ali Ahmad, Asmer Abdulla, Shoghan Salih, Bayan, Chiman, Zamman, Badria Rasool, Basos Abdulla and their children as attested, since they are now deprived of the Shelter’s valued protection. (1)(a) The Government is aware that there are gender discriminatory provisions in the laws covering the Iraqi Kurdistan region. However, a law was passed earlier this year by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) outlawing honour killings. In particular, the law suspended the article of the criminal code which allowed for lesser penalties in respect of honour killings. Previously, “extenuating circumstances” could lead to a significant reduction in the sentence of someone found guilty of an honour killing. It remains to be seen whether this law will be enforceable. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) which controls the non-PUK autonomous region has not passed a similar decree. (b) The Government is aware that the Shelter run by the Independent Women’s Organisation (IWO) was closed down by the PUK on 21 July. There are conflicting reports concerning the circumstances surrounding the closure and it has been impossible to confirm details beyond the closure itself. (c) The Government is also aware of and strongly condemns the practice of honour killings but cannot confirm reports that as many as 500 women have been murdered in this way. (d) The Government is aware there have been reports of the murder of Nasrin Aziz Rashid but to date these reports remain unconfirmed. (2) While the UN is involved in Iraqi Kurdistan to the extent that it provides humanitarian assistance and administers the oil-for-food program, the area is not under UN supervision. (3) Despite making extensive inquiries the Government has been unable to find out any information about these women and children. The absence of a single controlling body in the region and of an Australian mission poses significant challenges in terms of verifying these reports. Family Law: Federal Magistrates Service (Question No. 1888) Mr Andren asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 30 August 2000: (1) Given that the Government’s stated desire to provide a faster, more efficient and cheaper family law service to litigants, why was it considered preferable to create a completely new court, the Federal Magistrates Service, rather than expand the role of local courts in each State by appointing specialist magistrates and increasing delegated powers. (2) Did the Government consider this option; if not, why not.",150,Attorney General S Department
219,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Will the Government continue diverting funds from the Family Court of Australia to the Federal Magistrates Service, even if this jeopardises the existence of Family Court sub-registries in regional areas. (4) Will the Government ensure that where Family Court sub-registries are closed in regional areas, those communities will not be left without a service; if so, how will this be achieved. (5) What guarantee can the Government give that there will be no reduction in family law services available to people in regional Australia during the transition of service provision responsibilities from the Family Court to the Federal Magistrates Service. (6) Is it the Government’s intention to abolish the Family Court of Australia, eventually shifting all family law responsibilities to the Federal Magistrates Service; if so, what is the proposed time frame; if not, what are the Government’s long term plans for the Court. (7) Is the Government aware that funding cuts to the Family Court have already led to substantial reductions in counselling and mediation services available in some regional areas; if not, what is the Government’s assessment of the current availability of Primary Dispute Resolution Services in regional areas such as the Central West of NSW. (8) Is the intention of the Government to outsource the Family Court Counselling Service to community agencies; if so, (a) what is the expected time frame for the outsourcing, (b) what are the expected savings to the Government if the Family Court Counselling Service is outsourced and how has this figure been determined, and (c) what will be the criteria for accrediting community agencies to carry out the work previously done by the Family Court Counselling Service. (9) If the Counselling Service is outsourced, (a) how will the Government ensure the services it currently provides are maintained and (b) is it the Government’s intention to ensure that the ‘best interests of the child principle’ remains a priority for community agencies following outsourcing; if so, how will this commitment be achieved. (1) The Government considered and rejected the alternative of expanding the family law jurisdiction of State magistrates. The Government believed that giving additional jurisdiction to existing State magistrates would be a more expensive option than establishing the Federal Magistrates Service, with complex agreements needed with each State and Territory and additional costs involved in training State magistrates who would not necessarily have been appointed on the basis of their experience with federal law. Although the Federal Magistrates Service has been established as a separate court, as far as possible it is using existing infrastructure in administration, personnel services, building and other non-judicial resources. So there has been no need to establish independent facilities and infrastructure where administrative support and other services can be provided by existing courts or other agencies. (2) See response to question (1). (3) It was always intended that some resources would be moved from both the Family Court and the Federal Court to the Federal Magistrates Service as the Service will be doing work that would otherwise be undertaken by the existing courts. The amount transferred from the Family Court includes some resources associated with Registrars appointed by the Family Court as an interim measure, pending establishment of Federal Magistrates Service. While some of the funding for those positions has been transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service, the Family Court has retained some positions. The Court has advised that it will maintain existing services wherever possible, particularly in rural and regional areas. (4) Both the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service are self-administering agencies and decisions about the provision of services are for those agencies, not the Government. In making such decisions the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service will be guided by their knowledge of the workload needs in regional areas. Subject to workload considerations, the Chief Federal Magistrate",151,Attorney General S Department
220,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:may consider it appropriate for a magistrate to peform his or her duties at a regional location on a temporary basis or may consider it appropriate to assign a magistrate to a particular location. As mentioned in (3) the Family Court has advised that it will maintain services in rural and regional areas wherever possible. The Government understands that the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service is liaising closely to ensure that the services provided by each of them cover the needs of regional communities in family law matters. (5) As referred to in the response to question (4), the Federal Magistrates Service and the Family Court have been consulting as to the best method of providing services to regional areas to ensure that the services provided by each of them cover regional needs. (6) The Government is not considering any proposal to abolish the Family Court and shift all family law responsibilities to the Federal Magistrates Service. The Government believes that the Federal Magistrates Service will provide a cheaper and more efficient service for less complex family law matters freeing up Family Court judges to deal with more complex matters. This will not only ease delays in the Family Court, it will be a more effective use of judges in the Family Court. (7) The reduction in the Family Court’s resources reflects funds transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service and savings from the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. The Family Court is a self-administering agency where decisions about the management of financial administration and the provision of services rest with the Court, not the Government. How the Family Court reduces its spending is a matter for the Court. In its ‘Future Directions’ Report July 2000, the Court states that in the 1999/2000 financial year it adopted a Resource Planning Model as the basis for allocating resources throughout the Court. It reexamined the potential for providing services in partnership with community organisations, particularly in the area of voluntary counselling and mediation services. As mentioned in (3) the Family Court has advised that it will maintain services in rural and regional areas wherever possible. The Dubbo sub-registry of the Family Court in the central west of NSW has two full time counselling positions. There are no plans to reduce these counselling positions. Counsellors from Dubbo currently provide visiting services to the Local Court at Orange and Parkes as well as a limited service to Bourke, Brewarrina and Lightning Ridge. The Court proposes some changes to the current circuit arrangements but they will not be finalised until the Court has consulted with residents and community agencies. These consultations are scheduled to take place during October. Primary dispute resolution services in family law are also currently available from: Family Life Movement at Orange and Dubbo; NSW Legal Aid Commission office at Orange; Community Legal Service at Dubbo; and the NSW Department of Community Services has an office at Orange. (8) The Government’s objective is to improve and increase access to Primary Dispute Resolution services across the community. It provides some direct funding to community organisations through the Family Relationship Services Program. The Family Court has decided to reduce its provision of counselling services in consultation with community organisations. The Government will continue to work with the Family Court and community agencies to develop a comprehensive approach to provision of primary dispute resolution services. (9)(a) The Government currently provides funding for community organisations to provide Primary Dispute Resolution services through the Family Relationships Services Program. The Government’s commitment to facilitating the use of Primary Dispute Resolution as a viable alternative to litigation will be maintained, whatever the outcome of the changes to the Family Court Counselling Service in the longer term. (b) The 1996 amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 were made to ensure that the best interests of children were adequately addressed in Family Law. This means that, under the Family Law Act, children must be taken into account in decisions about parents’ relationship difficulties, relationship breakdown and divorce. The amendments to the Act attempt to ensure that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and to ensure that parents fulfil their duties and meet their responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children. These principles are upheld by the Act, and will continue to be upheld by the Government. Family and child counsellors and family and child mediators, funded through the Family Relationships Services Program, are approved under the Act, and are required to comply with the intentions of the Act. The Government has commissioned research to identify strategies that would promote the best interests of children during their parents’ relationship difficulties, separation or divorce, and to consider the 1996 amendments to the Act. In 1998 a report entitled “Child Inclusive Practice in Family and Child Counselling and Family and Child Mediation” was released, which recommended that a training strategy in child-inclusive practice be developed and made available to the wider field of service providers. The Government has funded drafting and circulation of an information package to all Family Relationship Services Program organisations, and the conduct of 5 good practice forums for representatives of counselling, mediation, contact services and adolescent mediation and family therapy services. These forums aimed to enhance awareness and understanding of child-inclusive practice approaches in the sector, and expand networks and enable organisations to identify people with expertise and skills in this area. The forums will be used to promote continuous improvement in childinclusive practice within the sector. Australian Defence Force: Personnel Re-Enlistment (Question No. 1896) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 31 August 2000: How many personnel who first enlisted in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) prior to May 1985 are estimated to have re-enlisted in the ADF since August 1991. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Navy 184 Air Force 193 Army 162 Total 539 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders: Welfare Dependency (Question No. 1902) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 31 August 2000: What support is the Federal Government giving to the Cape York partnerships Project initiated by Mr Noel Pearson and supported by the Queensland Government. the following information to the honourable member’s question: Since we came to office, this government has been concerned about the negative aspects of welfare dependency within both the indigenous and non-indigenous communities. Indigenous community leaders, particularly Mr Pearson, are openly acknowledging the problem of welfare dependency and the associated problems of alcohol abuse and family violence. Indigenous people themselves have stressed that they can and want to find solutions and want to take action with the active support of government. The Department of Family and Community Services (DFaCS) has been talking directly with Mr Pearson about his proposals. Following a recent meeting in Canberra between Mr Pearson and a range of Commonwealth agencies, Mr Pearson presented DFaCS with a proposal for community capacity building initiatives, including family income management trials. DFaCS are currently in the process of gauging the extent of community support for Mr Pearson’s proposals within Cape York. The Prime Minister has asked Senator Newman and me to convene a roundtable that will bring together senior indigenous community leaders and representatives from church, government and industry groups to discuss how government can better support indigenous communities and families.",152,Attorney General S Department
221,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has providedThe roundtable will consider a range of approaches, including Mr Pearson’s proposals. The roundtable will create an opportunity to consider a national perspective on issues affecting indigenous people (including welfare dependency) and will draw from new and innovative approaches being discussed around the country. Education: British Education Action Zones (Question No. 1917) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 4 September 2000: Is he aware of evaluation reports concerning the performance of Education Action Zones in Britain; if so, what do these reports show, particularly regarding the impact on school grades. I am aware of the establishment on Education Action Zones (EAZs) in Britain and of recent reports and press releases. One of new Labour’s favourite think-tanks, the Institute of Public Policy Research, has criticised EAZs as little more than test beds for the latest ideas from central government. Researchers have said that, rather than successful experimentation in zones leading to a widening of the principle of local autonomy and variation, the concern is it will simply provide new ammunition for ‘tyranny of best practice’ with successful strategies being imposed on all sectors. Private Health Insurance: Rebate (Question No. 1924) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 4 September 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to research findings from the health economics unit at Monash University showing that (a) the cost of the 30% private health rebate has blown out to $2.8 billion per annum and (b) the rebate will yield savings to public hospitals of no more than $1.4 billion per annum. (2) Has his Department undertaken a similar analysis; if so, what are the details. (3 ) Is a 2: 1 cost/benefit outcome seen as a satisfactory use of health outlays. (1) Yes, I am aware of the matter to which Mr Latham refers. (2) The cost of the 30% Rebate for 2000-01 as estimated in the Budget papers was $1.88 billion. Obviously, given the overwhelming success of Lifetime Health Cover, we will need to increase this estimate somewhat in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook at the end of the year. (3) Claims that the Rebate spends $2 to save $1 from the public hospital system represent a gross misrepresentation. These figures ignore the savings the Rebate creates for the public hospital system. The Rebate means that there will be a sustainable private hospital system, which will provide choice and high quality health care. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1925) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 September 2000: (1) In relation to the Commonwealth Acting Director of Public Prosecutions’ (DPP) decision to decline to proceed with charges of defrauding the Commonwealth pursuant to section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) against the former Senator, Mr Malcolm Arthur Colston, was this a matter in which the Acting Director had declined to proceed ‘after commitment’ for the purposes of the Prosecution Policy. (2) In reference to the DPP Media Statement dated 5 July 1999 titled ‘Prosecution of Mr Malcolm Colston’, what weight did the DPP put upon the following factors in declining to proceed; (a) ‘health of the alleged offender’ and (b) ‘seriousness of the alleged offences’.",154,Attorney General S Department
222,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,155,Attorney General S Department
223,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Was the DPP asserting that irrespective of Mr Colston’s health the matter is insufficiently serious to warrant the continuation of proceedings. (4) Is he able to say which of the following consideration(s) under the Prosecution Policy were considered by the DPP when making the decision not to proceed with the prosecution: (a) the ‘interests of the suspected offender’ (paragraph 2.2), (b) the ‘interests of the community at large’ (paragraph 2.2), (c) ‘fairness and consistency’ (paragraph 2.3), (d) the ‘sufficiency of evidence’ (paragraph 2.5), (e) the ‘presupposition of the impartiality of the jury’, particularly as it relates to Mr Colston’s illness and (f) that there was ‘no reasonable prospect of a conviction being secured’ (paragraph 2.5). (5) What public interest criteria were satisfied in commencing proceedings against Mr Colston. (6) What public interest criteria under the Prosecution Policy (paragraph 2.10) were satisfied in declining to proceed with prosecution. (7) To what extent was the ‘necesssity to maintain public confidence in such basic institutions as the Parliament and the courts’ (Prosecution Policy subparagraph 2.10(t) a paramount consideration in declining to proceed with prosecution. (8) Are there any alternative enforcement mechanisms available to the DPP in respect to possible action against Mr Colston; if so, what are they. (9) Are there any alternative enforcement mechanisms which could be considered in substitution to criminal proceedings against Mr Colston; if so, when will these alternative enforcement mechanisms be applied. (10) Would the DPP consider obtaining a further medical examination in order to ascertain Mr Colston’s current fitness to stand trial. (11) Will the DPP or another relevant agency consider new evidence (Prosecution Policy paragraph 5.22) as to the health of Mr Colston. (12) Was the decision not to proceed with prosecution made under the DPP’s power pursuant to subsection 9(4) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act (Cth); if not, then under what power was the decision made. (13) When did (a) Mr Colston raise the issue of his health in respect of the proceedings against him, (b) the DPP commence investigations into the case of Mr Colston, (c) the DPP file and serve summon(es) on Mr Colston, (d) Mr Colston’s committal proceedings commence, (e) Mr Colston’s legal counsel file evidence of his medical condition, (f) Mr Colston’s hearing take place and (g) the DPP decline to take further proceedings. (14) In relation to the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board’s Best Practice for Fraud Control– Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth, is it in the public interest to establish the current state of health of Mr Colston. (1) Yes. (2) The DPP considered (a) and (b). The determining factor was the independent medical assessment that Mr Colston was unfit to stand trial and that there was no prospect that he would be fit to stand trial in the future. (3) No. (4) With reference to the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth, the DPP considered that there was a prima facie case with reasonable prospects of conviction and that, apart from the medical assessments and fitness to stand trial, it would have been in the public interest for the matter to proceed. (5) See 4. (6) See 4. (7) It was of major importance. (8) No.",155,Attorney General S Department
224,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) No. (10) The DPP’s decision was based on independent expert medical advice that Mr Colston was not fit to stand trial and there was no prospect that he would be fit to stand trial in the future. If there was evidence contrary to that advice it would be considered. (11) See 10. (12) Yes. (13) (a) 3 November 1997. (b) The DPP does not investigate criminal offences. This is the responsibility of the AFP. (c) The AFP informant commenced the prosecution on 14 July 1997. (d) 18 May 1998. (e) The DPP was provided with medical reports by Mr Colston’s solicitors on 3 and 12 November 1997 and on 7 April 1999. (f) See (d). (g) 5 July 1999. (14) The Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth provides that prosecution and related decisions are a matter for the DPP to determine in accordance with the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. The Fraud Control Policy does not provide any additional public interest grounds for decisions made by agencies, including the DPP, on matters relating to fraud prosecutions. Education: Funding for Non-government Schools (Question No. 1955) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 7 September 2000: How much Federal Government funding is allocated to each Catholic school in the electoral division of Werriwa. The Commonwealth currently provides $2,428 per primary student and $3,544 per secondary student to the New South Wales Catholic Education Commission. While the grants are paid to the Commission on a per capita basis, the Commission allocates funds between schools on the basis of relative need as assessed by the Commission. Based on final 2000 enrolments and current per student grant levels, it is estimated that the Commonwealth will pay over $545 million to the NSW Catholic Education Commission under the General Recurrent Grants Programme in 2000. Funding tables for individual Catholic schools in the Werriwa Electorate are attached.

Medicare: Bulk-Billing (Question No. 827) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: For each year since 1995-96, how many doctors bulk billed (a) Australia wide, (b) in each State and Territory, and (c) in the electoral Division of Batman. Details of the number of doctors who bulk billed (a) Australia wide, (b) in each State and Territory, and (c) in the electoral Division of Batman in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 are as follows: Region 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 New South Wales 11,536 11,659 12,641 Victoria 8,452 8,453 9,134 Queensland 5,572 5,695 6,339 South Australia 2,893 2,878 3,078 Western Australia 2,868 2,842 3,057 Tasmania 768 774 841 Northern Territory 274 276 310 Australian Capital Territory 550 553 603 Total 32,913 33,130 36,003 Batman 246 218 220 The above statistics relate to medical practitioners who rendered at least one bulk billed service in the period in question. To the extent that some practitioners have more than one active provider number, there will be some multiple counting of practitioners. In compiling the statistics, each practitioner was assigned to his/her principal practice postcode in the respective periods, having regard to service volumes. Since some postcodes overlap federal electoral division boundaries, in compiling statistics for the federal electoral division of Batman, the requested data by major postcode of practitioner were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population in each postcode in each federal electoral division. Caution needs to be exercised in interpreting bulk billing statistics by State and Territory and by federal electoral division. Since the data relate to providers of at least one bulk billed service for which Medicare benefits were paid, and there are a large number of relatively low activity providers under",157,Attorney General S Department
