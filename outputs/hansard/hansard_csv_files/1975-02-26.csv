...................................812 Wednesday, 26 February 1975 chair at 10 a.m. (Quorum formed) presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows:Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the existing grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irretrievable break-down, which remove any consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because:(a) it imposes on society a radical alteration of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to 'drift' into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing instituuonalisation of children with consequential delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the 'in-lighting' in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. 2. Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community requirements, secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable background, and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will make provision accordingly. by Mr Stewart and Mr Keogh. Petitions received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble difficulties for the sake of the chief victims of divorcepetition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully children, and showeth: That marriage is an exclusive lifelong partnership between provisionsone woman and one man, which should not be dissolved at the will of one party after 12 months notice nor without a repeated attempts atreconciliationrather than by an arbireasonable attempt at reconciliation and That a husband should normally be responsible for maintaining his wife and children within marriage. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended. (1) To require a reasonable attempt at reconciliation with the aid of counselling at least twelve months prior to the application for a divorce; (2) To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour, (b) desertion for at least 2 years, (c) separation for at least 3 years; And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Giles, Mr Jarman, Mr Luchetti, Mr Ruddock and Mr Wallis. Petitions received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth: (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Family Law Bill at present before Parliament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve months' separation, embodied in the Family Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. '' (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given judges in the present legislation and that the non fault maintenance concept (according to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54(2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray members of the House will restore this concept fully by deleting Clause 75 (n) from the new Bill 'as read a third time'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hurford. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat (A) under the provisions of the Family Law Bill(1) Twelve months separation is too shon; (2) Marriage rights are denied to the party divorced against his or her will, (3) No encouragement is given to parties to retackle (B) the Bill ought to be amended to include the following (1) Irretrievable Breakdown be judged by failure of trary period of separation; (2) Marriagerightsof the party divorced against his or her will be protected by:(a) Compulsory counselling-particularl y where children are involved,",10,Setup

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Family Law Bill 1974 would be an unjust law if passed since the innocent party could be divorced against his or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facilitate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect public opinion, not attempt to condition it. Gallup polls indicate 75 per cent of Australians are opposed to the concepts of the Family Law Bill. Therefore Parliament has no mandate from the people to ask such a farreachingchange in the nature of our society.

6,Mr Lynchi Ask The Prime Minister: Have,"Leader of the Opposition is: No; yes; in accordance with statute. tion been drawn to the recent announcement that inflation in the United States of America is currently running at 14.8 per cent? Is it also a fact the unemployment in the United States is running at8.2 per cent? Is it a fact that President Ford has now reversed his economic policies and is. now advocating measures similar to those commenced by this Government 4 months ago? In view of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is the only man in the world who has an answer to the twin economic ills of the worldinflation and unemployment-wil l the Prime Minister lend him to the Americans for a while? to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question. The last time that the Leader of the Opposition visited the United States he got very short shrift indeed. It is true that the figures for inflation and unemployment in the United States are more serious than is the case in Australia. It just accords with the situation which I have stated for sometimenow, that the twin problems of unemployment and inflation are besetting every country which is like Australia; that is, every industrialised trading country in the world-al l of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries-ar e afflicted in the same way. Opposition is enjoying his brief moment of glory and constantly interjects. Mr LynchI do not carry on like the archangel Gabriel either. analogy, he burbles like Beelzebub. The inflationary situation is serious in all of the countries of the OECD. It is serious not only in the United States but also in Canada, Britain, Italy and the rest of the OECD countries. The unemployment position is serious in all of those countries as well. reports in the West Australian media on this subOur unemployment situation is exceeded on a percentage basis by Canada, the United States, Italy, Denmark and Ireland, and it is equalled by West Germany. There is no particular comfort in recognising this situation, but there is no point whatever in seeking to conceal it or to confuse it. The fact is that all that part of the world which resembles Australia is in an extraordinarily difficult economic situation. North America, Western Europe and Japan all have these twin problems at the same time. At least it ought to be acknowledged that in Australia the general standard of living has improved and the incomes that people receive have risen more than have prices, even accounting for taxation. and Energy: Is it true that a very senior officer of his Department was invited to deliver a paper to the Fifth International Symposium on Energy Resources and Environment held in Kuala Lumpur last week? Did that officer refuse to deliver a paper? If so, why? Further, why was no officer of his Department present at that conference and symposium at which the world's leading experts on energy resources and the environment gave the benefit of their knowledge? Does this indicate that the Minister and his Department believe that their fund of knowledge in this area is complete? We are rather short of staff. Opposition members-Ha, ha! had its horse laugh the rest is this: If we had a little co-operation from the Opposition in terms of the application of our policy on which we were elected as a government, I might be able to spare staff for such a purpose. On the other hand, I do take a rather dim view attimesof people being sent along to gabfests and on junkets. the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the incomplete reports in Western Australia of the Government's intention to continue with social service benefits as planned? Will the Prime Minister further clarify that situation? Can he give an assurance that the proposed program for stage 2 of the abolition of the means test will proceed as planned next April? ject. The Minister for Social Security and I made it abundantly plain last week that there would be the usual increases in social service payments and the due reduction in the age limit for the means test this session.

17,Mr Whitlami Have Not Followed The,"BEEF INDUSTRY the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory. What steps has the Government taken in the past week or what steps does the Government propose to take in the near future to assist the beef industry? Does the Government welcome the Queensland Government's action in providing $10m to the beef industry at 2V4 per cent interest? In view of the fact that the Queensland Government is itself short of funds, does the Minister believe that the Australian Government should immediately take action to expand the provision of long term, low interest funds? Will the Government suspend the meat export levy which the Minister introduced into this Parliament, increase the availabUity offinancefor reconstruction in the industry and double the income tax averaging limit? With regard to the last three matters, is the Minister aware that 4 months ago the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, which the Minister is so fond of quoting, suggested such a course of action? the Queensland Premier announced a $10m cattle industry assistance scheme. But, of course, he did not tell us all the facts. It was announced in such a way as to imply that every cattleman in Queensland who wanted this money would be eligible for it. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, there are veryrigorousconditions attaching to the scheme that are going to preclude most of the cattlemen in Queensland from benefiting from it. Although loans are to be at 2 per cent, the proposal is really an adjunct to the rural reconstruction scheme and there is still plenty of money available in the rural reconstruction scheme for the cattle industry. The terms and conditions of the Queensland scheme are that it is to be administered through the Rural Reconstruction Board along the lines of the earlier wool growers assistance scheme. An eligible applicant must first have approached the Development Bank and been refused. The loan is for carry-on requirements, including local authority rates, stock assessment fees, land rents and similar commitments, plus debt reconstruction. But the point is that a person has to go to the Development Bank first and be refused. That is what is written down here. Those are the terms and conditions of the Queensland Government's scheme. Until a person goes to the Development Bank he cannot get this money. (Opposition members interjecting)member for Darling Downs. Speaker. I did not speak at all.

Speaker. day, that the Australian National Cattlemen's Council applied to the Australian Government in writing for a loan at commercial rates of interest. In its most recent letter it said that it is not critical of the Government's decision. This is not the case with the Opposition. The fact of the matter is that the money that has been provided by the Queensland Premier is not available to the cattle industry unless the cattlemen have gone first to the Development Bank and been refused funds available from Federal sources. The point is this: It is simply a trick which is going to preclude most of the cattlemen in Queensland. the Minister for Agriculture seen a report in this morning's 'Australian Financial Review' that the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party has said that the Australian National Cattlemen's Council is not acting politically enough?

Under the War Memorial Act the Government has the responsibility of appointing persons to the War Memorial. It is some months ago and I might not have a precise recollection of the circumstances, but I believe there were 2 members of the Board whose terms had expired.

It is one of the many Justice Starke, a returned soldier and a member of the Victorian Supreme Court. We wanted to preserve the continuity there. We appointed to the vacancy caused by the expiry of"" Mr Gullett's term a gentleman who had had considerable experience at a later period. He had not only covered as a war correspondent the hostilities in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam but he had also held senior rank. He was commanding officer of a battalion in the Citizen Military Forces and furthermore he had particular skills in many of the fields where it is not generally realised the Australian War Memorial is one of our principal institutions. It is an institution which is a considerable publisher, has a considerable art gallery and has a considerable archives repository. This gentleman has skills in the to denigrate the efforts of Queensland cattlemen whole field of the' media and he had experience in the Citizen Military Forces.

I am aware of the report by the Australian Consumers Association and the fact that the Association conmotions moved rationally and sensibly by one of siders that a large number of products presently on the market dealing with baby nappy disinfectants are next to useless or in some cases possibly even harmful. I am told that at present the Aus-. tralian' Government Analyst is conducting research into the problem at the request of the Trade Practices Commission. He is investigating the claims of the manufacture of these goods. The Trade Practices Act, as honourable members would know, prohibits a corporation from engaging in trade or commerce or any conduct that is misleading or deceptive. The Trade Practices Act also prohibits the making of false representations about the uses or benefits that achievements of this Government that we now have legislation of this sort. I understand that the Trade Practices Commission is currently investigating this matter with a view to considering possible prosecution or injunction proceedings relating to the supply of the goods. The product may well be a proper subject for consideration in relation to the product safety standard provided by the Trade Practices Act. I am having that aspect of the matter investigated.

Unfortunately that misrepresentation was picked up and commented upon in the editorial of this morning's 'Sydney Morning Herald'. I was again misrepresented in that newspaper, although I forgive the 'Sydney Morning Herald' for it. It is the deliberate policy of the Prime Minister to take words and misuse them. The Prime Minister alleged that I would destroy the national health scheme, the national compensation scheme and the national superannuation scheme. On page 630 of yesterday's Hansard the Prime Minister said: The Leader of the Opposition says that he would destroy the Prices Justification Tribunal, Medibank, the national compensation scheme and the national superannuation scheme. It istimethat the Prime Minister spoke correctly and did not misrepresent the situation. The Opposition's attitudes are clear. They are published in 'The Way Ahead', which happens to be the most extensive policy document ever put before the Australian people. The policy attitudes of the joint Opposition Parties have been set out. Specifically, we have stated that we will abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal which has done positive economic harm and which union and business leaders unanimously agree has not succeeded.

I have said that we would dismantle most of the measures which have been taken by the Labor Party, and that misrepresentation needs to be cleared up. We have stated that we will abolish the Department of the Media which we regard as an unnecessary and interfering propaganda bureaucracy designed ultimately to interfere with the freedom of the media to the benefit of the Labor Party.

The Leader of the Opposition has claimed that what the Prime Minister said is incorrect and he has made his point in relation to that misrepresentation. has made his point in saying where he has been misrepresented. The Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to say what he would do to remedy the situation! That would then be to debate the matter.

But to undertake to dismantle most point on which the right honourable member of them is quite another matter. I am making it clear that that is a misrepresentation. WhatI have said is exactly what we would do and that does not amount to dismantling most of Labor's policies. It amounts to dismantling those which are objectionable, unrealistic and improper. We would abolish the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. In every other area the Opposition is committed to the constructive improvement of legislation and Government schemes.. We have supported the principles of the national compensation and national superannuation schemes. WhatI have said is that we are not prepared to support such principles being implemented in such a way as to achieve massive transfers of funds from the private sector, out of the people's purse, into the public purse so that the public authorities can then introduce into and control the private sector in any way they wish.

I do not think that any convention can override section 15 of the Constitution, which gives the States the right to determine who the replacement should be when a casual vacancy occurs.

Paragraph (e) states: A person who(i) is for the time being exempted, by instrument under the hand of the Minister, from the requirements of this Division relating to entry permits; or (ii) is included in a class of persons who are for the time being so exempted, not being a person in respect of whom a declaration is in force under the next succeeding sub-section. It is important to note the words 'by instrument under the hand of the Minister'. This is a section which allows the Minister to exercise his judgment in exempting certain classes of people from the need to have valid entry permits when seeking to enter Australia.

Order! The Minister's time has expired. Dr FORBES (Barker) (11.32)-The Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has followed his usual line of appearing to be a reasonable individual. He has cited what he alleges to. be the law. He has covered himself and protected his own personal political position by what I would call a dubious practice for a Minister in quoting some instruction which he has given to his Department and which may well result in a miscarriage of the intention which he purported to have or which he suggested was his intention when he gave the instruction. That is typical of the Minister. All through his political just a cynical politician without any conviction. career he has been interested only in saving his own skin and protecting himself rather than the interests of the Australian people and the Australian taxpayers. That is what he has been doing since he became responsible for immigration, in dismantling a lot of the worse excesses of his predecessor, Mr Grassby. In fact it is well known that the Minister has told many people that on no account will he be held responsible for a lot of the things which Grassby did, like the consequences of the easy visa scheme. Mr HuntI do not blame him. I disagreed with a lot that Mr Grassby did. For once the Minister is right, I believe, in dismantling some of the excesses of Mr Grassby, such as the easy visa scheme. But it is consistent with his action in this case that he should not care a damn about his own Government or the Australian public. He is just trying to protect his own personal political position. This is characteristic of the Minister in relation to almost everything he does. I am not prepared to give him credence for what he has been saying. I do not believe a lot of what he says. I never believe the honourable gentleman. If there is anybody in this House who is an archetype of the cynical politician it is the present Minister for Labor and Immigration.

146,Motion (By Mr Daly),"by leave-agree d to:an unsolicited card that has been issued to him is confronted with a problem as to what he should do with it. Many such persons have little knowledge of the law and they are placed in a position of some anxiety as to what steps they must take to ensure that they incur no unintended liability. There are also reasons, from a privacy point of view, why credit ratings of persons who have not sought them should not be made and recorded, for example, in a computer to which many other persons could well have access. A credit arrangement is a personal matter between the person providing the credit and the person receiving it. It should remain that way and should not be rendered impersonal by credit, cards that are sent out without any request. Although it is a matter of opinion that is not the subject of general agreement, it is, or has been, claimed that the mass distribution of unsolicited credit cards can create undesirable inflationary influences. Persons who have not sought credit find it readily available and are encouraged to use it-wit h a consequential increase in the demand for goods and services. Other countries, notably the United States of America and the United Kingdom, have taken a similar approach to the matter and have banned unsolicited cards. I turn briefly to the other amendments proposed by this Bill. Section 51 of the Trade Practices Act provides certain exceptions to the prohibitions of the restrictive trade practices provisions of the Act. A question has arisen, however, whether a contract excepted by the section may nevertheless be rendered unenforceable by section 45. Such a result was plainly never intended and the Bill makes it clear that an excepted contract is enforceable. Sections 62 and 63 of the Act authorise the making of regulations to prescribe consumer product safety and information standards. These standards seek to ensure that goods which can be unsafe or hazardous in the hands of consumers are either not supplied to consumers, or are supplied to them with adequate warning of potential dangers. As the Act now stands, a standard must always apply to Australia's export trade as well as to domestic trade. The amendments proposed in the Bill enable the regulations prescribing such standards to exclude from their operation goods intended for use outside Australia. In such situations, the Government believes that the standards of the country to which the goods are to be sent should apply, not the standards of Australia. Many other countries of the world set standards with which consumer goods sold in their countries must comply. Although there is some uniformity of approach between countries in these matters, one must expect some differences to arise. These amendments would permit regulations promulgating standards to be made inapplicable to exported goods, so that Australian exporters are not faced with the problem of compliance with incompatible standards. The amendments would also help to prevent inconsistency arising with standards set pursuant to Australian Exports Regulations. Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Street) adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 February on motion by MrEnderby: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Lynch had moved by way of amendment: That all the words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'while strongly supporting the creation of a national regulatory authority to supervise the functioning of the securities industry with a view to increasing efficiency and avoiding abuses in that industry, the House (1) deplores the failure of the Government to consider the views of the States, company organisations and the securities industry and the decision to force the Bill through the House contrary to previous assurances, and (2) is of the opinion that the BUI: (a) will not permit the speedy and effective prevention of malpractices within the securities industry; (b) will involve confusion, increased costs and the creation of a massive administrative bureaucracy; (c) will not lead to an improved functioning of Australia's securities markets necessary to increase real capital formation and to allocate resources efficiently among competing demands for capital, and (d) relies too heavily on discretionary powers, rules and regulations and denies effective rights of appeal'. Speaker, you will remember that shortly before the debate on this Bill was interrupted last night, I was dealing with this Bill in considerable detail. I had mentioned the fact that I believed that the old principle of acting in haste and repenting at leisure would be found to be accurate in regard to this Bill. I was able to give some background on why I believed that the Bill should be withdrawn and replaced by something different. Mainly because I felt that the Bill was too technical, was far too detailed and lacked flexibility, and because the Government had shown that it was completely incapable of managing the economy, I came to the conclusion that if the Government was so incompetent it should not be given",38,Trade Practices Bill 1975
147,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) (11.59),"Mr Deputyany further powers. I went on to deal with the reasons why I felt that should not be done and this Bill not passed. I do not believe that one can mix up corporations and exchanges together. This Bill cannot be amended satisfactorily because at least 100 to 150 amendments would be necessary. Of critical importance is the fact that, although some of the concepts and principles of the Bill must be incorporated in the law at some stage, the law cannot be made so detailed and so difficult to administer that those who are attempting to run commercial activities will not be able to act unless they have a lawyer, an actuary and some other person beside them to tell them whether they may take action. In most cases the answer will be no. I went on to say that I would not be prepared to give the Attorney-General the powers that he proposes should be given under the Bill. I also dealt with the difficult position associated with divisions 3 and 4 in PartV of the Bill. I wanted it to be made absolutely clear that some of the concepts of the Bill, such as those relating to dealings as principal on the stock exchange, wash transactions and similar matters, were concepts which I approve but I do not believe that anyone in the House knows enough about it at the present time to be able to say; 'whilst we agree with the concept, we also agree with the manner and detail in which these concepts are being put on the statute book'. As I said, it would make the working of this Bill absolutely intolerable and impossible. I believe it is fair to comment here and now on the feelings and views of a man who was claimed to be the inspirational genius of the Bill before us. Not only the Attorney-General( Mr implement a change in any of the constituent Enderby) but also, if I remember accurately, the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Kerin) claimed that Senator Rae would fully endorse this Bill. They claimed that many of the changes to existing law and practices proposed by the Bill were recommended by him or based on his report and recommendations. Let us test that claim against what Senator Rae said yesterday, not in a debate but with reference to the Bill. He said that it is full of inconsistencies, illogicalities, impracticalities and potential injustices. There cannot be any more damning indictment of a proposal or a proposed Bill than that. Like every other speaker on this side of the House whom I have heard, I believe that the criticisms made here are so damning, as are some of the comments made by members of the Government, that the proper course of action is to withdraw this Bill, have another go, then let us on this side of the House examine the proposals and let democracy work in this country. I come now to clause 61 of the Bill. I had just about reached that point last night when the question for the adjournment of the House was proposed. There is provision under that clause for the Governor General to prohibit all trading of securities or of securities included in a class of securities during such period as is specified. In other words, the operation of the exchanges may be suspended without notice and immediately and indefinitely. There are incalculable implications and great dangers in that power. I prefer that it be deleted. If that is not practicable, the purpose could be effected by affirmative resolution of both Houses of this Parliament. Can any democrat object to that kind of procedure? Do we believe in democracy or do we believe in an agency of government being able to run riot, to disturb the economy and to disturb the free workings of a market economy? The powers conferred are altogether too wide and could be subject to arbitrary or irrational decisions. Surely by now we have had enough of that under the Australian Labor Party Government. I mentioned earlier the actions of the former Attorney-General with regard to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and other similar types of activities. Opportunity should be given for public debate and parliamentary approval before action is finalised. It can be seen by parity of reasoning that much the same applies in the case of clause 283 which empowers the Commission to make statutory rules in relation to 'any matter in respect of which the Commission is permitted by subsection 59(3) to make rules'. That is in cases, where a stock exchange is required by a notice to documents of the stock exchange. All honourable members will be aware how difficult it is to get action in the Parliament after the event in cases where regulations are made and there is an attempt either in the House or in the Senate to amend them. Therefore I strongly recommend that, so far as most of these problems are concerned, either the law should be made by affirmative resolution, or by a Bill, or in relevant cases a decision before becoming operative ought to be the subject of an appeal to administrative tribunals such as the Taxation Board of Review or the Industrial Court in the case of arbitration decisions. As I have said, I do not think that the Bill can be amended satisfactorily. I do not think that it can work in practice. I agree exactly with what Senator Rae has said. Consequently I believe that if the Attorney-General has the authority and the influence and the interests of the country at heart he will withdraw the Bill and put up something acceptable to us and, above all, something that will work in the interests of this country and particularly in the interests of the investor. Order! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired. waited in vain in this debate to try to understand what the Liberal-Country Party Opposition really wants. What is its approach to this Bill? It is one thing to nit pick and to suggest individual changes to various clauses of the Bill, but it is another thing to tell this House in a second reading debate whether the Opposition wants a Corporations and Exchange Commission such as the one proposed in this BUI. The fact is that the philosophy of honourable members opposite puts them into a tremendous dilemma. They are on record in many different places as paying lip service to the idea that they want a national companies Act and a national securities Act, but when it comes to the point of putting that into effect they go to water. Opposition members want to pretend that they will take the part of the small investor when there is a boom and the stock exchanges are going mad; but when it comes to actually deciding how that is to be achieved they listen to the voices of vested interests and they go to water. There is no other way of explaining it. There is a perfect analogy to this in the restricanniversarytive trade practices legislation. There is one small difference: At the time that concept was brought by them into this Parliament when they were in power they had a man of principle in Sir Garfield Barwick to do so. But then, of course, they mutilated the ideas that he brought to the Parliament so that the eventual legislation, amended time and again, meant nothing. Then a reform Government took over in this country and we achieved a Trade Practices Act which meant something. On this occasion they enjoy being in Opposition where they do not have to commit themselves as to just what their line will be. They can merely criticise the stand that has been taken. They want the Bill withdrawn. Like those opposing the Family Law Bill, they want it withdrawn. That is just an easy way of saying that they do not want to commit themselves to any sort of legislation such as this or to any reforms. Anybody would think that this issue had not been before the nation and had not been considered for years by all the people who are interested in this field. Of course it has been. I turn to the work of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia, of which I am a member. I would like to read from an article which appeared in the 'Australian Financial Review' as long ago as April 1970. The article reads: The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia warns against duplication of State control of companies in a federal body. That is the essence of what the Opposition is getting at in relation to this Bill. Opposition members cannot pretend to be State righters and at the same time advocate the introduction of effective legislation in this field. They still pretend that a uniform Companies Act will work. The article continues: An editorial in the Institute's official journal 'The Chartered Accountant in Australia' says that the States have the power and the responsibility for the control of companies. 'If events show that proper control cannot be exercised at State level, then surely the remedy does not lie in the setting up of a duplicate Commonwealth AdminisUation', the editorial said. a 'It would seem obvious that the better course would be for the States to relinquish their powers and let control of companies be solely a Commonwealth matter'. A similar comment was made by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. In this case I do not have to go back quite so far, only to July-August 1972. The editorial in that issue of 'The Chartered Secretary' is headed 'Need for a Commonwealth Companies Act' and reads: Just a decade ago uniform company legislation was attempted in Australia, a concept which relied upon continuous co-operation between all seven Governments and unanininuty of amendments considered necessary. The tenth The article was written back in 1972finds us with a ragged state of affairs. Amendments have varied in the State Acts and Territory Ordinances, both as to content and date of introduction. Some Acts have been amended this year, some have not. Over the period, some draft legislation has been delayed or put aside entirely, for various reasons including local influence, and often after considerable committee work and public ventilation. To prevent abandonment of the principle of uniformity, some legislation has inevitably been enacted which brought with it inconsistency and lack of precision and certainty. The editorial goes on in that vein. Yet the Opposition says that the concept of making it a national Corporations and Securities Industry Bill is something new. The fact is, of course, that it cannot accept the position that only by having Commonwealth legislation and throwing overboard its archaic abeisance to State rightism can this be achieved. It will not commit itself, I repeat, as to what it would do. Let me just draw attention to that point. I refer to a paragraph which appeared in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on 31 January which dealt with a seminar which was held in the Wentworth Hotel on 30 January of this year. The article reads:",39,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

One would expect such people to put up a the Bill should not be rushed through. The Opposition is still saying that the Bill should not be rushed through, almost a month later. When is it going to commit itself? We have heard the comments of a number of Opposition supporters on this Bill, but really they made, I think, only one legitimate claim and that was in relation to appeals against particular decisions of the Commission. That matter is taken care of in the amendments which the Attorney General( Mr be incorporated in amendments if they are found Enderby) has already brought before the House. I believe that he would have already said-if he has not, I say it now-that all of the submissions on the details of this Bill will continue to be looked at. It is some weeks before the Bill will get through the Senate, if indeed the Senate does discuss the Bill at all. Let me point out also that this is only the first of 2 Bills of this nature which must come before the Parliament. Of course, there must be a National Companies Act as well, covering all of Why? Yet again no explanation is given as to those areas which have not been covered by this why that should be so. Perhaps the honourable Bill in relation to corporations. The Attorneymember for Moreton( Mr Killen) who is to folGeneral has said in his second reading speech low me in this debate will give me an explathat when the second measure comes before the nation.

Later on the Deputy'Leader has put into the formulation of its attitude, as of the Opposition showed more inconsistency in displayed in the debate both last night and this the attitude which he took. I read again from the afternoon. The Opposition is not against the overall concept of the Bill, as I see it. I have not been able to dichotomy read that into Mr Valder's comments either, which I read in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of Commission 13 February. As I said, I analysed his article in aspects, it says, great depth. IfI have not already said it, I say it . . . . In other words he is indicating that the Commission now. It seems that the right of appeal was the should have the power to act more quickly and decisively. only major disagreement that he had.

But I read into that Leader of the Opposition to criticise the way in article no strong conviction that that is not inevirearguard action on it. When it came to the details of the Bill, I repeat that it was only the right of appeal that meant anything to me. I come back to the point I was making about the detailed comments of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, a copy of which I have in my hand. This document will, of course, be studied in great detail and there will be many other opportunities for its recommendations to to be of substance. The extraordinary attitude of the Opposition is really highlighted in a report in today's 'Australian Financial Review' on the contribution made to the debate yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch). The article reads: He said that the Opposition opposed the blending of corporations and securities industries laws into the one legislative enactment. These2 aspects should be kept divisible and separate and should be administered by 2 regulatory bodies.... report in this' morning's 'Australian Financial Review': Mr Lynch's speech, however, did point up something of a in the Opposition's argument. On the one hand it is saying that many of the powers of the are too wide and arbitrary, while on the other the Commission should nave stronger powers At the same time the Opposition complains that the Comwhich the Commission can work on the one hand, because there are safeguards against its COMPANY LAW acting too pre-emptorily and, on the other hand, to say that there are not sufficient safeguards.

Some weeks ago, and prior to the dissemination of the Opposition in this debate are, I would also like to above assertions, a questionnaire was prepared which, draw attention to an article in the 'Australian among'other things, asked that views be expressed relating Director' in which the views of Senator Rae are to the desirability of: (a) Federal companies law; (b) Federal securities industry law; and (c) Federal registration of public accountants.

153,"Member For Lowe ( Mr Mcmahon), Who","He was talking about what has gone on in the stock exchanges. The article continues: In May 1972, when speaking of the need for reconsideration of our concepts and legislative approaches to company and securities industry law, I said, 'The idea that we, as a sovereign nation dealing with an industry of fundamental importance and national breadth and significance, should find ourselves patching up a series of tattered veils makes me fear the cold winds of an economic winter.' I believe that we now find ourselves shivering, inadequately clad, in those cold winds. Apparently nobody is having more influence upon the dunking of the right honourable member for Lowe and perhaps upon the thinking of other members of the Opposition than Senator Rae himself. He is allowing us to go on shivering by not committing himself to what form of law the Opposition would sanction. Later in his address Senator Rae said: We must therefore balance the freedom of those in the monopoly position to continue their monopoly against the freedom of those who would otherwise wish to exercise their freedom of enterprise, but are prevented from doing so. Later still in his address Senator Rae said: The line to be drawn in regulating is, I believe, to be found act. at the point where the regulation ceases to provide for the fair, free and efficient exercise of the right and commences directing those who would otherwise wish to exercise that right in a way which curtails or changes their objective. I could go on with other quotations to show the complete dilemma of Senator Rae's thinking. Surely the answer is to have a commission with the flexibility of the Commission which is sought to be set up by this Bill. Surely the answer is for the industry to learn the rules of a body which has a continuing nature and deal with it rather than to expect a similarly satisfactory situation to result from the putting of all these regulationsregulations which cannot have theflexibilitythat the proposed Commission's regulations will have-int o law. I hope that I have shown in my contribution to this debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill that there is an urgent need for such a Bill. I repeat that it is only afirststep. I look forward to a national companies Act also being enacted with further regulations of companies at a national level because, as somebody who has worked in this sphere, I recognise perhaps more than most people in this House the tremendous difficulties of having 7 different companies' offices in Australia, 7 different Acts and all the anomalies that go with that. Of course, the State companies Acts are no longer uniform in any shape or form because they have been amended so many times. But even if the law is the same, it is a fact that the administration of that law in the make a glancing blow at my friend the Attorneyvarious areas differs. The honourable member's time has expired. admit at once that I have been left with the impression that the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) favours the Bill. I am bound to tell him, in equal candour, that I have not been left with the impression that he quite understands it. Let me turn to thefirstcommitment that the honourable gentleman has made and that is with respect to the support he gives the Bill. He has given very generous support, unstinted support, bold support; but for what has he given support? He has given support not merely for a proposal that sin should be abolished. The honourable gentleman has declared that there is only one way in which to abolish sin and that is to establish an abattoir. I would like to say to the honourable gentleman, to the House and to the people outside that there is no doubt as far as the Opposition is concerned as to the need for some regulatory body. rupted me and said that the previous Liberal Country Party Government had 23 years in which to act. I want to show the brilliance of the Attorney-General's logic. If one takes it and extends it one could say that the Attorney General would say that 23 years ago-in 1942-w e should have been operating DC9 aircraft on the Canberra to Sydney route. Do not distract me from the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide and his asseveration as to what the Opposition would do about a regulatory body. I want to say without the slightest ambiguity that we would establish a regulatory body, but that what follows is: What character of body? This is where we differ. Let there be no complaint from or misunderstanding on the part of the honourable gentleman or any of his colleagues as to what are the views of those who work in this industry. Mr Valder and Mr Campbell Johnston2 distinguished and highly respected Australians who work in this fieldhave said plainly that they favour a regulatory body of some description. So what is at issue between the Government and the Opposition in this matter is not simply to have a regulatory body as such. We are for all practical purposes ad idem on the point. What is at issue is what sort of system there would be. BeforeI turn to look at the Bill itself may I General with respect to the time table of this Bill.",43,Table C

I hope that he will not succumb to any pressure which may be placed upon him by that wily, albeit that lovable, that insinuating colleague, the Minister for Services and Property( Mr excesses there may be in human activity, whatDaly), who has been on the hot line finding out exactly what the orders should be on this issue. SoI plead with the Attorney-General: Do not succumb to the Leader of the House, to any of his blandishments, to any of his wiles or to any of his manoeuvres. Stand fast as we expect of any respectable Attorney-General. Stand fast and say: 'Yes, there will be reasonable time afforded for debate'. If there should be the slightest movement towards the tumbrils to the erection of the guillotine I ask the Attorney-General that he find that quality and sternness of character to say: 'This will be done over my dead body'. Having said that, let me say this to the Attorney-General, not by way of some grudging exerciseBillI can assure the honourable gentleman it will not be to his advantage or comfort. I want to say something further about the honourable gentleman's attitude as to what this House should do with a Bill that comes from the Senate. I find deeply offensive the argument that because the Senate has had a Bill for 2 months or 2 years, ergo this House should pass it through. We have our own rights. We have our own responsibilities and they are not to be whittled away by the Attorney-General's indulging in sophistry of that character. I would regard it as an impertinence for us to seek to tell the Senate what to do. Similarly I would regard it as an impertinence for the Senate to tell this chamber what to do. I ask my honourable friend to reflect most earnestly upon the curious position into which he has thrust himself. I turn, at the constant beckoning of the everything in this country.

That is the decision that the philosophy which distinguishes the Labor he makes. Whether or not it will be made to the Party from the Liberal and Country Parties, and advantage of those who are affected only time that is its fond belief that everything in this world will tell. can be controlled and regulated-no t merely its fond belief that it should be the case but its determination to see that that should be the case from the cradle to the grave. The Labor Party's philosophy is to get the Government to do it, to look after the people, to make sure that whatever ever temptation there may be to succumb to the world, these can be cured by legislative means. That is the dominant philosophy of the Labor Party and it is no better presented than in this Bill. But caught up in that, of course, is also the fact that our society, our system, is to be controlled and planned. The cry of the socialists in this country is simply this: 'Give us the controls, give us the plans and we will look after everything'. I am bound to say this to the Attorney General: Give him one plan and one runs a risk; put in his hands a number of plans and one stands in certainty of being greeted by chaos.

We will have a splendid opportunity of finding out how much homework the honourable and learned gentleman has done on this Bill when we get into the Committee stages. I am seeking to deal with what I describe as the principal philosophies behind the Bill and I would have thought the appropriate time to do that was during a second readingspeech. If I were, for example, to turn to, say clause 60 which deals with the capacity of the Attorney-General to suspend a stock exchange from trading for 21 days, I say to the honourable gentleman with respect, that it would be inappropriate for me to do so at this time.

161,Mr Killen,"The honourable gentlemanThe form of the legislation leads one to the conclusion that there has not been proper consultation in the first place with the States and in the second place with , those who work in the industries and in the field. I turn to the first conjust want to come on to the sideration, namely, consultation with the States. I do not yield to the honourable member for Adelaide or any other person in this Parliament in my anxiety to have established and to see recognised a proper priority for national consciousness. But one does not achieve that by ignoring the realities of the existence of the States. One finds this expressed not merely in Liberal-Country Party run governments in the States; one finds it expressed in Labor run governments in the States. The Premier of South Australia has an anxiety in this field. I find it a -very understandable one. The Premier of Victoria has an anxiety in this field. All of these anxieties are completely intelligible. One does not build a proper priority for national consciousness by ignoring the existence of the States and giving them the impression that one simply does not care. But beyond that, I invite the House to think of the confusion which can and will flow from pretending that the States do not exist, particularly in this field. As for the second observation-the failure to consult those in the industryI think it is a very sad state of affairs that when responsible Ministers in a Government give undertakings to people that their submissions will be considered, those undertakings are rejected. That is precisely what has happened on this occasion. Many submissions have been made by people who have worked in the field for many years-peopl e who speak with authority and with experience. Why the haste on the part of the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) and on the part of the Government to proceed with this Bill and to ignore the useful suggestions which have been made? I refer my honourable friend to the fact that he intends to move 19 amendments himself. cated that he will be moving 19 amendments but he now says there are really only three. I want to tell the Attorney-General that I will ensure that he gets an invitation to the annual St Patrick's Day dinner in Brisbane. He has 19 amendments hereMr KellyI would not want him counting sheep. counting sheep, as the honourable member for Wakefield suggests.

I bow before the fertility of the Attorney-General's imagination. I MrEnderby-TheBill. Bill. It is all veryfinefor the honourable member for Adelaide and the Attorney-General to sneer at the philosophy behind this Bill. The fact remains that this Bill, in its present form, is a significant assault upon the private sector in this country. Let no person be under any misapprehension about that. The private sector means the 75 per cent of the people in this country whose living and whose happiness depends upon free enterprise. This is the system that the Government wants to change. This Bill represents a significant attack upon the private sector. since 1934. electric chair in America too but there is no reason the Government should seek to thrust us into the electric chair. plainly earlier that we support a regulatory body. I am quite prepared to concede that the honourable gentleman has limited cerebral capacity to understand my argument but it rather frightens me to find that he is suffering from some other malady-h e cannot hear. Plainly we want a regulatory commission of some description. We do not want this sort of commission where 5 people are given completely untrammelled powers. It is all very fine for the Attorney General to say that this is not the case.

There is no appeal against that decision whatsoever. That is a power about which I would have thought that even the most ardent socialist planner would have thought twice. Let us say, for example, the Governor General in Council, that is to say the Cabinet, should recommend to the Governor General that, because of some attitude taken by. Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, BHP shares should be blocked for trading purposes. That is plainly a power in this Bill. There are about 180 000 shareholders and 56 000 employees in that one great company. The whole existence of those people could be put in jeopardy-no t some passing jeopardy but in very real jeopardy. That is a mere example of the hundreds of powers which the Government proposes to give to this Commission subject only to the most distant and the most ill-defined forms of parliamentary scrutiny. The last matter to which I would like to refer is the argument which has been pressed upon us by the honourable member for Adelaide and others that what was revealed by the Rae Committee is the reason for the existence of this Bill. Ifindthat a very curious argument indeed if for no other reason than that this Bill, in very real measure, does not cover the mining companies concerned. What the Rae Committee's inquiry revealed was a form of venality, a form of avarice, but not throughout the whole of Australia because that is not the character of the overwhelming majority of Australians. What it found by way of dishonesty was substantially-almos t exclusively, one could say-restricte d to mining companies. Here it istime. The Attorney-General is piloting through this House a Bill that exempts, or substantially appears to exempt, the very people about whom complaint is made. To recapitulate, the Opposition would establish a regulatory body but the Opposition would seek to bring balance, perspective and reason in the whole conduct of that regulatory body. This Bill is yet another Bill on the way to smash the private sector in Australia and to seek to erect a socialist edifice to assuage the vanity of those who presently sit on the Government benches.

In speaking about financial journalists, I congratulate the financial journalist in the 'Financial Review', who writes under the name of'Chanticleer', for his exposure of some companies which are attempting to lure people into depositing or investing money with them. I commend to the House the clauses that we are considering. the attention of the Committee once again to the definition in clause 3 of the Bill which defines a prescribed corporation and broadly covers the corporations which are to be registered. Strangely enough, it omits any reference to public companies or companies which have issued securities to the public. In fact, it appears to fol(Dr Klugman) concerningfinancialjournalists. low the prescribed corporations to which parts of this legislation apply and relates also to private companies. It has been indicated, as I understand it, why significant parts of this legislation apply to prescribed corporations, whereas the clear intention, as emphasised by the Attorney General( Mr Enderby) in his second reading speech, is to regulate the activities of registered corporations. There may well be cases where it is intended that certain provisions of the legislation should apply to companies other than registered corporations, but surely there is a case that they should be singled out for special treatment where there is a requirement for this to be the case. For example, is it intended that clause 83 (1) of the Bill should require holders of licences and financial journalists to maintain registers of interests and securities of prescribed corporations thus including, presumably, private companies, although this point is not adequately defined. Furthermore, the definition of 'dealing' in clause 3 would presumably cover, in relation to securities, an attempt to induce a person to offer or to make an arrangement, the purpose of which is to secure a gain for any one of the parties concerned. °The definition of 'investment adviser' in the same clause of the Bill presumably means a person who in the course of a businessI take that to mean any business-carried on by him or through him advises other persons concerning securities. It would appear clear that the implications of this are quite fantastic. For example, consultants and advisers in various fields, and even solicitors and accountants, are often involved in advising their clients on the handling of their portfolios and securities generally. Is the definition of an investment adviser to cover these sorts of people? Because of the narrowness of the exception in relation to investment advisers, it is quite obvious that such people are clearly caught by the words of the present definition. This is so despite the fact that the activities by which they are caught are in no way intended to be regulated and do not fall within the intended scope of this legislation. Management andfinancialconsultants appear to be an example of persons who would in total innocence find that a particular action with which they may have incidentally been associated will bring them within the confines of this definition. with the definitions clause, I invite the Attorney General( Mr Enderby) to consider the last point made by the honourable member for Prospect The definition, as it presently stands, refers to the publishing of information in a newspaper or periodical. Many financial journalists in this country would prepare material and have it published, but it would not be published in a newspaper or a periodical. I refer to information circulated by various people throughout the country. There seems to me to be a need to tidy up the clause-if need be, to broaden the definition a little. I also invite the Attorney-General to put into the Bill a definition of a stockbroker. It seems to me to be quite incredible that we are dealing with a Bill relating to the securities industry and there is not a definition of a stockbroker. Possibly my friend the Attorney-General may have some explanation for that. If there is a definition I invite him, if he would be so kind, to refer us to it. I also suggest that the Attorney-General consider-if not here, possibly in another place-that the definition of 'securities' should include a reference to unit trusts. It seems to me to be a conspicuous gap that there is no definition of a unit trust, because it represents a considerable field. clause. There seems to be to be a gap there, and we aim to please. IfI can find some minor blemish in the BUI I am quite sure that the Attorney General would not take the slightest exception to my making a suggestion on the point. I share the concern of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) in relation to unit trusts, but I am rather mclined to the view that the position is covered elsewhere in the Bill.

I have had a number of requests for an explanation from companies that handle or assist in trading in their own shares. Do they have to be licensed under the provisions of this Bill as a stock exchange? General) (2.35)-Without being unnecessarily abrasiveto admire the apparent reasonableness of the members of the Opposition as they ask that this Bill, containing nearly 300 clauses, be considered in Committee and they start off by directing attention to the title clause, clause 1, to clause 2 and to the definitions clause, clause 3. One is entitled at the outset and without being unnecessarily abrasive to question once again the motives of the Opposition. relevant to what I say answering the questions that have been raised. It is known that this Bill has been a public document for 3 months. Yet members of the Opposition come in here now and start asking questions about the definitions clause as though they have never seen it before. The inference I put forward, before I go on to give some information about the questions asked, is that they are not really serious. The Government does not believe in their sincerity on this matter one little bit. I certainly do not accept their apparent sincerity which is now being put forward by mock bad actors. All they are seeking to do is to delay and frustrate this measure. They see this going on and on for 6 months. They do not want this measure to become law, notwithstanding what they say to the contrary. Some aspects of the definitions clause raised first by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr The measure that has been adopted in the Bill is Garland) can be dealt with reasonably shortly. He talked about the rnining companies. He would be aware that there is an area of uncertainty as to whether the constitutional scope extends to them. The definition is in the Bill. It depends, of course, on the activities of the companies. On that point one can only refer to the mischief which was revealed by the investigations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange and which applied not so much to the mining companies but to the trading that took place in mining shares and mining stock. for Hawker interjects, and rightly so, it was the machinations. It was the trading, the shenanigans and the crooked dealings which took place in regard to the securities in those mining companies. It was not so much the conduct of the rnining companies themselves but rather how the smart boys in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide got to work on the shares and the securities. That is the mischief at which this legislation is aimed. It is that mischief which this legislation is intended to cure. The honourable member for Curtin asked whether the definition of'debenture' extended to instruments such as bills of exchange. It clearly does not, in the sense that the use of the word 'debenture' has to be related to the issuing of a prospectus to the public. In other words, it is the issue of a document or an instrument to the public as a means of subscribing funds at which this legislation is aimed, and a bill of exchange does not come into that at all. Whatever was the appropriate instrument that might be used by a corporation to achieve that purpose, it would be caught by the definition of'debenture', but it is most unlikely that it would be a bill of exchange. I think it was the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly) who raised the question of prescribed corporations and said that there is no reference to companies which have issued securities to the public. I direct his attention to clause 45 which uses the definition. I think he will find that that clause makes it clear. The other question related to journalists being required to register their interests in matters of this sort. We all know the power of the Press. Politicians probably know it more than any others do. It has been considered necessary to ensure that journalists keep records of all their securities and transactions because if they were not required to report their interest in securities of private corporations they could really use private corporations to deal for them in public corporations. completely consistent with that whole main thrust. There is nothing novel in this approach. It goes right back to one of the very early pieces of legislation of this Parliament, the Secret Commissions Act. The whole concept of the breach of fiduciary duty between principal and agent is dealt with in that very early Act of this Parliament. We all know the opportunities for abuse between principal and agent. We all know the obligations on, say, solicitors to have trust accounts and to keep their funds separate from those of their clients.",51,Pairs

This Bill seeks to extend those duties which have existed for many years in ordinary areas of law, such as principal and agent, into this growing securities industry. It should be said to the provisions in the Bill. AllI asked the in passing that, notwithstanding the bluff, hyperhonourable gentleman to do was to give an exbole and acting of the Opposition spokesmen who referred to this Bill as a measure of socialism, it was introduced into the United States of America-the homeland of capitalism-in 1934. honourable member well knows. It is designed to make the capitalist system work better, not worse. the continued complaints of the Attorney General( Mr Enderby) about the Opposition's questioning of this Bill, except to say that surely few months is an utter irrelevancy. Does the Minwe made it clear in the second reading debate, if anything was made clear, that we think that many of these clauses require far more explanation and justification. We are entitled to ask questions. We propose to do so. I might say-thi s should be of interest to honourable membersthat it is high time the House of Representatives took on the job instead of leaving it all to the Senate. I do not want to spend my full time every time. I rise, but let me come back to the 3 points which. I made before and which the Attorney-General did not answer. Does the definition of'business rules' include listing requirements? Will he consider putting in a definition of'current asset' as there is one there already for 'current hability' and for 'non-current hability'? In respect of prescribed corporations he responded to some of the questions asked, but I draw his attention to the matter which I mentioned first. Why do significant parts of the legislation apply to prescribed corporations, whereas the clear intention of the Bill-on e can quote the Attorney General's speech against him here-is to regulate the activities of registered corporations? What is the need to cover private companies as well? Lastly-thi s is the point my colleague the honourable member for Bradfieid ( Mr titled to put the point as strongly as I can that Connolly) raised-ca n we not have a definition of'public company' as referred to in clause 45 in the definition? make one observation. The Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) said that he did not wish to be abrasive. I think he has brought to the opening of the debate in the Committee stage of this Bill the charm of a dilapidated knackery. It is an impudence on the honourable gentleman's part to say that the attitude of the Opposition in this matter is one of obstruction. Surely to heavens we are entitled to offer some views with respect planation as to why there was not even a definition of'stock brojeer' in a Bill of this nature. There was nothing uncivil about the question. It was put to him properly and, I hope, pertinently. The Minister stirred himself to offer an insult. It passes me by, but I just draw his attention to the fact that the question was not put in any ungenerous fashion at all. The second question I asked him was why on earth he would not include unit trusts in the definition of'securities'. Again, that question was not put by way of being tendentious or difficult. The fact that this Bill has been in the Senate for a ister suggest that every time a Bill is introduced into the Senate we should sit down, get ourselves sopping wet with anxiety, a towel around the head, go through the Bills introduced in that chamber and then write to him asking him to tidy them up? What an impossible proposition. I do not dignify the attitude of the Attorney General by describing it as impertinent. I say that his attitude is one of studied impudence. General) (2.46)-It is to be regretted that the debate has degenerated into this type of exchange. I remind the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) of the way in which the debate began. Who was it who moved for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to prevent the debate from proceeding and then wasted perhaps an hour or 2 hours of the Parliament's time? suggest that the Attorney-General should not revive the second reading debate. second reading debate, but on the question of the credibility of Opposition spokesmen I am entheir credibility is in doubt in relation to this matter because it was they who moved for the adjournment of the debate within secondsthe Attorney-General is raising now are more relevant to a third reading debate than to consideration of the Bill in Committee.

There are 3 definitions in the definition clauses of the Bill relating to that subject matter of unit trusts because it is a matter which and I direct the honourable member's attention does worry me a little. to them.

General) (2.53)-We would suggest that there is not a gap or weakness in the clause. It is written in simple English. I put it to the honourable member, for Moreton( Mr Killen) that I know of no rule of law that says that the English language can be made so precise as to overcome every possible contingency. The words have to be given meariing by the courts. Surely they are quite clear enough. The honourable gentleman knows of the breadth of words. In fact, he will have an opportunity perhaps tomorrow when we are considering another Bill to talk about specific words and general words. I will read to the honourable member the clear language of clause 5. Mr KillenI have read it several times. able member again: Where provision is made by this Act for an application, report or other document to be lodged with or given or sent to the Commission(a) the application, report or other document shall be delivered, or sent by post, to the office of the Comthat that sort of impeding is not an objective of mission; There are clearly understood legal rules that govern that situation, and the honourable gentleman knows them. The clause goes on: (b) if the application, report or document is required to be lodged with or given or sent to the Commission on or by a particular day and the office of the Commission is not open on that day, it is a sufficient compliance with the requirement if the application, repon or other document is delivered to the Commission, or sent by post to the Commission so that it would be delivered to the Commission in the ordinary course of postThey are well understood-terms and probably have been the subject of hundreds and hundreds . of legal decisions-o n or by, as the case may be, the next day on which that office is open; I also put it to the honourable member that the document must only be put in the post to be delivered on the next day on which the Commission is open. The clause seems to me to be completely clear. ney-General( Mr Enderby) mentioned earlier the subject of whether this Bill should be dealt with clause by clause. I want to point out that in my last contribution to the debate I asked 4 questions of him and he has not answered them. Presumably the Attorney-General is not going to be in a good position to answer the next question I am about to ask either because he is not listening to me. The Attorney-General did have some sort of a reputation around this building as a lawyer. I hope that it will survive this debate. The fact of the matter is that the amendments which are to be proposed by the Attorney-General-ther e is not one in relation to the clauses before the Committee at present-are the result of further consideration and consultation. It is because those proposed amendments do not clarify the situationI am looking particularly at clause 10 and making some reference to clause 12-that it is necessary for me to try to elucidate answers to my questions. It is making something of a mockery of the proceedings for the Attorney-General to continue to talk to the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) and not to listen to the question which I wish to direct to him. Clauses 10 and 12 of the Bill require offers of invitations to make deposits with or lend money to a company to be covered by a registered prospectus. I have been advised that there is a considerable body of opinion that the traditional activities of the merchant banks and the industrial andfinancialcorporations in the inter-company market generally could be impeded by this requirement. I ask the Attorney General to comment on that matter. I presume the Government or of this Bill because, of course, if it were it would affect a significant part of the Australian capital market. Mr EnderbyI was distracted. Will the honourable member give the number of the clause again? clause 10 and making a slight reference to clause 12. PerhapsI should repeat what I have said; it is not long. Clauses 10 and 12 of the Bill require an offer or invitation to make deposits with or lend money to a company to be covered by a registered prospectus. I have been advised that there is a body or opinion that the traditional activities of the merchant banks and the industrial and financial corporations in the inter-company market generally could well be impeded by this requirement. I have said that I presume that that is not an objective or policy of the Government and that that is not an objective or intention of this Bill and that if it were so it would affect a very significant part of the Australian capital market. I ask the Attorney-General to consider clarifying this situation by amending the Bill. the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) to consider clause 6 in relation to the matter I have already raised, that is, the need for a definition of the word 'stockbroker'.

Clauses agreed to. Clauses 13 to 15-by leave-take n together. to be a clear error in clause 13.1 hope that the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) will listen to my argument on the point. It is a very short one. In the second last line of clause 13 there is use of the word 'member'. The simple fact of life is that the members of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges are the representatives of the 6 capital stock exchanges. The exchanges themselves are not members of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges. I suggest that the defect could be cured if the word 'member' were deleted and the words 'conference exchanges' put in its stead. General( Mr Enderby) has invited me to read the Bill. I have read it. I am wondering whether I can say the same for him. He has seemed to imply-thi s is relevant to the consideration of these clauses-that we should not ask him questions and examine him upon the Bill. He has a misunderstanding of the whole purpose of this debate and, I would say, a significant part of the sub-clause (f). Clause 14 is intended to define extracts from the clause, it reads: For the purposes of this Act. . . the following per'(f) any director or employee of(i) any corporation of which the person is a director or employee; or (ii) any corporation that isrelatedto that corporation. quite a lot. Presumably it applies also to large government departments. As we know more and more people are becoming members of governdepartments.

I invite the Attorney-General to discuss what is the intention and to state whether those ramifications are intended to be that wide. to one other clause at which I have had an opportunity of looking while the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland) has been speaking. I ask the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) to look at the implications of clause 14 in relation to clause 111, which relates to the disclosure of interests. For the purposes of my argument let me accept the proposition that there should be complete disclosure. I believe that the old rules offiduciaryrelationship should be observed and observed impeccably. There are instances, of course, when people do not observe them, and this is what the Bill seeks to correct. I still take the and impose the standards on people so that if view that, dishonesty is not to be cured by legislative form. If people do not have a feel and instinct for honour I do not think any library of statutes will cure that. But that is beside the point. We reach the absurd position where this clause deals with associated persons-and here it has a relationship to clause 111-the type of person who must disclose the interest. Let me give one illustration to the honourable gentleman. Take the case of a stockbrokingfirm.One of the partners sends out a circular to people involved in his area of activity. Under this clause, what he would be required to do is to check with all of his relatives and with all of his employees to ask them what they have by way of investment. The ramifications of that seem to me to be quite appalling. The time that would be involved would be immense, the possibility of confusion significant and the possibility of error very grave. I will be saying a little more on that point when we come to clause 111. WhatI would like to suggest to my friend is that he should delete paragraphs (a), (e), (f) and (g) from the definition and put in something to the effect of these words: 'or under which the person or any person who is associated with the person by virtue of paragraph (a) benefits or is capable of benefiting'. I do not insist that the honourable gentleman embrace my suggested amendment. But I do make the observation that there will be very great areas of difficulty if the definition in the clause remains as it is. General) (3.8)-The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) correctly drew attention to the fact that the language in clause 14 and clause 111 is broad, as indeed it has to be broad because of the abuses revealed by the Rae Committee. I might remind honourable members of the general recommendation of that Committee in this area, going to the question of a licence holder disclosing his interest in securities when making a recommendation. We have the example of corporations going behind the corporate veil. No one would argue more strongly than I do that the invention and development of the limited liability company have been a great engine for progress in the world over many years. But no one would argue or could argue more strongly than I that it has also been a great engine for fraud and deceit. Of course, the Rae Committee report tells us this, if we needed to be told. The problem of law really is to try to draw attention to the standards, lay down the duties they are in breach of these standards so as to cause injury by the committing of a fraud, the people concerned will be guilty of some offence or at least be subject to some civil liability to the person injured. All that this legislation seeks to do is to bring this about. We know that when we go behind the corporate veil we find a separate corporate identity made up of people who live together. Any lawyer on the other side of the chamber would know the difficulties of proving a representation that comes from a corporation when one is not in possession of the facts that lead to the creation of the authority of the person to make the representation on behalf of the corporation, notwithstanding provisions for discovery, interrogatories and matters of that sort. I was involved in a case in the Australian Capital Territory not so long ago that went to the High Court on that very issue, involving some of the very great corporations in Australia. With those difficulties of getting behind the corporate veil and finding out what is going on and whether certain activities are to the detriment of outsiders, law-makers like ourselves have to come along and give the injured person a better remedy than he has at the moment. That is what this legislation seeks to do. This legislation is broad, but so is every type of legislation of this sort that has ever been enacted. All legislation of this kind has been broad and the courts interpret it having regard to the mischief which they are intended to stop. The honourable member for Moreton also referred to clause 13 (1) and talked about and criticised the word 'member'. He said that the word should be changed to 'conference exchange' or an expression of that sort. We would suggest that there is absolutely no need",56,Pairs
229,Mr Killen (Moreton) (3.4),I wish to refer,57,Pairs
230,Mr Enderby (Canberra,"Attorneyfor such a change. The use of the word 'member' in that context is clear and acceptable and there is no need for it to be replaced with the words 'conference exchange'. I remind the honourable member again that exchanges are required to be incorporated. With the exception of the Brisbane Exchange, all the exchanges are incorporated. I understand that the Brisbane Exchange has been dragging its feet for a while. When this Bill becomes law, as we hope it will, that exchange obviously will be assisted in its steps towards incorporation by the requirement that it be incorporated. The honourable member for Curtin( Mr the first-mentioned corporation; Garland) talked about the definition of 'associated' in relation to clause 14 (f). The definition in clause 14 must be sufficiently wide to catch well practised schemes designed to disassociate persons from their misdeeds. I put this to honourable members: When one looks at this legislative scheme one sees 2 measures in the mind of the Government. One is customer protection and the other is protection of the investor-consume r protection if one likes to use that expression. In devising a means of giving that protection by way of all these legislative steps, one has to take account of the different levels of some of the customers. Given the nature of the industry, some people are particularly vulnerable. We know that. Some are naive. Some have had no experience at all. On the other hand, others, particularly those who use the facilities of merchant banks and the city, are particularly sophisticated and experienced investors operating in and through great corporations, and need less assistance. The legislation seeks to take into account the difference between the great who do not need a great deal of protection and who can be expected to be able to employ expensive lawyers to guard their interests and the little person, the battler, the fellow who was deceived so badly some years ago and continues to be deceived from time to time, who needs protection. The legislation seeks to draw attention because of the different dealings that occur between those 2 types of clients, customers or consumers of the service. We must bear in mind when looking at all the page 14, line 32 and measures that the Bill also seeks to facilitate the free working of the market. This is where the rubbish is put and the he is put to allegations of some kind of socialist monster. The legislation 32 refers to the word 'corporation' where seccopies a model from the home of capitalism-the would ondly appearing in line 31. The amendment United States of America. The legislation is designed to take account of the fact that practices have grown up in the industry which do not 31. allow the market to work as it should work and so correctly allocate resources into the best and optimum areas. It is designed really to facilitate the free working of the capital market in this country. I ask honourable members not to forget those 2 main threads that go through the overall cloth that make up this Bill. Clauses agreed to. Clause 16. (1) For the purposes of this Act, a corporation shall, subject to sub-section (3), be deemed to be a subsidiary of another corporation if(a) that other corporation(i) controls the composition of the board of directors of (ii) is in a position to cast, or control the casting of, more than one-half of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general meeting of the first mentioned corporation; or (iii) holds more than one-half of the issued share capital of the first-mentioned corporations (excluding any pan of that issued share capital that carries no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either profits or capital); or (b) the first-mentionedcorporation is a subsidiary of any corporation that is that other corporation's subsidiary. (4) A reference in this Act to the holding corporation of another corporation shall be read as a reference to a corporation of which that last-mentioned corporation is a subsidiary. General) (3.14)I move: In sub-clause (1), at the end of paragraph (b), add ""(including any corporation that is that other corporation's subsidiary by another application or other applications of this paragraph)"". In sub-clause (4), omit ""last-mentioned"", substitute ""other"". The first amendment to clause 16 is straightforward. It simply seeks to ensure that a chain of subsidiaries is also included in the area of protection. It is thought to be an improvement and I do not anticipate-and I hope I do not hear-an y opposition from honourable members. I would be surprised if there were any opposition because it seems to put the clause in a better form. It is a drafting improvement. It seeks to omit the words 'last-mentioned' where they appear in clause 16, substitute the word 'other'. As presently drafted it might be argued that the expression 'last-mentioned corporation' in line make it clear that the reference is to the word 'corporation' where first appearing in line Amendments agreed to.",57,Pairs

I deal first of from the honourable member himself, as indeed all with 20 (2) (c). In doing so I have to go back has one other. I say this to draw into focus to King Henry VIII to make my point. It is what exactly what is happening in the Committee is known as a King Henry VIII clause which, in stage of this debate. Some of us have a document years gone by, was inserted in Acts of the of 86 pages relating to about 86 or more separate Imperial Parliament. It draws its name from the clauses and sub-clauses of this Bill. They are fact that Henry VIII used to make declarations detailed comments from the body that I have having full legislative force merely by making a mentioned, the Australian Associated Stock proclamation.

I stated in my speech as well thatother honourable members from referring to the second reading debate. man. I was stimulated into making this comment because of the inane interjections members opposite have been trying to make to point out that, because the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges had taken some time to get this document into this place, now is not the time to hold up an important Bill for a recommendation such as deleting the word 'promote' and inserting the word 'encourage', which is suggested by the honourable member for Moreton. I repeat that there are 86 pages in this document representing about 86 such recommendations. I do hope the Opposition will be responsible enough not to go through each of those recommendations in the way it hasjust indicated to us. one must respond to the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) that we are in some way sycophants of the stock exchanges. He then went on to make the very point of what we are about. We are the ones who protested about the fact that those who are most concerned in the most practical way-w e think in particular of the stock exchanges-hav e not been given sufficient time to put final submissions to the Government. So, there is little option but for those of us who speak on this side of the House to do it for them. We know that certain Government backbenchers have been given information by stock exchanges, and for the first time that has confines the Governor General to appointing been acknowledged. This ought to be before the Government because it is a matter for consideration by the Government. Referring to clause 20, to which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) drew attention, he was correct in saying that subclause (2) (c) is one of the widest provisions that which are required by clause 21. It would not be one could ever imagine. Is there not a group of Government backbenchers who are alarmed about the future of the institution of Parliament to which they belong? It seems to me to be most important that if this is to be the pattern of Government legislation Parliament will be very much bypassed. In reply to the debate on clauses 13 to 15 the Attorney-General did say that the Commission that is being created is not a socialin conjunction with the Australian Labor Party's platform could be forgiven for doubting the Attorney-General's assurances, but at the very least if one reads the Bill in its entirety one finds that the Commission is an academic bureaucratic monster. When one reads clause 20 (2) (f) one really does wonder whether the Commission will not be in competition with another bureaucratic monster, namely, the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I think I should read paragraph (0being established in competition with it. sition to the AIDC, but I certainly am speaking in opposition to clause 20 (2) (f) which reads: develop and facilitate the opportunities for persons to participate in the ownership and control of Australian industry by means of collective investment schemes and improve the performance and efficiency of such schemes; It seems far beyond the purpose of this legislation to have this Commission, with the wide powers given under clause 20, involved in developing opportunities for persons to participate in the ownership and control of Australian industry. ThereI would commend some of the recommendations from the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges because it is important that the Commission should be confined to 'facilitating'; it certainly should not operate in the very broad sense of'developing'. * Clause 21, which is relevant to my references to this quite possibly becoming an academic area, relates to the Governor General's power of appointment of persons to the Commission. It persons having requisite experience in or knowledge of industry, commerce, economics, law or public adminstration. It is the concern of those who are practitioners in this area that these be added together or that these be conjunctive and that the commissioners must have both practical experience and the academic qualifications difficult for the Government to substitute in clause 21 (3) the word 'and' for the word 'or'. After all, we are imposing on members of the Commission inordinate powers. Even if the Bill were worded more precisely these would be very great responsibilities, and one would hope that we would put them in the hands of persons who were qualified by practice as well as by academic",59,Pairs

He described Hurford) to understand one thing about this debate. IfI believe that a submission made on this legislation by a body which clearly knows a good deal more about it than certain members of this chamber is a worthwhile submission, I am quite prepared to consider it and argue it. I do not think the cause of proper discussion in this debate will be advanced by the honourable member for Adelaide expressing great frustration because the Opposition seeks to give this Bill some consideration. I was absolutely astounded to hear him remark a few moments ago that the Opposition members were behaving like sycophants. The honourable member said that of course the Government had not had time to consider the stock exchange comment and recommendations. That is precisely the point that we were making. Adelaide said that the Government had not had time. Government. Government. Already divisions are appearing in the ranks of the Government over this Bill. The fact of the matter is that there are a few members of the Government Party who are starting to be a bit worried that this legislation is being rushed. If years, I think we have every reason to anticipate the honourable member for Adelaide was really faithful to what he said a few moments ago he should have come over to this side of the chamber and supported the second reading amendment that was moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch). I think that this Bill belongs to that category of Bills which the Government has decidedorder. The last five minutes or so has been an exchange between 2 honourable members on opposite sides of the chamber. Nothing has been said about the clauses under discussion. has been speaking for about 2 minutes. I remind him of what I have told other honourable members, and that is that they should speak to the clauses which are being discussed. I have allowed him a little lattitude, but cross-talk about how the Bill should be debated is not relevant to the clauses in the Bill. Mr HO WARDI am grateful for your ruling, Mr Chairman. I would like very quickly to add to what the honourable member for Moreton( Mr it as a Henry VIII clause. I think that clause 20(2 )(c) illustrates that to a very large extent this legislation must have been drafted in great haste because it has all the indications that the draftsmen and the Attorney-General thought: 'Maybe there is something that we left out; so we will clothe this Commission with a bit more power'. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Macphee) has drawn attention already to the criteria which ought to govern the Governor General's determination when he appoints the members of the Commission. I support what the honourable member said. Probably the most important single act that might be performed under this legislation is the appointment of the personnel to the Commission. I would hope, in view of the acknowledgment that the Attorney General now gives by nodding his head, that some consideration will be given to an expansion of that definition. Opposition does not object to the establishment of this Commission per se. What we do want to ensure, however, is that the personnel employed and the objectives of the Commission will be rationally related. In New South Wales, for example, there are about 300 public servants involved in the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. On the basis of the exercises performed by the present Government in relation to its Public Service expansion in the last 2 that at least 300 people will be involved in this Commission. In the definition which has been given concerning the appointment of officers to the Commission I would not like to see the criterion 'knowledge of or experience in public administration' used as a means of bringing into the Commission a substantial number of public servants, thereby diluting the Commission's very real need to ensure that the people at the top are in fact, as they are in the case of the Australian Industry Development Corporation men who are well experienced in the field of commerce, industry and finance. General) (3.34)-The remarks made by honourable members about clause 21, and in particular sub-clause (3), concerning the qualifications of members of the Commission are relevant and are very much in the Government's mind.

The Government appreciates that fact fully and when the time comes to find those people every effort will be made to find those most suitable for the job. They will have to be acceptable to the industry and that is appreciated. They will have to be men or women with a great breadth of experience and understanding. That is why the various qualifying features were written into the Bill. Clause 21 states that a person shall not be appointed to the Commission unless the Governor General is satisfied as to his or her knowledge in industry, commerce, economics, law or public administration. The words are flexible. They are very wide. I say in passingplease do not misunderstand my saying this because I know it is understood that I represent Canberra, which has a lot of public servants-n o one should under-estimate the qualifications of senior public servants. They are extremely capable and competent people. Because of the nature of their work they are often able to take a broad view of a whole industry that people in the industry or a particular part of it have difficulty in takprinciples of ultra vires apply. There may be ing because their experience has not given them the breadth of view that sometimes a senior public servant has. That provision is there only to give flexibility and no one would appreciate more than I the fact that the personnel must be acceptable to the industry. Otherwise the whole tiling would not function at all. A number of other points were made. Some concern was expressed, I think by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), in his usual flowery language. seeking. member wishes. The honourable member for the Government to the Commission of what the Moreton referred to clause 20 (2) (c) as being a Government thinks the Commission should try Henry VIII clause. I would suggest that it is not, to do, namely, to protect persons who invest in although it bears some such features. One has securities in corporations. In other words, if these also to take into account without departing in provisions were not there the members of the any way from the sovereignty of Parliament and Commission might well say: 'Where do we go to the important role that Parliament must play and find out what we are supposed to do?' We know must continue to play and the emphasis that this we can do some tilings but where are we to go in Government gives to making it play a role and to this Act to find out what we are supposed to do? making it work betterI do not want to get sideWhat does the Government have in mind for tracked into the role of Oppositions and governus?' All clause 20 seeks to do is to assist in that ments in this unfortunate debate-on e also has to regard. recognise that the modern world is so incredibly complex, especially in an industry like the securiwith which honourable members would be famties industry, that the House of Representatives iliar, is a clause which sets out what the Governand the Senate are not really equipped, because ment hopes the IAC will bear in mind as it goes of their history, to go into some of these practical bread and butter day-to-day matters. MrHoward-Oh! the Commission has to be an SEC type body. I have not heard anyone really argue that seriously here. The argument seems to be around the size of the Commission, the extent of its powers or the choice of language used in creating those powers. No one has ever argued that there should not be a statutory corporation type body beyond the Parliament with its day-to-day administration of the system and that it should have a rule making power. The rule making power is set out in clause 20. One has to realise that it is a kind of statement of intent as much as anything else. The language in the clause hardly enlarges the power. It is really a preambular approach. This is becoming increasingly common with parliamentary counsel these days. Of course we know what clause 20 says. It provides that the Commission shall have such functions as are conferred on it by this proposed Act. If the Commission goes outside of the provisions of the proposed Act the normal actions in the courts which can declare invalid a rule making exercise of the Commission, if it is outside of the scope of the proposed Act, and bring it crumbling to the ground. There is surely no problem there. Clause 20 (2) states: It is the duty of the Commission to the extent to which the Parliament has power to confer that duty on the Com-, mission. Again there is strict compliance with an attempt to be legalistic and proper to ensure adequate prescribed corporations. There is not a conferIn the Industries Assistance Commission Act,",61,Pairs

255,Mr Enderby,"No one has ever argued thatabout carrying out its function. Clause 20 provides the same sort of provision. Clause 20. (2) (b) states that the Commission shall maintain effective surveillance over the operations and activities of certain organisations and persons and sub-clause (c) is almost an exhortation to the Commission, I suppose, to be vigorous and active in its work. That is really all that provision does. It does not give the Commission any extra available powers. It states: -tak e such action (including the making of rules under secis addressing himself to the questions as is proper tion 283) as is necessary and available to it In other words the Commission is to act within its powers and the power comes from the proposed Act. It is the proposed Act that we are considering now. As I said, the ultra vires principle stands behind that so it is not a Henry VIII clause. It is ridiculous to suggest it, although it sounds elegant to do so, as the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) said a moment ago. Another aspect also comes into the category. I see that my good friend the honourable member for Moreton has left the chamber. I suppose he has something better to do. He made something of a word that he found going through the Bill, as he is going through it now for the first time, it seems. He found the word 'promote'. for thefirsttime now. gives me. Is it not the impression he gives you? Clause 20 contains a number of sub-clauses. If honourable members have read the Rae Committee report they will know that the sub-clauses are almost all taken right out of the Rae Committee report; certainly (f) is and I am almost certain that (g) is. 'Promote' may not be a lawyers' word. It is synonymous for practical purposes with 'encourage'. To suggest this nasty thought that in some way there is a proprietorial interests, that in some way this Government wants to take over things when all it is doing is bringing into being a body that will regulate this industry in a way that will promote the national interest, the public interest and the interest of investors, to suggest that just because the Commission is called upon to promote the establishment of a national stock market there is something wrong with the word, is stretching the English language. If the honourable member wants to take out 'promote' and insert 'encourage' I would not quibble with him. But I suggest that we are wasting time to talk about it. He is wasting time to raise the subject. 'Promote' means to encourage in that context and no one would argue otherwise. to take up briefly the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford). I have 3 analyses of this Bill including an analysis of this clause and I have discounted most of the suggestions made in them. But I think some have value and are worth being put to the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby). I think in relation to this clause he and I commend him for that. For the honourable member for Adelaide to suggest that we should just jam the Bill through without examination and justification is really letting the cat out of the bag as far as the Government is concerned. We all heard the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) say a while ago: 'You have had it for 90 days'. We have not had it for 90 days because the Attorney General 's amendments to the many questions that I have raised were given only yesterday afternoon. It was only then we knew that he did not propose to change anything in clause 20 or indeed the other clauses on which we take issue. SoI think that it is fair to put that on the record. It is not a question of delaying the legislation. Damn it all, what is a day or two in a matter involving a Bill of this scope and considering the delay there has been? I go back to some of the comments the Attorney-General has just made. What he said perhaps has some validity, but at the beginning of clause 20 (2) it states: It is the duty of the CommissionThat wording tells the Commission what to do. It is not, as he implied, a sort of outline or a bit of encouragement to the Commission to look up this clause to see what it should be attending to. It says: 'It is your duty to do these following things' not 'if you feel like it'. not be? Attorney-General will have the right of reply if he wishes to exercise it. The clause, having stated that it is the duty of the Commission, uses certain words. I point out here that the Attorney General's first line of defence, if I might say so, was that we should not take these words, too seriously. that they appear in the Rae Committee report and after all this was only an indication to the",62,Pairs

264,Mr Garland,"The Attorney-General saidCommission what to do. I have already pointed out that it is charged with duties which include: (f) develop and facilitate the opportunities for persons to participate in the ownership and control of Australian industry by means of collective investment schemes and improve the performance and efficiency of such schemes. 'Develop' is a word which conjures up in some minds a fear of action by this Government. The Attorney-General may say, as he has done, that that is not the intention of the Government but if this Bill is passed it will be the law whatever his intention and it will become a question of what will be the real objectives of the Government. I can assure the Attorney-General that some members of the Opposition have great and grave doubts about that. In paragraph (g) the word 'promote' appears. It is the duty of the Commission to: (g) promote the establishment of a national stock market. How is one to regard that provision when the first objective in the Labor Party's platform calls for the nationalisation of large sectors of Australian industry? The Attorney-General can smile but he knows that is the objective. He knows that it refers to banking and to finance. We have been through this aspect about 1000 times and it cannot be denied. The Attorney General says that 'promote' in this sense really means encourage. That is one meaning of the word, but it has another meaning which is equivalent to the words 'set up'. We are fearful of that meaning and it is not enough for the Attorney-General to say he does not believe in that meaning because, as he knowsI say this with respect-hi s assurances as recorded in Hansard are not law. What is passed in this Bill becomes the law. I accept the Attorney-General's assurances without doubt but I say that they are inoperative and do not have any effect. I suggest that this provision should be looked at. If the introductory words were 'The Commission ought to have these matters in mind' I still would not be happy, but it would be a deal weaker than saying 'It is the duty of the Commission'. I assure the Attorney-General that the Opposition is concerned about this aspect. He talked about its being a statement of intent as though, somehow, that was of less importance. He said that if the Commission went beyond the powers, that would be ultra vires. I do not think he said it, but obviously that would be subject to challenge and this is exactly what we are concerned about-the powers being given to the Commission. We are not presupposing that it will be ultra vires; we are concerned with whether its powers are too wide and will be used by the Commission, with the Government's support, to make incursions that are unjustified but are in accordance with the socialist objective. This is a matter of very clear concern. The honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi) is making noises of disbelief. He is entitled to do so, but I assert that there is much fear in the Opposition that that is the true intention. There is a lot of fear in the Opposition and a lot of fear out in the community. What we are considering in this and many other clauses is not that there should be some power but where the limit of that power should be. We want to see a clearly defined limit. It is not good enough to say that these words were included in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-the Rae Committee. After all it made recommendations in non-legal language. This clause should be amended and made clear. We ask that this Bill and other Bills that the Attorney-General brings forward be clear so that people know what is the law and what is the intention. There should be no doubts about that. should like to add to the comments of the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland) regarding paragraphs (f), (g) and (j) of clause 20. The Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) no doubt has heard of Parkinson's law. His Government has been an avid practitioner of that law during the last 2 years, consequently I honestly question the present formulation of this clause as described in this text. I again emphasise the point made by the honourable member for Curtin, namely, that whatever the Attorney-General may tell us it is not necessarily the law of the land although perhaps he would wish it was at times. Therefore to suggest that this Corporations and Exchange Commission is going to 'develop and facilitate the opportunities for persons to participate in the ownership and control of Australian industry by means of collective investment schemes and improve the performance and efficiency of such schemes' would lead me to suggest one of two things: Either-and this would be a very naive approach-that this Commission is, going to accept the present finance market of Australia, the insurance industry and various other means by which individuals and collective enterprise may invest in stock exchanges and the purchase of shares, debentures and so forth; or, alternatively, that this Commission will set up a new, and in other words, a rival finance organisation. We have seen, in the case of the National Investment Fund, which we debated recently, that this is a trend which clearly runs through the Government's mind when it comes to matters of",63,Pairs
265,Mr Connolly (Bradfield) ( 3 . 4 9 ),"Inational finance. There is no evidence to suggest that the Government is prepared to use the existing market structure. There is considerable evidence to suggest that it wants to set up a rival machine at the insurance industry level, at the banking level and in the total money market structure of Australia.

The finance industry in Australia is viable-a t lapsed because the directors never had enough least it was viable when the economy was in a definancial acumen to place their investments in a cent shape.

No appeal will be available where a grievous error of judgment is made by the Commission. The Attorney-General will not heed my words but I wonder whether he will heed the words of the authentic voice of a great Englishman, Lord Denning, in the first Hamlyn lecture. These words should be carved in some form or another in the office of every civil servant in Australia. This is what Lord Denning said: It should be clearly understood that although the High Court has some degree of control over the tribunals it is not such as to enable it to correct many of the faults or injustices which may arise, unless the Statute gives an appeal. The High Court proceeds' on the footing that if Parliament had thought fit to entrust jurisdiction on all these new matters to new tribunals without any appeal from them, then, so long as the tribunals do not exceed or abuse their jurisdiction, the High Court should not interfere with them. He continued: If a tribunal should come to a wrong conclusion on the facts or, indeed, if there is no evidence on which it could come to its conclusion, the High Court cannot interfere; nor, if the tribunal comes to a wrong conclusion in point of law can the High Court interfere. So long as the tribunal keeps within its jurisdiction, and is not guilty of any flagrantly unjust procedure, its decision is final both on facts and the law. For all practical purposes the High Court in Australia, in relation to this Bill, is placed in a comparable position. I implore the Attorney General, as the one whom I have described as the chief law officer of the country, the parens patri of the country: For heavens sake, provide some appeals provisions that are readily identifiable and will adequately safeguard against the improper use of very grave powers. General) (4.1)-The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) made his first mistake when he said that there was power to delegate. Now he has made his second mistake.

What is wrong with the Government being the final court of appeal? sort. It is typical of Opposition members that they try to bring Government into disrepute. Government has the final sanction behind it, a sanction far more effective than any court or any commission. It has the sanction of public opinion, because it has to face the people at election time.

They always forgot it when they were in government. We never forget it. The honourable member for Moreton is about to leave the chamber, having made his second consecutive mistake.

I would be interested to hear the Attorney-General's comments on that. HSkaterati> (tM)-I consider that the provision is sufficient. The obligation is there to disclose the conflicting interest and a very heavy penalty-$2,00 0 or imprisonment for 6 months-is provided for non-compliance. The clause goes beyond that and deals with other prove. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) may be wondering what follows the disclosure. I put it to him that 2 things suffice to ensure complete protection. The first is the quality and standard of the Commission itself and the job it has to do. The second is the power of government in the ultimate resort and the power of the Governor General acting on the advice of government if necessary to take appropriate action. But more important than either of those things is the fact that one of the amendments that I will be moving will change the part that takes out the prerogative writs. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman knows what I mean. I think he has studied law. The writs of prohibition, certiorari and mandamus will now be part of it, apart from and in addition to where they are enshrined in the Constitution.

It has been noted that clause 34 (2) reads: The Chairman of the Commission has all the powers of, or to say: exercisable by, a Permanent Head under the Public Service Act 1922-1974 so far as those powers relate to the branch of the Australian Public Service comprising the staffreferredto CEC . . . The qualifications required are in line with in sub-section (1) as if that branch were a separate Departthose existing in State and Territory provisions except that a ment of the Australian Public Service. In clause 35, as one would expect, there is reference to the fact that moneys payable to the Commission under this or any other Act shall be collected and received by the Commission on account of, and shall be paid into, the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Clause 36, in dealing with the Commisssion furnishing information to the Attorney-General and the Department, states: (1) If the Attorney-General or either House of the Parliament or a Committee of either House, or of both Houses, of amendment to the Bill having that in mind, or the Parliamentrequiresthe Commission to furnish to him or whether he considers it to be quite unnecessary. to that House or Committee any information concerning the performance of the functions of the Commission under this Act, the Commission shall comply with that requirement. I am wondering how the Audit Act affects the Commission and whether the commissioners are affected as are all other departments and permanent heads who are conscious of the impact of the existence of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. The Minister has set out in his memorandum quite explicit comments in relation to the audit requirements relating to corporations. referring? page 23 of the Bill. I have referred to the chairman of the Commisssion being treated as a permanent head. Clause 35 provides, as one would expect and anticipate, that all moneys payable to the Commission shall be collected and received by the Commission on account of, and shall be paid into, the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Clause 36 deals with committees of either House of the Parliament which would include, for example, the Public Accounts Committee. I am asking where within the Bill is there reference to the effect of the Audit Act and to the Auditor General? Has the Auditor-General and his office been excluded from a relationship with the Commission which would be similar to that which he would have with all the other departments of State? I point out that on page 43 of the explanatory memorandum the Attorney-General has stipulated quite stringent standards in relation to the audit requirements for the corporations. As one would expect, those requirements relate to State and Territory legislation, as has been mentioned, except that an auditor of a registered corporation will need to be registered under this legislation. The memorandum refers to the definition of'registered auditor', and then goes on The function ofregisteringauditors is to be vested in the degree or diploma from a College of Advanced Education is recognised. It seems to me that it would perhaps be reasonable to expect that somewhere in the Bill there would be clarified, in the light of all of these circumstances, the relationship between the Commission and the Auditor-General who is answerable, after all, to the Parliament in his annual report. I would be grateful if the Attorney General would let me know whether that is envisaged, whether he would consider an General) (4.22)-The latter part of what the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Graham) said is the answer to his question, namely, that it is unnecessary. The situation described by the honourable member as it appears in relation to those clauses is part of the public account and is automatically picked up in the Auditor-General's role and the Act under which he operates. It is not necessary to spell it out in this Bill again. It is automatic; it just comes about. The answer is contained in thefinalquestion which the honourable member posed, and that is that it is not necessary. I go on to put to the honourable member that there is always a grey area in the relationship between a Minister and his department, the relationship between a permanent head and his department and indeed between a Minister and his permanent head. I smile as I say that, having had, I think, 7 permanent heads in the short time that I have been a Minister. The relationship depends on the department, of course, and the statutes for which the department or the Minister is responsible. The chairman of the Commission is to stand in relation to the Commission in the same way in which a permanent head stands in relation to his department, and that means that it is his responsibility to see that the department-in the case of the chairman it will be the Commission-work s properly.

309,Mr Enderby (Canberra,"AttorneyThe last point raised by the honourable member concerned the committees of both Houses of the Parliament. I did not read into the honourable member's question that that was in any conflict with his main question. Indeed, I believe that he applauds the general principle behind the proposal. If social circumstances require that a Commission of this sort be set up to regulate the industry in the interests of the capital market and the consumer operating in the industry and if that is outside the scope of Parliament in the direct sense, it is then impractical to do it. No one is arguing otherwise. The task then is to make the Commission responsible to the public interest through the elected body, which is the Parliament. The best way-to do that, of course, is to relate it to the Minister, to the Governor General, to the Parliament as a whole and, indeed, to the committees of the Parliament so that they are all then involved in that situation.

We have just maintained the long established practice that, with those safeguards, the mischief does not exist I think I am correct in saying that the varifrom the practice.

So in that sense we are giving the Staterightistssome encouragement. take up the point that the Attorney-General( Mr argument in respect of the exclusion of a public Enderby) has made. I put to him the view that that is not a good principle, Staterightsor otherwise. I have referred, perhaps somewhat bluntly, to a particular instance which I think proves my case, that is, the prospectus of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. If that is not enough evidence, I do not know what is. I ask for that matter to be looked at because we have now been told that this Bill will go to the Senate and apparently will then come back to this chamber, although I do not know how long it will be here on that occasion.

It Attorney-General, not being either logical or is, after all, a law which exists for somewhat other purposes.

I am merely saying that the justification given by the Attorney-General for excluding public statutory corporations is that that has always been done in the past and there is no strong reason for departing nature of the Australian Industry Development Corporation is something quite different from that of the normal public statutory corporation, such as, for example, the New South Wales Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. I can understand the Attorney-General's statutory corporation such as that, but I do not think that it can seriously be suggested that the AIDC, which is a public statutory corporation, comes out of the same stable as the New South Wales Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, the Sydney County Council or any of the other statutory bodies that issue debentures and raise money from the public. The AIDC is in the business of buying and selling securities in a big way. To that extent to categorise it with the ordinary public statutory corporations and therefore justify the exclusion of all such corporations on the grounds that it has been the practice in the past and there is no good reason for departing from that practice is I think, with respect to the persuasive. look at this provision.

Clauses agreed to. Clause 48. (Reports by registered corporations.) raise a small point. Clause 48 (3) states: Where a registered corporation lodges a repon or other document with the Commission under this section, the corporation shall forthwith send a copy of the repon or document to every registered stock exchange that permits shares in the corporation to be traded on the stock market maintained or provided by the stock exchange. It seems that this sub-clause ought to contain the words 'shares and debentures', or substitute those words for the word 'securities'. I suppose it is a small matter in that only one word is involved. But the fact of the matter is that if this part of the clause is to have the desired effect, surely companies that just have debentures listed, quoted and registered ought to be included in it. Clause agreed to. Clauses 49 to 51-by leave-take n together. wonder whether the Attorney-General( Mr tration. Enderby) has considered an interesting point relating to clause 49 which is concerned with the allotment of shares otherwise than in pursuance of a prospectus. The aim of the clause, as I read it, is to have clarification for the general public to whom the prospectus is made available. Has the Attorney considered the situation that could arise where shares are made available to nominee companies of banks and set out in the prospectus. In such a case the Commission may find itself asking the banks, for whom their own nominee company is in existence, to advise them of the beneficial ownership of the shares? I have always understood that only the Commissioner of Taxation has been able to do that sort of thing in the past and neither the Government nor the Treasury has on any previous occasion in Australian history been prepared to intrude into that sort of field. Could the Attorney answer that question? later I shall come back to it, with leave. cerned with clause 51(1). There seem to be some doubts expressed in stock exchange circles as to whether or not some types of corporations fall within the categories laid down in clause 45. Really, I suppose, what falls within the area and what does not can be determined only by the courts. Yet, it is incumbent on the stock exchange to determine that and to take action. It seems that it is an obligation which is impossible for them to fulfil. I put that to the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) for comment. I can well understand that he would want the stock exchange to do some policing and to put obligations on its members.

General) (4.40)I am sure that the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland) understands the thinking behind the requirement. We all know that it is necessary to have this requirement if the legislation is to be effective.

Is this a set fee for every application or does it have a relationship to the nature of the corporation, the size of it, the capital of it or what? Where will the prescribed fee be found?

The Attorney-General has informed us that we will see legislation in the near future for the establishment of this administrative appeals tribunal but it would seem to me appropriate, if there is a complaint made about a decision of the Commission, that an appeal be made to that body.

I take the honourable member's point with regard to clauses 59 and 60 about the possible advantage of providing an appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal. I will not give an assurance at this time but we will certainly keep the matter under consideration. The difficulty, as the honourable member for Moreton would appreciate, is in attempting to achieve a balance. One wants this Commission to be a working body. One wants it obviously to be able to bring about the same improvements in the Australian securities industry as the famous Securities and Exchange Commission of the USA. brought about in the US. securities industry over a long period of time. One has, at the same time, to ensure that the rights or corporate bodies and the rights of individuals are properly safeguarded. It is a matter of balance. One does not want to put the Commission into shackles but yet one does not want to offend unnecessarily. I have to say that myfirstreaction to the honourable member's question is that sufficient safeguards appear in the legislation. I will give the honourable member an assurance that we will certainly look at the matter again, particularly when the administrative appeals tribunal comes into existence. I could follow up the point which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) made. Taking the spirit of the comments just made by the Attorney-GeneralI might say that my comments will be quite brief but they are directed to the same area. To some extent the criticisms that I was about to make have been diminished by the assurances of the Attorney-General that at least he will examine the area of appeal. As it stands without an appeal clauses 59 and 60 are far-reaching. I will not make any additional comments to those made by the honourable member for Moreton about clause 60. But clause 59, when taken into conjunction with other clauses in this Bill, creates a breadth of power which is really quite startling. I think one must say that. We have already referred to clause 20. There is no need to repeat it except to say that clause 20 related to the functions and duties of the Commission. We did remark, in dealing with clause 20, how broad those functions were in their description. We find similar breadth in respect of clause 59-the power of the Commission to require amendments to constituent documents of registered stock exchanges. The breadth of power, for example, is indicated in clause 59(1) which, in thefirst3 lines, states: Where the Commission, after making inquiries and investigations as mentioned in section 58, is of the opinion that it is desirable that a change be made in the constituent documents of a registered stock exchange, the Commission may . . . It goes on to set out the powers of the Commission. I simply ask the Attorney-General: Why was it not possible in framing the objects of this legislation to set out criteria which were appropriate to exercise the Commission's discretion under clause 59? It says merely that it is 'desirable '. My point simply is that in framing this legislation was it not possible to set out criteria whereby it was determined when it was desirable. As I say, the problem is partly overcome if, indeed, there is an administrative appeal. If there is not, then that power is indeed very wide. It may not be abused but there is no appeal to ensure that it will not be abused. If one examines clause 59 (3) one sees a similar breadth-agai n I read only part of the clause-whic h gives the Commission power to have regard to the rules of the Commission and states: . . . may make provision for and in relation to any matter relating to the constitution of the stock exchange or the activities or conduct of the stock exchange or of its members or of other persons who are permitted to trade in securities on the stock market maintained or provided by the stock exchange. . . . The breadth of that again is great when one reads it in conjuction with clause 283, to which I will not refer when we come to it but which specifically refers to the rules of the Commission and says: Subject to this section, the Commission may make rules, not inconsistent with this Act or the regulationsOne should pause there to say that as the proposed Act is so broad the scope of the Commission is great indeedfor or in relation to(a) any matter in respect of which the Commission is permitted by sub-section 59 (3) to make rules; As I have said, clause 59 (3) is so broad that it has a very full run indeed. Clause 284 relates to regulations. AgainI mention this simply because it is all part of the package of powers which the Commission is to have under the Bill. Clause 284 reads: The Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters that are required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed or are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving, effect to this Act. . .

338,Mr Macphee (Balaclava) (4.51),"Perhapsthere certainly was not when we had to consider this Bill, adequate appeal procedure, then the powers are so broad as to suggest that the Government did not have a clear idea of what it intended this Commission to do. It was giving the Commission inordinate powers. As a safeguard perhaps the Government made clause 59 (4) very broad so that by regulation the rules of the Commission might be contained in some way. At the same time it was basically leaving everyone without the power of appeal other than the possible disallowance of regulations by the Senate, and as we all know the present situation in which. the Opposition has control over the Senate does not always obtain. I think I have made my point sufficiently without amplifying it except to say that there is a package of power which has caused alarm. The absence of powers of review again has caused alarm. One would have thought that the Government could have been more specific in its intention and could have set out the criteria in clause 59 (1). It certainly should have left more power with this Parliament to amend by legislation rather than to have amendment by regulation. refer to the point which the honourable member action, a lot of heartache would have been saved for Moreton( Mr Killen) raised on 2 occasions in this country in the 1969 boom.

The exchanges either of those norms are exceeded or until explanatory have asked for explanations and the answers information is received and published. AllI am suggesting is that if the trip-point had been reached in the Poseidon affair on thefirstor second day of trading the Commission would have stepped in and said: 'You have a margin of 15 per cent. If you trigger that trip-point trading will be suspended until we are satisfied that the board of directors or whoever it is that is trading in the shares is acting in the best interests'. If that had occurred the Poseidon scandal would never have reached any proportions at all. I put this to chamber honestly and sincerely. On the sheer mechanics of this, if the Commission or even the stock exchange is not given the power which the New York Stock Exchange has it will mean that should appeals arise people in similar situations to those in the Poseidon affair will be able to get away with exactly the same sort of scandal. though? proposed Commission as one ought to have in these matters.

General) (5.3)I think that many of the expressions of concern that come from honourable members opposite will disappear if the relationship that one assumes will come into being between the Corporations and Exchange Commission and the industry does come into being. Honourable members opposite assume hostility. It seems to be implicit in their comments that there will be some kind of detective or police role and nothing else in the type of role to be played by this Commission. The Government certainly sees it as being something much more than that, and that is why expressions of exhortation, if you like, were put into the legislation to encourage the industry to do this and to do that to protect the investor and not just simply to punish people. I have to say that if one considers the powers of the exchanges as they exist today one sees that they are in the hands of the members of the exchanges. I know that there is a school of thought that says 'Let it be; that is the way it should be'; but I personally do not accept that point of view one little bit. I take another view, and honourable members would have heard me put it often in this place in connection with questions and debates concerning other occupations and certainly other professions. I suppose it can be summed up in very exaggerated form in that old saying of George Bernard Shaw that every profession is a conspiracy against laymen. The occupational groups, although they often say sincerely that they serve the interests of the wider public, because they are occupational groups or professional groups often cannot avoid having their own interests at heart. The danger of it, of course, is not that they abuse their position sometimes; the danger is that they are sometimes seen to beabusing their position, that justice just is not the Bill. We have spelt out all the safeguards seen to be done. There is disquiet, uncertainty, confusion and concern of the public, often expressed through financial journalists, that they are a bunch of shysters who have to be handled roughly because otherwise they will not put thenhouse in order. It is the appearance of things that creates half the danger. If that is the situation that in part has to be put right, the Commission, as I see it, will have very considerable rapport with the industry. I went to some pains earlier in the debate to course means the Government-to deal with this emphasise that the people who will be put on the prohibition problem in relation to trading on the Commission must be acceptable to the industry. If that rapport can be brought about so that it is a constant exchange of ideas and a constant friendly association, all the fears that are sometimes touched on in debate, I think, fall to the ground. I put it to honourable members that as people sitting here almost in a vacuum, looking out as to what might be the situation in the future, imagination sometime runs riot. But the Government has put considerable thought into the Bill, as I think it testifies, trying to provide safeguards and trying to achieve the right balance. One cannot prescribe everything that might happen in the future. This Bill already contains nearly 300 clauses. It would have 1,000 clauses if we tried to provide for every contingency. We would get into enormous difficulties. Neither can we have a simple Bill of Rights or Ten Commandments type situation leaving, say, commissioners or judges to fill out the legislation because we would not know what they would do. I put it to honourable members that a very satisfactory compromise has been reached in this measure. On the question of public interest, of necessity the Commission has a rule making power. I heard it said that it is cumbersome because in some circumstances 44 days could elapse before a rule could be made and actually become effective. That is good in my view because rules are lawmaking processes of a sort. That is not a bad thing; it is a good thing. If we had allowed the Commission to make rules on the spur of the moment we would have had criticism of a different sort. However, the rules can be disallowed in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. They can be disallowed on a motion of the House of Representatives. To provide an extra safeguard, if one is looking for safeguards, we have the other regulation making power of the Governor General which can override the rule making power. So there is ample precaution in with, I think, liberal provision for appeal as well. listened to the remarks of the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) in relation to clause 60 and the comments that were made earlier by the honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi).

He is creating a situation which will give a good deal of what-ho in the market because he seems to have forgotted that a stock exchange is a marketplace. All it needs is for someone to say: ' I say, old boy, have you heard the news today? The Attorney-General is going to prohibit trading in such and such a stock and it will be at a certain level on the market'. What happens then if the Attorney-General has to change his mind in three or four weeks time after an investigation? What would be the price level at which the stock would go back on to the market? Here is an opportunity for some really smart operatorsmost of whom are not lawyers, I remind the honourable member for Hawker-to get into a situation where they could make a cool fortune, whether they are in the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the Australian Country Party.

It is within the power of the Crown to make such an assertion. Under the provisions of this Bill the Attorney-General may find that there is a risk of starting rumours. The Government does not appear to me to have provided for it to be an offence to start rumours which have an effect on the marketplace by announcing that the Commission or the Government is moving to prohibit trading in a certain stock. I would have thought that this needed to be done. I bring it to the attention of the Attorney-General because I think it is worthy of consideration. I suggest to him that if he ignores it, he is likely to have some really fascinating circumstances in 1976. to the point that was being made by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Macphee) on the use of the word 'desirable' in clause 59 (1). I submit to the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) that he really did not answer that criticism adequately. It is of no use talking about the Government havingfinepeople with rapport because we have had too much experience in the last 2 years of where that has led us, though I cerwho are to be appointed will be jolly good feltainly agree with him that it is tremendously important to choose the right people. Indeed, I referred to that in my speech in the second reading debate. In view of the assurances the Attorney-General has given us about that, if not the history of his administration as Minister for Manufacturing Industry, I hope he makes the appointments and not the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). It is not really enough to say that a satisfactory compromise has been made. He is not even listening to me, so what is the use of talking? ance of the honourable member for Wakefield. It is not really enough to say that we cannot provide for every situation. The Bill contains words which are so wide that they could mean anything. If we say, 'A commissioner, after making inquiries and investigations, is of the opinion that it is desirable', we are opening up the door fully, we are not inhibiting anybody one little bit. We are not laying down any criteria to say where people should be limited. We are saying whatever they want to do they may do. It really would not result in hundreds of additional clauses. It would result in only about half a page, I would suggest, to inhibit these activities to some degree. I said in relation to earlier clauses, and it is equally applicable to these clauses, that the in the debate on the clauses of this Bill.

It is not a justification of the clause for the Minister to say: 'We have to make the powers wide because we do not know how to inhibit actions properly and anyway, the fellows lows and we can trust them'. That really is not a good enough defence. That is in paraphrase what he told us.

At the moment the power is exercised-to use the ugly word 'power'by the exchanges. They are not accountable to the public interest at all. I saw a number of honourable gentlemen on the opposite side nodding when I said that occupational groups whether they be trade unions, professional associations or employers' associations, often of necessity are obliged to put thenown interests first rather than the wider social interest. No one can argue against that, and that includes the stock exchanges. We know that they have the powerI am using the ugly, abrasive and naked word that we often run away from. They are not accountable to the public interest at all. That is why they are criticised and that is why, when the abuses and the scandals broke, the whole industry was brought in to disrepute. They were seen to have the power and they were subsequently seen not to be doing much about it. Whether they claim that they were doing the right thing or not doing the right thing, the public saw them as not doing the right thing. Surely it is better to give the power to a body that is publicly accountable; that has to present an annual report to the Parliament; that has a Minister responsible for it who will be answerable to the Parliament for what the body does or does not do; and that has a rule-making power that can be overridden by this Parliament. None of these restrictions is possible with the exchanges as they exist at the moment. Under these provisions, a regulation-making power will be given to the Governor General. Again, the Parliament will be able to overrule that. That will be coupled with a generous system of appeals. None of these exists at the moment to soften or cushion the power of the exchanges. If one really wanted to say what was the best that could be done to advance the interest of the Australian security industry in the capital market one would have to say: 'Make it -publicly accountable in this way and avoid the criticism that is continually directed at it'. to the point I was trying to make to the Attorneyclauses. In the Attorney-General's remarks, he General earlier. WhilstI appreciate much of his directed himself to a criticism of the establishargument, I cannot help but suspect that the ment of a commission. He attempted to justify whole emphasis of this Bill is on the assumption the existence of such a commission. That is not in of guilt;, that the stock exchanges have been dispute. I agree with all the objectives he said wrong per se and therefore it is necessary to were desirable; they are desirable. It is desirable introduce this legislation. I think the Minister to inhibit the Commission, to provide powers, would agree with me that the circumstances surand so on. But that is not the point. The point is rounding the last mining boom were unique. whether or not the power to be given to the ComThey certainly have not occurred for a very great mission is too wide. I return to the words 'It is length of time. The same mining boom showed quite clearly that the stock exchanges as then organised were not capable of meeting the requirements of the hour. But there is a distinction between the capacity of the stock exchanges to do the job as we now think they should have done it and the real problem of protecting the investor from himself. I do not see how a man who wishes to gamble can be stopped from putting money on a racehorse any more than he can be stopped from putting money in a share. This is a human weakness, a failing, that we all have. Probably many of us put money in mining shares during the days of the mining boom and, undoubtedly, many of us lost. I want to make that point clear because, in relation to clause 60 (1), I still do not understand and I do not think anyone else in this chamber understands, on the basis of the explanation given so far, precisely what the role of the Commission will be in relation to the stock exchange. The Minister has said that he expects a close and good relationship to exist, and so on. However, it seems to me that the exchange will be given no authority over its members, and no authority over its own market placeI emphasise that it will still be the market place of the exchange which will be used-and I think that honourable members deserve specific answers to these questions. touches on an important matter. I am sorry to repeat myself but it is necessary as a result of what the Attorney-General said. thought it rather interesting that the Attorney General seemed to assumeI think he said it twice-that the passing of this proposed legislation will improve public confidence in the stock market.

I am sorry to interrupt my colleague but I have to take the point of order immediately. I was clearly of the impression that we were dealing with only 2 clauses, 59 and 60.

Ministerial Statement and Property and Leader of the House)-by leave I regret that it is necessary for me to make an explanation in connection with additional staff assistance to members of Parliament, but I do so because of certain misleading and false reports which have appeared in the daily newspapers in most States. Yesterday the Government approved of a proposal that each senator and member of the House of Representatives be permitted to engage additional assistance as required in their electoral office within the financial limitation of an annual amount not exceeding the base salary payable to an electorate secretary, which at this stage is $7,353 per annum. The provision of this extra assistance will be available from 1 March 1975, and an amount of $2,500 will be available to each senator and member for the balance of the financial year 1974-75 for this employment purpose. The type of electorate assistance required and the personnel selected will be a matter for decision by the individual senator or member. This is a long overdue reform as the staff entitlement of a member has not been increased for more than 30 years-as a matter of fact, since December 1944.

It is a clause which I hope would never be resorted to by any government, 61. The Governor General may, where he considers it or desirable to do so for the protection of persons buying or selling securities or in the interests of the public, by notice in writing to a registered stock exchange(a) prohibit all trading of securities on the stock market maintained or provided by the stock exchange; or (b) prohibit trading on the stock market maintained or provided by the stock exchange of securities, or of securities included in a class of securities, specified in the notice, during such period as is specified in the notice. The power is clear. It means that the Governor General could shut down an entire stock exchange. I hope that nobody will be misled. This is not some expression of gubernatorial solicitude for the investor or the company. This power means that a government could shut down an entire stock exchange, because it is the conventional rule that the Governor General acts on the advice of his Ministers, although it is tralian Labor Party, Dr Evatt, observed that surely it is wrong to assume that the Governor General is a mere tool in the hands of the dominant political party. For all practical purposes, one may say that this proposed section would give to a government a power to shut down-indefinitely , mark you-a n entire stock exchange. It is not a case of suspending from trading one company. It is not a case of questioning the professional or commercial ethics of any person or any group of people.

For my part, if I had the numbers at my disposal in this chamber, quite apart from any instinct on the question, I would throw the clause out completely because it is not a clause which lends itself in any way to ready assessment of a set of circumstances which would justify its use. I ask the Attorney-General to tell the Committee what is within his contemplation as to the circumstances in which he, as the chief law officer in the country, would say to the government, and the government would make a decision: 'We believe that the Brisbane Stock Exchange should be shut'.

It is a concept which we find incorporated in much legislation. What the term jects and says: 'When it can be'. I am telling him in fact means is that the Labor Government, when it was. lilywhite as it is, would not consider doing anything which was not in the interests of the public. I put to the House a case in point. It could involve Broken Hill Pty Co.

General) (5.50)-The points of view put forward by members of the Opposition probably go as far as anything that has been said today to illustrate the fundamental difference between members of the Liberal and Country parties and members of the Labor Party. I am not trying to be provocative. I see that Opposition members are nodding their heads. After a bad start the debate has gone reasonably well for a little while. I shall try to put to the House the way in which the Government sees the situation. What is envisaged is an extreme power to be exercised and it would be exercised only in an extreme emergency. This matter has been touched on by speakers from both sides of the House, but it is a power that exists at the moment in the private stock exchanges. They can invoke such a power. I have to cover some of the ground that I but I think that this is an adequate and eminently covered at an earlier stage in the debate. We suitable way of doing so. I am not impressed with place the public interest extremely high. We be the argument of the honourable gentleman who lieve strongly that it is far too important to leave said: 'Suppose a situation arose between General matters of this sort to a small occupational group Motors and Dr Cairns, as Deputy Prime Miniswhich conducts its affairs in secret through a syster, in which, arising out of pique, annoyance or tem of committees. Whether it is one committee something else, the Government acted in some or 2 committees, no one knows. One cannot find way?' out unless one is on the stock exchange, hears some gossip or rumour, or has read a book on the subject, which expresses only an opinion anyway. I cannot find out what is the situation. There institution, in far more esteem than that. In fact, is a corporate veil of a sort beyond which the if I were to be given a free choice between the public interest cannot penetrate at the moment. captains of industry-the y are all good men-and In placid times, in even times, probably no great the men of any party which leads our country, harm comes from it, and yet we know that there whether it be the Liberal Party of Australia, the are times when great harm comes from it.

It goes beyond that. From time to time one of the Australian Government and who lead the reads that trading on a particular security has country. I would give far more esteem and status been stopped. The reason it has been stopped is to them because they are more responsible genthat to allow it to continue on the market would erally. They are elected and they have public be to run the risk of people being hurt and injured by losing money. Sometimes they could lose very large sums of money. Sometimes it could have consequential adverse effects on innocent people. At the moment the power to say whether the trading on a security should stop or should not stop is given to a group of often anonymous people who are not elected by the public in the same way as we are elected as politicians. Often such people buy seats on the stock exchange and grow up in the ways that are peculiar to the industry. Behind their closed doors they make their decisions which are not open to public scrutiny at all. They are criticised because they do not make a decision when often it is thought proper that they should. We believe that decisions of this sort should be brought into the open. They should be, insofar as it can be done practicably, made subject to public scrutiny. We do not want to create any monstrous bureaucratic nightmare any more than anybody else does. But the power which we seek in this Bill is already in existence. It is in the hands of a hidden, secret bureaucracy which is not accountable to anyone or anything except its own self interest. I see that the honourable member for Bradfield is about to ask me a question. this public examination? House is that the exercise of this extreme power should be in the public hands.

396,Mr Enderby,"I hold this Parliament, thisopinion behind them all the time. For example, to come back to, with respect, the absurd example that the honourable gentleman gave, if this power were to be exercised it would obviously have to be considered by the full Cabinet. There are 27 Ministers in the present Cabinet. Every one of them is accountable to this Parliament and every one of them is accountable to the people outside through the media. There would be a Cabinet decision, with all the safeguards that go with that, to put up a recommendation to the Executive Council, which would give effect to it. It is obviously a power that would be exercised only in extreme situations, but at least its use is publicly accountable. in the House? Opposition could take action in respect of it.

If the power were abused it could in some circumstances bring down the government-and rightly so. There may be other alternatives, such as the various measures that the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested, but I put it to honourable members that given the safeguards and given the fact that the power now exists we are only subjecting the exercising of the power to democratic controls. That is all we are doing in writing such a provision into this legislation in this way. I turn to the point about when it might be exercised.

He said that if that was contemplated of course there would be a Cabinet meeting of 27 Ministers who were revincing. The Attorney-General will find when he sponsible, responsive and so on.

That was a pretty serious event. ing and selling securities there are certainly other So one does get to the position of asking really aspects from those that I mentioned. under what conditions one would expect the Government to advise the Governor General to close down the stock exchanges of this country. What motives would a government have? What objectives would it have for doing such a thing? The Attorney-General's better argument was: Attorney-General to take into account the 'Look, the stock exchanges themselves could present character of drafting of clause 65. This close themselves down. If they can do it and they provision gives to the Commission a power to have a certain amount of public accountability cancel or to suspend a stock exchange from all surely to heaven governments should have the forms of activity if the stock exchange has, in the right to do it'.

406,Mr Killen (Moreton) (8.7),"I invite theto take adequate steps. There should be the plainest obligation upon the Commission to say in what respects it has failed. I am sure that the Attorney-General will understand that if a charge is made against any person one is entitled to particulars. If the Commission makes a charge against a registered stock exchange and says: 'You haved repeatedly failed to take steps to enforce the business rules', the obligation should be there-and it should be observed-for particulars to be given. This is not asking too much because the consequences are immense. It is not good enough to make a suspension or-indeed , worse-to make a cancellation and then to seek to repair the damage. It could well be that a hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under sub-clause 8 of clause 65, which deals with appeals to that Tribunal, may result in the Tribunal, on hearing arguments on the point asking what was the basis, what was the nature of the particulars. I would hope that before this debate is over I will be able to take the honourable the Attorney General to thatsplendid and lively state of reasonableness that he protests he already commands. I am not asking for anything unreasonable. I am merely asking that where there is a complaint made by the Commission against a stock exchange particulars be given and that those particulars .be taken into account. The other observation I make on the clause is that there should not be that final act of suspension or of cancellation until the appellate provisions have been exhausted. Damage could be done and it could be very hard to undo. General) (8.10)I rise to take up one point that was made by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen). I wrote down his words: ' If there is an infringement there must be a sanction'. I accept the admission because the present state of our law provides no such sanction. Mr KillenI do not argue with that. the honourable member said because implicit in everything honourable members on the other side of the House have said on this subject is a suggestion that in some way we are creating a system that is worse than the present system. The fact remains that the present system gives all the powers about which the honourable member expressed concern to this Commission. The present system has the powers in the hands of unrepresentative, unelected, anonymous people-peopl e who conduct their affairs behind closed doors and who are not accountable to anyone but themselves. If they infringe what is right; if they engage in what is wrong, no one has a sanction. The history of the last few years of the Australian stock exchanges bears that out. The testimony of the Rae Committee bears it out. There is no sanction. How often have we heard in this House and in the Senate suggestions that the closed committee that reflects its own interests does not really do anything to discipline its members who are guilty of all sorts of offences? What the Government seeks to do is to make the conduct of the exchanges accountable to the public interest. They are not accountable to the-public interest at the moment. All manner of safeguards are provided which do not exist now. None of the safeguards that honourable members opposite say should exist, exists now. We are providing in this Bill many safeguards that do not exist now. As the honourable member for Moreton reminds me, they can do that. Of course they can do that. MrKillen-Who? my good friendI have to remind him because he has not really read the Bill-that if he examines clause 65 (7) he will see a provision which states: Subject to any order of the Administrative Appeals TribunalThe one to which the honourable member for Moreton referreda decision of the Commission to cancel or suspend the.registration of a registered stock exchange takes effect on the expiration of such day as is specified in the notice given to the stock exchange under sub-section (6), being a day not earlier than 14 days after the giving of the notice. A lot of safeguards are built in. Sure, I would agree that one could say it should be this way of that way. No safeguards exist at the moment at all. If one looks at the mischief that we are trying to put right one sees an absence of safeguards. If one looks at the remedy the Government is proposing we see plenty of safeguards. That is the simple point, surely. May I also say to the honourable gentleman that implicit in the language of clause 65 is the proposition that if the Commission decides to cancel or suspend the registration of a stock exchange-somethin g that can happen already-it has to give reasons for the decision. No such reasons have to be given now under the existing law. Under this clause there will be adequate protection for a registered stock exchange.

The additional good feature-it is quite exciting for those of us who have considered the absence of uniformity in administrative law in this country for so many years-is that with the emergence of the administrative appeals tribunal for the first time Australia will have some regular set of guidelines and a minimum set of standards by which tribunals of this sort must conduct themselves. If they depart from those minimum standards then a remedy will be given to the injured person. Clauses agreed to. Clauses 66 to 81-by leave-take n together. queries I raise. I am not raising one of the points out of a sense of obstinancy but of Irish persistence, a quality which I regret to say the Attorney-General does not quite understand but which the honourable member for Grayndler and the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) does understand. Mr HurfordI always thought that 'Enderby' was an Irish name. race very well. I come back to the definition of a stockbroker. Under clause 66 (1) dealing with licences reference is made to dealers in securities. The point I make to the Attorney-General is a short one. It is not only stockbrokers who deal in securities. There are companies which buy securities and there are companies which sell securities. Even though the Attorney-General this afternoon asserted, I thought, with rather boundless enthusiasm, that there was no State securities Act which defines 'stockbrokers' I in my Spartan simplicity brought in here the Acts of the New South Wales Parliament and there was the definition of'stockbroker'. Of course, the honourable gentleman may have a rather jaundiced view of my motives and of"" my attitudes but I repeat that I am here to help. I would hope the Attorney-General would at long last come to the realisation that one of the significant gaps in the Bill is the fact that in the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill, of all forms of legislation, it is not defined what is meant by 'stockbroker'. There it is. I would hope, during the slumbers of the evening, that the Attorney-General may come to a realisation that there may have been something in the proposition put to him so simply, so fervently, by the honourable member for Moreton. That is the first observation I make on that clause because I think it points up again the deficiency in the Bill. The second observation I make is this: Why is there only 30 days for registration after this Bill is proclaimed and translated into law? It is not merely out of consideration of those who will be involved; it is a consideration of those civil servants of the country who will have to deal with the matter. It would seem to me to be more in accord with realism if the Government were to extend' that period of 30 days to 60 days. It is an entirely personal observation. I think that 60 days would enable the processing to be done with greater measure of reasonableness than would be possible with the 30 days. remarks are exclusively and briefly directed to clause 71 which governs the grant of licences by the Commission. I simply inquire of the Attorney-General whether it would not be an act of grace and an act of recognition of the status of existing stock exchanges, and whether the Attorney-General might give consideration to the suggestion that members of existing stock exchanges be given, in the absence of good reasons to the contrary, in effect an automatic grant of a licence. I think there is something which is capable of odium attaching to a procedure whereby every single member of an existing stock exchange, even those with an impeccable reputation, should feel that their right to carry on their profession is in some way in dispute. General) (8.19)-The 30 days period mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) is a matter of personal opinion. I would have thought that, with the enormous amount of publicity being given to this measure and the publicity that will continue to be given to it, there could hardly be a dealer (stockbroker) in the country who does not know that legislation of this sort is in train, and that the 30-day period would be sufficient. On the other hand I can well understand the honourable member thinking that 60 days might be a more generous period. The Government will watch it very closely. in my ears from dealing with some of my clients. being paid? In reply to the other point made by him, I have to admit that the thought which entered his head and to which he gave expression here today crossed my mind as well. However, of course, it is put that one has to create an objective yet flexible set of qualifications for the licensing procedures.

I imagine that is what is in the honourable member's mind. The matter is under review. At the moment the balance leans heavily towards a fresh start. There is nothing offensive in a person saying he is qualified. The mere fact that a person has carried on his occupation for so many years speaks for itself and it is largely a pro forma matter. I take the honourable member's point. As I said, we are trying to be flexible in this matter and we will keep it under review. speak to clause 70, which relates to the appliwho have been restored.

423,Mr Macphee (Balaclava) (8.27),"I refer toclause 90.1 do not wish to do other than to say that this clause, on the face of it, raises some perplexing problems but there may be a simple answer to them. I do not wish to do anything other than to bring the Attorney-General's attention to the fact that in practice the clause may be more difficult to implement than appears on the surface. I think in particular of clause 90 (2) (a) (i). It provides a 3-day period before which the dealer will deposit certain documents referred to in that clause. I ask the Attorney General: What is the objection to deposit of securities for loan if the client in fact gives permispenalty for a contravention or breach of that sion? I see no reason why there should be a 3-day period. There may be some reason but it is not apparent. In sub-clause (3) again there is almost the opposite situation where there is almost a 7-day period of grace for the dealer. I wonder why it is not proper for the documents to be withdrawn if in fact the deposit is made immediately from funds which are paid from the client into the general account. I make no further point than that. practical point on clause 91(2). I am quite aware of the enormous desirability of having such a requirement. Having handled and continuing to handle trust moneys I fully understand the desirabihty. I just wonder whether the apparent automatic penalty imposed by sub-clause (5) could perhaps be ameliorated by the inclusion of some words to the effect of 'without reasonable cause'. I am just a little concerned at the sort of holiday situation that might possibly arise where for extremely good reason a payment of moneys that ought to be held in trust is delayed beyond the requirement in sub-clause (2). I think the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) understands the practical point to which I am alluding. General) (8.32)-Dealing with the last point first, the Government is acutely aware of the importance to be attached to the concept that trust accounts should be kept separate; in other words, that an agent's moneys should be kept separate from the moneys of his client, whether the agent be a solicitor, stock-broker or dealer, to go back to a dispute I had earlier with my friend the honourable member for Moreton( Mr money to bet on a racehorse, to build a house, to Killen). Otherwise there is chaos and a lowering of business morality. There can be little doubt that battles were fought and won several hundred years ago on this principle. We wish to extend such principles into this legislation to cover a field where they do not exist at the moment and where it is widely believed that abuses exist. One has to declare principles in legislation, as they exist everywhere else, in the nature of an offence. First the duty is set out, then the breach of the duty and then that an offence exists if there is a breach of the duty. So it is set out. First is the duty that is brought to the attention of the dealer that he shall pay into account all moneys held by him in trust for his client and keep them separate from his own. Surely there can be nothing but applause for that. Sub-clause (5) provides the duty. This provision is similar to provisions contained in legal practitioners' ordinances and Acts all around Australia, as I remember them. I see nothing wrong with it. There may be occasional cases where a man says, ' I am sorry, I made a mistake', or ' I forgot' or ' I mixed them up, I will not do it again'. In such cases there is first the discretion of a prosecutor, an informant in any system of law, whether to lay a charge, to bring proceedings under this or any other legislation. That is the first safeguard. The second safeguard of course is the discretion of the presiding officer above the prosecutor not to offer evidence. This safeguard exists in any system of law, including our own. Finally there is the magistrate or the judge beyond that Surely one cannot argue in this day and age that it is not important to remind brokers and dealers that they must keep their funds separate from the funds of their clients. That is all I have to say to the point raised by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard). The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Macphee) raised a point in relation to clause 90. That clause contains an attempt by the Government to deal with a current abuse, something that in the world of law is taken for granted as being wrong, namely, a pledging of someone's else's securities to raise money on one's own behalf. To lawyers nothing could be more axiomatic. Nothing could be so palpably wrong and wicked and deserving of punishment. It would be wrong for an agent, a solicitor or a stockbroker in possession of securities on behalf of a client with an obligation to do the r'ght thing by him, behind his back and without his knowledge, to pledge them at the agent's bank to raise pay his golf fees of whatever the purpose happens to be. That sort of conduct is forbidden in every other area of law. We seek to forbid it here. I suppose it comes back once again to the fact that this area of activity, the securities industry,",89,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

I certainly agree with honourable members that one could argue about the form of and agreed to. the words. There are always a dozen different ways to write what one wants to write but the gist of the provision is that the dealer who receives documents of title to securities for safe custody must cause them to be registered and if requested (2) Sub-section (1) does not preclude a person purchasing by the client, to deposit them with a bank. Runor selling securities or causing or procuring the purchase or ning through the whole scheme of things is that sale of securitiesthe client must be told of what is done.

Quite often one would get competing equities in a situation like that. I hate to put my mind to what it would take to resolve such conflicts. This legislation at least seeks to Clause 90 gives effect to the view that the pledgGeneral) (8.41)I move: ing by dealers of clients' documents of title should be subject to strict controls. Clearly the complies with the prescribed requirements'. dealer should not be permitted to pledge such This is a simple, almost procedural, amendment documents for his own purpose if the client is not to enable the making of regulations to regulate indebted to the broker and has not consented. the conditions under which a broker can act as a Even if the client is indebted to the dealer there principal in the ordinary course of trading on the should not be an automatic right to pledge withstock market.

I merely say that where the client comes within the provisions of the sub-clause I just do not see why he should have the 3-day period involved. It seems an anomaly.

It is interesting to note that a couple of provisions. I suggest that the followsince 1969forbid ing paragraphs should be added to clause 115: explicitly (c) is a dealers representative under clause 69; or (d) is a licensed investment adviser under clause 68 (1).

436,Mr Jacobi (Hawker) (8.53),"Like the reverseshould like to add some words to what has already been said regarding the discriminatory aspects of clause 115. Again we have heard, as we heard before the suspension of the sitting for dinner-it is a point that I then had to make and I make it again-that much of this legislation is apparently couched in terminology which presumes that there is a degree of default. Again we have heard the rnining boom taken as an example. As I said earlier, there is no question that the situation as pertained then was most unsatisfactory in many respects. Certainly I am well aware that stock exchanges in Australia-certainl y the Sydney Stock Exchange, with which I am more familiar-hav e made substantial changes in their regulatory procedures and so forth, specifically to try to overcome many of the problems which have been raised in the Rae report and elsewhere. For example, at present every member company of an exchange is required at the bottom of its statement which is sent out to clients on a monthly basis, to state quite clearly the company's interest in the shares that it is recommending to clients. Perhaps the Attorney General regards this as being pretty basic, and I think it is, but the point is that it is a real step forward. I think that it is frankly absurd to suggest that only brokers who are members of boards are to be regarded as something different from any other section of thefinanceindustry which, as the Attorney-General is well aware, has very wide ramifications. For example, if the merchant banks are doing their job they are at least as aware of the financial relationships of their clients as is any broker if he is doing his job. To say that a broker-no t a broker's employee so much as a specific member of a company which is a member of an exchange-shoul d be denied what I regard to be a not unreasonable interest in companies which he presumably has been asked to join because of his knowledge, is to suggest that the corporate body of Australia, which already does not have that much talent, is to be deprived even of the additional potential of getting good people from the stock exchange. I draw a distinction between what I have just involved in the capital markets. In fact, all of said and the point made by the previous speaker, these people have conflicts of interest. the honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi), that some brokers-allegedl y again during the period of the mining boom-were lowing proposals: Firstly, that a dealer who, associated with companies specifically estabtogether with associated companies, owns more lished to trade in other people's shares. I think than, say, 50 per cent of the shareholding in a we need to make a distinction between that sort registered corporation shall not be permitted to of operation and what is obviously a bone fide be a director of that corporation without the case. Sir Ian Potter was mentioned by the specific approval of the Commission; secondly, honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) as the son of gentleman who would be an asset to any board of directors. It is absurd to suggest that such people, with considerable qualifications as he has, should be denied the opportunity to make a very real contribution to the corporate life of the community. We have also heard much about the idea that a lot of this legislation allegedly is drawn from the previous American experience. I wonder whether that is the case. Professor Louis Loss, who was brought here last year by the Government to give it advice on this very Bill, was asked the following question: Does the SECThat is the American bodyhave any views on a broker being a director of a company? The Professor's reply was: As far as I know, and I am quite sure that it does not, it is not suggested that brokers have to go off boards. Nor has there been any great movement that I am aware of in point of fact whereby brokers have gone off boards. But the insider trading laws that the courts have been developing in recent years nave made it rather uncomfortable sometimes for brokers to be on boards. The SEC was reaslistic enough to say in a prepared report of some 10 years ago that it is impossible to avoid all conflicts of interest in the securities industry. That is the experience in the United States of America. We have heard from the Attorney General and others how this Bill is supposed to follow that experience. This is one classic instance in which quite obviously the Bill has not done so. I cannot help but deduce from that that the Government is making a very subjective judgment on the basis of a series of specific cases and generalising on an industry. I do not regard that as being particularly fair. I submit to the Minister that a potential conflict of interest can arise whenever a person acts in a dual capacity in almost any sphere of human endeavour. All dealers, whether they be brokers or bankers, can still deal in both large and small blocks of securities; they can operate discretionary accounts; they can manage accounts; they can advise different people on corporate affairs; they can be involved as advisers in takeover situations; and they can participate in the many other activities I would like the Minister to consider the fol-",93,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

I apply to the Secret Commissions Act and laws am glad to see that my friend the honourable regulating sohcitors or the ethics of the legal promember for Moreton( Mr Killen) has walked fession and so many other professions, but not back into the chamber, because he is familiar here. Only in recent years has the industry had with and frequently quotes the sayings of the opportunity for abuse that we have seen Edmund Burke who described one of the nicest revealed. That is why the Government says that legislative problems a parliament can have as this rule should apply. One may call it educative. what to legislate about and what not to legislate One may say that the Government is leaning about or, as Jeremy Bentham once said, what heavily towards protecting the consumer, should be on the agenda and what should not be although it is concerned with the role of the on the agenda. People will take different points broker and the director as well. of view about this matter. The Government clearly takes the view that there is a need to uplift business morality in this regard. It has been said that to date the Government bers of the Commission. That is true. Of course, seems to have been following the American one cannot compare them.

Surely that is the answer to the honourcism of a conflict of interests situation. I can well understand the argument that the that sense at all. These five gentlemen, when Government will rock the boat too much if it chosen, will be the must esteemed people in that panies. The answer to that surely is this: One should be concerned not only with the brokers as directors of companies but also with the clients or advice. There are far more clients than there are brokers. They are the public. As I have said so many times, this legislation is a two-fold measure. It aims to maximise the utility of the capital market and also to protect the consumer, the customer or the investor, who has been sadly defrauded in recent years. One cannot expect the customer to go to a broker seeking good independent advice, not knowing that the broker who is advising him has a number of direcThe point was made by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) that the Government does not apply this test to the memable member.

We impose on such people a very high standard in revealing any interests at all. We impose the same high standard as we would require of a judge or an arbitrator to make known whatever interests he has. But one cannot compare a commissioner with a sharebroker. The roles of the 2 people are quite different. Mr KillenA judge does that voluntarily. right. simple point I make is that whereas under clause 39 it is possible for a member of the Commission to make a decision which will affect the commercial fortunes of a company in which he holds shares, it is not possible for a dealer in shares under clause 115 to be a director and therefore influence the commercial future of such a company. That is the analogy I draw. I think it is a valid analogy; I think there is a conflict. The Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) argues that the provisions of clause 26 prohibit a member of the Commission from being a director of any company. He draws my attention to clause 26 (2) (c), which reads: (c) engages in paid employment outside the duties of his different from a person who is a director with all office; I know that the bounty of charity around the various of the responsibilities of a director. commercial centres of Australia is not all that great, but there are some people who act as directors of companies who, I submit, might not necessarily fall within the definition contained in clause 26 (2) (c). lative enactment of this Parliament and not the discretion of the Attorney-General. support the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) in this matter. I cannot believe that any government, even a Liberal-Country Party government, would choose as a commissioner on a commission such as the one we are discussing in this Bill tonight a person with such little integrity that he would not deduce from clause 26 (2) (c) that he must not be a director of any company that trades on a stock exchange. I do not accept the analogy of shareholding in this particular sphere but I would expect even then that the integrity would be such that there would not be a material shareholding. However, that is not my purpose in rising to my feet. I rise to point out that there is no other analogy between a dealer who is a member of a stock exchange or a partner of a member of a stock exchange in the context of clause 115 which-yo u do not have to draw my attention to the fact, Mr Deputy Chairman-w e are discussing. A merchant banker was mentioned and so was an ordinary banker. I must draw to the attention of the Committee the fact that neither of those occupations is such that a commission is involved in the turnover of shares. That point is all-important when we are discussing the matter of whether a holder of a dealer's licence should be a director of a company. Let me interpose here the comment that I believe as a chartered accountant that those firms of chartered accountants in the western world which have laid down that their partners should not be directors of companies have done a service to the integrity of the professional community of this country. One such company is Price Waterhouse and Co., the largest of the firms of chartered accountants, and one with which I have had no personal dealings at all. I understand that that firm does lay that down, and I think it is something to be commended. It still does not prevent a dealer who is a member of a stock exchange or a partner of a member of a stock exchange being a capital market adviser to any company, but a person who is an adviser in a particular field in which he is well qualified is I ask the Committee also to consider the fact that we are dealing with legislation which arises out of many problems which occurred in this country's capital market at the time of the boom, particularly the mining boom. I suggest to the Committee that if indeed the members of a stock exchange and the partners of members of a stock exchange who are dealers in this field had devoted their entire attention to the matters which were the subject of their main calling-in fact, they are dealers in that market-w e might have had many fewer problems than we have had. It was the people who were the directors of Poseidon NL and directors of other companies involved in this field who are also members of the stock exchange who by their actions gave rise to so many of the problems which have been brought out by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. I will not detain the Committee any longer. There are other points that I would like to make, but I merely say that I support clause 115 and hope it will not be altered.",95,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

I am sure that this matter will be debated in the Senate. I wish to agree with the remarks made by my friend, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr clause 119 merely for the purpose of drawing the Howard). Beyond that it is sufficient to say that the matter has been open for debate. I am sure that it will be debated more fully in the Senate. Clause 116 deals with the question of the dealer not being able to act as an underwriter in certain circumstances. I wonder why that clause does not apply to all of those people who are circumscribed by the definition of'dealer' in clause 3. I simply ask the question. If the Attorney General is not in a position to answer it now it may be answered in the Senate. Clauses agreed to. Clause 118.

General) (9.18)-I move: Omit 'carrying on a business of dealing in securities', substitute 'dealing in securities of prescribed corporations'. At clause 123. It reads: the end of the clause, add the following sub-clause: '(2) This section does not affect any application that the corporate applicant for a loan is in a bad way. Should he Trade Practices Act 1974 would have apart from this inform his colleagues in the bank's trust department, so that section'. The explanation of those amendments is quite inside information?

Many first amendment is simply designed to ensure American banks have sought a way out of this dilemma by that the provision is clearly within constitutional creating power. The reference to securities in the present clause might otherwise be construed as a reference to securities of corporations that are not prescribed; that is, corporations over which the Australian Parliament does not incontrovertibly have power to legislate. The second amendment is to ensure that the ordinary operation of the Trade Practices Act is not restricted by implication from the provisions of clause 118 (1). That clause is intended to ensure that the Trade Practices Act applies to dealers. It is not in any way intended to limit the operation that that Act would have in the absence of clause 118(1).

Clause 119 is a provision which refers to stock market manipulation. The Association has simply said that this clause ought to have regard to the provision in section 71(2) of the New South Wales Securities Industry Act. I know that the Attorney-General has the submission before him and I know that he cannot in any political sense accept the suggested amendment tonight, but I do suggest that he give regard to it when he considers this Bill prior to its going to the Senate. I refer also to clause 123, which is a very important clause. I am sure that my colleagues will speak to it. Clause 123 relates to the prohibition of dealings in securities by insiders. I would simply refer the Attorney-General again to the publication to which the honourable member for Adelaide has referred and which was prepared by Louis Loss. It is a publication that was printed by the Government Printer under the auspices of the previous Attorney-General. I refer in particular to paragraph (d) at page 22, which expressly should read paragraph (d) for the purpose of illustrating the kind of problem that arises under Suppose that the loan officer of a bank discovers that a the shares of that corporation may be sold out of the trust accounts? If he does, is not the bank culpably acting on intracorporate 'Chinese walls' between their loan and trust departments. continues: But is it clear that the courts would not attribute to the corporation as an entity the information obtained by its loan officer? About the only thing that is clear in the United States is that a trustee's duties under the law of trusts can hardly require him to commit a violation of federal law. The Code intentionally leaves for further judicial development the question of the efficacy of'Chinese walls'. I have simply drawn that matter to the Attorney General's notice.

This comes back to the point I made in relation to the definitions clauses when the Committee stage of the debate commenced. As far as I am aware there is no definition of 'current assets' or of 'non-current assets'; yet here we have an explicit reference to it. This provision is really capable of all sorts of ambiguity, as the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford), who is interjecting and who used to be an accountantI do not want to slight that organisation-knows . The honourable member will know if he has looked up clause 3 that the term 'current liability' is defined. Therefore, why not define the term 'current assets' and be complete about the matter? It may be said that this is the definition of the States. Surely it cannot be argued that we should preserve in this legislation any deficiencies that exist in the State laws now that the Commonwealth has seenfitto take over in that area.

That is pretty loose stuff. I ask whether it is intended that there by regulations more closely defining exactly what is meant there. It must be obvious that that covers a very broad area. They are very generalised statements. If the directors are able to give generalised replies their replies will be valueless. If they are to be fairly specific, and obviously what is intended here is the protection of employees, consumers and others, they are presumably entitled to know exactly what they as directors are to report on and what policies their companies are expected to carry out. I summarise the position by saying that I would like some indication as to whether it is. intended that there be further regulations setting out specifically, and not just in a waffling form, what is intended there and, referring to clause 129 (7) (c), by asking why can we not have a definition of the term 'current assets' as there is a definition of the term 'current liabilities' in the Mr GarlandI rise to a point of order, Mr The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN-It is a matter Clauses agreed to.

Omit sub-clauses (12) to (16), inclusive. These are the amendments I referred to earlier. The words omitted are unnecessary in view of the definition of 'prospectus'. This definition includes a notice, circular or other instrument so that the use of the word 'prospectus' does not change the meaning of the sub-clause but shortens and simplifies it. The second amendment to clause 162 is, as I informed honourable members, designed to eliminate a civil sanction for failure to register a prospectus. We accept that the criminal law is adequate. After careful reconsideration the Government has decided to remove the unusually broad civil sanction originally provided by clause 162 (12). The Government considers it will be sufficient for the Bill to rely on the criminal sanction provided in clause 162 (2) to enforce registration. it is wise that the Government has decided to remove those Draconian costs which would apply to people who transgress the legislation. As a general comment I think the clause will still as presently drafted create some serious practical difficulties so far as it affects companies' rights and capacities to raise funds on the open market. Companies making arightsissue, for example, have to register the prospectus with the Commission as required by this legislation, and the possibility of an extended delay due to the fact that sub-clause (3) requires the Commission to investigate and satisfy itself that the requirements have been comphed with will make it very difficult for companies to pitch the terms of the issue to meet the requirements of the Commission. The company cannot plan with any degree of certainty as to when the funds will become available and as to whether the Commissioner will necessarily accept the basis on which the issue has been made. Sub-clause (7), for example, introduces into Australia, I understand for the firsttime,the conCommission and application lists have been opened, the Commission may still cancel the registration. This provision suggests that a cancellation may occur at any time notwithstanding that the company may already have a lot of securities pursuant to the terms and conditions of the original prospectus. Furthermore, cancellation of the registration of a prospectus on this basis may mean that a prospectus has never been in fact registered, and the circularisation of an unregistered prospectus of course is something not permitted under this legislation. It seems Commission such widespread powers to cancel as distinct from withdrawing the registration of a prospectus subsequent to its original registration or at anytimewithout any other limitation on the conditions under such powers being able to be exercised. Amendments agreed to. introduces a new concept of the cancellation of registration of prospectuses. The recommendation of the Eggleston report was that this was unnecessary. Accordingly, there is a strong view in some sections of the community that subclause (7) should be deleted. Clause 162 (1) provides for the registration of prospectuses. Subcause (l)(b) requires the prospectuses to state the date of registration which is a matter of practice in regard to printing which could cause significant delays in its issue. This is regarded by many as being a provision which is unnecessary and there is no reason why it should not bear the date of its signature by the directors. Sub-clauses (5), (6) and (7) establish an important departure from the State Acts in regard to inquiries and investigations by the Commission for the registration of a prospectus, namely the discretion invested in the Commission to deny registration if it is dissatisfied as to the expert's qualifications or experience, and to cancel a registered prospectus under the conditions mentioned in the last of the sub-clauses.",99,Corporations And Securities Industry Bill 1975

It might well happen that shares are issued and such a registration is cancelled. For what it is worth, my own view would be that the ordinary civil remedies would apply. The criminal sanctions, of course, might apply. It would depend on the facts. But the person in that situation would have his civil remedies as he has now. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

The reason for this amendment is that clause 166 (1) provides that a prospectus in relation to debentures must state that the corporation will issue a document evidencing its indebtedness within one month from the acceptance of money as a deposit or loan in response to the prospectus. This amendment is to ensure that the corporation is legally obliged to issue such a document within one month. ing with debentures which affect a wide range of small investors and retired people. I understand that there are about 630,000 people who hold debentures or unsecured notes. The tragedy, whether we like it or not, is that many investors who hold debentures hold the false belief that they are the first to be paid in the event of the company being wound up. In fact criteria are laid down by the life offices to guard debenture holders. I sincerely suggest that the Government give consideration to the incorporation of those holders. Building societies, for instance, in South Australia are not allowed, as to the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) would be aware, by the Public Actuary to lend to big hire purchase companies. If that provision had applied earlier many small investors in Cambridge Credit would certainly have been saved.

CanI get an undertaking that the Government will give further consideration to this matter? Clauses 188 to 262-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 263 (Power of Commission to obtain information, documents and evidence). makes provision for the search of premises by the Commission if the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman has reason to believe that a person is capable of furnishing information. It makes further provision for the securing of a search warrant to enter premises any hour of the day or night and to seize any document, to search any place on the premises, to break open any cupboard, drawer, chest, trunk, box, package and so on. This search warrant can be secured by making application to a justice of the peace. In no way whatsoever do I seek to reflect upon probably one of the oldest judicial offices known to our system of law, but to be able to secure a search warrant in these circumstances from a justice of the peace is something from which I must confess, instinctively, I resile. I ask the Attorney-General to consider the ramifications of this clause as it now stands. If a man came to my home and said: ' I have a search warrant. I have obtained it from the justice of the peace. I want to come in', and he comes in and I say:.'Look old chap, I am not satisfied that what you are looking for is here', and I put my hand up against him, within the meaning of this provision I would be obstructing or hindering him in the course of his duty. I would be subject to a fine of $1,000 or 3 months imprisonment. Of course, I would have to take the 3 months imprisonment. Looking at the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen), it would be a pleasure to get away from them for 3 months. Great powers must be used with great discretion. I have always taken a certain view in regard to search warrants, which entitle a person to knock on the door and enter premises at any hour of the day or night. I have taken the view that this is a power that should be put into statutes with very considerable caution. I recall the occasion when Customs officers raided the home of a very distinguished Australian, Daphne Mayo. It happened that they had the wrong home. I was a private member sitting on the Government benches at the time and I complained, I hope with a proper sense of resentment, about the manner in which that raid was carried out. I ask a question of the Attorney General as the custodian of ourrights,the protector of our liberty, the father protector. I must say that he will have to work hard to improve his image as it is at the moment. Nevertheless, I ask him: Will he please take into account the ramifications of this clause as it stands, and when this Bill trundles its way to another place will he seek to include adequate safeguards to take account of the fears that I have expressed?

Honourable members will be aware of the presence last year of significant numbers of Indonesianfishermenon our north-west coast.

This is one of the matters that has to be looked at very seriously if we are to do what any honest Australian would want to see done for an Australian industry. When one looks at the monthly import-export figures, one is constantly despondent because of the fact that in terms of total value, we have been importing more fisheries products than we have been exporting.

Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah) (10.29)I brought to my notice that the opportunity to speak is available to me. I wish to raise a subject The Council has been concerned with the maximum amount of $300 for land and water rates that a ratepayer may claim as a taxation deduction. That limit was brought in by the Australian Labor Party Government in the 1973-74 Budget. The Council has lodged a protest with the Federal Treasurer and, as I have stated, representations have been made through me. The letter goes on to say: Apan from acknowledgments of the Council's protest no further replies have been received. Here we come to the crux of the problem. The number of people within it Council goes on to state: In view of the inflation that has occurred over the past yearRemember that this letter was written in August last year and remember that the inflation rate has accelerated even further because of the insubstantial and unrealistic policies of the present Government and the resultant increasing costs to Councils in providing Warringah he will find a great number of people services, this Council is even more concerned at the iniquiwho live on pensions and superannuation paytous situation caused by the maximum allowable tax deduction of $300. The overall average rate payable per assessments. ment in the Municipality of Manly for 1974 (including strata titledflats)and including garbage charges is $165.15, while the rate paid by a typical ratepayer on the most frequently electorate. occurring valuation is $154.13. These figures do not include water, sewerage and drainage rates paid to the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board and when their rates should be complaining. He should be doing are added to the Council rate it takes the total over the maximum allowable as a tax deduction. Remember that this is the average rate paid by the typical ratepayer in this electorate. This means that a great number of people would be paying well in excess of that. The letter continues: The Council considers that this situation is extremely bad as it represents discrimination against one section of the community, namely the person who owns or is purchasing a property in which he lives. The limitation imposed will not affect the property owner who derives his income from several properties as it has always been a legitimate deduction in such cases to deduct all outgoings on the income producing property. The present limitation reacts harshly on the young ratepayer who in all probability is struggling to secure a home for himself and his family. That is the view of the Manly Municipal Council. It parallels the view of the Mosman Municipal Council, it parallels the view of the Warringah Shire Council and I am sure it parallels the view of a great number of other councils throughout Australia. Let us look at the people it affects. As the Manly Municipal Council pointed out, it certainly affects the young ratepayer who is attempting to buy his or her home. It also affects-to my mind this is a more iniquitous result of the allowable deduction-thos e people whom this Labor Government pretends to represent-thos e people on fixed incomes, those people who are least able to cope with the inflationary pressures let loose in the Australian society by the policies of the present Labor Government. A great number of people on fixed incomes live within the electorate of Warringah. It is a very pleasant electorate. It takes in Mosman, Manly and other areas. As people who have visited this area know, it is a very well established and very old area.There are a great say'affluent'? areas. at the people who live within the electorate of Mr CohenI have 25 000 of them in my something to protect them and to look after them rather than interjecting here. These people are grossly affected by the higher charges imposed upon them by individual councils. Because they have no opportunity to offset the effects of inflation on their incomes they are forced into a very difficult situation. It can be said that these people, particularly the older ones, can sell their properties, which are valuable properties, and move elsewhere. But why should they? These people have lived in this area and have brought up their children there and all their friends live in this area. Why should they be forced out of thenhouses by the policies of the Government which alleges that it protects the interests of the smaller people in the community? That is absolute nonsense. This situation has been brought about by 2 particular policies of the present Government. It has been brought about by the ceiling of $300 on the amount of deduction allowable and it has been exacerbated by the economic policies of the present Government which have led to an unprecedented increase in the inflation rate, with a consequent effect upon the costs incurred by various councils throughout Australia. We are not talking about rich land owners. We are talking about the people who are battling to make a living, the people who are battling to pay off their own homes, the people who are battling to stay",108,Fisheries Bill 1975

In fact, there were a number of inaccuracies in his remarks. He suggested that the Grants Commission had given the sum of $315,000 to the electorate of Parramatta. He said: The municipal councils in the electorate of Parramatta are $390,000. If honourable members want me to go to receive a minimum of $315,000. That amount in fact was given to the city of Parscheme; there was a grant of $20,000 for the Parramatta, and I need not point out that the city of ramatta seawall; and there was a grant of some Parramatta is also substantially in the electorate $300,000 for the acquisition of land. of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development.

There are areas of the electorate of Parramatta, such as Dundas Valley, Ermington and Rydalmere, which are as deprived as any other area of Sydney. I am personally ashamed about the directions corning from the Department of Urban and Regional Development that Granville ought always to receive priority when grants are made to the City of Parramatta. Rather than do obeisance, I propose to take up this matter as regularly as I can and to point out how clearly this program is being used, I submit, as pork-barrelling in areas of the Western Suburbs to the advantage of the electorates of the honourable members. I have mentioned and not those of member's time has expired. that we have heard from the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Ruddock) almost one of the greatest advocacies of the policies of the present Government that I have ever heard in my life. All he has done is quote the amount of finance that the present Government has been pouring into the outer Western Suburbs of Sydney. It has been pouring infinance,whereas in 23 years in office the previous Liberal-Country Party government did not put in one single penny or one single cent. The honourable member for Parramatta has, of course, complained about the area improvement plan. That is to be expected. He always wants more. The Government of which he was a supporter never gave one penny for such a program, but now he says: 'You have given somefinancebut I want more'. We expect that of him. He has forgotten that the area improvement plan of which he has complained is the result of joint discussions between the Australian Government and the Liberal-Country Party Government of New South Wales of which his father is now a Minister. So he had better go home to Daddy and say: 'Please, Dad, try and get me a little more'. Honestly, Mr Speaker, can you blame me for laughing a little bit? The honourable member for Parramatta then went on to say that the various councils around the area had increased their rates. the honourable member for Prospect has said, is that when it was controlled by the Australian Labor Party the Fairfield Council did not but that the Parramatta Council, a so-called independent council which has a strong Liberal influence and which is, of course, part of the LibThe Minister for Urban and Regional Developeral Party machine of the honourable member, and the Blacktown Council, a so-called independent council which also has a strong Liberal Party influence-non e of them Labor Party con-, trolled councils-as well as the Penrith Council, a so-called independent council which has a strong Liberal Party influence have appreciably increased their rates despite the fact that they have received record amounts in finance from this Government. For the first time in history they have received very appreciable amounts in finance from the Australian Government under the area improvement program and the Regional Employment Development Scheme. They have also received finance from the Department of Tourism and Recreation and, of course, the Grants Commission. All of it is non-repayable, non-interest bearing grants. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that it is hard to understand why they have had to increase their rates by such an appreciable amount. Without a doubt they are going to be in a sea of liquidity with thefinancesthat we have put into the area. The honourable member for Parramatta also did not mention that during 23 years Liberal Country Party Governmenta government of the honourable member's political complexionthe debts of local government increased by 2800 per cent whereas the debts of the Australian Government during the 23 years in office of the Liberal-Country Party Government of which he, his father and so on have been such a part remained approximately static. The Liberal Country Party Government did not do a single thing for local government right throughout that period, yet we have been able to turn around and inject so much finance into the area that it is going to bring about a very great benefit indeed. I stated very clearly last weekI make no excuse for doing so-that the honourable member for Parramatta, instead of always trying to bring carping, petty political propaganda into this House, should be down on his bended knees thanking the present Government for what it is doing in his area. Even though it is a Liberal Party area we are not prejudiced. We believe that funds should be allocated on the basis of need. That is why we have been injecting funds into the outer Western Suburbs of Sydney, which were neglected for so many years by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government.
