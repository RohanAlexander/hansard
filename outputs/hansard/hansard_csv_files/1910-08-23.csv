Is it a fact that land was leased at Wollongong some years ago for the purpose of a rifle range ? 2. Is it a fact that although the land is quite' suitable, and a large sum has been paid in rent, the range has never been made available for the local rifle club? 3. What is the reason why targets have not been erected by the Department? 4. Is it a fact that the local club has, in consequence of the long delay, been compelled to erect temporary targets at its own expense? . 5. Is it a fact that the Telegraph Department has erected a line of wires between the target and the firing point; and, although an officer has been sent down to report, nothing has been done to have these wires placed in' a safe position ? 6.

I shall be very pleased to confer with the Minister of Defence on the subject, and arrange the matter, if found practicable. Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice1. Is there a sufficient number of rifles, and is there a sufficient quantity of ammunition, at present in possession of the Commonwealth, to equip the number of men liable to be summoned to trie defence of the country in the event of hostilities ? 2. How many effective modern rifles are at the disposal of the Defence Department? 3. Is there any reserve of ammunition per rifle maintained. If so, what is that reserve? 4. If there is a deficiency in the number of rifles required to arm that portion of the male population of the Commonwealth liable to be called upon for defence in the event of hostilities affecting Australia, is it proposed to supply that deficiency from the output of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow? 5. When will the Small Arms Factory be in working order, and what is the estimated capacity of the Small Arms Factory in the output of rifles? 6. Should war conditions involving the Commonwealth arise before the stock of rifles is brought up to the number considered efficient, will the Minister of Defence give an assurance to this House that the deficiency can be otherwise supplied in such an emergency ? j . What is the estimated number of rifles conthe Treasurer in introducing them lay emsidered adequate for Defence purposes by the Minister? S. What reserve of ammunition per rifle should be held by the Commonwealth? the Department are these1. In time of war, approximately, 800,000 men would be liable to serve under section 59 of the Defence Act. The Commonwealth is. not yet in possession of sufficient rifles and ammunition for that number. 2. This information will be given confidentially, if the honourable member desires it. The military organization in operation until the commencement of universal training provides for about 25,000 trained men in peace, to be increased to 50,000 .in war. There are sufficient effective modern rifles in stock foT this numbeT. 3. Yes. The information required is also confidential. The reserve is, however, sufficient for the numbers given in 2. 4. Yes. Under the new system of universal training a rifle will be provided for every man trained, and, on his passing into the reserve, his rifle will also be put in reserve. 5. About the end of the present year. The ordinary capacity of the factory will be about -15,000 rifles annually. 6. Should it become necessary to largely increase the number of rifles in an emergency, the factory will be capable of turning out 45,000 rifles annually, if three shifts a day are worked. 7. The number of rifles required depends upon the number of men who are trained and organized as Defence Forces, together with those who have passed through such Forces during the last few years. 8. Not less than 500 rounds per rifle. Debate resumed from 19th August (vide That this Bill be now read a second time. Those who have listened to the debate upon this important proposed change in our currency must feel pleased at the high level which has been maintained, the knowledge of the economic and historic conditions affecting the subject possessed by honourable members being undoubtedly very great. I am glad that the measure is one which we can discuss without being hindered by constitutional limitations such as have hampered the discussion of many of the other matters of importance which we have had before us. I agree with those who hold that it is the duty of the National Parliament to legislate in respect to currency. The Constitution empowers us to do this, and it is our duty to give effect to our powers at the earliest convenient moment. I have studied the proposals of the Government without party bias, and was pleased to hear phasis on the fact that the Bill is not a party measure. Most of those who have contributed to the discussion have accepted that view. While I have endeavoured to make myself acquainted with the historical and economic considerations involved, I shall not allow myself to be lured into the discussion of the currency of ancient and mediaeval nations, it being, I think, sufficient for our purpose to have regard to the history of currency since the passing of the celebrated Bank Charter Act of Sir Robert Peel in 1844. It is the period from that time onward which supplies us with all the really valuable data calculated to guide us in the proper consideration of this question, and in arriving at a sound determination. It was probably in 1844 that we first had established a thoroughly sound paper currency. Sir Robert Peel's Act made it compulsory for the governors of the Bank of England to have in their issue department coin and bullion equal to the value for every note they issued. At the present time the Bank of England has in circulation notes to the value of £28,000,000,",15,Defence Department Wollongong Rifle Range Rifl E And Ammunition Supplies Smal L Arms Factory Wir E Drawing Plant

15,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [3.12],"and that issue is backed by a coin and bullion reserve of £36,000,000. It is unnecessary to refer to the banking history of Great Britain prior to 1844. We know, however, that prior to that year the banking history of England had been strewn with the failures of private corporations, just as had the history of every other proas I can the history of State currency in gressive nation, and that it required the force of legislation to bring about real stability in the national currency. Great Britain, in 1844, was nevertheless considerIn Great Britain the Bank of England is ably ahead of every other nation in respect of its method of controlling its finance and commerce. ahead of them than it is at the present time. The action that was taken by England in 1844 secure by a gold backing to the issue of its paper money, has been followed by every progressive nation. The two principal issues of paper money to which we find reference in history, and which have been most freely discussed in fhis House, are the issue of assignais of France at the time of the Revolution, and the issue of greenbacks at the time of the American Civil War. As has already been said in this House, however, neither of those issues furnish us, in regard to our modern system of finance, with valuable evidence as to the value of State as against private issues. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -They were war issues. They were issued in circumstances that were never known before in America or France. the fact that the Governments of both countries had failed to place their finances on a proper footing that it became necessary' for them to issue paper money in large quantities. They had to meet a set of extraordinary circumstances. Another phase of the question that has not been sufficiently considered is that the establishment of a safe and 'sound paper currency in all nations has been the result of growth and evolution. been found necessary in order to secure that safety to back up paper currency issues by proper gold reserves. Such a task was made much easier of accomplishment all over the world by the gold discoveries in California and Australia. Prior to 1850. rhe world's yield of gold was from 0 £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 per annum. With the discovery of the precious metal in California and Australia, however, the world's annual output of gold rose to from £20,000,000 to ,£30,000,000 per annum. That naturally gave a great impetus to various financial institutions, as well as to the Governments of progressive countries in establishing, as they have since done, gold reserves to back up their issues of paper money. Reviewing as succinctly progressive nations I find that it affords us valuable and cogent lessons in support of the position taken up by the Government. in reality a Government institution. In France the Bank of France has complete It was indeed much further control of the paper currency. In Germany the Imperial Bank issues its own bank notes, while in Austria' the Government assume complete control of the note issue. The same law exists in Russia, while Switzerland, the little Republic which has supplied us with many .valuable lessons, passed a law in 1907 making it compulsory for the State to assume complete and absolute control of the issue of paper money in the present year. The assignats of France and the greenbacks of America were issued for war purposes. The greenbacks were absolutely necessary to enable the American Civil War to be carried on, whilst the French assignats were issued to meet the exigencies of the French Revolution. Neither supplies us with reliable historical data upon which we might base any financial policy such as that now before us. Japan, however, has furnished us with a very valuable illustration of the evils of a paper money issue unbacked by a sound gold reserve. About It was owing very largely to 1867 a complete changetook place in the system of government that had long obtained in Japan. For probably 200 years before that date there had been in vogue there a system of paper money, and it had sunk to a very low level when the new system of government was established. There was for some time a silver backing, but the issue was generally without any gold reserve. The value of this issue sank very considerably, and at one stage it fell so Only in modern times has it low as to threaten the nation with serious financial difficulty. As a matter of fact, it destroyed the credit of Japan, in every sound financial country. . Japan had been very anxious to cut herself off from the rest of the world and to remain in a condition of isolation. It had been her policy for hundreds of years to remain in a state"" of insularity, and prior to the treaty negotiated by Admiral Perry, entered into by Japan about i860, she had",16,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

I think I shall be right in assuming that to time have been largely due to failure the proportion of reserve to the issue was on the part of Governments to undertake about the same in 1909 as it is now. It the' important work of controlling the curwas stated, I think by the Attorney-Generency in the interests of the financial ral, that the gold reserve for the Canadian stability of the country.

36,Mr Sampson,"The honourable membe a sufficient reply to the honourable member. Japan has ,£30,000,000 of notes in circulation, backed up by a paid up capital of £44,000,000. Austria has the lowest backing for a note issue of any of the countries mentioned. The whole of the notes are issued by the State or central government, and the law requires that a"" reserve of 40 per cent, shall be held in coin and bullion. The note issue there represents £75,000,000 and they have a reserve of £30,000,000 in coin and bullion to back it. In Switzerland in 1907 a law was passed compelling the private banks to relinquish the issue of their notes, the more liable is the community to become and assuming the power to issue notes on behalf of the Federal Government. They were then issuing notes to the value of £9,000,000, and that issue was backed up by a paid-up capital of £8,000,000. At present, in 1910, the Government control the whole of the note issue of the country, and it is backed up by a reserve of almost 100 per cent, of securities. I haye given the reasons why I think the Government of the Commonwealth should undertake the control of the currency. We have in Australia probably the soundest system of private banking in operation in any part of the world, and yet, in the face of the striking examples I have quoted from the world's leading countries, it is proposed in this Eill, that that system should be replaced by one under which the Government undertake the whole of the note issue, and propose to back it up with the lowest gold reserve required anywhere. I think that would be a retrograde step, and one which should not be taken by this Parliament. I believe that in the interests of the future safety and stability of ihe country, the Government should undertake the note issue, but when we have probably the soundest system of private banking in existence, we should not change it for a State currency, unless with a reserve which will compare favourably with that required in other countries. member change his attitude if the proposed State issue of notes were backed up by a State Bank? a State note issue and not a State bank, and, in my opinion, the two questions should be dealt with separately. I am speaking of insuring the national safety and stability in times -of panic and crises by the State undertaking the control nf the note issue, but urging that that should only be done with an adequate gold [68] reserve. I quite appreciate the fact that the credit of the State must, necessarily be better than the credit of any single corporation-that , I think, is obvious to every patriotic citizen-and I quite understand that, even in times of panic, it is impossible for the State to, perhaps, allay certain fears that arise on the part of timid people. According to opinions expressed by some of the leading economists, thc more highly complex our system of commerce becomes-the more we become traders, not only amongst ourselves, but with the leading countries of the worldseized with financial panic, which may throw the whole system of commerce into a cataclysm for the time being. Under those circumstances, it would be impossible to carry on commerce in any part of the world were it not for that confidence which is so necessary in all business transactions, from those of the State down to those of the individual with |the smallest commercial dealings. I clo not think that there is anything to prevent, at certain periods, panics overtaking a community, and, perhaps, involving it in serious financial trouble; and that is one of the reasons why, I think, a State issue of notes is more calculated to preserve confidence and give greater financial stability than any control exercised by private corporations. But without expressing any hostility to the measure, which I have viewed with an open mind, I certainly think it is the duty of Parliament, when exercising its undoubted right to change the system of the paper currency-whe n taking it out of the hands of the present banking corporations which are in such an absolutely safe and sound position-to act according to the best traditions of the leading financial countries of the world. The question of a paper currency, backed up by a gold standard, is one, as I have already said, of evolution. It started in 1844; and we know now that every leading nation and every Government finds that the only safe plan* on which they can undertake the permanent issue of paper money is to have it backed up by a certain reserve of gold. It is only by a substantial gold backing that it is possible to retain the confidence which is absolutely essential to the carrying on of our commerce and the maintenance of that credit which we are proud to possess as a nation. I hope that when the Bill is in Committee the Government, with their great majority and power, will not retain the small gold reserve proposed, because it may have the effect of reducing",19,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

The notes thus stamped were not charged 6d. exchange, but all Inter-State notes not so stamped were. As an old bank clerk, I have a great regard for my first employer. the only member of the House who stood before a body of men whose intention it was to rush down Collins-street and attempt to raid a bank during the land boom. The bank in question was the Colonial Bank, and the unemployed were sought to be used for this purpose by a man who held some of the bank's notes and wished to have them exchanged -experiences of the early nineties. I hold They said, "" We are going to have money for these notes, or we will proclaim that the bank is bankrupt."" The honourable member for Richmond will agree with me that in times of trouble and danger the holders of notes will be inclined to demand cash for them. He will also agree with me that if notes are issued only by the Government that will be one factor in relieving the crisis. Speaking with full respect for the banks as they are conducted to-day, I ask: What is there in their management to make them so safe that there can never be a crisis? This Commonwealth note issue will remove one danger. I wonder whether any honourable member has ever tried, by way of experiment, to ascertain whether persons holding notes knew what banks had issued them. Just [68]2 lately I went round amongst the honourable members whom I met in this building and asked them whether they had any bank notes in their possession. I further asked others who said that they had whether they knew which banks bad issued the notes. I found that none had taken the trouble to observe. At the time of the boom, in Melbourne, I went down Collins-street, and asked a number of men whom I met-ordinary men of business-whethe r they could tell me off hand what banks issued the notes in their possession. I met with only one man who could tell me, and he had quite recently obtained his notes from a bank. The honorI resent strongly the statement that has been made that every bank holds £ 7 in gold for every note issued by it. That statement is a mere quibble, because, if in time of crisis a man having a current account with a bank went into the institution ancl drew a cheque for the amount of his account, the cashing of his cheque would take precedence of the cashing of any notes if he presented himself at the counter first. If a bank was unsound, how much gold would it have to meet its notes after its current accounts had been paid ? It must be remembered that banks are not disposed very much to help each other in time of crisis. I am, perhaps, When the house of Baring wanted only £4,000,000 to tide over a difliculty, did the Rothschilds or the Bank of England step in to save them? No; and the Barings closed their doors, and by so doing did injury to the commercial world to the extent of, perhaps, £500,000,000. Our banking system in Australia has certainly been purified as the result of the terrible in my hand Vol. 5 of Horwitz's Victorian Statutes, from which I shall quote. I have consulted Mr Godfrey, a bank director of considerable experience, and he agrees with the view I take as to the section which 1 shall quote from page 345 of this volume. It is there statedNo banking company, firm, or individual banker shall issue notes payable to bearer at sight or on demand unless such company or firm has a subscribed capital of not less than Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and a paid-up capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, or unless such individual banker has a capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, and any company, firm, or banker issuing notes contrary to the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty amounting to Twenty-five pounds per centum of the amount of the notes so issued, to be recoverable with f u l l costs of suit by any person who may sue for the same.",21,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

50,Dr. Maloney,"Not soj only reIt appears from that section that, in Victoria, any body of men with a capital of £125,000 could establish a bank and issue notes to the extent of millions of pounds; and if they liked to mortgage their assets there would not be a penny piece to cover their notes. There was formerly in existence, in this State, a bank known as the Provincial and Suburban Bank. Only a week ago one of the notes of that bank was brought down to Melbourne from the back blocks of New South Wales. Of course, it was a worthless piece of paper. I have known notes of the same bank to be in circulation 'during 'the last thirty years. What were they worth? Nothing. But how many people have been wronged through their being in circulation? The Bank of England cancels notes that have been in circulation and have been returned to the bank. Consequently, no matter how clever a forgery may be committed it is discovered once the forged note reaches the bank. When the number is being called over for the purpose of cancelling the note the officials at once know whether anything is wrong. But what takes place in regard to Australian notes ? Let me give my own experience. I have been engaged in dealing with mutilated and old notes as a bank derk. PerhapsI should be calling out the numbers to a fellow clerk. He might say, "" That last number has already been written off."" We might then look at the note with a magnifying glass, but all that would be done would be to make a memorandum on the margin, and it might be concluded that a mistake had been made by the clerks who had previously crossed off the same number. That is the difference between the Bank of England system and ours. It is absurd that there should be thirty-eight different kinds of notes circulated in Australia. Why should a State ever entrust to other people the right of issuing money ? A coin has not a value equivalent to that which it represents, unless it bears the authorized inscription of the State which has issued it as currency. To put that proposition to the test, let a coin be laid on rails so that it may be run over by a tram car or a train, which will beat out of recognition 'the authorized inscription and image"". What would a half-a-crown be worth after having been so treated? The person owning it would be lucky if he got a shilling for it. Section 12 of the Victorian Act from which I have already quoted readsNotes payable to bearer at sight or on demand honourable member ever saw in New South issued in Victoria by any banking company, Wales, and that is a half-Johanna, valued Dr. Maloney. firm, or individual banker in the hands of any bond fide holder thereof for value who has received the same in the ordinary course of business without notice that the same has been issued or dealt with contrary to the provisions of this Act, and has not subsequently dealt with the same otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, shall, in the event of such company being wound up, or such firm or banker being insolvent or bankrupt, be a first charge on the assets in Victoria of such company, firm, or banker, not being the subject of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, or other security in favour of any other creditor. I challenge any one to say that under that Act there was anything to prevent a bank from issuing notes to the extent of millions of pounds if it wished. When I was travelling in the United StatesI never saw gold in use as currency, except when I obtained six small dollars by way of curiosity. I have before me one of the first brochures on this subject ever published in Victoria. It was written by the late Dr. Crooke, who points out that the one dollar note is the standard currency of Canada. When I was in Canada the only gold coin I saw was a sovereign which I had in my own possession, and for which I obtained notes. What is money? Money is that which is stamped by a Government or a bank, and which is accepted on credit for purp'oses of exchange. a British gold coin intrinsically worth the sum which it purports to represent? orable member permit a tram car to run over a sovereign and then see what he can get for it as old gold'. We know that money can be made from almost anything. For instance, on page 256 of volume 4 ot the Historical Records of New South Wales, I find a Government and general order on the subject of legal tender, which was proclaimed by Governor Philip Gidley King on the 19th November, 1800, and from which I extract the following passageAnd that no one may plead ignorance of the rate or legality of this or any other of the coins circulating in this colony, of which it does not appear that any regular proclamation has ever collectively been issued, 1 have judged it most expedient herewith to publish the following table of all the specie legally circulating in this colony, with the rates affixed to each, at which they shall be considered and be a legal tender in all payments or transactions in this colony. What were these coins? First of all, there' was a guinea, valued at 22s. Then there was a coin, which I do not suppose any",22,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading
51,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,But is not,23,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading
52,Dr. Maloney,"Yes, but let the honat £ 2 . A Johanna was a coin which was first issued in Portugal in 1750; and which, therefore, must have been fifty years old when it was made legal tender in New South Wales. Its value in Portugal was about 36s. j therefore, the value of a half-Johanna would be 18s but in New South Wales its value was fixed at £""2. In addition to those coins, there were a gold mohur, valued at ,157s. 6d.; a Spanish dollar, valued at ss.; a Johanna, valued at £ 4 ; a ducat, valued at 9s. 6d.; a pagoda, valued at 8s. ; a rupee, valued at 2s. 66.; a Dutch guilder, valued at 2s. ; an English shilling, valued at is. 8d.; a copper coin of 1 oz., valued at 2d.; a copper coin of \ oz., valued at i d . ; and a copper coin of a \ oz., valued at \6. Copper coins were a portion of the currency when I was a boy in Melbourne. Any merchant could issue them, but I believe that they had to be of a certain weight. It was simply the issue of a proclamation by the Governor which made the coins I have mentioned legal tender within New South Wales. The quotation continuesWhen a sufficient quantity of copper coin is received in the colony, of which notice will be .given, no private notes or goods will be allowed lo circulate. This supply of copper having been sent to relieve the inconvenience of persons requiring to make small payments, no persons are to collect ihe same for the purpose of making large payments, nor shall it be deemed a legal tender to offer the same in payment for any sum exceeding ""Five pounds. To those honourable members who speak of gold leaving Australia if this measure be passed, I commend the wisdom of the Governor of New South Wales in its early clays, so far as copper coins were concerned. The quotation continuesAnd it is hereby declared that the exportation or importation, except from His Majesty's Treasury, of any sum exceeding Five pounds of the .above-named copper coin, shall be punished by fine of treble the value, and forfeiture of the sum exported or imported. J do not blame them in the circumstances. We know of the money current for a ,long time in England. I think that Henry .7. was the first sovereign to introduce the currency. He introduced the staff, or rod of wood, with peculiar markings thereon. The rod was split in half; one-half, representing the amount which he had deposited, was given to the creditor, and the other -half was put in the Treasury of the King, so that the two halves could be compared by putting them together. We know of the cowries of Africa. Leather money was in use in Russia up to the time of Peter the Great. The State can make money of anything. But this will be the first ""time in the history of the world that a continent will have only one note circulating throughout the length and breadth of its territory. I do not want any one to construe my speech into an attack on any bank. I recognise that the banks are doing splendid work, but, in my opinion, they will do far better work when only a National note is in circulation. As the result of my reading on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that it would be far better for the Commonwealth to establish a standard currency, that is, to fix an amount below which the value of a note could never go. Suppose, for instance, that we fixed a currency of £4,000,000 notes for a population of 4,000,000. The notes up to that amount should be unredeemable except by the State, but all notes issued in excess of that amount should be redeemable. I think that a gold basis of 25 per cent, is quite sufficient for every purpose. That is the only little note of difference from the Treasurer's scheme which I have to sound. Strange to say, by an edict of England, the Johanna was made currency in Ireland in 1725, and there, as in Australia, at an enhanced value. Whereas its value was raised from 36s. to 80s. in Australia, its value was fixed at 40s. in 1725. in Ireland. I hold in my hand a pamphlet which was published for private circulation only. I suppose that, at tliat time, the publishers thought that I was a fairly well-to-do man, ancl was therefore deserving of receiving a private communication of this kind. Any one who will look at the figures in the publication will find a -post-mortem mark set against three banks, namely, the City of Melbourne Bank, the Federal Bank, and the Mercantile Bank. My desire is to insure the safety of the present private system of banking, and I believe that we shall achieve that object by withdrawing from them the right to issue notes. What was the result of introducing a State note in Queensland? The local banks were foolish enough to say that they did not want State notes, as they would pay in gold. With what result did they do so? I have here a return showing the value of the gold coin which was sent away from that State from 1879 to 1893, that is the year in which the banks made their boast. I shall not weary honourable members by quoting all the figures, but shall content myself with stating that the lowest amount was sent away in 1883, namely, 4,000 sovereigns. In 1879, 26,000 sovereigns were exported; in 1889, 100,000 sovereigns; in 1891, 161,000 sovereigns; and, in 1893, when the banks said that they did not want notes, as they would pay in gold, 435,000 sovereigns were sent away. I point out that, in that year, four times more gold was sent away than had been sent away in any previous year, except in two instances. In other words, 100 times as much gold was sent away in 1893 as had been exported in 1883. It is strange that the question of banking has concerned the most brilliant minds of all kinds during the last century or so. Henry Clay, the great American, made the statement that up to his time not a cent had ever been lost by a national bank. Let us take the history of the oldest bank in the world, namely, the Bank of Genoa, which, as honourable members know, advanced money all over Europe to carry on the Crusade in Palestine. It carried on its operations until Italy was conquered by France, and it only stopped payment then because it was considered that its creditors should not have too much power. What did the proprietors of the bank do? In their hour of danger, when a terrible war arose, and the Austrian arms swept over Genoa and took the whole of the gold in the bank what happened? The bank did not do what nearly every bank in Australia has done. It did not ruin the men who had invested their money in shares in the bank; it did not fine them and make them pay the fine. It consolidated the money which was owing, gave a higher rate of interest, made deferred payments, and paid every penny piece; yet it had not a basis of gold such as the Commonwealth notes will have, backed up by the national credit. Ask any man in the street which he would rather have: an unlimited issue of notes by a bank with only £125,000 paid in, or a limited issue of notes issued by the Commonwealth with a gold reserve of 25 per cent, backed up by the credit of every hill, valley, river, and mountain of our loved Australia? There is not a man who would not prefer the State note to the note of any bank. To-day three Melbourne charities are faced with the prospect of being robbed by the Assets Company of a bequest of £3,000 each. I allude to the Melbourne Hospital, the Alfred Hospital, and the Benevolent Asylum. What does the company care so Jong as legal technicalities are ' complied Dr. Maloney. with. If it robs these charities, then we in Victoria will want to know why the act is permitted. I have suggested to the company that it should be content to take one-half of the money. How did that debt arise? A shareholder invested his savings in a bank's shares; it failed, and made calls upon the man whose thrift had enabled him to buy the shares. If the Assets Company do the despicable deed which is threatened, I for one shall stamp them as usurers and demand a searching inquiry. I could speak at greater length, but I think that I have said quite enough* It seems to me absurd for any one tosuggest that we should go to the moneylenders of Europe for a loan. Why should we with our millions of broad acres go to the money markets of the world when land even in the presence of a crisis means a certain value. A crisis that will ruin one .bank may cause a loss of a quarter of a million, indeed, of half amillion. Vou can never tell when the end will be readied. You can never tell what little home or little farm may be sold. But land which is far more stable than the notes of any bank or any deposit receipts, or anything which man can make, would be the safest guarantee of our Commonwealth notes. If we want to make our community free from the possibility of reproach, we must handle the money question. Any one with a knowledge of banking knows that if the Rothschild family agreed to combine with Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company they could smash up the Bank of England to-morrow; and if that were done, God alone knows the extent of the misery and the wretchedness and the bankruptcy which would spread through the world. Knowing that never has a State bank broken, that never have the creditors of a State bank been ruined, and that never has the State bank crucified thousands and thousands of men, women and children, I welcome this measure and its accompanying note issue. With that knowledge which comes only through the crucible of experience, I feel sure that the Government will be able even to extend the scheme after a few years' experience. After we have had an experience of five, or perhaps ten, years, let us make that money so stable that, even though a bank might fail, the State notes will not be made a lever for bringing it about. I speak feelingly, because I have a vivid recollection of a crowd wishful to run down the street and cry out, "" We have notes, and are going to get cash for them from the bank."" The Billi f enacted will eliminate the possibility of such an event recurring. At present, in time of crisis a man who had an account might stand at the door of a. bank and cry, "" I have not got my money""; but it would be in vain. But, in rhe future, this will not happen. There will be no need for any of the old dodges, such as the heating of sovereigns, so that they would be too hot for men's fingers to pick them up. The currency is the lifeblood of the community, and even the land question itself is not more vital than the money question. I ask honourable members to combine, not for any party advantage, but for the advancement of the welfare of Australia, which, I think, we all love. If we settle the money question properly, the .Commonwealth will enter upon such a career of prosperity that her laws and her financial system wiil be an example to the whole world. tend to curtail my observations on this important question, as on all others, to the minimum. Lest what I have to say may seem inadequate, let me make in advance an apology. vital issues raised by the measure, effective to experience already made by others, my action can be taken only in Committee, at which stage there must be a concentration pf considerations which will have been distributed through many speeches. Although this discussion has been protracted there has not been one speech too many, nor, allowing reasonable latitude of interpretation, has the patience of the House been at any time abused. Few, if any, questions are more abstruse than those with which the proposals of the Government are associated. Upon the world's wide financial experience have been based a great variety of doctrines in regard to currency, banking; bi-metallism, and kindred subjects, which have afforded ground for philoIt was fortunate that when the Prime Min-sophic discussions occupying many volumes, and are yet to occupy many volumes more. This is largely due to the fact that -the application of even the most fundamental of these doctrines must vary enormously, according to the country, the age, and the people concerned. This is not a -question of mathematics; we have not definite numbers, or particular units, to deal with. We are very much at large. Light ma.y be obtained from many quarters, and the discussion represents a perfectly honest have penetrated beyond the web ""of theory endeavour on the part of honourable members to grapple with problems which have engaged the attention of the ablest intellects of many nations, and will continue to engage attention after we are gone. To this legislation we shall offer a new page of experience whereby those coming after us may test their theories, my one anxiety being that our experience may be purchased at the lowest price possible. The different interpretations which conflicting authorities have placed upon the same sets of incidents have been repeated by honourable members to such an extent that, were one to endeavour to canvass their arguments, even in outline, a sitting would hardly suffice. It is without deprecating the length of the debate, and the contributions to it, that I preface my remarks, being fully conscious of the magnitude of the task, and appreciative of the gallant attempts of honourable members to grapple with it. If some are passed by, it is not because they are not pertinent to the matter in band, or need no discussion, but because, 6ft a' matter like this, we should co-operate in contributing from different stand-points in theendeavour to reach a satisfactory solution of a great national problem. If I put in the simplest form to which they can be reduced a few broad aspects of the In regard to the question, setting on one side the appeals endeavour will be to avoid the overshadowing of these relatively practical questions by the discussion of greater questions than it is necessary for us to resolve. I hope that this will not be misunderstood. I was a. member of the Victorian Parliament when it sat in this chamber, and questions like those now before us furnished the staple of discussion for a year or two. To that I may refer at another stage, mentioning it now to show that to some of us the present issues are not new. In the hope of sparing honourable members repetition, let me concentrate attention upon a few points which should at no time be lost to sight. ister finished his introductory speech, my honourable and learned colleague, the late Attorney-General and member for Angas, was able at once to make a statement of the experience on this question which is generally regarded as authoritative, and of the principal doctrines that must be borne in mind. He has been followed by a number of speakers on both sides of the chamber, whose speeches have shown that this is not a new question to them; some into sundry of its practical aspects. But",23,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading
53,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat) [4.32],"I ineven these practical aspects are so numerous that the endeavour to simplify them discovers conflicting currents of thought and competing interpretations which may ivell induce an agnostic attitude in regard to the whole subject. Honourable members on this side, and on the other, too, have enjoyed, and have exercised, great freedom in dealing with this Bill. The subject appears to me a proper question for Parliament, and an inevitable one. To disregard it would have been equivalent to action. This Parliament, having teen specifically endowed with power, is responsible for what it omits and for what it does. It has been responsible,by consent, for the existing currency for the past nine years. All responsibility for the future currency must rest upon the representatives of the people and those who elect them. The Constitution states as plainly as words can put it that this Parliament is authorized to act however it may think best in this matter. well have consisted in the strengthening of the securities of the banks. that the words of the Constitution do not require the adoption of any scheme. We accept full responsibility for any measure of our initiation, or, negatively, for the conproviding for the issue of' promissory notes, tinuance of existing conditions. Whether we remain active or inactive, our responsibility remains. That is an elementary point to be emphasized. Next we should note that this measure deals only with currency, though the last speaker and many others have discussed banking as distinct from currency. The two subjects are so interwoven that it is not easy to separate them. One of the elementary factors is that we are empowered, not by one section of the Constitution, but by several: There is, first of all, the obvious paragraph xu. of section 51, by which the Parliament is empowered to legislate in relation to "" currency, coinage, and legal tender."" Those words are susceptible of being so construed, under American precedents, at all events, as to embrace nearly anything and everything of the subject with which we are dealing. In immediate juxtaposition, we have paragraph XIII., by which the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to legislate with respect to banking, with certain qualifications and "" the incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money."" Those, therefore* who have discussed banking during this debate have been perfectly in order, for the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate with respect both to banking and currency. lateral provision, designed to complete the assertion of the Commonwealth's power by a demarcation of the sphere of the States. Honourable members will also find that in paragraph x v i . of section 51, we are empowered to legislate in respect not only ta bills of exchange, but promissory notes.. And what is this Australian note issue but a series of promissory notes, the only difference being that they are to be issued: by the Government of the Commonwealth; instead of by some other authority? I arm reminded that we exercised last year one of the powers conferred upon us by paragraph xvi. by passings Bills of Exchange Bill dealing with bills of exchange and promissory notes in general. If the constitutionality of this Bill were questioned on the ground that it extends beyond our power to legislate in respect of currency and, perhaps, banking, we might find the requisite power in paragraph iv., which authorizes the borrowing of money on the public credit of the Commonwealth. This is not only a Bill dealing With currency and banking, and! but it is in effect a loan Bill, and we have in paragraph iv. of section 51 a specific-' loan power. There is yet another section* with which I hope this legislation will never be associated. It has a grim, unpleasant sound, but the result of passing unwise, unsafe measures of this kind has beento bring many countries into ""bankruptcy and insolvency,"" in respect of which we have also power to legislate. I doubt if some of our critics have fully appreciated! either the many-sided powers that the Commonwealth possesses in this regard, or the many-sided character of the Bill now before us. It certainly is not a simple measure, that can be dealt with completely by the exercise of any one set of powers, and' hence I have recited several in order to convey an impression of its extreme complexity. That complexity is partly inherent and' partly attached to it, whether necessarily or unnecessarily, by Ministers. Thus, instead"" of this being the transparent proposal that one would suppose, judging by platform utterances and certain criticisms in this: House-instea d of its being possible to deal with it in a single category-it will take those who make such an examination",26,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading
54,Mr Bruce Smith,Such action might,27,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

57,Mr Deakin,"That is rather a colof it as it deserves into very different chanpercentage, and say, "" So much reserve nels, and into some of their many branches. Then we ought now to turn to a very preliminary conclusion to be drawn from ihe evidence which has been generously and almost lavishly laid before us by a number of honourable members ? Some of them are deserving of a special expression of our indebtedness, but to single them out must appear discourteous to others, and my memory might cause me to do an injustice to one or two. A number of them have laid before us all the illustrations that appear necessary to convince us of some of its essential aspects as a currency measure. One of these is that the experience of the world, from many countries and at many times, is that currency is not to be dealt with as an end in itself. Those who have attempted to imply that it is an instrument for the stimulation or control of any of the great social functions with which it is allied have invariably found themselves led to shipwreck. The function of currency is to minister to production, . trade, and exchange in all their operations, and its perfect success is achieved by its perfect ministration to these without obtruding itself. The easier it makes production or the freer and cheaper the exchange, the more it enables transactions to be conducted at a distance, for great matters, or in complex matters, and the less attrition there is, the greater the success. Currency serves best when it is least thought of. A country is financially in its soundest health when its people forget that there is any currency question, and have nothing to obtrude it on their minds. Mr G. B. EDWARDS --It is very HI. what digestion is to the physical body. not attempt to follow further the argument to which this is intended to relate. But quite a series of honourable members have spoken of the currency as if it were a tool to be used, so to speak, for some other end than that of an agency by which the. world's commerce and business are carried on. That has been a fruitful source of error. Then', again, we have constantly heard discussed the measure of risk that has been run by different enterprises, and the measure of risk we are about ""to run in this note issue. The world's experience, which has been cited by so many honourable members, proves, .if it proves Anything, that the risk is not so measurable. We cannot name, with precision, a must be held in gold and then you will be perfectly safe."" The experience which honourable members have heaped before us goes to show, that whilst in ordinary times, in a healthy community, the percentage of gold that need be held against u note issue may be inconsiderable, or fractional, that is only true, so long as there is no pressure.. The disasters that have been cited, have arisen from a want of knowledge of the fact that there is no average to be struck, and that, when the hour of emergency arrives, or is believed to be airiving, it can suddenly be raised. On the contrary, the world's experience goes to show that the currency, if tested at all, is tested at a time when practically no proportion is sufficient. It is put to a real test only when there is a panic. And when it is put to a panic test, we appeal in vain to the judgment and reason of men for a fair consideration of the real resources of any institution or currency. There is a natural disinclination on the part of those, who have not sufficiently saturated themselves with this experience, to allow large quantities of gold to be idle, when they might be usefully and profitably employed. The historical citations made prove that, in this matter, there is no security, except an absolute security, in time of panic. A practically immediate value must be given, meeting the whole of the obligations represented by the issue of paper money. M.r.

We are looking at this question and are entitled to do . so, in one sense, from a selfish point of view. We are considering schemes which must mean a loss to the States, and the States are Governments chosen by Australian citizens to conduct the. affairs of particular portions of Australia. speaking of a revenue loss. to the States. I venture to say that this loss to them is one that we can regret. It is unfortunate that it should be imposed upon them. In addition to that, the banking institutions of this country will be placed in a position of some temporary difficulty owing to a change of system which will take from them their gold, or,at all events, a considerable part of it, and transvaluable public asset, increasing the repufer it to the National Government, against the notes it will issue. The weakening of the banks' gold reserves is not a thing which would make them acceptable to the we, as Australian citizens, need rejoice at, even though it should help the creation of A national gold reserve. These matters require to be recollected. It may be said that no course can be taken in this life to the advantage of one person that is not in some way or another to the prejudice of others; but, as these considerations have been almost ignored during this debate, it seems worthwhile to mention them. big advantage to the public. tion. But when we are aiming at doing something which ought to be of advantage to the public we may still recognise that we are injuring or weakening, to some extent, local agencies which we do not desire to injure or weaken if that could be avoided. just the same. the interjection by the honourable member for North Sydney, with respect to a sinkNotes Bill. 1863 ing fund. The name was used because it should have that character. Whatever margin there is, between the gold which we think it necessary to hold, and our issue of paper money, represents, for the time being, a gift to the party issuing, whether it is a bank or the Commonwealth, and under this Bill it would be the Commonwealth. I have already indicated to what that should be applied. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -To increase the security. the total sum of the margin to which I have referred, instead of as this Bill proposes being placed at the disposal of Parliament for works or projects which we have yet to hear of, to authorize or to refuse, ought not to be put to any such purpose. From the very first this sum should be employed in the purchase of Commonwealth securities or debentures to be held as a sinking fund, and in trust as a support for this issue, and also as a means of improving the stability anl financial reputation of the Commonwealth. would be extra-currency. to its purpose. Having limited our margin to a reasonable small amount, it will, in the process of time, become a very tation and stability of the Commonwealth, and giving to these notes a backing which crustiest, most cautious, and timorous dealer in money the world has ever seen. Surely that is what we want? I hope I have answered the honourable member for North Sydney sufficiently. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Hear, hear. end of the argument I have been following, which may be summed up in this way. First of all, there is a legal power to issue Australian notes having a currency throughout the Commonwealth. There is not only the right to issue them, but, in my opinion, there is cast upon us the duty of issuing them. Not only is there the rjght and duty to issue them, but they can be issued, by a practically unanimous House, if it be done on such lines as I have indicated, putting our currency in so impregnable a position that the shadow of doubt could never be cast upon the issue ""in any respect.

77,Mr Deakin,"That brings me to theall the advantages attaching to it and absolutely without risk and without the possibility of danger under any circumstances and with guarantees and backing that make it practically impossible that any disaster can happen to it. If tliis were an Australian Notes Bill and only an Australian Notes Bill, we might establish under it an impregnable currency without taking a single ha'porth of risk in the whole transaction. The whole of the risks of this measure consist in an endeavour to attach to the Australian note issue and the gold reserve proper for the notes another purpose altogether. note issue can, and may, be made impregnable, but the loan policy hidden in it in this guise carries all the ordinary risks of such a policy, and with them the risk at some future date of making possible a shipwreck of the Australian note currency. Have the public apprehended these points ? Mr O. B. EDWARDS -They have never been put to the public. preciated this fact? Will not honourable members find if they speak to the average citizen in the tram that the idea generally held is that it is the note issue that necessarily carries the risks. People are doubtful about the proposed note issue only because of the risk. If you explain the matter to the average citizen he will say that he is perfectly satisfied with the proposal. What he will continue to have grave and very reasonable and proper doubts about, is the making of our note issue or currency a means for raising a loan which, depriving the issue of its impregnable security, delivers the banks, which I believe to be safe as us to the hazards of future panics. They may not come in our time; let us all hope they will not. They may not come for a long time, but come they will, unless this country is to have an experience differing from that of every other. What with the world changes at present taking place, thc uncertainties of commerce and the uncertainties of our own seasons, there must be times of tightness, even in this favoured part of the world, and when panic comes the damage is for a long while irreparable.

I should like to see this regarded as one of those questions which are above party politics.

Are conditions which are sought to be attached to our national notes such as to make us safe ? That is what I am concerned about. this Bill. ber can have no ""loan"" of us. I have been a little led off my track by interjections. The point I had reached was the Australian note issue, its value, and how to make it impregnable. There are, at least, three clear ways in which an Australian note issue could be obtained, and one of these I ought to have dealt with at an earlier stage. It was within our power, without taking a farthing of responsibility on ourselves, to pass an Australian Note Bill which would have imposed on the banks at present issuing their own notes all the safeguards which Parliament might think necessary. made with the narrow objects suggested by my honourable friends opposite, it would be for them to oppose and reject it ; but here, again, I am speaking of conditions which ought to be unanimously agreed on, that it would be for this Parliament to lay down. The note issue of it stands, could be made impregnable, ancl impregnable it ought to be made, before it could receive the imprimatur of the Commonwealth and go out as an Australian note issue. The exchange on notes between the States was not only antiquated, but indefensible; but to transform the current bank notes into Australian bank notes needed simply such an Act as this Parliament has in its power to pass, affixing all the necessary guarantees, and imposing them on the banks as a condition of the Why issue. The Commonwealth could retain against the issue cover which would make it safe.

We should require to face this problem from a standpoint which would differ from that of the Commonwealth, partly because the banks have a huge business already, with agencies in every direction, which could be directed to minister to operations in connection with the currency, as well as in connection with other matters. All that was possible, and that was one plain road we could have taken to give the Commonwealth an Australian note issue through the banks without incurring a penny of responsibility or a penny of risk, and, at the same time, relieving those who used the currency from any apprehension whatever. There is a second road we might have taken. I make no pretensions to be an authority on finance, but, naturally, it has been my duty and endeavour to learn as much as I could, and especially to listen to those who have experience and who .are specially competent to advise. On the last occasion when it was my official duty to be in London, I happened to be brought in contact with some of the principal financiers of the Mother Country, including governors of the Bank of England, from whom I sought advice and obtained it-advic e which was perfectly dispassionate and uninterested-in regard to the nnancial future point. The consensus of opinion was reof the Commonwealth. The questions, of course, covered a fairly wide area. They began with the possibilities of Australian loans, either by way of redemption of State issues or in connection with an agreeunder political control or too closely in ment with the States which would have covered all their loans, and also covered Commonwealth purposes. They passed from the consideration of loan business-the high costs that some of the States have had to pay on the London market, and the question of their reduction-to the possibilities of loan flotation in Australia itself, of our banks as agencies, by which this flotation could take place, and of questions incidental to the present note issue of the banks, and of a new note issue. It may If he considers simply his be said, of course, that the Briton is conservative in his habits; but to be conseivative in matters of finance is recognised as rather a strong recommendation. Changes are viewed rather askance, because the The probeaten road has been proved and any new road requires to be carefully scanned. So far as I could judge, except in two or three instances, the men to whom I spoke, If we were to have an Austhough themselves conducting large operations on the London money market, were quite free from special attachment to the Bank of England model. But the curious feature was that all the principal men were practically agreed that the best model Australia could take in launching any new financial adjustment would be the establishment of a bank in Australia fulfilling the same purposes that the Bank of England does for England, with the necessary changes to adapt it to Australian environment. They pointed out that by the chartering of a bank or group of banks under legal conditions, we could arrange for the new institution to take the Australian note issue under control, manage the flotation of our loans, and act as our financial agents generally. come in? brokers should not come in, but certainly the interests of the country should be placed first, and the brokers should earn their money by serving those interests, and not at the expense of the country, as they sometimes do.

104,Mr Deakin,"Even the least inof England have in serving their private interests, as well as in conducting pubto? lic business, the same successful results cannot be anticipated. It is so easy to make a State business run easily without involving loss, but at the same time without making those savings which sometimes it may be unpleasant to make, but which, when a bank is managed by men representing private as well as public interests, will undoubtedly be made. For these and other reasons the third mode to which I have referred does not happen to commend itself to me, and I say so plainly. I have pointed out how safe the note issue ought to be, and may be, made, and have called attention to the fact that it is not made safe merely because it is proposed to hold 25 per cent, of gold, the remaining 75 per cent, being in Treasury-bills to be sold to meet an emergency. I have my own ideas as to what would probably happen if an attempt were made to sell those bills to meet an emergency, but that is not the important point. So far as that part of the measure goes, it is a Loan Bill. The Prime Minister himself has told us that he expects the circulation of the Australian notes to reach £7,000,000. £7,000,000 early. I am taking the Prime Minister's first statement, when he spoke of £7,000,000. That means that £1,750,000 are to be held in gold. tical purposes. all practical purposes, £2,000,000 are to be held in gold, and that £5,000,000 are to be placed in the hands of the Government, subject to the authority of this Parliament, to be expended on whatever purposes may be thought fit. That amounts to a loan of £5,000,000. honourable member's mind by saying that I shall not ask for a penny of that money for Commonwealth expenditure. does not ask for the money for Commonwealth expenditure, he cannot ask for it either for State or private expenditure.

I should not have been unprepared for such a statement if this Bill had not preceded the Budget.

Fortunately, however, it is not necessary to speculate on that subject now. Under the circumstances, I'hope, also, that the Prime Minister will take a broad view of the proposed gold reserve; and will recognise that for some years to come, at all events, by way of establishing the reputation of the Australian note and putting it beyond all challenge, as a mere matter of policy he should provide a large increase on the proposed cover of gold to be held.

But I would press upon the Prime Minister that 25 per cent, is quite insufficient in itself as a reserve. Now we are launching a new system, we can afford to increase that cover in order to establish, once and for all, the reputation of the Australian note beyond cavil or question, even in times of panic. is that there are so many people who are anxious to have our notes even now ! -in many respects! I believe that when the honourable gentleman's statement, about investing the 75 per cent., is realized throughout the country, it will occasion a great sense of relief, and that the people generally will feel far more satisfied than will many of those enthusiasts a week ago. it shows that even after a week's reflection it has still held. The Prime Minister's word is quite good enough for me. I look forward with interest to the education of the enthusiastic gentlemen who have been predicting from platforms outside, and who have even hinted inside Parliament, that we were going 'to establish a golden age in this country-in one act-wit h other people's gold !-as a result of the present Government's financing. That illusion is gone. With that out of the way, and face to face with our circumstances, it appears that the questions we have to discuss are whether we can conserve the interests of Australia best by launching our note issue through the banks, or by undertaking it through some institution on the lines of the Bank of England. I should say that either of those two courses is greatly to be preferred to a purely Government departmental bank, for which I foresee no success, no adaptability, no progress. That would be true, even if we were fortunate enough now and then, amongst those who would be charged with the management of the institution, to find some of those rare men who, being possessed of great financial ability, would be willing to apply it with the same sleepless earnestness, the same zest, the same foresight, and the same anxiety to effect small savings, in a public position, that they own concerns. Because it is, we must remember, by the multiplication of small savings rather than by large dealings that those successful financial institutions have been built up. I have, however, trespassed quite long enough upon the time of the House, in the hope that a few of the aspects of the case that I have put might commend themselves to honourable members. I hope also that they may commend themselves to those public critics, many of whom, so far as I can judge, have much misrepresented the real bearing of the opportunities presented to this House by an issue of Australian notes. I think it must have become obvious to honourable members that interest in this debate has to a large extent gone out of the House. Those who have listened to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, and watched the very scanty attendance of honourable members during its delivery, must have recognised that fact. But, notwithstanding, I think that the speech was a peculiarly useful and interesting one in this respect. Although it did not deal with any of the disputed points which have been so fully debated in this House, it was educational in presenting a bird's-eye view of the risks and responsibilities which arise out of the measure. I am quite sure that those honourable members who sit on the Ministerial side, and who feel themselves bound to support this measure in all its details, will, nevertheless, if they have listened carefully to that utterance, have realized that, after all, this banking proposal of the Labour party is not one merely of ""beer and skittles,"" but one that involves a great responsibility, the seriousness of which few realized when they first embarked upon it as one of the planks in their platform'. I do not propose to follow other honourable members in dealing at length with what has been called the economic aspect of the question. But I wish to deal with what appear to me to be the practical aspects that have come into prominence during the course of the debate. I should like to preface the few observations I have to make by disclaiming sympathy with those critics who predict nothing but financial ihsastei as the necessary consequence of this measure. I do not think' that it is indispensable that this Bill should be followed by financial disaster..",34,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

126,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [5.40].,"It depends very much upon the type of man who, in the position of Treasurer, and in the position of Prime Minister, has the determination and the administration of it. With the Prime Minister at present in office, I should have no fear of reckless conduct regarding its administration, such as might be expected from some other members of the Labour party; because, although he may have just as strong a desire as any of them to realize the rather party with regard to this branch of legislation, there is also a strong element of Scotch caution in the Prime Minister which would always save him from running into extravagance, even in dealing with a banking measure. At the same time, I think that the measure is entirely uncalled for; and that the burden of proof is altogether on those who seek to interfere with the existing order of things, which have been conducted, at all events since 1893, without the slightest public inconvenience or danger. The burden is upon them to show that the bank currency of the country, apart fromany process of obtaining cheap loans, or the desire to interfere in the banking arrangements of Australia, is lacking something which can only be remedied by this proposed interference by the Commonwealth. I submit that that has not been shown by anybody on the other side. I have listened to all the speeches on tliis measure with great care, and I am willing to award to one or two of the speakers a meed of praise-for what it is worth-for the temperate manner in which they spoke, and the thorough manner in which they appear to have investigated the question before coming here as critics. At the same time, I hold that since 1893 the currency of this country has gone on so smoothly, with so little fault being foun3 on the part of the public, that there is a strong obligation on the Government, apart from their banking ambitions, and their desire to get a ""loan for nothing or for very little, to show that the currency with which alone this Bill professes to deal, is so un satisfactory that it is one of the urgent -questions for the State to deal with. That is, I submit, the logical position in which this measure is placed before the House. Not only is the measure uncalled for, but in my opinion it is unnecessary, and it has within it I speak with all care and responsibility-the germs of disaster if its administration should fall into the hands of a -reckless or even careless Treasurer, or a careless Government. By passing the measure we shall be adding unnecessarily to the statute law, though that in itself is not of much consequence, and increasing the financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth. I feel sur2 that honourable members, whether they sit on this side or on the other side, will admit, as the result of their reading, and whatever may be their view of the wisdom of .passing the measure, that all deal ings with money on the part of a State, which means on the part of the Government fevered expectations of his already occupied with State affairs, party considerations, questions of expenditure in order to meet the approval of the public, all questions connected with money, whether it be with banking or with currency, are dangerous-mor e dangerous in the case of a State than in the case of private organizations, whose business it is, apart from all political considerations, to devote their whole attention to that one question, and to make that the object of their business lives. mostly. member has the old bee in his bonnet. I shall deal with that question in a moment, if he will wait, and shall show him, I think, that it is a complete misconception on the part of the Labour party that there is much, if any, profit being made out of the notes which the State ought to take out of their hands. I ask the House to consider what is trie genesis of this measure. We all know that ever since the Labour party has been in existence it has talked of a State bank. And we know, from speeches which have been made by members of that party, and from articles which have appeared in the Labour press, that there has been a widespread belief that certain private individuals were making millions of money out of the system of banking and out of the issue of bank notes. That has been the popular "" Labour"" opinion; and it is held by a number of honourable : members here. The honourable member who has just interjected is evidently labouring under the opinion that the banks are making huge profits out of the present issue of £4,000,000 worth of notes, and that the sooner the State takes this function into its own hands the sooner will the banks lose this profit, and the sooner will the State acquire it. a very clever twister. I never said anything of the kind.",35,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

129,Mr Fenton,"The honourable member iseffect of the honourable member's interruption. complete misconception of the position of the banking business. I am not going into the question of banking itself, although honourable members are very familiar with the scores of Labour cartoons, in which banks have been represented, not as the property of mixed bodies of persons, of whom some are rich, some poor, and some with very moderate means, but as the property of certain very rich and vulgar persons who have no other object in life than to cheat the public in every possible way, and prey upon their means. I have hereand I always like to go to the journalistic fountain-head-a n article which appeared in the Worker as far back as April. Worker, which is the only Labour publication that I read. In my view it is the most clever Labour paper in Australia; and I read it more particularly because I think that whatever ability is displayed with regard to the Labour policy emanates from that source. A short extract will give to the House, and the public, some idea of the way in which the banking class are viewed by the rank and file of the Labour party, and even by one of its most influential journalistic editors. Speaking of what the Government are going to do, it saysThe establishment of a Commonwealth bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve, would be a big step towards making the Australian nation master of its own currency and liberate its citiorable member who is now a member of zens from the talons of the Money Power. That is an absolutely childish and ludicrous view of the whole banking business of Australia, because, in the first place, the share lists of banks, which can be inspected in every State on the payment of a shilling, include all sorts and conditions of men and women. The shareholders in banks are just as numerous and just as varied as are the depositors in the Government Savings Bank in the different States. Those who attended any of the meetings in connection with the reconstruction schemes of 1893 were afforded a vivid illustration of the varied character of the shareholders. They represented every class of people-shop keepers, merchants, clergymen, and women, and workmen. Yet, from time to time, the banks are personified, as represented in the cartoons, and as described in this newspaper, as a set of "" vultures "" who have no other purpose in life except to bleed the public of their honestly acquired means. There is no doubt about it that this Bill iswhat is left-the mere rudiment-of that That idea is, I repeat, based on a misconception of the robbery which is said to be going on by the banking class. It has been whittled down until we were told, that the Government were going to limit their Bill to a note issue. VVe know that only, so far back as the time of the Brisbane Conference tliere was a scheme brought forward, not merely for a note issue, but for the establishment of a State bank. That scheme was designed, I believe, by the honourable member for Darwinj and it provided among other things-and honourable members will see what a crude state its. designer's mind must have been in at the time-that there should be no money to meet the notes, that they should only be met in one part of Australia, either by Commonwealth consols or by gold, at the option of the-ComptrollersGeneral of the bank. I ask honourable members to consider for a moment what a tremendous transformation must have taken place in the corporate opinions of the Labour party since they approved of that scheme. by the Conference. This was a scheme which was actually approved by the Conference at Brisbanealthough it was founded upon a proposal to ask the States to take shares, and the whole capital of the bank was to consist of 12,000 shares, of £100 each. An honthe Executive of this country conceived' this childish, this silly, scheme for a national bank. the honourable member not to go into details. into details, sir. ber say that that Brisbane scheme was adopted ?

Mr O'Malley put it before the Conference, but it was not adopted. imprimatur of the Labour Conference at Brisbane, in July, 1908. ciples of it did. titled to go into details, and therefore I cannot follow the matter further, except to say that, however crude it was, its general principles received the imprimatur of the Brisbane Conference. It was designed by a gentleman who might have been Treasurer of the Commonwealth. This Bill is merely the rudiment of it. The national bank scheme has been put on one side, and although honourable members opposite talk confidently of our seeing very shortly a Bill to create a State bank, my own belief is that the Labour party already sees the difficulty, and almost the impossibility of establishing a State bank, and that we shall hear very little more about it. The whole scheme is then reduced to this proposal for a Commonwealth note currency. I desire now to quote the ideas of one of the leading organs of the Labour party as to a State issue-thi s same Queensland Worker. In the first place we were told that there was no need for a money backing, and that the Government were merely bowing to a "" gold fetish "" in providing for any redemption whatever. The same newspaper characterizes as "" a waste of money"" even the providing for 25 per cent, of the note issue. Honourable members will, then, see for themselves that within a very short period the Labour party have gone through some very interesting changes, beginning with this "" hifalutin"" scheme by which they were to make hundreds of thousands of pounds for the public. They have lately abandoned as impossible and impracticable a measure for a State Bank. come down now tb this note issue, with a 25 per cent, gold backing, which backing one of their leading organs condemns as a waste of money. It is interesting to see the evolution of the measure' when it comes before the House in this way. I should like to go from that to this general statementand I think it will be supported by all who have studied this question-that banking in any shape or form is a business. If there be any doubt on that point, I support my statement by reference to an authority who has already been very frequently quoted on both sides-Walte r Bagehota banker whose experience extended over a lifetime, and who was regarded as one of the ablest thinkers in English politics. writers on the subject, too. regard that as less important. him to convey his views with wonderful clearness. his book on Lombard Street, he has expressed opinions of very great value, and saysNothing can be truer in theory than the economic principle that banking is a trade, and only a trade; and nothing can be more surely established than that a Government which interferes with any trade injures that trade. When once we have recognised that banking is a trade, we see fhat it is very questionable whether a Government should enter upon any branch of it unless under the pressure of absolute urgency. If the currency of the country since 1893, a period of seventeen years, had not met all the needs of our commerce, the time would have arrived for the Government to -interfere j but, recognising that banking is a trade and money a commodity, that a banker is merely a dealer in money, and that commerce has not suffered by reason of the present currency, we take upon ourselves a tremendous burden if we enter upon this trade in the hope of providing a better currency. If Ministers were to honestly declare that their object is to borrow without paying interest, which was undoubtedly the primary purpose of the measure, their position would be different. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister has told the House that he does not look for profit, and I shall demonstrate, by means of They have figures, not only that he will make no profit, but that what he proposes will involve the public in a monetary loss. The Bill was, as I have said, put on the Government programme with a view to raising a loan without paying interest, as is shown by a quotation from the Labour bible> The proposal of the Fisher Ministry is to issue up to £4,000,000 almost at once. . . . In this way the Government will obtain a £3,000,000 loan without interest.",37,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

148,Mr Bruce Smith,"That is so. Inber must not read a newspaper comment upon a measure before the House. object of the Bill was to enable the Government to borrow £4,000,000 without paying interest for it. If the Government has abandoned the hope of gaining in this way by the proposal, Ministers and those who support them have no right to disturb the currency, and involve the public in an actual money loss, which will come from mixing up with politics the business of banking, and which may involve serious trouble in future. Why should the Commonwealth embark upon this business of banking? There are wild spirits, like the Postmaster-General, who would like the Commonwealth to run a line of ocean steamers. Not long since he spent two hours in trying to persuade the House to approve of the establishment of a line of steamers to run in opposition to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and the Orient Steam Navigation companies' vessels. run such a line successfully, seeing that we run railways successfully ? there are no private railways in competition with the State railways, to show that greater facilities than are at present enjoyed in Australia might well be offered to our public at less cost.

During the last"" twenty years I have had a great many financial dealings of various kinds in this country, but have handled very few bank notes, and probably, during the last fifteen years, not one bank note has passed through my hands. honourable member's cheques are so good. gentleman has a valuable point. The people of this counfry are extraordinarily favoured in regard to currency. Should a man have only £ 1 to his credit in a bank, he could draw four cheques for it ; and the banks charge only 5s. a half-year for conducting their customers' businesses. The banks charge only 5s. a half-year for conducting the business of men who keep very small balances to their credit. They accept their'clients' cheques, cash them on order, take other cheques and collect them, supply cheque-books, keep a record of transactions which is equivalent to a cash book, if the customer makes out his cheques properly, all for the sum of 5s. a half-year; and cheques may be issued for any amount. I know from experience that to use cheques is an excellent way to pay small accounts, because it enables one to largely dispense with coin, and to keep a record of every payment. In the course of a year, a man may sign hundreds of cheques, and every one who possesses a banking account has in his .cheque-book what is equivalent to an unlimited supply of bank notes. ios. a year, the banks earn interest on the balances lying at the credit of their depositors. member may have such a large amount to his credit that his bank may make something by using it, but I leave so little in my account that it is of no value to the bank. Our banking system, therefore, affords; facilities for the using of cheques which is not given in any other part of the world. Many years ago when a student in England, I could not get a bank of any importance in London to keep my account, unless I would undertake to leave £ 1 0 0 always to my credit. all when in England, but I was able lo keep a banking account.

Since I8Q -? there has been no complaint about the currency, which makes all the greater the responsibility of the Government in proposing a change which contains the germs of serious trouble.

170,Mr Bruce Smith,"They said thatQueensland National Bank. That, however, is not a State bank. There is no doubt that the bank and the Government have a financial connection, but the bank itself is a money-making institution. It has shareholders, and pays dividends, and therefore comes under the "" fat man "" condemnation of the Labour party and the Labour journals. It so happens that the Government of the day found it convenient for the benefit of the people of Queensland to go to the rescue of the bank, and in that way there has been an intimate connection between the Government and the bank, and the notes have been guaranteed by the Government. That, however, affords no parallel of what we are doing to-day. The administration of tliis Bill will be entirely supervised, because they become very valuin the hands of the Government of the day. Under it they will have power to put out future notes for the payment of debts, with no outside body, like a bank directorate, to manage the issue. It will be entirely in the hands of the politicians of -the day, and primarily in the hands of the Treasurer and his Ministry. There is, therefore, no parallel whatever with the Queensland National Bank, to which reference has so frequently been made. I now ask the House to consider what is going to be the financial outcome of this Bill. It will be admitted at the outset that the questo be recorded and brought back to the tion is not what the .Commonwealth, but what the people, will gain. The people of Australia at the present time are gaining £80,000 per annum from the issue of £4,000,000 of bank notes. Let me show the House, and especially those honourable members who constantly remind us that the banks are making a great deal of money out of their note issue are? member, I think, said so once. corrected the honourable member. said several times in the House-and it is a popular idea amongst the Labour party outside-that the banks are making a great deal of money out of their note issue. member think that they are losing money by the transaction? honourable member; and if he will bring his practical mind to bear he will have to follow me in my figures. The banks are now paying 2 per cent, to the State Governments for the privilege of issuing notes, and, as honourable members know, they pay only 3 per cent, on deposits for twelve months. They get hundreds of thousands of pounds at 3 per cent., without any obligation to issue notes or do anything in that direction. They give 3 per cent, per annum on money which is carried to, and left with, them for a fixed period, whilst, as I have said, they pay 2 per cent, for the privilege of issuing notes. NowI ask honourable members to think of what the banks have to do for the remaining 1 per cent. They must remember that bank notes have, to be carefully printed upon special hand-made paper, and that their printing has to be able documents. The actual cost of the paper and printing is said to be ios. per £100 of notes. member, vvho is at the head of one of our large banking institutions, says that the cost is 12s. per cent. I take it at ios. per cent. That brings the cost to the bank, including the note tax, up to 2 per cent. L Then we have to remember that notes are carried from State to State; that they have banks, and that gold has to be given to other banks in exchange for them. A record has to be kept of all these transactions with other banks in all the States, and all this has to be done out of the remaining ios. per cent. without straw. member's remark shows that the common sense cf this statement goes home to him. Seeing that the banks can obtain money on deposit for twelve months at 3 per cent., they are not deriving any great profit from notes in respect of which they have to pay a tax of 2 per cent, in addition to 12s. per cent, for the printing of the paper, and an average of 8s. for exchange in gold, and the cost of keeping a record of all these transactions. At present, then, they are making absolutely nothing out of their note issue. The Commonwealth is going to take over this work, and I want to know how it is going to make any money out of it for the people. honourable member's argument, it is a wonder that the banks issue notes.",40,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

This, therefore, appears to be a complete answer to those somewhat windy advocates of this measure outside of Parliament, who are constantly telling us, as the Worker of Queensland does, that the Commonwealth is going to get a loan for nothing, and that there is no need for any gold reserve at all. I have tried to look at the question from a purely business point of view, and without any attempt at advocacy. One naturally asks oneself, "" Why is a House of Parliament, with its hands full of legislation, much of which is neededbecause there are many measures, such as the consolidation of the insurance law, and the banking law, which are urgently demanded-postponin g it indefinitely in order to discuss a Bill for the introduction of a substituted currency which will upset the existing currency, and add another function to the State, and a very dangerous function, too, to a political body like a Government? Great risks will certainly be run if the administration of the Act ever falls into the hands of less careful people than the present Treasurer. These figures should make the Government pause in their hurry to get the measure through. I should like to add a little to the flood of quotations already made, not on the point as to how large the gold backing should be, but on the general question of the wisdom of a Government entering into financial functions. I would mention Adam Smith, the pioneer and perhaps the greatest among political economists, as an authority on this very subject. His writings are very measured and careful, and the history of political economy has shown that his opinions are always worthy of consideration. Speaking of the banking conditions of the year in which he wroteI think about 1776-h e saidThe profit of a public bank has been a source of revenue to more considerable working of any system of banking, we must States. It has been so not only to Hamburg, but to Venice and Amsterdam. A among whom it operates. revenue of this kind has even by some people shrewd, calculating mind of the Scotch or the been thought not below the attention of so great Dutch, with thc impassioned go-ahead spirit of an empire as that of Great Britain.

Honourable members will see that as far back as Adam Smith's time there were people who thought that the State should take over the banking business of the Bank of England, and secure for the people the profits that were being derived from it. Adam Smith continuesThe orderly vigilant and parsimonious administration of such aristocracies as those of Venice and Amsterdam is extremely proper, it appears from experience, for the management of a mercantile project of this kind. But whether such a Government as that of England, which, whatever may be its virtues, has never been famous for good economy; which, in time of peace, has generally conducted itself with a slothful and negligent profusion that is, perhaps, natural to monarchy; and in time of war has constantly acted with all the thoughtless extravagance that democracies are apt to f a l l into; could be safely trusted with the management of such a project, must, at least, be a good deal more doubtful. It will be admitted that that quotation gains weight by the measured nature of its expression. Adam Smith recognised that there were people then clamouring that the State should secure the profits that were being made by the Bank of England. He recognised, also, that in certain States in which a firm hand was kept on the finances, it had been shown that the State could undertake such business; but he thought it a very doubtful proposition that in any country like England such a function should be attempted by the Government. I propose now to quote from another writer who has not previously been referred to in this debate. I refer to Mr Leone Levi, a well-known British writer on finance. good man on finance. a race that is credited with having good financial ability. At page 226 of his work, History of British Commerce, it will be found that he saysTo form, however, a correct notion of the not ignore the idiosyncrasies of the nation Compare the cool, The sime !:i.w mav operate But in the Government, it is contended, could United States, where each State possesses a",43,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

Not so in the new world, where progress is so rapid and intermittent. 1 submit that the distinction here drawn between the possibility of performing State functions in Europe and America applies with great force to Great Britain and Australia, which is equally go-ahead, and very mu-h in the same position as America was in at the time when Adam Smith wrote. At page 231 of his book, Mr Leone Levi quotes a very useful passage from Daniel Webster. He claims that Webster was ""one of the most eminent statesmen of America, and held strong views on this subject."" He quotes him as sayingI lay it down as an unquestionable truth, that no paper can be made equal and kept equal to gold and silver, but such as is convertible into gold and silver on demand. further and still further than this, and I contend that even convertibility, though itself indisfessor of Political Economy in the Unipensable, is not a certain and unfailing ground of reliance. ' There is liability to excessive issue of paper while paper is convertible at will. found ? What principles of prevention may be telied on? which the most discreet of them all follow, by compelling them to maintain a fixed proportion between specie and circulation, without regard to deposits on one hand and notes paj'able to bearer on the other. Honourable members will see that Webster is there approving a system such as that advocated by the Leader of the Opposition, that, instead of embarking upon a risky commercial function, or, as Bagehot calls it, a "" trade,"" we should utilize our powers by altering the Commonwealth law in such a way as to compel the banks to conform to those practices with regard to the issue of notes which the most competent and most cautious of them now use. We could do that, and secure to the people of Australia a surer currency, which would meet every object we deem them to require, and, at the same time, avoid entering upon this very dangerous function-because every one must admit that it has within it the germs of 'trouble if its administration be in the hands of reckless men. Australia from having placed in their hands this very dangerous weapon, which might at any time prove a menace to the commercial and financial peace of the Commonwealth. I should like also to quote a short passage from Garfield, but not upon Mr Bruce Smith. some of the aspects of the question which have been dealt with by other honourable In the Old World, moreover, we members. On the question as to whether the Government should interfere in a matter of trade of this kind, Garfield saysNo Government can safely undertake to supply its people with a paper currency issued directly by the Government, because no human legislature can determine how much currency the wants of a country require, and because a State note issue does nol possess the power of adapting itself to the business of a country. Francis Walker, who has been quoted on another aspect of the question, and who is acknowledged to be one of the greatest economists America has produced, says on this subjectI wish to say here that in our own country America, to-daya region where more financial heresies grow and flourish than upon any other civilized soil-politica l economists in our great universities are overwhelmingly arrayed in opposition to the Government usurping the legitimate functions of the banks in attempting to provide paper money for the people. But I have gone Bonamy Price, who was formerly the Proversity of Oxford, saysA Government is a bad direct issuer of paper Where, then, shall a regulator be currency, and every nation would do well not to f a l l into such a snare. By subjecting all banks to the rule Then a French writer, Beaulieu, saysA Government is ill-fitted and ill-equipped to maintain paper money in circulation, even if the paper is redeemable in specie. The redemption is in itself a great trouble and a great embarrassment. Facilities for protecting the metallic reserve are as completely lacking in the State as they are abundant in the banks. Honourable members may, in a know-all sort of way, shake their heads at these authorities. member would not call Richard Bonamy Price an authority. vote their whole attention to a science like political economy, and take into careful consideration the practical data supplied to them through literature from the whole world, there is not one of us in a position to sneer at the opinions of such authorities as if they were worthiest,. The honourable member for Hindmarsh should not forget that Bonamy Price, We might save the Government of in this matter, does not stand alone. He has supporting him men like Garfield, Francis Walker, and practically also Adam Smith, Leone Levi, and MacLeod. 1 am not saying that these men are right.

194,Mr Bruce Smith,"When men dethan they do; but, as business men intrusted with legislation for the welfare of the people, we can none of us justify a sneer at the views expressed by some of the greatest authorities in the world on this subject. I have shown the House what is likely to be the financial result of this measure. The question is : What have we to gain by it? show how the authorities he has quoted have been justified by the Queensland experience ? able member had been present, he would have known that I have shown that the Queensland National Bank, which has frequently been quoted to us as supporting this scheme, has nothing whatever to do with it. The Queensland National .Bank is a money-making institution. Queensland National Bank, but to the Queensland Treasury note issue. able member say that the Queensland Treasury note issue has shown any better results than the note issues of the private banks? Can he show that there has been the slightest interference with the true currency of the notes of the banks of Australia since 1893? I have dealt with 1893 in what I have said, and if the honourable member cannot show this, why does he quote Queensland as justifying the introduction of this Bill? AllI am contending is that the Government are proposing that we should undertake an unnecessary bianch of trade. I use the word "" trade "" because that is the word used by Bagehot, the authority I have quoted. Banking is a tradea dealing in money. It is a difficult trade, and men to be successful in it require to give their whole lives to its study. Why do banks pay their general managers salaries of from £3,000 to £5,000 a year unless it be that they recognise that theyrequire at the head of such institutions men with a very rare fund of experience in dealing with, the difficult subject of finance? If honourable members opposite could show me that the Commonwealth is going to make money for the people by getting a loan for nothing, or that the currency of Australia has so failed that it has become necessary that the Commonwealth Government should substitute for it something which will give better results, I should be ready to be persuaded. But the figures I have quoted speak for themselves, and figures do not lie if properly handled. I have invited honourable members opposite to criticise the figures I have put before them, and show me how any amount on the debit side could be saved. I have shown that, whether we float a loan of £4,000,000 or £7,000,000 in the way here proposed, we shall be put to much greater expense than we should be by floating a loan of the same amount on the market in the ordinary way. I recognise that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of the adoption of the latter course by honourable members opposite. I recognise that objection to loans of all kinds is in the Labour programme. A national bank and a national note issue are in the Labour programme, and I admit that that makes it very uncomfortable, if not, impossible, for the Labour party to go back on these proposals. I am not twitting the Labour party, hut merely say they are in a difficulty; and I did not refer to the I am asking them to deal with the question in the light of the many educational speeches we have had on this side of the House. I venture to say there are very few who can honestly state that they know no more to-day about this question than they did a month ago. Honourable members on both sides have applied themselves to the literature on the subject; and, after all, the literature on political economy questions embodies all the practical experience that is regarded as having any bearing on the general principles applicable to public finances. If those facts are undeniable, there is no escaping from the logical conclusion that it is undesirable for the State to undertake this function. I desire to say one or two words about the speeches made on the other side; and honourable members will credit me with having taken some care to be present when they were delivered. I have already said of the Prime Minister's speech that it practically gave no information to the House. It gave no idea of what advantage the Government expect to get from the B ill ; he spoke of no profit, and, in fact, said that profit was not its object. It is quite possible that the Prime Minister has worked the thing out, as probably the Treasury officials have done, and that he has found that, much as the bubble has been blown in the past, there is nothing in it when it is carefully examined. The honourable gentleman could not show that the people had been inconvenienced in any way in regard to the currency during the last seventeen years. As to the Attorney-General's speech, we all know that",45,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

I cannot say that I saw any indication of joking in the wording of his speech, but it sounded to me as if he delivered it with his tongue in his cheek. It seemed like a speech that had been prepared for the introduction of a Banking Bill, for it never touched the question of a note issue. spirit I thoroughly appreciated. The honThe honourable member moved away from the latter question, and entered on a sort of general excursion into banking. He quoted from the Banking and Insurance Record facts relating to different crises, but, though I listened very carefully, I could not see that the quotations had any bearing on the question of a note issue. The two questions which have never been touched on, except by two or three honourable members opposite are: What is the advantage to be got from this proposal? and, will that advantage, if We get it, compensate for the risk we must run, not to-day, for I am not afraid of the present Prime Minister as Treasurer, but from future Treasurers? long time for future Treasurers 1 long time for the honourable member, but I speak from a more youthful point of view, and expect to see many Treasurers before I have done. We have to think of the future. It is all very well to say that in the hands of a cautious Treasurer no harm can be done. When a Government may get into financial difficulties, and find it has the power to use the money, it will be a great temptation. Even though there may be checks, as proposed in the Bill, we have seen in this House how much such checks are sometimes respected. We have had two instances, one of the present Government using the trust moneys without the consent of Parliament; and, though the emergency may have been very great, we must consider that similar emergencies may justify a Treasurer in issuing more notes than he has a legal gold backing for. The Prime Minister has told us that the immediate issue contemplated is only £^4,000,000, but that there is power to issue £7,000,000, and he may go to ,£10,000,000! ,£10,000,000, seeing that there is nothing about that figure in the Bill? Wfe have the possibility of a future Treasurer using the power beyond the prudent stage. The honourable member for Calare made a long speech, to which I listened with great interest, but I am bound to say that I got no light at all from it. The two speeches that did indicate some research were those by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Dalley. The speech of the honourable member for Dalley was the most argumentative on that side of the House, and it was made in a orable member did resort to authorities, and on those endeavoured, though I do not admit successfully, to show that they justified this measure. The honourable member for Hindmarsh dealt largely with his favourite author. I know that the honourable member has been nursing that author upon his seat for the last two or three weeks, and he quoted him largely. ber's author is the Queensland Worker! Labour party's author; and I do not know that I have ever quoted to approve of it, but have only done so to show the Labour policy in its wilder stages outside Parliament. The honourable member for Dalley dealt with a passage of John Stuart Mill, and tried to draw a distinction which would justify this measure. Honourable members will recollect that Mill puts two hypotheses; he says that if the banking function proposed to be treated by a Government is one of a ""mechanical"" character, there is no reason why the State should not undertake it ; but that if it is one of an elastic character, requiring the exercise of judgment and discretion from time to time, it is undesirable that the State should undertake it. The honourable member for Dalley seems to think, and, in fact, expressed the opinion that this measure comes under the first hypothesis-that the note issue is a ""mechanical process."" member gave me that impression, because I said at the time that he would find a second hypothesis in which the question is not a mechanical one, but one requiring judgment, caution, and modification from time to time, and that Mill deprecates the State taking that function into its hands. say that this Bill finally comes under both hypotheses. we differ in the intellectual discussion.

They will have to increase rhe gold backing from time to time, and get in their notes, and get them out again; and this will require, as I say, a good deal of judgment. In the little book of Bagehot, Lombard Street, there is an interesting passage, which, though not conclusive either way, is very instructive. He points out, as the result of great practical experience, what a very elastic power this is, and how much judgment it requires to administer a function of this sort, so as not to produce evil results. In his chapter on ' The principles which should regulate the 1 amount of the banking reserve to be kept by the Bank of England,"" which is not a fixed amount, he saysTliere is a very common notion that the amount of the reserve which the Bank of England ought to keep can be determined at once from the face of their weekly balance-sheet. Honourable members will notice that in clause 11 of the Bill it is provided that every month the public shall be informed by a statement printed in the Gazette how many notes are out, and how much gold there is in hand, so that it may be known from time to time exactly how the States stand in the matter of the currency. It will be remembered that under the Bill the statement is to be made monthly. Bagehot goes on to sayIt is imagined that you have only to take the liabilities of the Banking Department, and that a third or some other fixed proportion will in all cases be the amount of reserve which the Bank should keep against those liabilities. this there are several objections, some arising from the general nature of the banking trade, and others from the special position of the Bank of England. Then there is an interesting passage showing what a number of vicissitudes and changes have to be taken into account by any one who undertakes to safeguard a currency and keep a sufficient gold backing. He saysAn old banker once told me : "" Sir, I was on Lord Althorpe's committee which decided on the publication of the bank account, and I voted against it. I thought it would frighten people. But I am bound to own that the committee was light ancl I was wrong, for that publication has given the money market a greater sense of security than anything else which has happened in my time. The diffusion and confidence through 1-cmbard-street and the world is the object of the publication of the bank account and of the bank reserve. Honourable members must be But that object is not attained if the amount uf the reserve when so published is not enough to tranquillize people. A panic is sure to be caused if that reserve is, from whatever use, exceedingly low. At every moment there is a certain minimum, which I will call the appre-1 hension minimum,' below which the reserve cannot fall without great risk of diffused fear; and by this I do not mean absolute panic, but only a vague fright and the timorousness which spreads itself instantly, and as if by magic, over the public mind. Such seasons of incipient alarm are exceedingly dangerous, because they beget the calamities they dread. What is most feared at such moments of susceptibility is the destruction of credit; and if any grave failure or bad event happens at such moments, the public fancy seizes on it, there is a general run, and credit is suspended. The bank reserve then never ought to be diminished below the ' apprehension point.' And this is as much as to say, that it never ought very closely to approach that point; since, if it gets very near, some accident may easily bring it down to that point and cause the evil that is feared.. a note issue? though the honourable member may not see it. banking. of a reserve against notes and deposits, and he says furtherThere is no ' royal road ' to the amount of the ' apprehension minimum ' ; no abstract argument, and no mathematical computation will teach it to us. And we cannot expect that they should. Credit is of opinion generated by circumstances and varying with those circumstances. The state of credit at any particular time is a matter of fact only to be ascertained like other matters of fact; it can only be known by trial and inquiry. And in the same way, But to nothing but experience can tell us what amount of ' reserve will create a diffused confidence; 1 on such a subject there is no way of arriving at a just conclusion except by incessantly watching the public mind, and seeing at each juncture how it is affected Too much reserve only means a small loss of profit, but too small a reserve may mean ' ruin.' That is to say, if we have a reserve of 30 per cent., it means a loss of profit. This has some reference to banking but primarily to the currency issued by the Bank of England, and these words, written by one of the most experienced bankers in England in his time, show that the function of issuing notes is not so easy as honourable members think. It is not that the Treasurer merely has to say, "" I have 25 per cent, of gold in hand, and, therefore, it does not matter how much in notes I put out"" j if he puts out more notes than",47,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

Suppose there is a limit of ,£4,000,000, and the Treasurer puts out £7,000,000, or goes to £10,000,000 in notes in order to meet some big obligation of the Commonwealth, and they come back into the Treasury unexpectedly, he will have to be ever on the alert to see that he has gold, not only to the amount of 25 per cent., but to a probably much larger amount, to meet notes which may come back. For it must be recognised that the practice of the banks has demonstrated that £4,000,000 in notes isabout what the people of Australia need for their commerce. If the Commonwealth put out ,£7,000,000 in notes, and a larger proportion than was anticipated came back quickly into the Treasury, it would not be sufficient to say to the people, "" Under the Act we had only to keep 25 per cent, in gold."" The Treasurer would have to provide probably the whole £[3,000,000 to meet the difference between the £4,000,000 and the £7,000,000. ment, demonstrate that the Treasury cannot put out notes to suit themselves without considering what the people really want throughout Australia, I say that the process is not a mechanical one, and that it, therefore, comes under the second hypothesis in Mill's work, as being a function which the State ought not to undertake. the suspension of the Bank Charter in 1844 ? dealing with ihe history of note issues, but with general principles; applicable to any time. I desire, -also, to say a word about legal tender. from some remarks made outside-and from some of the speeches made here -that , when it is said of a note that it is legal tender, it is supposed that every one must take it. But that is not so. "" Legal tender "" does not mean that you can force notes upon people. ""Legal tender"" is only legal tender when there is an existing debt to be paid. If I make a contract with an honourable member opposite, he has a perfect right to stipulate with me whether the debt shall be paid in notes or in gold. I cannot contract with a person to build a house for me for £500 in gold, and pay him in notes, unless I have stipulated that I may do so. I can, however, legally tender notes in payment of an existing debt. A person has a perfect right to say, "" I will only build this house for you if you pay me in gold."" That is not contrary to the law. The honourable member for Werriwa, who is listening to my argument and has had a legal training, will bear me out in saying that legal tender applies only to existing debts. If there is the slightest doubt about these Commonwealth notes, they will not, except for an existing debt, be accepted. If the banks are going to charge commission on them equal to that charged by the Commonwealth on its postal notes, men will be wary of taking them at par. If workmen are paid in notes-as they may be, because, having done their fortnight's work, there is an existing debt for which they are bound to take notes in payment-the y may go to a bank, aiid, if what I assume may be the case is the case, the bank, or a storekeeper, may say, "" Yes, I will take your notes, but I will take them less exchange."" the storekeeper will have to take the notes. member is quite right, but I am speaking Andi f I , by that arguof the class of men who are not in debt to storekeepers. the working. classes to say that there are few of them who are not in debt to storekeepers.

In such a case there would be no existing debt, and, as I have said, a bank would have a perfect right to demand exchange. demand. I have noticed member may think not. I do not wish to deal with the details of the Bill, but I must refer to one other provision in it, to the effect that there shall be an investment of the moneys earned. I asked the Prime Minister whether the moneys resulting from the issue would be used for discharging Commonwealth obligations. He said, "" Possibly."" This afternoon I heard him say, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, that the money earned or obtained under this Bill would be used for investments.

What are the investments to be for? notes. not be, because it must be an investment in certain stocks which would or might not be "" liquid."" -of the Bill that I do not want to discuss now, because we shall have an opportunity in Committee, but I want to mention it. There is a provision that every bank shall be compelled to pay over £ 2 5 in Commonwealth notes at any time when de.manded. There is nothing to show how .many times a demand may be made. Therefore, it is possible for a body of men to come along every few minutes and demand £ 2 5 in notes. It would be an obvious wrong to compel a bank to be ready at any moment to hand over notes to the .amount of £ 2 5 at a time, as often as demanded, without limiting the period within which the demand might be repeated. To make a provision to that effect would be to .give any person who chose to inconvenience a bank an opportunity to demand unlimited notes for gold. I also want the House to notice that the Government are not satisfied to pass the measure for the raising of this money, but that they haye made provision by which tiiey are to keep a quantity of Treasury-bills in their possession. I interjected in the course of the Prime Minister's speech, and asked him of what use they would be in raising money in an emergency. -could get money for them anywhere."" In the first place, I must say that, if there was an emergency in which the Treasury were short of money, the Treasurer would certainly not have time to send these Treasury-bills abroad in -order to raise it ; and, in the next place, if the. Treasurer of the Commonwealth were in a difficulty, we may conclude that -other people would be in a difficulty also. Is it likely that the banks would allow the Commonwealth to make a convenience -of them, and in any moment run to them with Treasury-bills, and say, "" We are in -a difficulty, and although you are in a difficulty also, we want you to come to the .assistance of the Government and cash these Treasury-bills""? 'under a necessity, and would not be under an obligation, to do so; and we shall be living in a fool's paradise if we suppose that, in circumstances in which the Government might be in want of funds, relief could be given by authorizing the disposal of these Treasury-bills. I do not want to deal with any further details of the measure. I content myself in the first place by saying that we are not going to get any financial advantage out of it. I have demonstrated that, beyond power of contradiction. There is another feature Then, it must be admitted, even by those who think it is desirable to do so, that we are undertaking a scheme which has in it the germ of difficulty if the working of it should get into the hands of incautious people. Further, I say that, seeing that the currency of Australia ""is now in such a satisfactory condition, and that if there is dissatisfaction it may be remedied in a Banking Bill-and we are waiting in the Commonwealth for a Banking Bill which should deal with the whole banking system of the country-the n we are undertaking a function which is, in the estimation of a considerable number, dangerous and most unnecessary. There is nothing to be made out of it in money for the Commonwealth, and no benefit to be gained for the people. I do not think that it can be contended that the Commonwealth, in legislating in this matter, is going beyond, not only its constitutional powers, but what it has a perfect right to legislate with respect to. Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not think that that has been contended. well be contended. It seems to me to be obvious that when the Commonwealth He said, "" We established Inter-State Free Trade, and when it was sought to encourage the making of contracts between the citizens of the different parts of the Commonwealth of Australia, an essential part of a contract being the making of payment, it naturally followed that there must be some method of regulating the medium by which obligations incurred under contracts were to be discharged. We have already exercised part of our powers with regard to currency by passing the Coinage Act, defining the standard of our coinage, and also at the same time dealing with the question of legal tender, as far as gold and other coins are concerned. We have dealt in a comprehensive manner with the whole question of negotiable instruments, so that now a The banks are not cheque drawn in this country is an Australian cheque, a bill is an Australian bill,",49,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

I shall illustrate the remarks I have the House is now asked to sanction for to make by a reference to the Queensland the Commonwealth. It provided that notes system. The Treasurer has stated very might be issued, and that on issuing notes properly that he adopted his scheme from the Treasurer should always keep in rethe one which was introduced, in 1893, by serve at least a fourth of their amount in Sir Hugh Nelson when he was Treasurer gold. Mr Groom. In what circumstances Having gone so far, it bedid the latter introduce his scheme? On The note issue in I cannot view with £600,000. The note issue of the banks The first Bill imposed a The object, he said in But in addition to that it provided that there should be Treasury-bills issued for the purpose of securing the retirement of the Treasury notes, and that they should be vested in certain trustees who were to be appointed under the Treasury Bills Act, and who were to be the President of the Legislative Council, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, .and the Colonial Treasurer. The Treasurer did not, as in this Bill, merely take -the power to issue Treasury-bills, but they were to be issued and absolutely vested in trustees and kept by them. It was pro-vided that the total amount of Treasury notes issued should not at any time exceed the amount of the coin held by the Treasurer in addition to two-thirds of the .amount.of the Treasury-bills issued. That .security is in excess of the proposal contained in this Bill. As regards the Treasury Notes Advances Bill, which Sir Hugh Nelson introduced, the intention was to advance the notes to the banks which had suspended payment, to enable them to withdraw therewith from public circulation their own bank notes. Treasury notes were to take their place, ancl there was to ""be a first charge on the banks for the amount of the Treasury notes so advanced. In that way the State was secured. The latter Bill was only of a temporary -character, but the real permanent structure as regards the whole of the Queensland note issue was contained in the first three 'Statutes which I mentioned. as the States are concernecl in the future this class of legislation has in effect passed -out of their hands. It is now provided that the States shall not coin money, nor -make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts. The -power to create a paper currency ancl make it a. legal tender has passed from the hands -of the States and is now vested in the National Legislature. 'Statutes were passed before the Constitution, and the system remains in existence. The other States could not follow in her wake. The Commonwealth power is, as I have mentioned, complete in this matter. T desire now to contrast the scheme which is submitted to the House with the Queensland legislation and administration. In the first place, we have to admitthat the Queensland Statute was experimental legislation. When he was introducing the Bill' Sir Hugh Nelson saidThe system on which it was' established is -simply that the Treasury, on behalf of the people, takes the paper currency into its own lands. It was an experiment, it must be ad[69] mitted. It has not often been tried by Governments. That is the proposition which he made. The Act has been in operation for a period of about seventeen years, and the question we have to ask ourselves is, Has the experiment succeeded or failed? So far as it has gone we cannot say that the Queensland system has failed. It has provided a currency which has commanded the confidence of the people of the State, and which, as I shall be able to show presently, has been sufficiently flexible to meet the requirements of trade. The true test, of course, which ultimately must be applied to the experiment, and which we never want to have applied, is how .it would shape under the conditions of a financial crisis. That test has never been applied. But, so far as the experiment has gone, it has given to the people of Queensland a satisfactory currency, and persons have been able to easily change their notes into gold in the State. We must admit that in passing the Bill before the House we are introducing an experiment into the Commonwealth, and one which to some extent has been tested in Queensland. But as regards its final success or failure, it has yet to stand the test of a great national crisis. Of course, when the crisis comes, it will affect, not only the nation, but every financial instiSo far stution. So far as our notes are concerned, what we have to do is to see that in framing our measure we give such security to the notes that public confidence will not be so easily shaken as it might be in the case of a private institution. That is the problem which we have to face. There are one or two points which I would like to refer to in connection with the. Queensland Act as contrasted with The Queensland this Bill. In the first place, it seems to me, on looking into the Queensland Act, that the desire of the Government was to create the feeling that the currency was something altogether apart from political interference, a desire to deal with the matter qua currency only, ancl not to blend it with any political consideration. It was claimed that it was a part of the currency only, and the legislation was merely introduced with a view to providing the people with a sound currency. If honourable members will contrast an early, section of the Queensland Act with clause 6 of this Bill, they will find that in Queensland the notes could only be issued by the Governor in Council. In this Bill we are asked to empower the Treasurer to issue"" notes; but in Queensland, only the Governor-in-Council could issue notes. That means that the Treasury officials would make inquiries as regards the necessity for issuing notes, that there would probably be a definite recommendation to the Cabinet or Premier, ancl that formal sanction would be given by the constitutional authority, namely, the Governor in Council. This Bill does not contain a similar provision, but leaves the notes to be issued at the will of the Treasurer. That is an important structural alteration, and one which we shall ask the Treasurer to justify when we get into Committee. The second change which I notice that he has made in the Bill is that the securities are not to be vested in a corporate body or trustees, as in Queensland."" I think that in that respect he is making a mistake. all to the Queensland provision. honourable member say that. I think he will rind that in Queensland the provision was made for some very good purpose. little more timid then than they are now. That legislation was framed in 1.893. _ man must remember that the legislation was introduced in Queensland at a time when public confidence was shaken, ancl he is now asking us to pass a measure which may have to go through a similar crisis. The steps that were taken in Queensland to ensure public confidence should now be taken by us to preserve public confidence. As regards the deviation from the Queensland Act, I think that a mistake has been made, and I am glad to hear the Treasurer say that, so far as he is concerned, he is quite prepared to amend that provision. Treasurv-bills and double cover. ber mean a certificate from *he Auditor General? crisis occurred, and there was a rush on the Treasury for gold. If there was a failure, the honourable 'gentleman would have to issue his bills ancl immediately try to raise the money. But in Queensland that is not the way in vvhich it is done. The Treasury-bills are issued and handed over to an independent body of trustees. These are preserved by them. Then when there is a national emergency requiring them to be sold they are sold, and the proceeds applied to the redemption of State notes. These bills cannot be disposed of except with the express authority of the Governor in writing, accompanied by a certificate signed by the Under-Secretary to the Colonial Treasury, and countersigned by the Auditor-General, certifying the necessity of the sale to meet paymentsThere is a further defect in the Treasurer's scheme. He has not provided for a sufficient amount of Treasury-bills. In that respect, again, he has departed from the Queensland system. The Treasurer of the day in Queensland pointed out that if there were a crisis, and money had to be raised, it would be necessary to have such an amount of Treasury-bills in the hands of the trustees that if it were immediately realized at a discount, the Treasury-bills would bring enough money to redeem the notes. He allowed for a discount of 33$on the bills which are issued. The figures which he issued showed that with gold for a fourth of the value of the notes issued, ancl 66j per cent, supposed to be realized by Treasury-bills sold at a big discount, he would have more than enough to meet any demand that might be made on the Treasury in a crisis. I think that in this Bill the Treasurer is making a mistake in limiting the amount to the actual value of the notes issued. In Committee I shall urge that the amount be increased, because a note issue must be based on solid security. With a 25 per cent, gold basis, plus an increased reserve of Treasury bills, the issue will be in a strong position ; but I intend to ask the Treasurer to increase the gold reserveI am aware that the Queensland Act provides for a gold reserve of only 25 per cent., but in its administration, especially during the first few years, the Treasurers, of the State have always kept a much larger reserve. Mr Chalmers, in his Colonial Currency, makes a complete survey of the currency of the British Empire studied from the historical and economic stand-points, and comes to certain definite conclusions. He says, at page 36It may be weM to state the essentials of a sound Issue. Every note should be (a) secured, and (i) convertible; that is to say, a noteholder should know that the note he holds will exchange, not ultimately, but on presentation, for that amount of legal tender cnin which is indicated by the note's denomination.",50,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

231,Mr Fisher,-Does the honourable mem,53,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading
232,Mr Groom,"Yes. Suppose that aIn order to insure the convertibility of an Issue, it is not necessary that every £ 1 in notes should have a gold sovereign behind it ; for experience shows that the circulation in noteusing communities never drops below a definite minimum. amount of notes which is never likely to be presented for payment may therefore be represented by securities, i.e., may be "" f i d u c i a r y "" ; Treasury bills vested in trustees. That all notes beyond such minimum should be issued against legal tender coin. Until experience has shown what is the minimum Issue in a given Colony, investments (which should be in high class securities other than those of the Colony itself) should not exceed one-third of the notes in circulation, nor should they ever exceed one-half. These stringent safeguards, which subordinate profits (beyond working expenses) to the financial security of the community point to Government Issues as the only practically sound system of paper currency. And it may be added that there is no more reason-in fact, less reason -wh y banks should issue notes at a profit than strike token coins at a profit. But, whether the issue be by the Government or by the banks it is of vital importance to a community that the notes in circulation should be so safe-guarded as to form, in no unsubstantial sense, "" the shadow of the gold."" There should be a much larger reserve than the minimum provided for by the Bill. If this scheme is to be a success, it must command the confidence of the public, which means that the note issue must be based on the best security. Therefore, it would be better to increase the minimum reserve and the other securities, as suggested by the learned authority whom I have just quoted. The success of this scheme will depend greatly on the administration of the Act. To inspire the public with confidence, it will be necessary to publish returns showing that the administration complies with the spirit of the law, and demonstrating that the Treasury reserves are sufficient to redeem the notes should payment in gold be required for them. member think that any Treasurer would go to improper lengths in reducing the reserve ? down the rules which should govern administration. We should have monthly statements showing the amount of gold m the Treasury, the manner in which investments have been made, and the returns from investments. When the Queensland measure first became law, the greatest care was exercised to keep an ample gold reserve. In the year ending 30th June, 1894, £769,646 jos. worth of notes had been issued. £328,710 ios. being in actual circulation, but the Treasurer of the dav kept in reserve, through [6 ]9 2 advances to the banks, £379,666, and, in gold coin, £389,979, and made a temporary advance to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of £[50,000, so that he had a This minimum, representing an good reserve of sovereigns at call. Furthermore, he had a large amount of state of affairs was made known to the Queensland public, and naturally inspired confidence. The Queensland note issue was not made for the purpose of obtaining revenue, and in the first year only £7,885 19s. was gained by it. The first arrangement with the banks was to advance the notes at a charge of 4 per cent, on the value in circulation, no charge being made on those kept in reserve This was altered, and it was arranged that the banks should agree to pay coin equal to one-third of the face value of the notes .advanced, and that the remaining two-thirds should be placed to the credit of the Treasurer at a deposit bearing interest at the rate of 2 per cent., payable half-yearly. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Then the banks doing business in Queensland have to pay on the note issue of the State, whether it is in circulation or not? although, in 1894, the note issue was £769,646 10s., the value of the notes in circulation was only £328,710 10s., and a similar ratio has been preserved ever since. Last year the Queensland note issue represented a value of .£1,554,720, and the' note circulation a value of £755,635. Only three of the banks in Queensland took advantage of the arrangement which the Treasurer was willing lo make with them. All the others were prepared to pay gold, and to take their notes in return for gold. For the first seven or eight years the Treasurer, in administering the Act, took stringent care to see that the gold reserves in the Treasury were ample to inspire public confidence. It was only some years after the Act came into force that any portion of the reserves was invested, and the Auditor General's report for 1908-9 shows how those reserves are dealt with. The Treasury notes issued and outstanding on 30th June, 1909, amounted to £1,554,720, and this sum was covered as follows:-Ad vances to banks, under Treasurer's arrangement, ,£388,333; exchanged for gold, ancl proceeds applied as follows :-Gold coin in Treasury strong-room, £536,000; silver coin in Treasury strong-room, £15,300; coin in charge of Treasury teller, £ 1 , 9 1 0; amount at fixed deposit with Royal Bank,",53,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

All these sums were over and above the Treasury-bills in the hands of the trustees to whom I have referred. The Treasurer of Queensland has administered the State Act in such a way as of necessity to inspire public confidence in the currency. The Queensland note issue certainly brings in a revenue, that for last year amounting to £25,138 is. 8d., after deducting the cost of administering the Act, which was £2,543 13s. 4d. not saying a word against the Commonwealth proposal? banks. debate, pitting rival systems against each other. I am simply showing that the Act has been so administered as to inspire public confidence, and sounding a note of warning to the Treasurer that, if he desires to inspire confidence, on the part of the people of Australia, in the Commonwealth note issue spire public confidence. mere assertion is not sufficient. The question of whether or not public confidence is inspired will depend on the methods of administration. fidence in the Ministry in office on 13th April last. able member has quite enough in hand to inspire confidence in himself. I do not wish to revive unpleasant recollections of Pleasant Sunday Afternoon statements. member to use that scrubbing-brush on himself. to open a different lock. Honourable members opposite will be responsible for the administration of this measure, and they have imposed upon them a public trust. They have appealed to us in the light of the history of various currencies to support this Bill, and they have cited the Queensland note issue to substantiate their case. My reply to them is that if the Government intend to follow the Queensland system, it will not be sufficient merely to place this measure on the statute-book. They will have, in addition, to inspire public confidence by administering it upon the lines that have been adopted in Queensland. I hope that in Committee honourable members, anxious, as I have no doubt they will be, to conserve the public interest, will do their best to strengthen and safeguard this measure. AVe are justified in legislating upon the subject of bank-notes because from their very nature notes, as soon as they are put into circulation, are practically forced upon the public. A man walks up to a storekeeper, and presents him, say, with a £ 1 note in payment Queensland is of his account. The storekeeper has really no alternative but to accept it. In the circumstances, it is a note sanctioned by the community, and it becomes part of the currency. The storekeeper practically accepts it involuntarily, and, in the interests of the community, we ought to stand by the note whether it be issued by the State or by a private corporation. That being so, ""we are perfectly justified in legislating to make the note safe for the individual who is really compelled to take this particular piece of currency. Dealing with the virtues of the proposed Australian note issue, the Treasurer claimed for it the advantage of convertibility. The Queensland note is convertible, and convertible at Brisbane. We are legislating now, however, not for the restricted area of one State, but for a continent. To tell a man in Western Australia that the Commonwealth note which he holds is convertible on this side of the continent, and that, therefore, it is just as convertible as any ordinary bank note, is at least to delude him. land State notes have been converted during the last seventeen years? might be surprised if he saw the figures. ber has the correct figures from the beginning, I think that he must be surprised at the number. to give it.

252,Mr Fenton,"We cannot legislate fora wrong to even one man if it can be avoided. Canada, which, so far as area is concerned, is not very different from the Commonwealth? In Canada, according to the revised Statutes for 1906, the Govemor-inCouncil may establish branch offices of the Department of Finance at Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, St. John, Winnipeg, Victoria, and Charlottetown for the redemption of the Dominion's notes, or may make arrangements with the Chartered Bank at any of those places for their redemption there. What is to prevent the Commonwealth Government allowing these notes to be converted at all the State capitals? honourable member so responsive. Perhaps he is going to move an amendment on the lines 1 have indicated. What is there to prevent the Government making an arrangement with the banks by which the convenience of the public may be met in this way? Depots will have to be established in different parts of Australia where dirty notes or notes otherwise unfit for circulation may be exchanged for new ones. The Bill makes no provision for that. Surely such depots should be established in the far outlying portions of the continent. items that will also require attention. will be able to mention them in Committee. I wish now to refer to what I may call the "" forcing "" clause, which has been criticised by several honourable members. The Treasurer very properly referred to wise remarks made by Sir Hugh Nelson in introducing the Queensland Notes Bill, but certain other remarks were made by that honourable gentleman which he might well have emphasized as to the danger of doing anything to force the notes upon the community. He emphasized that point in 1893, a n < i again in 1902, when reviewing the whole measure from his presidential chair in the Legislative Council. T.ooking hack with a certain amount of natural pride upon the administration of the Act, he saidThere never has been any attempt to force looking at it quite impartially, shows that the circulation. The thing must grow a natural the experiment was justified, but, of growth. So long as the notes are payable on course, until it has gone through a crisis, presentation there is no advantage to be gained it is rather early to dogmatize. by forcing the circulation. He stated again that the Act was never issue, it is necessary that our criticism n-.eant to bolster up the banks, and that should be directed to such parts of the it was never the intention of the Government to force the notes upon the community. It was intended that the notes What are the conditions in should flow naturally into circulation. The Government include in this Bill a clause which compels the banks to keep the notes; they are forcing them on the community. more into a pint-pot than a pint-pot will hold. wise remark, and applicable to the particular circumstances to which it applies, but to say to the banks that you will compel them by force of a penalty to use the notes, and then to say that it makes no difference, because they can redeem them immediately in gold, is a contradictory position for the Treasurer to take up. out altogether, will that do? course; and if the Treasurer intends to take it, I shall say no more upon the point. I simply emphasize Sir Hugh Nelson's statement that the currency, if it was. to suit the needs of the people, must go naturally to the people, that if they wanted it they could use it, and if they did not want it they could leave it alone.; Experience in Queensland has proved that the people did want the notes, and that the notes did go into circulation. On going through the records for a large number of years, I found that the notes increased or decreased in number according to the natural requirements of the community. The system started with an issue of £769,000 in 1894, whicli grew to £971,000 in 1897; in 1900 is was up to £1,178,000; in 1903 it went back to £1,145,000; and in 1909 it was up again to £1,554,000. The Legislature made the necessary amendments from time to time in regard to the Treasury-bills to keep the security requisite for the increasing note issue. Those figures show that the system proved elastic, and adapted itself to the needs of the people, and in that respect the measure was justified. I have spoken to-night with a view to show that the scheme which has been submitted has to be dealt with on its merits, and that the Queensland experience, Seeing that the Government are going on with the",55,Australian Notes Bill Second Reading

Speaking on the second reading, I pointed out that, while I had the utmost confidence in the ability of the Commonwealth to see that the notes are stable from the time they are issued, the powers proposed to be placed in the hands of the Treasurer were such as should not be given to any one man, no matter who he might be. In saying this, .1 am not reflecting o;i past, [9.30] I should like, if the honourable member for North Sydney will permit me, I should like to see that revenue apto move a prior amendment.

264,Mr Fisher (Treasurer,"Wid e Bay)him a Commission, such persons to have special knowledge of the commercial and financial conditions of the Commonwealth, .and to co-operate with him in regard to the issue of notes, the application of moneys and their investment and re-investment. I -think that the Government should have, in connection with operations under this Bill, the advice and counsel of persons thoroughly versed in the financial affairs of the -Commonwealth at the time when these matters were dealt with, and in whom the people would have more confidence than they might have in the Treasurer of the day. . I quite Tecogni.se that, to introduce such an amendment as I propose, would necessitate the redrafting of the measure. We should require to alter, not only clauses 8 and 14, but the division of parts. I am now seeking to test the opinion of the Committee as to whether it is desirable that these alterations should be made. If the amendment is accepted by the Treasurer amendment. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am very sorry to hear the Treasurer say so, because while it would not affect in any way the principles of the Bill, it would increase the confidence of the people in operations under it. It is impossible to conceive that the present Treasurer could be so thoroughly versed in the necessities of the commercial ancl financial position of the Commonwealth from time to time, that, acting on his own knowledge, he could be with safety intrusted with the conduct of all the operations under this measure. We know that he would have to seek outside advice and assistance, and I think it is far better that this Committee should insist that, when a crisis arises, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth should have some persons, selected uncler normal conditions, to assist him in deciding what should be clone. The amendment would be of value chiefly in connection with the investment of funds derived from the issue of the Commonwealth notes. It is most important that these moneys shall be dealt with in such a way as to inspire public confidence in the whole system. I am satisfied that it would create a feeling of great -security if it were known that the Treasurer hacl associated with him in connection with these most important and onerous duties, two other persons specially informed as to financial operations. I have been surprised to hear the honourable gentleman say that he will not accept the amendment, since it would in no way interfere with the object of this measure, which is to secure the control of the currency for the nation. Its acceptance would not deprive the Executive of the control of the currency, or of the advantages of funds raised under the Bill for the national welfare. I am supporting the Bill and, on the second reading, I intimated that there were one or two amendments which I desired to see made. I had then no forecast of the Treasurer's stern opposition to this amendment. I understood the honourable gentleman to say that the matter would be open to consideration, and that he, for one, would not object to what I proposed. He has evidently altered his views on the subject, and I should like to say that, if he persists in his opposition to the amendment, some very warm supporters of the Bill on this side may be converted into anything but friends of it. The powers given to the Treasurer are powers that neither this Commonwealth nor any other nation has ever given to any one man. 1 am simply asking the Treasurer to share the burden ot these onerous responsibilities with other parties, who have a wider knowledge of the subject than ever the present Treasurer can attain, or that we can expect in any of his successors. I shall not waste more time; I have put the matter before the Committee in the hope that there are reasonable men on both sides who will co-operate to make this measure a success, ancl secure confidence in the future issue of national money. [9.42] I am sure that the honourable member for North Sydney will recognise that he is slightly in error in saying that I ever agreed to the amendment. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That was what I gathered from what the honourable gentleman said across the table. to quite a different matter. According to , the proposed amendment, how has this Commission to be constituted, and what has it to do? The Commission is to include two persons in addition to the Treasurer. By whom are they to be appointed ? By the Treasurer; ancl they are to watch over the Treasurer. From that point of view, the amendment is exceedingly weak. Rightly or wrongly, responsible government is the basis of the Constitution, and, therefore, the Treasurer and the Government are responsible to this Parliament for all their acts.",57,Smith Whe N The States Present Or Future Treasurers
265,Mr Fisher,"No, I cannot accept the",58,Smith Whe N The States Present Or Future Treasurers
266,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,Treasurer ),58,Smith Whe N The States Present Or Future Treasurers
267,Mr Fisher,"That was in referenceMr G. B. EDWARDS -Oh, no! to be. At the best, this proposal includes two persons who have to be appointed by the Executive, ancl, therefore, the honourable member is only adding to the number without in any way strengthening the position. The desire of the honourable member is that there shall be more men to consult, but I do not think that the amendment' will attain the aim he has in view. It is with great regret that I say that. I cannot accept the amendment, coming as it does from an honourable member who is so favorable to the B ill ; but I am sure he would not desire the Government to defer their judgment if they do not regard the proposal as of service. That seems an unfortunate conclusion. It must be admitted that there is a good deal of force in the Prime Minister's argument. But what is that argument? It is that the amendment does not go far enough-that it proposes to associate wn!i the Treasurer two persons, chosen, probably, by the Treasurer himself, or by the Government of -which he is a member-and he points ""out that that is very litlle addition in the way of independent judgment. I agree that the amendment is worth having as it stands, but am willing to recognise the force of the argument of the Prime""Minister, and say that some more independent choice might be made in a matter of this kind. Ar all events, if honourable members run their eyes evei so lightly over the Bill, what do they find? They find that, for the purposes of the measure, the Treasurer is to become more than a Treasurer. I always regard the Prime Minister with great respect, but, as I look at him now, he seems to swell in his proportions. He is to become a "" corporation."" When drafting the Bill, it was evidently felt that the titles of the Treasurer did not appear quite impressive enough; consequently, there is a special provision that he shall be turned into a corporation, in order that, ""with this addition, he may as a small, but happily united family, arrive at certain decisions. But putting aside that rather curious feature, introduced, no doubt, for certain legal purposes, what has the Treasurer to do? He is to hold the money in gold, or use it in redemption of Australian notes, or invest it ; he may sell or dispose of any securities in which the moneys are invested, for which purposes he and his successors in office shall be deemed to be a corporation ; in addition, he may issue Treasury-bills to such amounts as he thinksfit within a maximum limit. How does the Treasurer accomplish work of that, sort ? There is in his ofiice a gentleman, known as the TJnder-Treasurer, who devotes the whole of his time to the consideration of financial matters, and upon, whose recommendations the Treasurer, in many rases, will act without question, ancl in other cases will probably act after question. That officer is already a busy and over-burdened manj and this matter of thecurrency is not simply an annexe of the Treasury, but means much more. If this course is to be pursued, the only meansthat suggests itself fo me by which trieTreasurer can make the control efficient is to have an officer of sufficiently large experience, and sufficiently free from other official obligations, to give the whole ofhis time and thought to advising the Treasurer pn this matter. This will mean, of coursef that that officer will be practically the effective person in such matters. The Treasurer must by now know tbe obligationsof his position, added to the burden of parliamentary responsibility, and to the duties to be discharged to tlie country in generalthe administration of old-age pensions and other interests that have yet to be taken into account. If he and his successors are invested with this power by the Bill as it stands, the Treasury will be forced to find some practical way out of the situation, some one supplying the requisite knowledge ancl attention, which the Treasurer, with his multifarious duties, cannot be expected to give. tem runs like clockwork. ways run, and human clockwork has often to be repaired. I do not desire to elaborate the point, but think it Will be found 1 ot practical use and advantage for the Treasurer to relieve himself of some of his additional responsibilities, which, of course, will mean relieving the chief Executive officers, who will have to advise him. divided responsibility.

I submit that tlie amendment covers the widest possible field. in order, because I am bringing under the notice of the Committee certain proposals which were made for the administration of a measure of this kind. I am reading the quotation with a view to showing the Treasurer that by co-operating with the banks, and forming a Commission somewhat on the lines which the honourable member for North Sydney has mentioned, he would be enabled to secure its success more effectually than he would by the B ill . tween the two things. membei will be in order in making a reference to the report. while the continuous reading of a report is quite proper on the second-reading stage of a Bill, it is out of order in Committee. of this part of the report is that the banks will be prepared to co-operate vvith the Government on certain terms in the promotion of a State note issue. They suggest that from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, should be kept in gold, that the balance be invested in securities, that the securities should be invested in a certain way, and the income therefrom apportioned in a certain way. I do not ask that the Government should adopt the 'fifteen suggestions of the bankers, or any part of them. I am merely pointing out that, before proceeding f u r the? wilh this measure, they ought to consider the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney, taken in connection with the well-known fact that the banks will necessarily have to co-operate with the Treasury in carrying the scheme to a successful issue. missed Ihe opportunity of speaking on the ..second reading of the Bill, when, of course, T should have had greater latitude to deal vvith the question. WhatI wish to impress on the Treasurer is that we desire to help Hm to make the measure as perfect as possible in the public interest, to introduce the change with as little friction as possible, to secure the best means for distributing the notes, and entire co-opera. tion between the Government and the banks, on the bona fides of the Treasurer or of vvhich should be secured if possible.

[10.7] 1 would point out to the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Mernda that the Treasury is entirely responsible for the silver issue at present. No one has suggested that it ought to have the assistance of outside persons. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I have. the analogy is complete, and so it is, too, He must see that, with regard to the copper coinage I am in a position to say that the banks will cooperate with the Government under the Bil l as it is drafted. No later than yesterday a blanker said tliat he would be prepared to give the Treasury a quarter of a million in gold as soon as we delivered that value of Australian notes into his hands. Surely an honourable member who speaks about our getting the co-operation of the banks can be satisfied with that assurance. do it for nothing? honourable member ask him to do it for nothing ? as to question the bona fides of a. gentleman who knew exactly what he was saying, and who made that statement to rre by authority.

I ask honourable members not to assume, so late in the day, that there is any antagonism on the part of the banks.

What the honourable member for North Sydney has in view, if I understand his amendment aright, is that in all matters relating to the issue of the notesas to their number, their circulation and the investment of the funds which will accrue to the Treasury by means of their sale, indeed, all matters relating to the management of this currency-ther e shall be called to the councils of the Governme.it independent financial experts. My honourable friend desires, first of all,. that the best financial talent in Australia shall be provided for the assistance of the Treasurer in the performance of his very important duties under the Bill, which practically constitutes the Government a bank of issue for the Commonwealth, with functions like that performed by the Bank of England for the United Kingdom. It is proposed to issue notes to the value of £[7,000,000, and we are told that the issue will probably be increased within a few years to £10,000,000. Sums like those cannot be regarded as a bagatelle. I cannot conceive of more important functions than those involved in the control of the rurrency, and it is no reflection on the Treasurer or on his officers to say that they have not the time or that intimate knowledge and experience of banking necessary to enable them to manage -without assistance all the intricacies of a note issue. But above these considerations is the question, Shall the issue be subject to political control ? Ts the amount of the issue to be decided by the Treasurer or by financial experts removed from the temptation to consult the political exigencies of the moment? The public will have more confidence if the note issue is controlled by disinterested persons possessed of a knowledge of banking and circulation, than if we leave it in the hands of Ministers who may be moved by party considerations ? The Treasurer should be elar! of the chance to exclude from the public mind all doubt as to the proper administration of this measure. He says that Parliament is the final court of appeal, which is true; but Parliament is not competent to manage a note issue, and should be the last body to be charged with such a duty. I hope that the Treasurer will reconsider his position, and take advantage of the opportunity to remove from himself and his successors temptation to make a political use of the powers given by the Bill. Independent trustees have been appointed in connection with the establishment of sinking funds for the repayment of loans, which is a less important matter than the issue of notes. The Agent General of W estern Australia, and one of the directors of the London and Westminster Bank have vested in them all matters relating to the management of the sinking fund established by the State Parliament for the payment of present and future loans. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The national debt of Great Britain is managed by a Commission. Naval Loan Act, lately repealed, this Parliament, on the motion of the present Prime Minister, provided for a sinking fund, to be controlled by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Secretary to the Treasury, to prevent the possibility of party control. The issue of notes is a matter of much greater importance than the management of sinking funds, and what is suggested is that the Treasurer and two persons to be appointed by the Governor General in Council shall form an independent Commission to deal with this matter. I heartily support the amendment, and hope that it will be accepted. Progress reported. AND ARBITRATION BILL.

Mr KE LL Y W h a t is to prevent their burdened witha desire to assist the spinning out a case ad infinitum if they realize that they are to be paid by the unions they represent? It was put very strongly by the honourable member for Hunter that a number of gentlemen were quite competent to represent their unions in the Court; that, although they did not happen to be privileged to . appear before the ordinary law Courts, they were qualified to deal with the business that from time to time crops up in Arbitration Courts. He held that, when these men represented their unions before the Court they were entitled to special payment for their services. All I have to say to that is that the honourable member's argument strikes at the very bedrock of unionism, -which, so far as I understand it, is that no particular class of men shall blackleg on any other class in order to get an immediate advantage, but that every man shall do what he is best fitted and trained to do, and allow other men to do that for which they are trained. and almost immoral utterance. always ready to do everything in certain -circumstances. -willing to do everything in the Courti f we disagreed with the Senate, and l e f t the Bill in its previous form,? The honourable member says that my -statement as to the meaning of unionism is not fair or correct; yet the Government now declare that outside of their hours of work the public servants shall not do anything to conflict with any-other hody of men in the pursuit of their livelihood ! Why, then, should we haye this special kind of advocate a paid lawyer who is not really a lawyer, but who wishes to be considered qualified to do this highly-paid work? Why should we consider that special kind of professional liti-gant at the expense not only of bond fide. litigants coming before the Court, but of the unions called into being under the Act? The very fact that the Government have deliberately refused to give unionists the privilege of free Government audit makes it all the more necessary that we should safeguard the rights of the individuals composing the unions. We should make it absolutely certain that the unions shall not be exploited for the personal gain Of this or that small section of the community. That is the principle underlying the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta. It amazes me to find honourable members opposite, who pretend to be overworkers, now preferring to sacrifice the interests of the workers rather than to prevent the class of men to whom I have alluded from continuing to live on the unions that they pretend to help. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and there may be self-sacrificing union secretariesI should be the last to say there were not-eac h of whom is prepared to go into Court and deal with the union's affairs simply because the union keeps him as secretary throughout the year, and because, as secretary, it is his business to concern himself with the union's interests, l t is all the belter if that is so, but if my honourable friends are satisfied that the organizers of their unions bear that high character, they should be the last to refuse to allow the Bill to stand as it previously left this Chamber. The issue is clearly defined. Honourable members will have to ma/ke up their minds whether they are to consider the interests of the men or the interests of the union bosses who, if the amendment now urged by the Attorney-General is passed, will reap a pecuniary benefit out of the men. My honourable friend is That is the position in a nutshell, and I hope, for the' sake of the good I wonder if he would be name of Australian unionism, that the? Senate's amendment will be rejected in its entirety. If it is not, an amendment such as that suggested by the honourable member for Angas is necessary in common fairness, but I am concerned now with trying to save the funds of the unions from the payment of special fees to incompetent persons who may possibly have been fomenting a dispute with a view to afterwards reaping some pecuniary benefit out of its settlement. Last Friday the Attorney-General proposed to pass this measure through its remaining stages, because he said it was urgent, and it was not fair to wait until Tuesday. He was quite willing then, as I understood him, to accept the honourable member for Parramatta's amendment, but only refused to do so on the ground of the urgent necessity of passing the measure into law. Why does he not take up the same attitude to-day ? The question of urgency no longer",63,Commonwealth Conciliation

306,Mr Kelly,"operates ! because we can disagree with the amendment, and the Senate to-morrow can ratify our decision, seeing that honourable members opposite absolutely control the Senate. No time will be gained by the Attorney-General's present attitude. It is not in the interests of urgency, and it can be only in the interests of a small class of people, who will reap a pecuniary benefit at the expense of the men whom my honourable friends pretend to represent. safeguard, and let them know what they are doing. If honourable members opposite do represent them, why did they refuse last week to give them a free Government audit? They have a right now to refuse to allow the men to be exploited by selfinterested persons, and if they wish to prove their bona fides let them act on that right, and disagree with the Senate's amendment. would suggest to the Attorney-General that he reject, not only the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta, but also the amendment made by the Senate, because the Government must have made up their minds as to the terms to be employed in the Bill, and the Senate's amendment is nothing more than a definition of a provision inserted by the Committee after due consideration. A large amount' of deference must, of course, be paid to the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth, in view of the interest which he takes in Labour organizations and the welfare of the workers, and I recommend the Attorney-General to pay the honourable member's views a considerable amount of attention, if only to please him. On Friday last I advised the Committee to accept the Senate's amendment, but in justice to myself I would point out that, not knowing the matter was coming on, I had the amendment put into my hands when the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking, and was perhaps more concerned in opposing his amendment, which made matters worse. After perusing the amendment of the Senate, I think it also should be rejected. In fact, both amendments should be rejected. The.words ""counsel or solicitor "" should be struck out of the principal Act, as, if not, we shall be in exactly the same position as when the Bill first came before the House. The Committee thought it necessary to exclude counsel, solicitors, and paid amendment an experienced lawyer who agents, but the Senate's amendment practically brings them in again, because we cannot prevent any barrister or solicitor from becoming a bond fide member of an organization, and, therefore, he will be able to appear before the Court. In regard to the statement of the honourable member for Wentworth, that to permit laymen to occupy this position would strike at the Dasic principle of unionism, the honourable member does not realize that our object in advocating the exclusion of lawyers from the Court has always been to facilitate the hearing of cases and avoid the delay now caused by the raising of technicalities. That is our only object, and when the honourable member for Parramatta moved his amendment with regard to paid agents, my difficulty was that in many unions certain men who hacl been following their employment had been taken from it and put into these positions, and paid a salary, and it would be a question for the Court, if the point was raised, whether they were paid agents or not, seeing that they no longer followed their employment. They were die only men available to deal with the cases coming before the Court. I urged the rejection of that amendment, ancl now the amendment carried in the Senate brings us back to where we were before. We should be stultifying ourselves if we accepted it. If it is accepted we should strike out the words ""counsel or solicitor,"" ancl then define what a paid agent is, so that the Court might know the intention of the Legislature. The honourable member for Wentworth will agree with me that no one could be better qualified than the officials of the unions to represent the men in this Court, which, after all. is a Court of eauity and good conscience, and not one in which legal points are to be raised. .1 clo not ask that any one should be given the opportunity to blackleg on the legal fraternity, as the honourable member for Wentworth has suggested, but I do ask that a provision should be included in the Bill under which ofiicers of organizations will be able to represent them in the Arbitration Court. I think the Attorney-General would do well to accept the advice of the honourable member who preceded me. the Senate's amendment should be rejected. I shall support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta, but I am of opinion that the amendment I have suggested myself would be required to cover the ground, and I shall move it later.

311,"Mr Glynn (Angas) [10.43],","I thinkto represent it in the Arbitration Court. All that the Act provides for is a statutory number of persons as members ot a union before it can be registered as an organization. These must be employees in the case of an employees organization. But, in addition, there may be members of a union who are not engaged in the trade at all The effect of this amendment would be to bring professional men into the organizations to do the work. Then we should have one' side represented in a dispute by lawyers and the other side not so represented, which would be grossly unfair. The clause as amended by the Senate would not help the employer at all. It applies only to members of organizations, and they are, as a rule, composed of employees. It is only by such bodies they could put fairly before the Court the solidarity of labour in relation to a particular demand. As a rule, also, it is individual employers who are brought before the Court. that at Broken Hill or single individuals or firms, as in the case of the Federated Sawmillers, there would be no right to representation by counsel uncler the Senate's amendment. If the clause is to stand as amended by the Senate, I say that we should allow the President, where a lawyer appears for an organization as a member of the organization, to permit the other party to be also represented by a lawyer. back to the position under the existing Act. side only to be represented by a lawyer. The honourable member for Herbert would not advocate that. fair for us to say that the rule which we thought it swell to lay down might 'be broken by one side and not by the other. I think the difficulty goes deeper than has been suggested by the honourable member for Angas. This is one of those cases in which honourable members suffer an inconvenience in discovering what is intended by the Bill, because they are obliged to read with it the provisions of the principal Act. T shall quote the part of the section of the principal Act which affects this matterNo party shall except by consent of all parties or by leave of the President be represented by counsel or solicitor. We omitted the words "" or by leave of the President,"" and added, after the word ""solicitor,"" the words ""or paid agent."" The original provision was then amended to readNo party shall except with the consent of all parties be represented by counsel or solicitor or paid agent. That is how we dealt with the matter before the Bill was sent on to the Senate. Unless all parties agreed, there could be neither counsel, solicitor, nor paid agent representing them. Seeing that it is possible that some paid agents may be members of the Bar, or solicitors, the clause as amended by the Senate provides that, though they may be counsel or solicitors, they shali be deemed not to be counsel or solicitors. Certain honourable members, who are associated closely with unions, although they are lawyers, would be able to claim the right to go into the Court as agents, and ask that they be considered not to be members of the legal profession. That is the position which, I believe, honourable members opposite would not tolerate for a moment, because it would be playing into the hands of two or three men who happen to be associated with orWhether it were a company like ganizations. Why should they be given, such an advantage? What it would lead to eventually would be that members of the Bar.ancl solicitors would become members of employers' organizations, in order to secure the same right, and we should have restored exactly the condition, of things that existed before the original Act was passed. The legal members of the employers' organizations would have the same right as die legal members of employees' organizations to claim that they should not be regarded as barristers or solicitors. I am in favour of the provision that, unless the parties agree, there shall be no lawyers on either side; otherwise, we are practically recreating the old evil, if it bean evil. The Senate's amendment meansthat so long as a man is a paid agent, though a member of the bar or a solicitor, he is not to be deemed what he is. passed the Senate had been sitting all night, ancl senators did not know what they were doing ! that there is some suggestion that honourable members opposite are in favour of the Bill as it passed this House.

319,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorneywould be to allow lawyers ancl paid agents to practice, although, when the Bill left this House, that was not the case. But, after all, what this proviso means is just what the honourable member for Parkes has said, namely, that if a person is a paid agent, and a member of a union, he may appear, but he shall not be deemed to be a paid agent or lawyer at that time. However, my own impression is that the clause as it now stands will permit a bond fide member and an officer of an organization to appear, quite irrespective of what he is. The case cited by the honourable member for Hunter has nothing to do with the question, because that is a matter for the union. Some unions provide that unless a man is following the occupation the union represents, he cannot remain a member, and, therefore, such a man could not appear because he was a paid agent. But if he be a member ot the union, whether following the occupation or not, he could appear. However, the Government regard this amendment as quite unimportant compared with the vital principles of the Bill, and, as from the amendments foreshadowed, there is a probability of endless discussion, I shall be very glad to withdraw my motion, and move to disagree with the Senate's amendment.

Paid agents are in the same position; and if a union secretary is not an agent of the union, what is he ? If he is a paid secretary, he is a paid agent. conduct the case. Mr J. H . CATTS -The provision says nothing about what he is paid for. member say that a paid secretary is a "" paid agent "" ? Mr J. H . CATTS I submit that he is-that if he is paid a salary by the union, ha is a paid agent. If the provision is not intended to apply to union secretaries, some definition of ""paid agent"" is required. This was recognised in the Senate by the Government representative; but, while in the definition it is stated that an officer of the union is not to be deemed a paid agenr, the same also applies to a barrister or a solicitor, if he is the officer of a union. What is required is that the Senate's amendment should be incorporated with the provision as it left the House, with the omission of the words counsel or solicitor,"" so that it would then readno counsel or solicitor or paid agent shall appear to conduct a case except by the consent of both parties, provided that a bond fide member or officer of an organization or a bond fide employee of a party not being an organization, appearing in that capacity to represent the organization or party, shall not be deemed to be a paid agent within the meaning of this section. If the clause came finally out of the Committee in that form we should have a counsel or solicitor or paid agent excluded from-the Court save with the consent of both parties, except in die case of bona fide officers of organizatians, who, not being legal men, would be exempted from the category of ""paid agents."" That is what ""is reWithout the quired. There seems to be such a desire to hastily dispose of the Senate's amendment that I am afraid that a very important aspect of it may be passed over.

It would be much better to delay the consideration of the Senate's amendment for a day, rather than to pass it in haste, and so tie up the unions with a double knot.
