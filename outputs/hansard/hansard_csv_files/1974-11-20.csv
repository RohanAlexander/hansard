That the SRC formulate a definite plan that is an acceptable constructive and reasonable amendment to the present planning schedule at the Institute.

That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Vour petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion An be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored in those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, in meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and inretailtrade.

Marriage The honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representauves in Parliament assembled.The humble petiuon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That the whole principle of the Family Law Bill 1974 is aimed at destroying the entire concept of marriage as traditionally recognised in Australia, with its special obligations between husband and wife and between parents and children.

5,By Mr Mcveigh.,"TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF HOME ing and Construction that ever since the December 1972 elections the people of AustraUa have been promised a tax deductibility scheme in relation to home mortgage interest payments. They have not yet seen the scheme despite all the promises. I have been watching the daily program anxiously to see whether such a Bill is to be introduced. We still have not seen it. This sessional period is to conclude in a little over 2 weeks. Will the Minister advise the House whether enabling legislation will be introduced during these last 3 weeks of this sitting? give to this question is to recommend that the honourable gendeman look at an account of the proceedings. If he does that he will estabhsh that the Bill was introduced last Wednesday. Minister for Northern Development who no doubt is aware of the announcement by President Ford of the United States of America that a global quota will be established for imports of sugar into the United States. Will this action futher accentuate the shortage of sugar that is now causing serious concern to many importing countries, including the United States? Ford of the United States of America has made an announcement which in effect establishes a global quota of 7 million short tons of sugar which can be imported into the United States. The decision was made to ensure that the United States is guaranteed supplies of sugar. The President made this decision because of the critical world shortage of sugar. The current United States legislation in regard to sugar is to expire on 31 December this year. If the President had not taken this action, tariffs on sugar imported into the United States would have had to increase. By making a proclamation which provides for an import quota-in this case a global quota-the President has been able to ensure that current tariffs or import duties will remain. So in effect the President has taken action to ensure that sugar is imported into the United States at the lowest permissible rates of tariff which can be adopted under the United States laws. What the action of the United States President again emphasises is the critical shortage of sugar on world markets. President Ford said: Users of sugar can help ease prices by buying wisely, conserving supplies and consuming less sugar. He went on to say: I urge all Americans to reduce the amount of sugar in cooking and to put in half the amouni usually used to sweeten coffee or tea. The very serious situation that applies in regard to the supply of sugar is illustrated by the fact that the President of the world's most powerful nation is urging Americans to eat less sugar, not because of its qualities but because of the shortage. In view of the free advice that I gave to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the qualities of sugar, I am not certain whether I am game enough to advocate that Australians should eat less sugar. sugar is a third-rate poison. a difference of opinion on sugar between the Minister for Health and me. But I have made very clear to this House the great energy attributes of sugar. I think the Leader of the Australian Country Party is a good consumer of sugar. This shortage is a very serious problem. Australia is now taking steps to increase its production of sugar. This decision has not been taken lightly because as honourable members know 80 per cent of our total production of sugar has to be exported. Also, the growing of sugar is a mono-culture and therefore the sugar industry in northern Australia is at the complete mercy of export markets. As I said, we are taking steps to increase the production of sugar within the existing mill areas. I have saidtimeand time again in this HouseI believe all honourable members will agree with me-that before a major expansion of the industry can take place we want to be sure of guaranteed markets through long term agreements with importing countries. aware that in order to attract industry to decentralised growth centres such as Albury Wodonga, State governments give concessions to industries which have the effect of increasing their profits? Is he aware that, as a result, half of the concessions granted by States finish up in Commonwealth consolidated revenue?

In particular, when may we expect the implementation of his 1972 election policy promise for local call telephone access from Albury to Melbourne and Sydney? the Post Office under Sir James Vernon-the second Vernon Royal Commission-mad e some recommendations upon the matter of concessional telephone and telex charges to designated growth centres. They are being discussed with the State governments. the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Has the Minister heard allegations that the Australian Government does not have a realistic and responsible wages policy? Is there any truth in this allegation? Is it not true that the Parliament has no jurisdiction to legislate on incomes? Did not the Liberal and Country Party members actively campaign against this Parliament being given such power during the campaign which preceded the 1973 referendum on prices and incomes? Press that a gentleman in the Parliament last night made the absurd allegation that the Government does not have a responsible and realistic wages policy. I understand, if the Press can be believed, that that statement came from the person who poses as the alternative Prime Minister of this country. I notice that the honourable member for Wannon is rather amused at that proposition. I can understand the reason for his amusement and I sympathise with him. The Government does have a very positive, realistic and workable wages policy. For the very first time in 25 years we have a government that has a positive policy on wages, a policy which, if adopted by the Arbitration Commission, will bring about the stability in the economy that the whole of the Australian people are craving. What it will do is to index automatically wages to whatever price movements are revealed in the consumer price index so that workers will know in advance what their wage increases will be. It will not be necessary for workers to make exaggerated wage demands based upon expected movements in prices. They will not have to go on strike two or three times a year to get that which will now come to them automatically each quarter if our proposition is adopted by the Commission. In addition to that, each year there will be a review of productivity. Superimposed upon the quarterly increases that will flow from the automatic indexation of the consumer price index will be a further increase based upon a flat division of the total productivity. This should go to the whole of the labour force. In between these annual reviews and in between these quarterly automatic indexations of wages there will be opportunities to correct any anomalies arising from exceptional circumstances that may come from changed techniques, changed work values or changed work skills. The one big question that has agitated the mind of the Government is when indexation will commence. From what date will it operate? I say that because already there are some wage increases that have not been fully dissipated and measured against price movements. Those increases have not yet been fully absorbed. The Government believes that the December quarter ought to be compensated for by giving to wage earners a real tax reduction in lieu of any wage indexation for the December quarter. In this way we will be able to postpone any automatic indexation of the consumer price index until the results of the March quarter are known. That figure would become known to the Government and to the public at large on about 20 April. From the first pay period commencing after 20 April there would be an increase in wages to compensate for price movements. So we would have a substantial reduction in tax to compensate for the price movement in the December quarter, and then there would be the automatic adjustment for the March quarter towards the end of April. This will give employers a breathing space of from today until towards the end of April, with workers being better off in their after tax pay and the employer being required to pay nothing at all in increased wages until about the end of April. This is not only an effective way of guaranteeing that wages retain their value and are preserved from erosion by rising prices; it is also a very effective, common sense and realistic way of dampening down the rate of inflation which would otherwise occur if nothing was done to increase the take home pay after tax, and nothing was done to index wages automatically. Minister representing the Attorney-General and I refer to the reply given by him to remarks I made concerning the aboUtion of the Northern Territory PoUce Special Branch.

16,Mr Calder,"My question is directed to themembers of the jury which in October 1974 found Mr Syd Anderson of Papunya, via Alice Springs, guilty of the murder of Mr Eric Erlensen. Anderson was duly sentenced to IS years gaol with an 8-year non parole period. Is the legal aid service in any way connected with the request for this inquiry? If not, who is? Does the Minister consider it right that there should be a breach of the privacy of citizens under these circumstances? some time ago to the honourable gentleman's question as to why the Special Branch was disbanded. I repeat that one of the best and earliest actions taken by this Government was to dismantle a political arm of a police force which operated in Australia, because it was iniquitous and went completely against everything for which this Government, and I am sure every Australian, believe in and stand for. I have no knowledge of the allegations made by the honourable gentleman but I am happy to express the opinion that the allegations, if true, would be completely inconsistent with everything that this Government stands for. Naturally I will direct the inquiry to the Attorney-General. May I add that this is typical of the form of question that comes from the honourable gentleman in that he seeks to associate the legal aid schemea system designed to assist ordinary citizens of Australia, particularly those on low incomes-wit h something that is wrong and to smear and slur it in some way. It is quite typical. This is a pattern to be found running through all his questions. Having said that, I add this thought: It is well known that the deliberations of jurors is a matter for them and them alone. The anonymity of discussions in the jury room is something that is essentially basic to the adrninistration of justice in Australia and comes to us through tradition from the United Kingdom. a fact that the Government's economic policies an immense economic and social impact upon require the co-operation of all sections of the these young people? How can the Government commumty to break the wage-price spiral and justify abandoning these young people at this reverse the trend in unemployment? What critical point in their lives when they are about to response has the Government received to its embark on their working careers? Why will the appeal? Government has had a very favourable response industry going again? from employer and employee organisations to the program I outlined on Tuesday night of last week. Employers feel confident in being able to of every year-thi s has been characteristic of our put men and women on their payrolls and to society ever since we have had compulsory keep them on their payrolls. Employee organisations in a great number of cases have responded positively by telegram, letter or telephone call supporting the Government's approach. Apparently it is only, in public life, among people on the opposite side in this Parliament that we find no positive response to these matters. I observed that in his speech last night the Leader of the Opposition did not make any mention at all of wage indexation. One would have thought that the great issue in which all governments will be engaged before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the next few months would have been something justifying his passing interest. He showed no interest in it at all. the honourable gentleman would have said that it is a phoney. He is capable of using terms like that. It is a term he uses quite often. But his response was utterly negative. He is just a nark and a knocker. One would have thought that in the course of 7 days and 7 nights burning the midnight oil one should have been able to come to some positive view on the proposals. But of course all the financial newspapers have categorised the right honourable gentleman's own proposals for tax reductions as being naive and woolly, whereas, of course, we have tied them in with the general context of a contract between employees, employers and the governments of Australia. I am satisfied that the Commission will respond to such positive suggestions. the Government going to do nothing about the position of many thousands of young Australians leaving schools and universities who will go straight on to the unemployment register, and the thousands of secondary and university jobs that are so important to many of them?

It is true that this year there will be more students than there were last year who will not be able to get work immediately. Last year was a boom year. I have had a look at the ngures and they show that there was a total increase in the work force last year of 220,000, which is an all-time record. It was a boom year, and those conditions could not possibly have been repeated indefinitely. This Government has done something of which I feel we on this side are all very proud. We have introduced a career reference centre in every one of the main capital cities which, for the very first time, will give these young people an opportunity to have vocational guidance instead of being required to make their own decisions without the proper information as to future trends and future job opportunities.

I am proud to say that my Government has taken initiatives in each one of those matters which I have just quoted. It has established or extended public enterprise in each of those matters. I believe that it has done so with public support. The resources of this continent and the opportunities of our people would be very much less if the Australian Government had not at last decided to extend or establish public enterprise in those fields. The honourable gentleman asks me to elaborate on the attitude of the Government towards private enterprise. In a nutshell, the Government recognises that three-quarters of the men and women in Australia are employed by private enterprise.

Against this background the Minister for Manufacturing Industry( Mr The Government has given no positive stateEnderby) has said that the manufacturers and ment of policy or objections in relation to manutheir management are frightened of their own facturing industry. It is prepared to stand by and shadows. If they were able to say in this House see the imposition on manufacturing industry of what they think of the Minister for Manufacturthe most intense credit squeeze that has ever ing Industry then it would perhaps explain to been applied in the history of this country. It is him that they are not frightened of their own perfectly clear that jobs are being lost in the shadows; they just want to get on with their jobs manufacturing industry, and that is where incenand have the capacity to do their jobs. The Prime tive and help needs to be given. The only reason Minister called them nervous Nellies. He called why the Government maintains a credit squeeze his own parliamentary colleagues the same. But this is not going to help manufacturing in that manner then pressure has to be put on the industry. Basically manufacturing industry is the private sector to stop the private sector from area in which jobs are being lost. This is the area competing for the goods and services supplied to in which retrenchments are occurring. This is the the people. That is why I say: 'Cut back on area in which there is no investment, and it is the government sector spending so that there is no area in which help needs to be given. It is clear need to have a credit squeeze'. The Government that nothing that the Government has done since could reduce interest rates. The Government that survey was taken has restored confidence in could say tomorrow: 'We will pull back on manufacturing industry. Fixed capital spending government spending. We will then have the cais down; it is falling on the basis of real prices. In pacity to say to the Reserve Bank of Australia: 1973-74 there was actually $50m less spent than ""Go out into the market place and buy, buy, buy in 1969-70 in real terms.

Our cament sector spending should be cut down is that pacity to have increased productivity will diminwe cannot have government sector spending takish. Our capacity to have a lower unit cost will ing aU of these things from the private sector and diminish as plant gets older and as technology think it is doing some good.

72,Mr Mcleay,That is right.,38,Manufacturing Industry
73,Mr Speaker,"Order! The Deputy PrimeRetrenchments are far more extensive than in AustraUa, both absolutely and proportionately. If one examines these unemployment and growth figures and conditions in those particular industries, one sees that the position that the Leader of the Opposition spoke about as though it was only an AustraUan condition caused by the AustraUan Government is actually a world wide situation. It is part of an economic process. The AustraUan Government is not the cause. I should not think that even the Leader of the Opposition would suggest that the Australian Government is the cause of the retrenchment of 102,000 workers in the American automotive industry or that the AustraUan Government is the cause of 10 per cent unemployment in Hong Kong, S.3 per cent in Canada, and 6 per cent in the United States of America. The AustraUan Government is not the cause of that situation. What is happening is a world-wide process and, as everyone in the outside world reaUses, it is a more serious economic difficulty than the world has experienced for nearly half a century. Unless a person is capable of reaUsing that this is an international problem he will never come up with a policy or action capable of deaUng with it. This is a world-wide problem, but the AustraUan Government can do something both to moderate inflation and to prevent unemployment. How can we moderate inflation? Although inflation is running at 20 per cent, the Leader of the Opposition never mentioned it in his speech. Is he not concerned about inflation or is he concerned only to exaggerate unemployment and blame the Australian Government for all of it as though it exists only in this country and nowhere else? Inflation has to be understood before it can be dealt with. Inflation is the excess of income demand for goods over the supply of goods. Income demand rose in Australia in 1971-72 because of international factors. There was a great inflow of funds from overseas. Exports rose by $2,000m and capital inflow by $3,000m and on the basis of that situation there was a great credit expansion in Australia which the Leader of the Opposition, at that time the Treasurer, did nothing to restrain. There was an inflationary boom. Inflation is not an accident; it is understandable. Incomes, demand and money had to be regulated if inflation was to be reduced but for 18 months the previous Government did nothing, desperate as it was to win back the support it had lost under the McMahon-Snedden coalition. It went along with inflation. It allowed the Mainlines to boom. It allowed these pyramids, which are based on very Uttle cash, to inflate land values and put up building costs enormously. It aUowed the inflationary boom to be released in AustraUa and did nothing to deal with it. Would Mr Snedden have rejected any kind of credit squeeze? Would he have allowed that inflationary boom to continue forever? And what about the professor of economics, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), who sits on the front bench? Is he against any kind of credit restriction in an inflationary period like that? Would he have done nothing to restrict credit? I know that some honourable members opposite are interested in another kind of squeeze, but I am talking about monetary policy. Would they not have done anything to increase imports with the great shortage of goods? Would they have done nothing to appreciate the value of the Australian doUar? If these things had not been done by this Government-the y were radical policies in Australia's history-inflatio n would have been 10 per cent greater than it is now. If inflation is to be checked in circumstances Uke that-unfortunatel y it had to be done 18 months or 2 years later than it should have been done-som e depression of industry and some unemployment unfortunately must occur. What the Government does about depression in industry and unemployment is to end it here and now. I emphasise that this is a matter of judgment. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-The honourable member has never shown much judgment. If reflation starts too soon we will get back into inflation and more unemployment. The Australian Government has begun reflation and no other government in comparable countries has gone as far as we have gone. Certainly the reflation can be more precise. I do not say that our policy is perfect. Last night I think the Leader of the Opposition made some useful remarks about monetary pohcy, but what is he doing? He is refusing or falling to analyse inflation and unemployment because he wants to attribute them to the fault of the Government. He sees no further than that. He is claiming that the Government is solely responsible and therefore he has no adequate analysis of unemployment and inflation. He has no idea of what causes them if he thinks the Government has caused them. If he has no idea of what causes inflation he cannot produce a policy to deal with it. In fact, he is offering a policy that may be inflationary, particularly on the monetary side. Presumably he would reduce taxation by a great deal more than we have done but one does not have to get past the first chapter",38,Manufacturing Industry

123,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Leader of theper cent or 190,000 people is trivial. The Deputy Prime Minister used the words: 'We have to stan to accept that unemployment is necessary'. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party is accepting now that unemployment has to be pan of anti-inflationary measures. I hope that every Labor man and every unemployed person reads what the Deputy Prime Minister had to say. It was also quite amazing to hear the manner in which the Deputy Prime Minister spoke this afternoon. I have never heard him speak in such a frantic way. He spoke almost as if he were leading some moratorium march. It is obvious that tensions are building up within himself and his own Party at their mismanagement, ineptitude and inability to cope with the situation which the Government itself has produced. It is no use for the Deputy Prime Minister to shelter behind the international situation. He is cowering behind a mass of statistics of other countries. This country should never have suffered the unemployment that is now taking place. We have not been subject to the same circumstances to which other countries have been subject. We have not been involved with the energy crisis to nearly the same degree as other countries because we have been 70 per cent self-sufficient with the cheapest fuel in the world. you? review it. We would not put ourselves at the mercy of the Arab States, as the Government will do with its negative policies. We have some of the cheapest steel in the world. Our copper and food are cheaper than those of most comparable countries. It is a lot of nonsense to use the intergoing to place tremendous strains on liquidity. national situation as an excuse for the position in which Australia is now placed. I wonder how investors would have reacted if they had heard the darling of Wall Street perform today? I am sure that the distressed way in which the Deputy Prime Minister acted today would never engender any confidence in them to invest in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister completely ignored the situation in which manufacturing industries find themselves and he completely ignored the consequences of tariff cuts, devaluation and all of these other matters. Unemployed workers from secondary industries have a lot to be worried and concerned about in what the Deputy Prime Minister said today. I think that those people who have the opportunity of reading what has been said this afternoon will agree that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) put forward a strong and constructive speech outlining the concern that the Opposition has, because there is great concern. The Deputy Prime Minister said that some secondary industries are doing well and some are doing badly. I suppose anyone can make a generalised statement like that. We know from the surveyfiguresthat are now being compiled by the Department of Manufacturing Industry that the prospects are the gloomiest since the surveys were first conducted. Other surveys conducted by the Bank of New South Wales and the ANZ bank indicate great concern as to how secondary industries are to cope in future. I think the difficulties of manufacturing industry can be summed up in this way. There has been a very sharp rise in imports; profits are being squeezed by rising wages and costs, and by the activities of the Prices Justification Tribunal; interest rates are very high, and finance is hard to get; domestic and export demand have slackened; and unchecked inflation is eating the heart out of the economy. The net result of all this is a fall in profitability, a consequent fall in capacity to invest and capacity to employ people. The Government, after producing an extremely serious situation in the manufacturing sector and badly hurting many of Labor's strongest supporters-the people in the work force-ha s at last begun to show some faint signs of understanding about what is happening, and why it is happening. There has been a slight reduction in the rate of company tax, but there needs to be a great deal more to engender any confidence. All companies, in all sectors, should be told that there is no need to comply with the requirement that they pay the quarterly tax instalments which are The Government's adamant, if not dogmatic, approach to 3 revaluations of the currency last year did enormous harm. The Government must do something about the damage being done to industry as a result of its arbitrary and indiscriminate across-the-board tariff cut of last year. This cut failed to do what it was supposed to do-that is, to keep down prices. All it did was to damage Australian industry and put many thousands out of work. But the Deputy Prime Minister says that this is a trivial matter. I am not suggesting a blanket reinstatement of the previous tariff levels. WhatI am suggesting is selective action to repair the damage caused by the Government's inept handling of this matter. There must be more encouragement of export. There must be encouragement of investment in industry. Industry must be able to get investment finance on better terms. The tragedy is that, whatever the Government does-and there is",42,Manufacturing Industry
124,Dr Gun,"You would soon fix that, wouldn't",43,Manufacturing Industry
125,Mr Anthony,"Well, we would at leastreally no sign that it intends to do anything more than the meagre amount it has done already-the outlook for the immediate future is by no means encouraging. Thefirstquarter of next year seems certain to see inflation at a rate of about 25 per cent. Unemployment then could be as high as 300,000 in March. I suppose that is going to be trivial too when they have to face up to it. There is no sign of increasing domestic demand. World demand will remain slack. World commodity prices are unlikely to pick up to any degree. Liquidity will remain a problem, and interest rates are unlikely to fall. All in all, the picture is a depressing one, and the responsibility largely rests with this Government. Of course, when we have tried to draw the attention of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) to these things in the past, he has accused us of being rumourmongers, prophets of doom, and saboteurs of confidence. Yet now we have the Prime Minister himself talking about the worse economic prospects for 40 years. We have the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions predicting the worse depression in Australia since the thirties. Who now are the saboteurs of confidence, the rumour-mongers, the prophets of doom? How can there be any certainty, and confidence that the Government knows which way it is going, when we are seeing so many somersaults and about-faces and changes of gear?

The trouble is that there is no easy way to repair that damage.

As long ago as the last election campaign in April and May of this year, this Government was concerned about what was happening to cenain aspects of manufacturing industry and in particular the textile industry. During the election campaign the Government sent a reference to the Textiles Authority on the subject. It was a 30-day reference which was acted upon promptly and which resulted in voluntary restraints being imposed on overseas exporters of certain types of textile articles to Australia, with authoritative source as the Secretariat of the Orconsiderable effect. That was in April of this year but, if one peruses the records of this House and the questions that have come forward from Opposition spokesmen who have now belatedly suddenly discovered a thing called manufacturing industry, one will find a benign indifference and a benign neglect of the importance of the subject.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Barnard: That the Bill be now read a second time. Dr FORBES (Barker) (3.38)-The provisions it is now more than a year since the Minister of this Bill are confined to increasing defence announced-it was widely circulated in Service forces retirement benefits and defence forces circles-that anomaUes had been revealed by the retirement and death benefits to compensate, I appUcation of the new scheme, particularly in suppose you would call it, for inflation. The relation to officers who froze their contributions method adopted is to apply the 16.2 per cent under the old scheme. He said then that the increase in average weekly earnings for the 12 anomaUes would be removed by the introduction months ending 31 March this year to a notional of amending legislation, probably in the autumn consolidated revenue portion of the pension. session of ParUament. This statement was made This is done in Ueu of the automatic annual last year. The autumn session has passed. He also adjustment mechanism which was recommended by the Jess Committee and which the Government is committed to introducing but which it is still studying. The Opposition supports this Bill, but I would like to make a few comments on it. The first comment I make is that I wonder Government admitted in its Budget of wage increases of over 20 per cent, this 16.2 per cent increase wUl be sufficient to protect the recipients sure that it wUl not be sufficient. The pensioners wiU get further and further behind. I make this point because it adds force to the next point I want to make, that is, the importance which the Opposition attaches to the introduction of the automatic system of adjustment which presumably will cater more precisely for increases in costs and anticipated increases in costs than the present ad hoc method adopted by the There are 2 matters in which the Government Committee recommended that automatic adjustments be made to pensions. I reaUse that the bring this sort of examination to a conclusion. introduced, the pensioners under this scheme wUl be dependent on the whims of the Government to make annual adjustments. I ask the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) in replying to this debate to give the House a report of when he believes it wUl be possible to introduce the automatic adjustments. The second matter on which the Government has been dragging its feet relates to the fact that stated that the benefits would be made retrospecmuch of the pressure to set up the Jess Comtive to 1 October 1972. In those circumstances it mittee and the introduction of the new scheme. would have been reasonable to expect that these To demonstrate the point I am making about the amendments would be included in legislation difficulties suffered by some of these people, introduced in November of 1974. Again, I hope perhaps I could read a letter from a retired warthe Minister will inform the House of the position rant officer living in Canberra. The letter states: in relation to that undertaking and those amendments when he replies to the debate. The main point that I wish to raise this afterThat is, letters to the Minister for Defence. noon relates to those people to whom, so far as I to am aware, the Minister has given no undertaking issues, except that automatic updating of pensions will lucky I am, or, even more undiplomatic, how lucky those are apply to them. I refer to the 8,000 or 9,000 penunder the new scheme. I believe that the Minister or his assioners who retired prior to October 1972 and sistant who signs these replies has only a sketchy idea as to who are not included in the new scheme. The what it means in actual pension rate. very generosity of this new scheme-it is a Incidentally, I do not believe that this is correct generous one-highlight s the situation of these because I beUeve that the Minister knows a great people. I cite the case of 2 officers whom I know deal about this scheme, particularly as he was a personally. They are of the same rank and retired member of the Joint Select Committee on the only a month apart. They retired a month apart Defence Forces Retirements Benefits Legispurely because of an accident of birth. They both lation. But nevertheless it describes the feelings entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in of this warrant officer after he had been in receipt the same year. They retired a month apart. But as of communications signed by the Minister for a result of that month's difference in retirement Defence or the Minister assisting the Minister for dates there is no less than $5,000 a year Defence( Mr Morrison). The letter continues: difference between the pensions that the two of I believe also that if hereadthe replies concurrently with the them receive. The reason for that of course is thatletter, he would doubt if he was signing the correct paper. It one retired before 1 October 1972 and the other seems a case of the Government being run by the adminisretired afterwards. I might add that the person tration. who retired first, and who is receiving $5,000 a It has reached a point where trying to get through is year less in pension, over the period ofhis servicedifficult. Most of the replies talk percentages, and that profor various reasons contributed in total more to portionately the scheme than the person on the higher lengths pension. I am informedI have not been able to get any accurate assessment of this-that the disparity on the average between the pensions received under the 2 schemes taken overall-of course there will be individual exceptions-ma y well be of the I would add that the increase we are talking order of 50 per cent. In other words, the pensions about in this legislation wUl give that person, as I of people under the new scheme-thos e people in calculate it, an extra $2.49 a week but it will not comparable circumstances and people who bring his pension up to a princely sum. The retired at the same rank-wil l be 50 per cent Government's failure to do anything about the higher. Of course every time there is a percentagepUght of these people contrasts strangely with its increase such as the one contained in this Bill the generosity to other groups of existing pensioners disparity widens. It has widened twice in the last for whom the Commonwealth has responsibUity. 2 years as a result of these 2 annual adjustments I mention particularly the position of existing brought in by this Goverament. It is not as if pensioners when the parUamentary retiring althese people contributed less as a percentage of lowances scheme was changed by this Governtheir pay; in many cases they contributed more. ment. I think that was a great step forward. One Towards the end of their service some of them of the concomitants of a government's taking a contributed much more.

I purely wanted to get home to him that my residual pension, after commuting one-third, is a taxable $19.43 (repeat $19.43) per week, with correspondingly poor widows pension in the event of my death. Replies that ' I haven't been badly done by percentagewise' doesn't comfort me or my wife, and doesn't increase my ability to pay bills. My ex-service friends receive similar replies. under the pre-October scheme and a parliamentary pensioner who retired, say, 20 years ago and whose pension under new legislation, regardless of the amount contributed, will automatically become 50 per cent or more than 50 per cent higher, depending on his period of service, of the existing parUamentary salary and any increases in parliamentary salary which might be granted in the future. I beUeve that if a government is ready to take a decision to treat one group of pensioners in a certain way, it should accept the consequence of that decision that it has an obUgation to treat other pensioners for which it has responsibUity in a similar way. It is difficult to know precisely what the Jess of whether the Minister agrees to set up such a Committee intended in relation to this group of people. Certainly these people came within the Committee's terms of reference. But from what I could discover from the odd reference in the report itself and talking to some members of the Committee, the pressure to make recommendations for a new scheme was such that it left the Committee insufficient time to sort out the complexities involved in making recommendations in respect of this particular group, except for the one recommendation that it made, relating to automatic updating. The point I am making is that, if my information is correct, the abwelcome. Why it has taken the Government so sence of specific recommendations in respect of this group does not mean that the Jess Committee beUeved that nothing should be done. Indeed in the comparable debate in May 1973, one member of the Committee, the previous honourable member for Isaacs, Mr Hamei, used words which lead me to the beUef that the Committee felt that something more should have been done about this particular group of pensioners. The Minister was a member of that Committee and perhaps when he replies in the debate he can give us his version of where the Committee was placed and what the Committee intended in respect of this group. The Opposition supports the suggestion which, I believe, has been put to the Minister by the remaining members of the Committee who are members of this ParUament and who are not Ministers-m y colleague, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett), Senator Maunsell, and Senator Devitt who is a member of the Minister's own Party. We support the suggestion made to the Minister by that group and by the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association that a new committee be constituted to make recommendations in relation to servicemen who retired prior to October 1972.1 beUeve that it should be a select committee of the Parliament for 2 reasons: First, the original committee was a select committee and this could be looked upon as a continuation of work which that committee did not have time to complete and, secondly and perhaps more importantly, it was this ParUament which took the responsibility for providing the precedent in relation to Commonwealth pensioners when it passed the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Bill. Therefore, it should be a committee of this Parliament which faces up to the responsibility, the equity and the moral obUgations that the ParUament has, in the light of that particular decision of the ParUament, to other groups for whom the Commonwealth has responsibiUty. Irrespective select committee, the Opposition is committed, when it is returned to government, to set up such a committee to make recommendations in relation to equitable treatment for the pre-October 1972 pensioners. The Opposition supports the BUl. honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), I support this BUl. There are a couple of comments I would Uke to make about it. This Bill is long overdue and, as far as I am concerned, is most long to introduce it I shall never know because to my way of thinking it is a simple, straightforward and, incidentaUy, important enough matter to warrant earUer action. When the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) introduced the pension increases for defence force retirement benefit recipients 17 months ago he explained that those increases were an interim measure only and, in keeping with his promise, when he introduced the new Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (Pension Increases) Bill indicated that the increases would be automatic annual adjustments. Seventeen months later we are still operating under an interim measure and a permanent method of adjustment of ex-servicemen pensions is stUl being investigated. I wonder whether the Minister and his Department know that many ex-servicemen depend to a great degree on their pension to meet their living commitments and they have needed this increase. To have kept them waiting for 4 months or more to receive it seems to me to show a definite lack of concern for this section of our community. It is aU very weU to say that the increases wUl be backdated to the first pay period in July, welcome though that is, but there was no need to embarrass for so long a period the ex-servicemen who depend on their pensions. I cannot accept the excuse put forward by the",51,Judges Pensions Bill 1974
150,Mr Bonnett (Herbert) (3.58),"Like the Minister for not introducing permanent adjustment arrangements. He said that all retired government employees should receive comparable treatment and that this is the Government's aim. I have no quarrel with that suggestion but I do not accept that the matter is so complex that it cannot be implemented without further inquiries. How much more time does the Government need to bring in the required legislation? It has beenfiddlingaround with this matter for approximately 18 months, trying to say that DRFB pensions will be the subject of automatic annual adjustments and not the subject of special legislation introduced each year, and which will be introduced at the Government's convenience. The Minister informed us that legislation will be introduced next year to provide for the future permanent methods of adjustment but, in view of the messing about that has been going on in regard to this matter since May 1973, I will believe it when I see the Minister introduce it. The matter of pension increases is not the only one which is vexing me and service personnel who retired prior to 1 October 1972. For instance, there is the surplus of funds mentioned in the fourth quinquennial report. At the last time of asking, the Minister informed me that the actual amount of surplus had not been decided. Yet the report indicates that on the basis of the old Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund the surplus of assets over liabilities is $3,065,000 in respect of pre-1959 pensioners, $11,828,000 in respect of pre-1959 contributors and a net deficiency of $544,000 in respect of post-1959 contributors and pensioners combined. If that information is available, surely it would not be too difficult for the actuary to arrive at an exact figure and surely it would not be too difficult for the Government to decide what to do with the surplus. Will the Government distribute the surplus among the contributors, as has been done previously, or will it sock it away in Consolidated Revenue? I remind the Government that this is contributors' money that it is fiddling around with. If the Government were to repeal the old Act and place every recipients of a DFRB pension under the new benefits scheme I would understand its wanting to put the surplus in Consolidated Revenue. But if it intends to retain the old scheme the surplus should be distributed among those who have contributed. How much more time does the Government need to make up its mind? Does it need another year or two, if it is still the Government? I can assure the Minister and the House that when we return to government there will be an end to this procrastination. As I said previously, many anomalies exist under the old DRFB scheme which are vexing the retired servicemen and of which I know the Minister is conscious. I well remember the Minister when he was in Opposition saying how he had plugged for a joint select committee to be formed to investigate the old scheme and to come up with a new, simple, straightforward scheme. Therefore he must be aware of the anomaUes that still exist in the old scheme. But now the boot is on the other foot. Is he content with the old scheme as is, now that the then Opposition is the present Government? An investigation by a joint committee into the anomalies that exist is required just as much as it was necessary previously. In fact, in the light of the new scheme benefits, it is even more necessary now. If the Government is fair dinkum in its expressed concern for the welfare of these ex-service pensioners it would have that joint committee on the job now. I mentioned the boot being on the other foot. NowI am plugging for that committee to be formed as the Minister did. The terms of reference for the committee will be on the Minister's desk this week. I am sure that if the Minister really wanted to do so he could persuade his colleagues that such a committee is warranted, for they too must know that the situation applying to DFRB pensioners warrants investigation. I wUl go even further and inform the Minister that, when we become the Government, that joint committee to investigate the anomaUes existing now in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act will be formed immediately. We are committed to this; it will be done. I have no desire to delay the passage of this BUl through the House. As I said, I welcome it. I know that pensioners and recipients of ex-service benefits will welcome it also. It has been delayed long enough. Accordingly, I support the Bill. speak in support of the BUl. I think it provides only due and proper recognition of the service given to this country by the men and women concerned. I am certain that the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) is aware of that just as much as I am. I think I could quote perhaps not from his words but from his intention when he said it was felt that the demands imposed on servicemen and the distinctive nature of their work warranted incorporation of their retirement benefits in a special scheme. I think this is a most important point which can be overlooked when we speak about the pension rights of servicemen and servicewomen.",54,Defence Force Retirement And Death Benefits Pension Increases Bill 1974

I have been lenient because of the circumstances relating to the second reading debate. I suggest that the Minister now be allowed to make'his comments without interjections. Speaker. I listened in absolute silence. I extended that courtesy to all speakers who have taken part in this debate. I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill because, as I have said, no one opposes it. I am not in disagreement with those who have indicated that there are some anomalies that have to be dealt with. The legislation which was introduced by me in 1973 gave immediate effect to the main recommendations of the Jess Committee of which the honourable member for Herbert was a member. If honourable members opposite want me to remind them of the situation that applied before the general elections of 1972 they will remember how the then Government procrastinated and could not make up its mind about the recommendations of the Jess Committee. We had the spectacle of the then Minister for Defence coming into the House and saying: 'We do not intend to introduce the legislation now to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee, but when we do make a decision-goodnes s only knows to 1 October 1972'. I said at the time that the then Government would not introduce the legislation and that I would introduce it. That is exactly what I did. I moved with speed to do so early in 1973. The introduction of this legislation was in keeping with the promise that we made during the 1972 election campaign when we said that we would introduce legislation to give effect to the Jess Committee's recommendations as soon as possible. I acknowledged when introducing the legislation that there were bound to be some anomalies and that they would be corrected in the future. I said that it would be better to adopt the main recommendations than to wait until we had thoroughly investigated what honourable members opposite are now referring to as some anomalies. I agree that there are some anomalies. That is why I said when introducing the legislation that if anomalies resulted from the legislation I would move to amend it. I have amended the legislation in one way today, that is, to provide an additional $3.2m, which is not an insignificant increase. I think that this has been acknowledged by honourable members. The question ofthose who left the Services before 1 October 1972 has been raised. Of course, this is a problem. I accepted the statement of the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) when he was Minister for Defence that the legislation should be made retrospective to 1 October 1972.

170,Mr Peacock (Kooyong) (4.21),"The purprovisions deleted by the Senate. If the amendments relate to clauses previously deleted by the Senate, we will oppose such amendments. I give notice now of such opposition and I will await the Committee stage for further elaboration. I mentioned earlier the Tariff Board report into the film industry. Contained within that report were references to the distribution of films, one of the major difficulties experienced by the Australian film industry. It would appear that in the formation of the Film Commission insufficient regard is being paid to both the distrimterests. We should not deny them the opporbution and the actual screening of films in this country. Obviously other problems referred to by the TariffBoard have not yet been met in the formation of the Commission but these facets were covered by the Opposition's shadow Minister in another place. A most important matter refened to by Senator Guilfoyle, however, was the composition of the Commission itself. As she said, the personnel must have the experience, wisdom and ability to recognise the problems and to do whatever is within the power of the Commission to overcome them. Therefore we will be interested in any Government amendments relaung to the personnel comprising the Commission. Persons without experience are virtually worthless. Persons with pecuniary interests should not, ipso facto, be excluded. Should they have certain pecuniary interests these obviously ought to be mandatorily disclosed. But such interests ought not to, indeed must not, preclude persons from serving on the Commission. If one refers to other Government agencies and corporations one will find provisions whereby those drawn from the particular industry over which that statutory authority is to exercise power are allowed to sit on commissions provided they disclose their interests. I can recall when the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill was introduced in the 1950s. I cannot recall reading it then; I was at a mewing and chewing stage. But I can recall reading later the remarks passed at that stage by the present Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). He spoke quite vehemently about persons with pecuniary interests sitting on commissions. YetI was interested to read a Bill that was introduced by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) recently which made reference to the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It permitted persons to serve on that Commission albeit they may have direct interests in the shipping industry. So in other areas the Prime Minister has seen, over the period since he spoke in the early 1950s, how wrong he has beeft' Much of the value of the Australian National LineI dispute some of its operations-ha s come from drawing into the Commission people thoroughly conversant with the operations of the shipping industry. In the formation of the AustraUan FUm Commission we should welcome those who work within the film industry, those who have interests in the industry, provided they disclose those interests and do not participate in a discussion or a deUberation in the Commission on something that would further their own interests, provided they opt out on something relating to their own tunity to serve simply because they have a financial interest in the industry. That to me is axiomatic, if one is drawing on the best people available. I do not say that that should be the sole criterion, but to me it seems ludicrous to create a situation whereby those with a particular financial interest in the industry should not be able to serve the Government on its commission. Having said that the persons appointed to the management of the Commission should be able to do just that; they should be able to manage the Commission and not be overridden by either the Minister or his Department. A statutory body is supposed to operate at arm's length from the Minister and the appropriate department. This is the whole aim of a statutory corporation. It appears that this Government has forgotten that. If this Commission, as foreseen in the legislation introduced in the Senate and in the BUl now before the House, which provides for ministerial direction and authority, is to operate under that sort of ageis it might just as well be administered by the Department of the Media itself and we should not go through the legal fiction of estabhshing a commission in whose activities the Minister can directly intervene. As I said, it is one of the fundamental aims, in order to provide necessary flexibility in a statutory authority, that it be at arm's length from the Minister concerned. If the flexibUity and expertise is overridden by a department or by the Minister, the Commission is nothing more than a legalfictionor facade. Its work might just as well be done by the Department itself. That frankly would satisfy nobody, because of the way in which the Department has been carrying out its Goebbels-like function over the past 22 to 23 months. That statement is not injected for a little bit of light relief. When I read the provisions in the BUl that entitled the Minister to give directions for certain films to be shown-to insist that they be shown-in particular cinemas, I can well imagine the sort of propaganda that this Government would insist on cinematograph producers showing to the people of Australia. The most glossy publications have been produced at enormous expense to the taxpayers to conceal what sort of shambles and mal-administration this Government has been constructing during its period in office. Now the Government is to play on the visual scene and thrust its views on persons in the commumty, through the film industry, I would imagine at great expense to the community and the taxpayer. But the central factor is that the Government, through the Minister, would direct that particular propaganda be shown in cinemas whether the owners or proprietors wanted it or not. I wanted to be brief in these remarks because my colleague in the shadow Ministry wishes to support me in this matter. We shall comment on the proposed amendments that the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison), representing the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas McClelland), will proffer at the Committee stage. I reiterate that we support the measure to estabUsh the Commission. But the remarks .1 have made are designed to ensure that the Commission not only wiU function efficiently and properly but also wUl be the sort of film commission that can properly serve the people of AustraUa and not simply serve a government of the day through the Minister that is aUowed to have control ofit. come the opportunity to participate in this dethe Media and to place them under the control of bate.

I mention the maligned points system that has been rubbished on many sides. It has achieved its objective of raising AustraUan content and giving great encouragement to the industry, which of course is reflected in the greatly increased budget. I beUeve that both sides of the House are agreed on the need to develop an increased national sentiment, that is, pride in being Australians and a pride in our history. I suggest that film is the most suitable medium for such a purpose. I am aware of the upsurge of interest in schools in film making, where it is seen as yet another mode of communication. I have vivid memories of when I was in the teaching profession and participating in the making of films, of the gold rushes, at the Doveton and Pakenham high schools where the chUdren had the opportunity of actually taking part in history. In this way they captured something of the excitement and the fever of the gold rush era. In simUar' manner, I believe that some of the television films and films of Australian origin have given Australians a much greater awareness of their identity and an understanding of their history.

I suggest to honourable members on the interrelated. One has already been referred to by other side of the House that they should reflect the honourable member for Kooyong, that is, the on the history of the AustraUan film industry and matter of ministerial responsibUity. It seems to me that the Opposition has taken and then declined again. What the Government an extraordinary stance on this point. I say that wants to see is a viable industry for the future is so frequently cited in this respect is the National FUm Board of Canada. It is specifically Media is responsible to the Parliament, should be retained in this BUl. The second objection is linked to the first. It rant nonsense. Why should the situation change? At this point in time FUm Australia is under the The third objection of the Opposition appears to be to the short film quotas. Surely it is obvious that no indigenous film industry can continue to how it has had its times when it has blossomed and not one which is left to chance. I return to what I said earlier. The Commission is to be established to encourage not only the making of Australian films, as has been done through the Australian Film Development Corporation, but also their showing in theatres so that there will be a return to the producers. It is only in this way that we can encourage effectively the production of films in Australia. I do not think I need to say it but I will do so for the benefit of honourable members opposite: Any quotas that will be set will allow for a very wide selection of films by those exhibiting them. In the few visits I make to the theatre I , for one, would be delighted to see Australian short films shown more frequently. How often do we see films produced by the National Film Board of Canada? How seldom do we see Film Australiafilms?I would commend the Bill to the House and I would commend the amendments. able member for Holt( Mr Oldmeadow) takes a most benevolent view of the amendments which are proposed by the Government to the Bill. I fear that he takes a rather unrealistic view of the significance of the amendments. But before I introduce any note of acerbity into this debate can I say how glad I am that the honourable gentleman graciously referred to the efforts of the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr sorts to pause even to look at what was referred Gorton) and his pioneering in thisfield?I would join with the honourable member for Holt in observing that. I would go further and say that I think the right honourable member for Higgins pioneered a number of initiatives in this country that are not as yet quite apprehended in their significance by some of his contemporaries-contemporarie s spread on both sides of the ParUament. It was in this field that the right honourable member for Higgins was prepared to seek to give deep and genuine expression of national sentiment. This is not said in any chauvinistic fashion. It is said with a quiet pride in the achievement of this country and a wUlingness to seek to portray to the world something of the character of the country. It is in that sense that the Oppositionfindsitself in wholehearted agreement with the Government. If honourable members turn to thefirstfunction of the FUm Commission in clause 5 as it now stands, they wiU see that it speUs out the aim and the objective of the FUm Commission. Clause5 states that the functions of the Commission are: (a) to encourage, whether by the provision of financial assistance or otherwise, the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian films; That is the ultimate objective of the Commission. Our quarrel with the Government is how best to achieve that objective-to achieve it in terms of meeting the objective but also to ensure that there will be no departure either by dint of indifference or by some susceptibUity to political bias and to poUtical prejudice. The area of quarrel was unfolded and expressed in a most temperate, perceptive and reflective speech by my colleague, Senator GuUfoyle, in another place. That area may be shortly stated: We object most strenuously to placing in the hands of a Minister-no t the hands of a commission-the right to determine what shall or shaU not be done. It is of no avaU whatsoever my honourable friend from Holt saying that the prospect of this being used for propaganda purposes is-to use his feUcitous phrase-'arran t nonsense'. The honourable member for Holt has not only an immense geniaUty of nature but also he has always impressed meI say this without seeking to patronise him-as highly inteUigent. Surely the honourable gentleman can see something of the immense Niagara of propaganda which cascades down upon us every day in every week. It is all very weU for the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) to laugh. Obviously he is too preoccupied seeking to hammer out a science policy of to by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock)-gloss y publications. One is not overstating the position to say that at the end of a week in this place one almost needs a dray and a draught horse to cart them out. This has been pushed out all over the country. To seek to take this into thefieldoffilmproduction and film distributionfiUsus with concern. I wUl Ulustrate the proposition very quickly. The bonafidesof the Government can be tested very readUy. Why not take from the proposed amendments the power given to the Minister? The Minister, at his discretion, may say to the Commission: 'Go and produce afilmof national interest'. Why not leave it to the FUm Commission to determine what is something of national interest? If the FUm Commission is not doing its job, the Government simply has to change the members of the Commission. Let us consider some of the immense powers proposed to be given. Clause5 deals with some of the functions of the Commission and then continues: (b) subject to the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any films and, in particular(i) films that serve the purposes of a Department of State or an authority of Australia;",60,Australian Film Commission
172,Mr Killen (Moreton) (4.46),"The honourCannot honourable members imagine the 27 blushing violets in the Government making a judgment as to what would serve the purposes of a Department of State? Why not leave thatimprovement because I understand that it can conceal blemishes with great facility. Why not leave this power to the Commission? Another function contained in clause 5 concerns films that deal with matters of nauonai interest to Australia. Why not leave that to the Commission? But no, the Government comes along and says that these powers3 of them in the main-shoul d be under the direction of the Minister. It is stated that the Minister may give a direction to the Comnussion with respect to a film and then the categories are put. They are the categories of the type I have mentionedthe purposes of a department of State, matters of national interest and matters designed to illustrate or to interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the Australian people. Surely the honourable member for Holt would have a preference for leaving those powers to be exercised ultimately by the Commission and not, as is proposed by the Government, ultimately by the Minister? What would be the position if we were to take-probabl y an extreme case-the case of some paranoiac Minister who took the view that he could find 20 or 30 matters of national interest and he gave, in 30 consecutive weeks, directions to the FUm Commission to producefilmson matters of national interest or matters dealing, in his judgment, with the purposes of a Department of State? What scope of activity would be available to the Commission to deal with its business? This is the very centre of our complaint about this clause. For the honourable member for Holt to say: 'Well, this is just some fiddling Uttle problem', is to take, as I say, a very benevolent but a most unrealistic view of the provision. I hope this House wUl not let go unnoticed the fact that this provision which is proposed by the Government by way of amendment to this BUl is claimed by the Government to put back what is most inaccurately described as 'teeth'. But this is not identical with what was contained in the BUl in the first place when it went into the Senate. The Minister has had a change of heart since then. In the first amendment, deaUng with the exerable friend, the Minister for Services and Propcise of this vast power, the Minister, under this erty. Some of them take their tasks very seriously proposed section, gives a direction and within IS indeed-so much so that they take the view that sitting days after giving that direction shall lay if the whole of the world does not revolve around before each House of the ParUament a copy of them it should. the direction together with his reasons for giving the direction. At first blush, that seems an eminently proper provision to make. Why was not it made in thefirstplace? Why did not the Government, when it introduced the BUl, indicate that when such powers were given to the Minister they would be exercised subject to parliamentary scrutiny? The simple fact of the matter is that under this proposal it would be possible for the Minister, even with parliamentary scrutiny imposed upon him, completely to control all of the activities of the Film Commission. I would hope that no person would believe for one moment that the deletion of this immense power is going-to use the in word-emasculat e the BUl. ReaUy and truly, this is to indulge in a sUly piece of hyperbole. This will not emasculate the BUl at all. It wUl establish the Commission. It will give to it proper powers for it to exercise, and in general terms we do not complain about those powers. We have raised no quarrel at all about that. But we are concerned with what probably could take place with the Minister interfering all the time. The other observation I make about the speech of the honourable member for Holt is this: It is quite competent for a statutory body simply to be required to report to ParUament. The honourable gentleman says: 'Well, if the Minister is exercising a power you can question him'. The fact of life is that we know that in this House of Representatives we can ask a question here now about once every 2 months. One gets tired, almost exhausted, from getting up and down each day trying to ask a question. How unreal is that? tion. question. The prospect of exercising parliamentary control by way of a question is a curious one indeed. This brings me to the second great power. The first power is that the Minister will have the ultimate control of saying to the Commission: 'All right, boys, turn this out'. One cannot say that all Ministers are consumed with vanity. Take the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly). He is the most modest man we know. He has been protected against the ravages of vanity.

The second aspect, which was referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong, is this: The Minister says where the film will be screened. Really and truly! AustraUanfilmscan stand on their own for excellence. If they are produced they wUl be shown and they wUl be screened on their merits. I disagree most vigorously with my friend from Holt when he says that this wUl mean that they wUl not be screened. I suggest to the honourable member that the reception which has been accorded AustraUan-produced films around the world has been quite outstanding. It has been a very warm reception and I am sure all of us have welcomed it. But the Minister under the second power would be able to go to any theatre, to any drive-in, and say: 'You wUl screen this film'. man again takes a most benevolent view of the Government has seenfitto give expression to a provisions of the BUl, because under the second phUosophy which is quite unacceptable to us. amendment proposed by the Minister-in the Senate this provision was removeda me to hear the honourable member for Moreton requirement can be issued which specifies the ( Mr KUlen) express the view, which he seems to period to which it relates, being a period comhold, that no intelligent person could possibly mencing not earUer man a particular date, to the hold a view which is not consonant with his own. theatre or theatres to which it relates.

To sum up, our objection to this BiU is the manner in which the Government seeks to implement its objectives. When the right honourable member for Higgins pioneered initiative in this field there was no suggestion of tying that initiative down to ministerial control. There was no suggestion of ensuring that everything had to be met and approved by the Mimster, and no power was given to the Minister to intrude in the fashion in which this BUl seeks to give power. Our objections are, with respect, principally to the 2 features I have mentioned: Firstly, that the Minister can determine what is good for us all and, secondly, that the Minister can determine the theatres in which the films shall be screened. If the Minister for Science can be prevaUed upon to remove these amendments, to let them waft away into the desert night, he would cheer us up immensely. This BUl is welcomed. The principle of it is welcomed most warmly by us.

This showed that in most cases the Australian these powers, even though when it was in film has encountered difficulties in securing satisfactory government it had these powers for many years. handling in regard to contract terms, publicity and exhibition We have exactly the same sort of thing happenlocations.

That is a very important consideration. The BUl we are now discussing represents the embodiment of the recommendations which came out of the Tariff Board, as it then was, relating to the distribution of AustraUan films. I have another short quote that I wish to make from the report: Evidence was presented to the Board by both distributors of the means by which the educational side of the and producers on the number of localfilmswhich have been school dental service was to be fostered was by financed or distributed by overseas companies.

This is something I have an example with which I have been personally involved. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you probably know I have had a very great and active interest in fostering the school dental service which has been one of the great achievements of the Whitlam Labor Government. One for Health (Dr Everingham) on this matter to try the teeth. Surely in a case like this-it is an absolSenate Opposition has a consistent policy of obutely unanswerable case-the Minister should have the power to ensure that these films are produced by Film Australia. If the Opposition's views on this matter are upheld by the Parliament, the Minister will no longer have those powers which he has had for many years. We would like to see Film Australia produce good pro-social films for showing in children's television programs. I think most honourable members would agree that the quaUty of children's television programs is not aU that it ought to be. Surely, it is necessary to produce good prosocial programs with an AustraUan content which can be shown during chUdren's viewing times. I know that it has been asserted that it would be undemocratic for the Minister to have this power to direct FUm AustraUa. Apart from the point I have made already, that the power has been there for many years, the Government wants to provide even additional safeguards. It agreed to an amendment moved in the Senate which provided for parliamentary scrutiny. It provided that any directions given by the Mimster could be disallowed within 1S days after their tabUng by either House of the Parliament. Another area in which there seems to be needless obstruction by the Senate is that in which it tried to have FUm AustraUa productions removed from the quota for short AustraUan films to be shown by exhibitors and cinema operators. I tlunk it is worth pointing outI do not think this has been made clear in the remarks of the that there was no compulsion on cinema operators to include FUm Australia productions in thenshowings or to meet the AustraUan quota. All it meant was that they had to meet a certain quota of Australian produced films. They could count FUm AustraUa productions in that selection offilmsto meet the quota. But the amendment proposed originally by the Liberal-Country Party Opposition in the Senate endeavoured to take this out of the BUl so that FUm AustraUa productions would have the same status as foreign films and there would be no quota requirements applying to them. Worse still, because the Senate Opposition did not have the numbers to have this pernicious amendment passed, it sulked and would not allow the appropriate clause to be passed at all. So the original clause 10 of the BUl has been deleted and now there are no AustraUan content quota requirements applying in regard to FUm AustraUa films as short AustraUan films. I think that the people of AustraUa ought to know where the Senate Opposition stands on this matter. The struction. It has a strict pohcy of opposing the development of AustraUanfilms.I do not want to apply these criticisms to the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) who played a large part in the establishment of the Australian FUm Commission, but I think that what has happened since the Liberal Party has gone into opposition is quite clear. Members of the Opposition quite often have had a lot to say about the need to do something in regard to permissiveness. In that regard, I think that perhaps something could be said of the degree of violence on children's television programs. Is this not a good chance to do something about this, to have a public authority which can produce good quality programs for chUdren's television? But it seems that the question of permissiveness vanishes when the Opposition has to support its private enterprise friends. If a question arose of whether quality or private enterprise profits should come first, it appears that the Opposition would have profits comefirst.If it is a question of whether we wUl have Australian content or whether foreign films should continue to dominate completely the film industry in Australia, then the Opposition supports the foreign film industry. I believe that the Australian public ought to be made aware of this. I wish to express some concern of my own about the legislation. It relates to an area in which I beUeve the Bill has not gone far enough. I refer to the question of control by a very small monopoly of foreign controUed companies of the film exhibitors and the cinema operators. We have just 3 companies which control a very large share-in fact, most-of the exhibition houses. I quote what the TariffBoard said: The three main Australian chains between them control 50 of the 77 city locations Later on the report states: When the number of cinema seats is taken as a further test of the strength of the major exhibitors, this impression of the dominance of the chains is reinforced. -The report also contains a very illuminating table which appears as table 8 at page 47.1 ask that this table be incorporated in Hansard. leave granted?

We do not want to hide the facts of real life; we are prepared to accept them, but we do not want to have the type of film that we sometimes see which is based entirely on violence, sex or crime. We would be better off without them. The Minister in charge of the Commission would want to do better with films than the Government has done with art, with the paint on 'Blue Poles'flakingoff every day. That gives an indication of what can happen when the Government assumes control over something without regard for the people who should be given a say.

Apart from the glorious beaches and the particularly attractive aspects of those beaches and the people enjoying the sun and the surf, there is a wonderful opportunity to portray on film more of the many unique attractions of inland Queensland and inland AustraUa since films about places off the beaten track have such an appeal for metropoUtan Australians, if not all AustraUans, and for people overseas. What we do not want to see happen, if a person making a film is not sympathetic to the Government's policies, is the Minister putting his big foot down and saying: 'No, you cannot do just what you want real effectiveness of the proposed Commission reduced as an instrument for the regeneration of the Australian film to protect the film industry and the broad functions of the Commission that are mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech would, I am sure, be accepted by the Opposition generIt should be noted unequivocally that the previous AusGovernment had been having films made, with the their possible use in the future.

185,Mr Corbett,"My friend the honourable aUy. The Minister continued:That is in accord with what the Opposition wants, but we want to see it done without ministerial dictation. We are not suggesting that there will be ministerial dictation but we do not want to permit the possibUity of such action. The Minister and the Government may not intend such dictation but we do not want those powers in this legislation. If such powers have been included where they should not have been included by a previous Government, perhaps it was in error but, as a Minister said, it is a big man who can admit his mistakes. It is not often that I quote from a Government member, but this is one occasion when I can. The Country Party, with its colleagues in the Liberal Party, wants to see a thrivingfilmindustry in Australia free from political interference and domination. In conclusion I repeat what I said in this House not long ago when I updated a famous quotation of Thomas Jefferson-it may need some qualification-'Our Uberty depends on the freedom of the media and that cannot be limited without being lost.' afternoon we are considering the text of the AustraUan FUm Commission BUl which has already been the subject of very extensive amendment by the Opposition in another place. We did not make these amendments through any desire to be capricious; we made them because our precise interest is to ensure that we have a piece of legislation passed through both Houses of this ParUament which guarantees that the AustraUan film industry for the foreseeable future wUl be based on a sound legislative framework. Unfortunately the legislation as it was introduced in the other place and the amendments which the Government again proposes to move to the same BUl mitigate against that objective. It is in this cona month before the elections. It was also interesttext, therefore, that we must consider the amendments which were proposed and accepted by the Senate. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) and I have both read, I am pleased to note, the Tariff Board report concerning motion picturefilmsand television programs. If those who drafted this legislation had done so, as they should have, within the context of this report they would have found, as I did in reading it with some care, that many of the objectives they are trying to achieve are not contained in the BUl's text as they should wish it to be. We are trying to tivity being conducted by future governments, buUd this legislation on a foundation established by therighthonourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) when he was the Prime Minister of Australia. I think it is only fair to the industry, Government speakers is that the existing organwhich he realised was of such great importance to the future of AustraUa, that we should give it legislation which can make everybody appreciate the position of the industry and its relevance within the Australian community. Essentially what we are trying to do is to come up with a Bill under whichfilmsproduced in AustraUa in terms of both theatre and television will assist in translating AustraUa not only to Australians but also to the rest of the world. It is within this context in particular that we must see the role of the organisation known as FUm Australia and the position which has been adopted by the Government in relation to the approval of the Minister. The Opposition has consistently made it clear that it does not accept clause 5 of the BUl primarily becauseI point this out once again as other speakers have done-it provides that the functions of the AustraUan Film Commission are: subject to the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any films . . . The point we make is that it does not refer to somefilms-not just films which have been produced by or in future wUl be produced by Film Australia or other organisations-bu t films from the entire industry. Within that context it is quite unacceptable that we should leave the industry entirely at the hands of one Minister. There are people, certainly supporters of the present Government, who wUl say that we are running red herrings. I remind the House that before the May elections the Minister who is responsible for this legislation spent about $lm in advising the people of Australia of the functions of ParUament. It was extraordinary how that piece of propaganda was distributed only about ing that most of the money was spent in the migrant Press. I do not need to make the point any clearer. If the Australian people are to continue to live in a democratic society it is fundamental that all areas of the media, in particular television andfilmsas well as the Press, should be allowed to remain free from ministerial guidance. I have just quoted one example. I have no doubt that if one looked deeper into the files of the present Government there would be many other examples. However, the Opposition is not prepared to pass through this House legislation which leaves any possibUity of this type of acincluding the present Government. A point which also has been made by previous isation FUm AustraUa, when it is incorporated within the Australian FUm Commission, should",68,Table 8 Cinema Seats Controlled By Major Exhibitors In Australian Capital Cities
186,Mr Connolly (Bradfield) (5.27),"Thisrequire the approval of the Mimster for its operations on the grounds that Film Australia has always acted within the confines of ministerial direction. That was the position because Film Australia was an arm of an existing government department. But what we are debating now is the establishment of an entirely new commission, and as it will be a statutory authority the criteria which we apply obviously should be different. Since when has it been decided that ministerial control should be exercised over the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation? We know the role of the Minister in that regard and I fail to understand how anybody could logically argue that if statutory corporations and commissions are to be established there should be ministerial approval in one field that does not apply in other fields. I should like to refer again to the TariffBoard report on 'Motion Picture Films and Television Programs' because it is relevant to the principles which should apply to this legislation. Dr H. C. Coombs, who is known to all honourable members, when he gave evidence to the inquiry made 4 pertinent points. Me said: . . . The inquiry probably relates to four general aspirations1. To increase the opportunities for Australians to express themselves in the various artistic and cultural fields which at least certain types of film production embrace; 2. To increase the opportunity for Australian creative artthat reason, if a foreign company wishes to proists in the film medium to express and enrich Australian identity and culture; 3. Hopefully, to increase the knowledge and appreciation of Australian creativity in the film medium in other countries through international exhibition of such films; and 4. To enable Australians to make an appropriate contribution to the sum of international achievement in those fields of culture, entertainment, education and other worthwhile endeavour communicated by film. I am sure that no honourable member in this House would disagree with those basic principles. I hope that the Government, in its wisdom in drafting this legislauon, kept those concepts in mind. Another aspect which we should cover concerns the question of the unfair monopoly position which can be given to productions of the Austrahan Film Commission in relation to the total industry. Clause5 of the Bill outlines the criteria which are supposed to apply to the type of films the Commission would like to see produced. In addition the Bill, in clause 3, contains a definition of Australian 'short film. The Opposition in the Senate made substantial amendments to this definition but I note that it is the Government's intention to restore the original text. As it stands, the Austrahan 'short film' definition is quite satisfactory. It covers films made by the Commission as well as films which can be defined as being Australianfilms.The latter arefilmswhere at least 80 per cent of the footage has been made in Australia. WhatI fear, however, is that we have perhaps missed the point. Although it is intended by this legislation to make funds available for the creation of AustraUan film, it is not necessary for us to cut off foreign investment in the film industry. As has been pointed out by other speakers, this industry in Australia is still in the development stage. For that reason, we wUl still need to be prepared to import to AustraUa a considerable degree of expertise, especially at the director level, if we intend to produce feature length films as distinct from short length films. Within that context, therefore, I would have thought that it was important that in our definition we should not only relate to the question of the percentage of footage which is produced in Australia but also be concerned as to whether a film is substantiaUy produced in Australia. By that I mean whether those who participated-the technicians, the actors, the producers and the directors, to name a few-were Australians. What we are trying to do, I would have thought, is to establish an industry which had not only a sound economic base but also personnel well trained in the activities regarded as essential in that industry. For duce a film in AustraUa, and it is going to employ a substantial percentage of Australian personnel, I would have thought that was a reasonable basis for inclusion in the definition in terms of an Australian film whether it be of short or long duration. I have one other criticism in relation to the proposed Commission. It is this: At present not only do we have FUm AustraUa which we know is to be incorporated into this Commission but also we have the National FUm and Television School, which is attached to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the FUm and Television Board of the AustraUan CouncU for the Arts which also comes within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In addition there is the Australian FUm Development Corporation. I would have thought there was reasonable logic in trying to relate these organisations in a more specific manner than has been proposed in this legislation. After all, we are deaUng with one industry. We are once again facing the proUferation of bureaucratic organisations established by this dfo'vernment in the 23 months and the very real possibility that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. I think this is a classic example of how this problem must be kept in mind. The Opposition has accepted this Bill in principle. We have put forward exceUent amendments which I would commend to the House. Provided the Government does not intend to force through its other amendments, we shall support the BiU. mentioned from time to time in the course of this debate I feel it encumbent upon me to say quite clearly where I stand in this matter. I am in favour of the FUm Commission. Let there be no doubt about that. But I do not Uke the concept of giving a Minister complete control of the Commission. Does this control apply to the whole film, to part of the film or to both? I suggest that it appUes to both. So, there is a whole film proposed to be made. Let us say it is a film that presents a Labor point of view. A Liberal Minister says: 'No, we cannot have that. Keep it out. Put it under wraps. We do not want it'. I wonder whether the Labor Party would be so keen to have a Minister exercising that responsibiUty under those circumstances. If a part of a film was involved-jus t some scene in itI wonder whether the Labor Party would be pleased if the Liberal Minister said: 'Cut that scene out. We cannot have that sequence. It is bad for pubUc relations'. I put the matter that way because I want the Government to think ofit. Our opposition is not just opposition for opposition's sake. It is quite clearly a case where no Party should have control in the sense in which this BUl gives control to the Minister. I cannot see why the Government is so firm on insisting on this matter. I want the Government to think what the situation would be if the Minister were a Liberal Minister. One honourable member on the Government side suggested that in putting forward our opposition we were opposing for opposition's sake. He said that the Minister always had these powers in the past; why not continue them in the future? I suggest that we do not continue them in the future because we are setting up a Commission. That is why we do not continue them into the future. Having set up the Commission and having given it the powers then it goes on with the powers whether the Government is as at present constituted or in a few months' time if we come in as a government. In either case, I suggest that that is a reasonable proposition. I do not like the provision giving directions for shortfilmsto be included in Australian quotas. I Science) (5.45)I move: do not mind some short films being included in AustraUan quotas. But I can foresee a circumstance arising in which a film theatre owner could say: 'Well, I have a theatre. I have shown so many 20-minute films, 10-minute films and 15-minute films. I have completed my quota. I am not going to show this full length film which you have put up, because I have completed my quota already by the use of shon films'. That, I suggest, is not a good proposition for the film industry in this country. If the quota was to be cut down to some percentage of shon films, that is fine. But for the whole lot to be included is something that I find very different. I refer to one other matter which has not been raised at all so far. This is the matter of the definition of a person who is going to be helped by this legislation. In the definition the provision is that the FUm Commission must have regard to the nationality and place of residence of the person to be assisted. I think the legislation previously said that regard had to be had to the nationality. Now regard must be had to the nationality and place of residence. If that provision is persisted in, some famous Australian living overseas for some time would not be able to have or would be seriously hampered in having a film made in Australia. Let us say that a famous singer living abroad was to come here for the making of that film, for example. No film could be made of her life. There are many other examples too. could go on. Regard must be had to the place of residence of these people. I would like the Government to consider whether it is not enough just to say: 'We will have regard to nationality'. That is all I wish to say. I do not think there is much politics in this BUl. But I want the Government to understand that our opposition is not opposition for opposition's sake; it is opposition to try to make a good BUl a better Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The Opposition certainly seems to be developing an inconsistency in regard to this matter. This where concern was expressed about how it was to be interpreted. The Government offered an elaborating or clarifying clause to make sure that the points that had been raised would be met. Sub-clause (3) of the amendment which I have moved states: Where the Minister gives a direction under this section, he within 15 sitting days after giving that direction, lay amendment which intends to bring to this Parliament the power that ParUament must exercise. It a power that ParUament can exercise through a I faU to see the difficulties that are foreseen ob(i) films that serve the purpose of a Department of State or an authority of Australia; volved in this part of the clause. The clause con(ii) films that deal with matters of national interest to Australia; and (iii) films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the Australian people; or the Government that anyone who wanted to make a film on Dame Nellie Melba would not have some broad concept of what the film was to be about. Such a person probably would indicate that the film would be shown at a festival of arts overseas. The person drawing up the criteria or requirements of the film would know where it would be shown and would have some idea of what the local audience would be interested in. This comes down as a direction of the client who has commissioned the film. Therefore the amendment which I have moved provides for full parUamentary supervision of a statutory authority. Let us not forget that it is very strange that the Opposition all of a sudden has put forth the proposition that any statutory corporation should have fuU and ultimate powers. This is not the nature of statutory corporations. If this ParUament loses the control and hands over complete power to any statutory corporation we are denying the democratic rights of this Parliament, and that is why I have moved the amendment. makes a fundamental mistake when he says that the Opposition is being difficult. I want to put it to the Minister that he is making an even more fundamental mistake by trying to gather from the second reading speech relating to this BUl what is in the BUl. This ParUament can bring a statutory corporation into existence and it can extinguish its life. But the point at issue is simply this: Why should a statutory corporation be so designed that it can indeed become the tool of the dominant government of the day and of the Minister of the day. That is the point at issuenone other. This was explained in simple, blunt and characteristically forthright terms by the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr judgment, respond to a request from the MinisGorton). The Minister said in relation to the Governare getting such an austere reaction from the ment's proposed clause 7A that the Minister is Minister for Science. trammelled in that he can deal only with prescribed matters. I invite the Minister in the name of simple understanding and of certainly Deputy ChairmanreUeving me of the prospect of suffering some tension, to come with me on a quiet, gentle Uttle walk back to sub-clause (1) (b) of clause S. The sub-clause reads: The functions of the Commission are(b) subject vo the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any filmsAnyfilms-not a particularfilm-and that covers the field. The sub-clause then goes on to deal with particular matters and the language used is: 'and, in particular'. So the situation that I invite my friend to agree to is this: We have a Minister who can cover the field, say, with respect to any film. respect, that seems to me to be hardly relevant. I am deaUng with the powers of the Minister. Under this provision the Minister can direct the Commission with respect to any film. It goes on to specify the particular powers that are there. If the Government wants to establish a statutory corporation of this character-thi s one stands on its own; it is quite singular, quite different from most other corporations which have come into being-and then say that the Government should have some link in it that is intelligible enough to us. This scrutiny would be quite apart from the parUamentary superintendence in the matter of reporting to Parliament annually or whatever the case may be, the money being made available for its operations by this ParUament. Why does the Government not content itself with saying: 'The Minister may request that a particular film be made'? Then the ultimate judgment would be left to the Commission. This is the bone of contention between us. We are quite determined that we would like to see the Commission estabUshed, but we are not content in the least with seeing a commission estabUshed which could quite blatantly, flagrantly, almost obscenely, become a vehicle for Government propaganda. That is giving it to the Minister in straight language which I am sure he will understand. It would be more becoming the stature of a commission of this nature to have its independence put in a position where it can, on its own ter. That is the simple approach of the Opposition. It disturbs me immensely to find that we Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question put: That proposed new clause 7A be inserted. The Committee divided.

(6) After clause 36, page IS, insert in Pan VII the following clause: 36A. (1) Subject to sub-section (2), the Commission is not subject to taxation under any law of AustraUa or of a State or Territory. (2) Theregulationsmay provide that sub-section (1) does not apply in relation to taxation under a specified law. In consideration of this amendment, Mr Deputy Chairman, may I suggest that we take into joint consideration proposed new clauses 8A and 8B. The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN ( Mr Senate. But because we have followed the Annitage)-I s leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. this amendment is to re-insert in the Bill power for the Australian Film Commission to require exhibitors offilmsto exhibit some proportion of Australian shortfilms.The power, as amended in line with a proposal put forward by Senator Hall, can only be exercised after empowering regulations have been brought into effect. Those regulations will eventually include details of the proportion or percentage of shortfilmsexhibited wbich must be AustraUan. The Opposition in the other place sought to delete this whole power of the FUm Commission almost entirely on the grounds that we have provided for the inclusion of FUm AustraUa films in the quota provisions. What it has done in trying to attack FUm AustraUa is attack the whole of the short film industry in AustraUa. The Opposition in the other place deUberately took out of the BUl any requirement for any short film to be shown by exhibitors. We do not believe that any short film produced in Australia should be so subjected. It is, in fact, placing short films produced in AustraUa in the same category as foreign films. Because of its tenacity and desire to disrupt the activities of FUm AustraUa and because of the blind view it had taken, the Opposition in the other place wiped out the whole provision and made all short films produced in Australia not subject to what we regard as a requirement vital to the encouragement of the film industry in Australia. If l may, I wish to quote from the comments of the TariffBoard in its report on the role and the significance of short films. It said at page 38: Because of the imponant role which the production of non-sponsored shorts can play in developing an emcient film industry, the Board has recommended that locaUy produced shon films intended for theatrical release be submitted to the A FA for certification that they are not sponsored and are thus eligible for commercial exhibition under the proposed quota. The Tariff Board realised, in relation to the development of the film industry in Australia and the training of cameramen, technicians and producers in the short film industry, that there had to be some sponsorship and there had to be some Government intervention in order to ensure that the short film industry was not only developed but also able to get under way and become an important pan of the film industry in Australia. So we, as the Government, have introduced the notion that there should be a film quota for shon films. This part of the legislation was defeated in the recommendations of the Tariff Board and because we strongly believe that the short film industry in Australia, which is the cradle of film makers in Australia, has to be assisted we are insisting upon this provision being reinstated in the BUl. The philosophy of the Liberal and Country Parties is: 'You can go ahead and make films but it is not necessary that you should be able to show them and not only is it not necessary that you should be able to show them but also we will not provide you with any assistance or the conditions under which they can be shown'. It is simply ludicrous to suggest, first of all, that we should just let films be made and not shown. That is why we have put forward the requirement that there should be a quota for them to be shown. It has also been suggested that the films made by Film AustraUa should not necessarily be shown. That, to my mind, is ludicrous because the amount of money which has been spent over the last few years on films sponsored by the Government for a variety of reasons",74,Pairs
198,Mr Morrison,"The general purpose ofadds up to some $4m. It seems to us that the use of that money can be displayed in the form of short films that can be seen. So we insist that we should be able to legislate to ensure that the Film Commission, which will be sponsoring short films, will be able to have thosefilmsshown and that the quota provisions, which provided the teeth of the Film Commission and which the Opposition has quite dehberately taken out, should be reinstated. appalled by the information put to the Committee by the Mimster for Science( Mr Morrison) in his capacity as the representative in this chamber of the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas McClelland). He talked to us about the Opposition in the other place taking this provision out of the Bill and therefore denying the recommendations of the Tariff Board in its report. It is just as well that members of the Opposition are better informed on matters than supporters of the Government. I have in front of me the report of the TariffBoard to which the Minister referred. He talked about the Tariff Board recommending that for quota purposes films such as those produced by Film Australia as it is now called-it used to be called the Commonwealth Film Unit-shoul d go towards the quota for Australian short films. In fact, the Tariff Board's report says at page 16: Certification (for quota purposes) would only be given to cise of powers under this sectionshorts not madeI emphasise the words 'not made 'by the Commonwealth Film Unit. In fact, what the Government is seeking to do with the extraordinary piece of drafting in the two proposed new clauses that are being considered together is to try to condemn the independent film industry by forcing it out economically by the production of Film Australia shorts that would drive out the independent film producers in Australia. Within these proposed new clauses it insists, in the dragnet, Goebbels style, of the earUer clauses to which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr KUlen) was referring that it wUl demand that these films be shown, irrespective of whether an operator wishes to show them. It is all very well to insist upon a quota of short films, but not if it is going to drive out another section of the industry. Unquestionably the industry understoodI have this on the best authority-that this provision would be amended by the Government, but not by the reinsertion of the clause that was taken out by the Senate, which would stay out. We would be happy to agree to this insertion if the definition of an AustraUan short film were to be amended by the deletion of sub-clause (a) of the definition, but that is not going to be done by the Government. We would be happy if the Government were to agree to the deletion of all references to the Minister's approach, approval and direction in the BUl, but the Government has just reinserted that provision by supporting it in the division that we have just had. The Government has introduced as part of this amendment a provision which says, in proposed sub-clause (5): It is a defence if a person charged with an offence under sub-section (4) proves that he had a reasonable excuse relating to the availability of Australian short films for not complying with the requirement to which the offence relates. The onus of proof is being thrown onto the individual charged. The same honourable members opposite who have the hide to come into this chamber on occasions and talk about wanting to introduce a Bill of Rights in the Parliament have thrown aside all conventions and laws relating to the onus of proof. Let me quote proposed clause 8B, which the Government seeks to bring in together with proposed clause 8A. It reads: The Minister shall give such directions to the CommissionAgain we have the Minister saying what it should do; so much for the independent authorityor an authorised person under section 7A as he thinks necessary for the purpose of ensuring the observance, in the exerListen to thisof the obligations of Australia under the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and thc Commission or the authorised person shall comply with those directions. I have in front of me a copy of the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. sitting I had expressed the Opposition's grave reservations about the amendments proposed by the Government. Included, of course, is clause 8B which we have been discussing in a cognate debate. I traced through the Opposition's view that we would accept this amendment if there were changes made in either the definition of the 'Australian short film' in clause 3, or if in fact the references to the approval of the Minister and the direction of the Minister throughout the Bill were changed. I indicated, of course, that as the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) did not seem to be moved by my argument on the Australian short film change in definition and the fact that",75,Pairs

In Part II of the Australian Film remind Government supporters that the whole Development Corporation Act, clause 6 (3) purpose of a statutory authority is that it may opstates: erate at arms length from the Minister. The central argument that 'the honourable member for direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a business of making. Moreton( Mr KUlen) has been putting throughout this debate in the Committee stage is that the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas McCleUand) or his representative in this place, the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) ought to remove themselves from a position of having control of the statutory authority. We do not want to regurgitate the same arguments time after time. But the central issue is that the Minister is aUowing the arguments to be regurgitated as we debate clause after clause. We ask the Minister for Science, who represents the Minister for the Media in this place, to Usten to the persuasive arguments that we have been putting about the withdrawal of the authority of the Minister for the Media over a commission such as the AustraUan FUm Commission. As I said, the whole purpose of the Commission operating effectively and efficiently is that it operates with a flexibility that only a statutory authority can have. If it is to operate directly under the authority of the Minister his Department may as well administer the Clauses agreed to. Proposed new clause 1 7A. After clause 17, insert the following clause: '17A. A person having a direct or indirect pecuniary (a) to be appointed under section 12 as, or to remain, a full-time member: or (b) to be appointed under section 17 to act, or to continue to act, in the place of the Chairman or another full-time member'. The purpose of this amendment is to reinsert the provision to ensure that fuU-time members of the Commission should not be open to the charge of conflict of interests in carrying out their responsibUity in the service of the Australian Film Commission.

The Bill that it introduced relating to very much the same sort of thing as the Bill we are now considering specifically excludes anybody with a pecuniary interest being appointed as a member of that Corporation. Then, in the other place the Opposition argues that there should be as members of the Austrahan Film Commission people who have a pecuniary interest in the film industry. We accept this argument. I think that this is one of the major criticisms of the Austrahan Film Development Corporation which members of the Opposition brought in when in government. We accept the argument that it is necessary to have on the Commission people who have an interest, experience and expertise in the film industry. But what we say-thi s is the point I must stress-is that a full time member cannot have a pecuniary interest. It is a very simple proposition. We say that a part-time member of the Commission can have a pecuniary interest. If the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) would read the Bill he would find that this was the case. So the clause that we are seeking to reinsert by way ofan amendment really contains the sort of philosophy that one assumes the Opposition had in this context. We just make the differentiation that we hope that full-time members would be full-time members and would not be running Hoyts or some other outfit in their spare time, that they would devote themselves entirely to the functions and operations of the Commission. We accept the proposition which was contained in the original Bill, which unfortunately the Opposition in the Senate deleted, namely, that pan-time members can have these interests as long as they declare them in the consideration of matters that come before the Commission. ment of the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) is the most predictably schizophrenic argument that I have heard in this chamber since I have been here. How on eanh can the Minister say that the Opposition is inconsistent and then stand up and say that if a person has a pecuniary interest in a matter he cannot serve as a full-time member but he can serve as a pan-time member? What the Opposition is trying to ensure is that the Australian Film Commission functions as effectively as possible. That means that we should choose the best qualified people, irrespective of whether they have a pecuniary interest. (Government supporters mterjecting)schizophrenia is widespread amongst honourable members on the other side of the chamber. The Government will allow people with a pecuniary interest to serve as part-time commissioners but not as full-time commissioners. It seems to me that once you take that step and permit people with a pecuniary interest to serve on the Commission, whether it be on a full-time or a part-time basis, you have crossed the Rubicon and have conceded that these people have a contribution to make. If positions are to be open to them on the Commission to fill as full-time commissioners, the positions ought to be filled by the best qualified persons. Honourable members opposite in Government have a predeliction for saying time and again: 'We have representatives of the housewives association, of the employers associations and of trade unions on a certain body. Is that not marvellous? We have almost the whole spectrum of the community represented on this body'. The fact that such people may know nothing about matters to be discussed does not enter into it. What is important in regard to this Commission is that we get the best quaUfied people. Of course, it should be insisted that they declare their interests. Of course the Government insists that it is mandatory that they declare their interests and that they are not aUowed to take decisions or to vote upon matters in which they have afinancialinterest. The best people qualified to serve on the Commission should be put on that Commission. The Government has taken the step of permitting such people to serve pan time on the Commission. Why does the Government have a bob each way, or in this inflationary time, $5 each way? Why does the Government not go the full step and allow the people to serve, provided they declare their interests? To me it is extraordinary that the Government fabricates an argument against those who have such interests but permits them to serve as part-time members and not as fuU-time members. The Government's argument falls to the ground because of the lack of logic in it. The Opposition opposes the amendment. against the attitude taken by the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison) with respect to this amendment. The logic put by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock) surely is captivating, if not overwhelming. Question (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 November on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron: That the Bill be now read a second time. (8.41)-This Bill is aimed direcdy at the barge and small ship operators servicing the north coast of Austraha, the Northern Territoiy in particular. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) said: It has come to the Government's attention, as a result of a dispute in Darwin and an associated legal opinion, that the original intention of the legislation could be frustrated by the planes, footwalkers or motor vehicles, if he can, lack of clarity in the existing wording of paragraph (n). Thus, concern has been expressed by the principle parties in the industry that this paragraph should be clarified at the earliest opportunity. Paragraph (n) is part of the definition of waterside worker contained in section 7 of the principal Act. I beUeve the Minister said also that he had had discussions with the principal persons concerned in Darwin. However, I do not think the Minister said that agreement had been reached with them; I am certain he would not have secured their agreement. I believe this BUl emanated from the time when a barge operatorI wUl name him since the Minister no doubt will do soa man named V. B. Perkins, managed to have his barge operation declared an industrial undertaking. By so doing he was not bound, under the Act, to employ Waterside Workers Federation personnel. Had it not been for a legal interpretation of the provisions of the Act barge operators on the north coast would still have been forced to employ WWF labour. The point about this whole situation is that in the past the employees of the barge operators have been able to load and unload these vessels at a rate of 7.2 tons an hour as compared with 0.7 tons an hour by WWF labour. PerhapsI should explain the operations of these barges. Thetideis all-important. A barge must be beached and loaded intimeto catch the next high tide. As honourable members and some people know, Darwin has a rise and fall in thetideof up to 28 feet. Many places serviced by thistypeof vessel also have high rises and falls in the tide and that is why barges operate in the Northern Territory and on the north coast of AustraUa. Not only is Mr Perkins involved in this type of operation; every barge operator on the north coast of Australia must follow a similar procedure. These barges operate from Port Keats eastwards to the Gulf of Carpentaria. When mining operations first commenced on Groote Eylandt and when the Nabalco company first developed its operations at Gove there were few signs of civilisation. There were no roads and no sealed airstrips, except for a wartime strip at Gove. Consequently these barge operators alone transported most of the supplies to and from those areas. They have been doing this work for up to 12 years. I have been accused by the Minister of conspiring with these people to try to further their ends. Who would not try to further the ends of people who provide virtuaUy the only means of communication to such places on the north coast? I suggest that the Minister try to service these outlying areas with a number of aerofrom now until next April because if this BUl is passed in its present form there will be a complete faUure of barge operations on the north coast no matter who owns the barges. I am quite wUling to be in a conspiracy when I am trying to save an essential operation which has functioned for 12 years. I am in conspiracy on behalf of thousands of my constituents. As a quick calculation-it must be quick as I am supposed to make my comments briefI should estimate, from looking at the townships, settlements and what used to be missions on that north coast, that 4,000 to 5,000 people would be relying directly on barge operations and an additional 7,000 to 8,000 people would be in considerable difficulty if those barge operations ceased. Why then should I not be standmg here defending the barge operators and trying to stop a Government move which wUl put these ships off the north coast? These operators could easUy go elsewhere with their ships. IfI owned these vessels I would not be operating on the north coast now. I would not have stood the nonsense perpetrated by the Government on behalf of the people whose interests it is espousing in the stevedoring industry in Darwin. These barges operate from Frances Bay, which is the small ships pan of the Port of Darwin. It has been suggested that WWF labour working these vessels would be loading at",81,Pairs

It is not one which the Government, we that industrial undenaking;'. move: In proposed new paragraph (m) omit 'performing', subthe moment: stitute 'whose duties include'. As the honourable member for Wannon( Mr persons, being employees in the regular employment of a Malcolm Fraser) pointed out in the second reading debate, the clause suggested in this Bill goes beyond what was seemingly intended by the Government and the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) in his second reading speech. As was pointed out, the Minister referred to the second reading speech of the late Mr Harold Hok in 1956 when the definition of waterside worker was originally put in the legislation. It was clear that the purpose of this was to cover a case where ships were unloaded at remote places-then , for instance, Bell Bay, and now places Uke Gove, Groote Eylandt and the Uke. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that persons employed in those ventures are able to unload from ships not only the actual machinery, products, or goods that are bemg used in connection with an industrial undertaking-for instance at Gove in regard to the Nabalco bauxite undertaking-but also those goods which have been transported there by ship for use in hotels, motels and shops-in other words, ordinary stores or perhaps the furniture of people who Uve in and service the neighbourhood. If the BUl goes through in its present form aU that would be permitted in such a case would be the unloading of products that are used in connection with the Nabalco undertaking. I have taken this undertaking as just one example. Goods for use in the local store would not be permitted to be unloaded from the ship. Products to be sold in any store, perhaps even the Aboriginal store at Yirrkala near Gove, could not be unloaded. The Opposition cannot believe that the Government really intends that this should happen. Of course, the significance of this is that although Gove is not a port at which there is a register for waterside workers at the moment, once a possible demarcation could arise it would be open to the Waterside Workers Federation to seek the registration, for example, of the port at could be established and waterside workers would handle that part of a cargo which was for respectfully suggest, ought to promote. Therean amendment to clause (3) (n) which seeks to omit the word 'perforrning'. The clause reads at person carrying on an industrial undertaking . . . performing work in or in connection with stevedoring operations of the employer with respect to a cargo that is the product of, or is for use in or in connection with, that industrial undertaking. That is construed to mean 'whilst performing that work'. WhUst they were not performing that work they would not be exempted from the definition of waterside worker, that is to say, whilst they were unloading a ship in so far as the cargo related to goods for use in the local store. Our amendment seeks to delete the word 'performing' and to put back the words 'whose duties include'. Therefore as long as the duties of the persons who were unloading the ship included the unloading of that part of the cargo which was a product of, or for use in or in connection with an industrial undertaking, that would be sufficient. The fact that they took off the rest of the cargo which related to the local store would not require them to be regarded as waterside workers for the purposes of the Stevedoring Industry Act. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment. We believe that the amendment would not only preserve industrial peace, and comply with the intention of the Government according to the Minister's second reading speech but also would be consistent with the original intention of this legislation and with a desire to cover the problem which brought about the amendment. The amendment would enable the legislation to cover the problem. At the same time it would not give rise totfurther problems in the nature of demarcation disputes which could",82,Stevedoring Industry Bill 1974

If the Minister has not understood the language of the BUl as introduced he has an opportunity to overcome that misunderstanding by accepting the amendment that the Opposition now proposes.

Having agreed to the request of the CSR organisation the then Government inquired as a matter of urgency as to whether other companies might warrant exemption. It ascertained that various companies had long-standing exemptions from the waterside workers award. It appears that paragraph (n)-the one we are now talking about-wa s then added to section 7 (1) to give those companies the increased protection of the legislative exemption. At its simplest, the paragraph appears designed to cover those types of companies which already had exemptions from the waterside workers award. The following quotation is taken from the Cabinet clause notes for the 1956 Bill: . . . shall grant exemptions from the need to use Federation members where the stevedoring operations concerned with the operations ofan enterprise loading or unloading at wharves which form part of the enterprise and in relation to which the normal employees of the enterprise will be used.

223,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh,"seeks to clarify the original intention of the legisParty. For that reason we had indicated that we lation. That intention was that an employer using his regular labour could stevedore at his company wharf any type of cargo that was the product of or for use in or in connection with that undertaking. The Bill therefore merely confirms the original intention, but does not dehberately do violence to the existing practice. The wording of the Bill has been the subject of consideration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and other unions. It is recognised that the Bill is intended to clarify weaknesses in the legislation which could have serious impUcations for the stevedoring industiy and that it is not intended to disturb relationships outside the stevedoring industry. The wording of the BUl has been the subject of discussion between employers and the Government. Agreement has been reached on all matters of substance and on much of the wording. There were, however, some differences in the preferences given to the clause. words used in some parts of the BiU. Senior legal opinion was to the effect that the words now to be found in the BUl better stated the intention of the legislation but were not in conflict with the phrasing preferred by existing industrial undertakings. The wording of the BUl has been the subject of discussion with the stevedoring industry parties and they are in agreement with its present form. I do not intend to speak again on this clause or to say anything when we come to the consideration of the next clause. I conclude by saying that if, as suggested, we were to delete the word 'performing' and replace it with the words 'whose duties include' the situation could work in reverse because if only 1 per cent of the cargo handled by an employer was directly connected with his undertaking or his product, the other 99 per cent of the cargo that had nothing whatever to do with it would then be exempt from the operations of the Act. That would produce the very opposite result from what I am sure the Opposition intends. about that. The Attorney-General's Department has said that this is a critical clause. Talks have gone on today between the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Mr Innes, U. E. Fitzgibbon, I think it is, of the Waterside Workers Federation. The Waterside Workers Federation had intended its Mr Docker to come to Canberra tomorrow to discuss this matter with the Opposition Parties and with the Government would keep an open mind on the matter. If, as a consequence of the talks we have with the Waterside Workers Federation and of the talks which take place between the Federation and the Opposition parties, it is thought that there ought to be some amendment of the BUl or that the amendments which have been moved or circulated ought to be accepted, the Government wUl be, of course, willing to do that in the Senate. Unfortunately the airline strike has hit the Waterside Workers Federation and its representative is not now able to come to Canberra tomorrow. But I should think that we would have an opportunity before the debate is resumed in the Senate to hear what it has to say and if, as a consequence of that, the Government feels inclined so to do it wUl move suitable amendments in the Senate.

236,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Leader of thewould like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1974 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (9.49)-The Livestock Slaughter Levy Bill 1974 and the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1974 have the support of the Opposition. Briefly, the Bills extend the operation of the Uvestock slaughter levy from 1 June 1975 to 30 June 1977. The funds collected providefinanceto the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for scientific research in connection with beef, mutton and lamb processing. It is paradoxical that we are presendy debating this legislation when the meat industry is undergoing its greatest crisis since the depression.

It is against this backFrom these BUls approximately $90,000 to ground that I think comment should be made. The present position of the beef industry is exrectly, it is really the meat producers who pay for tremely disturbing, not only from the viewpoint it in terms of the price they receive for their of the beef industry but also from the viewpoint cattle. Thus, it is important to examine their of the nation. The total coUapse of the beef financial position.

From a reference to the annual report of the AustraUan Meat Research Committee it can be seen that the projects being undertaken with the money raised by these BUls are contributing significantly to improving consumer appeal of meat to consumers. For instance, significant research has recently been undertaken into the effect of feedstuffs on meat quaUty and taste. An expansion ofthefindingsfrom this report could lead to better forms of management practice which would ensure that producers could avoid producing for slaughter cattle with undesirable consumerflavours.Other investigations which are taking place include: More effective methods of waste disposals from abattoirs, particularly in relation to boned digestion of gut materials from slaughtered animals to produce high quality fertiliser; studies in reducing bacterial contamination of hot boned beef; studies into the refrigeration technology of freezing carcasses; the best methods of conditioning mutton by hanging after slaughter; and, studies into producing well marbled beef for which premium prices are paid. The CSIRO is to be congratulated on this work which I fully beUeve wUl lead to significant and potentially great changes in the industry.

Such have been at the processing end where wage an improvement is urgently needed and I think rates and slaughtering charges haverisenout of the Government would see the wisdom of such a hand. I think there is a need to develop methods step. The other point I wish to raise with regard to the legislation is that I firmly beUeve that the results of the research which have flowed from to the processing of meat into forms for which simUar BUls in previous years could be used by there is an untapped consumer potential. For the Government in the development of a food instance, in the United States of America an aid program involving meat products.

The Government should look at this which do not involve expensive refrigeration will proposition because we could help ourselves and significantly reduce this problem and I urge that help these underprivUeged countries at the same it be more widely investigated. time. The Mimster for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) recently returned from Rome after does not oppose the BUl. However, we believe promising a record amount in food aid to the developing countries. Studies that have been meat have meant that there is widening knowledge of the best methods of treating meat for a wide range of markets. This knowledge should be used by the Government so as to allow it to I appreciate that there are substantial probof cattle slaughtering and meat processing which wUl reduce these charges wherever possible. I also recommend that serious study be given In conclusion I reiterate that the Opposition that the Goverament must take urgent action to reduce the problems facing the meat industry and to improve consumer acceptability of meat and at the same time consider the suspension of levies that growers have to pay in order to improve the liquidity position of the industry, with the Government taking over the growers' component of the contribution until the situation in the meat industry has improved. The Opposition supports the Bill. know, the purpose of the Bills is to continue the levy to provide finance for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for scientific research in connection with the processing of beef, mutton and lamb. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr O'Keefe) ably pointed out the research carried out by the CSIRO which isfinancedby these levies. He mentioned the projects that the Organisation has in hand at the moment and he also mentioned that perhaps it could do a lot more work. It is imperative that it turn its attention to processing meat that can be incorporated in our food aid program. I was heartened by the comments of the honourable member for Paterson that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) have been discussing this matter recently. I know that the Government has been very concerned over the last few months about the position of the beef industry. Since last April we have been in an unprecedented slide and today the industry is in dire straits. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) and the Minister for Agriculture in answers to questions and in speeches that they have made recently have demonstrated their concern for the industry. Naturally the Minister for Northern Development is primarily interested in the top end of the country, but both he and the Minister for Agriculture have demonstrated their interest mainly in the northern part of AustraUa where beef is primarily produced for export. I suggest to them that the southern States of AustraUa are today in just as much trouble. In fact, I beUeve the northern parts of AustraUa have completed a reasonably successful killing season but are naturally looking forward with some trepidation to the coming killing season. But at the moment catde men in the southern States are in the process of selling their catde. The cattle have to be taken off the properties. As we know, prices are going down week by week. We thought a month ago that they must have hit bottom but today the price that breeders are getting for their stock is an absolute tragedy. This also applies to the people who are in the quite legitimate business of fattening stock which were bought last year at very high prices. Today they are facing losses of over 50 per cent of what they paid for their stock. Stock that they bought for, say, $150 a head, is being sold by them for $50. But let us come back to the point about processing beef and the CSIRO's role in this. I have no doubt that if something could be arranged quickly between the Government and the CSIRO to process meat into dehydrated form or into canned form such meat could be incorporated in our food aid program. Looking back over all rural industries, but in particular the beef industry, we see that we have gone through a period of great troughs and peaks. While we would Uke to think that this wUl change in the future and that maybe by our marketing expertise and more long term government to government agreements or long term meat agreements with other countries we will be able to take the peaks out, personally I think that from the way the world is going at the moment it would appear that the peaks and troughs wUl always be in front of us. They may even become more regular. This is a disappointing future to look forward to, so it is important to be able to produce meat in a processed form that can be used for different markets and can be used for aid. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory has said many times that the Government is giving the beef industry earnest consideration and that it realises the crisis in which the industry is. I trust that the Minister will be able to make sure that his coUeagues see the reasons behind the need to do something immediately. I beUeve that taxes and levies that are placed on the meat industry could be lifted until the industry has returned to a period of prosperity. The estimates of receipts and expenditure for the Department of Agriculture show that the rural industries contributed $260,672,000 to receipts. This is vastly greater than the payments by the Government to the rural industries which in fact total $210,879,000, not including the $4m subsidy contained in the Tractor Bounty Act, the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy of $13m and a phosphate fertiliser bounty. My point is that the Government is not losing by subsidising rural industries. The rural industries very much pay their own way. When one takes into consideration their earning capacities overseas, they are essential to the country. As the honourable member for Paterson pointed out, the beef industry in particular is essential to the country. I have already spoken on this matter",90,Pairs

Another matter on which I should Uke the not to cover ground that has already been Minister to comment is the problem of meat covered in this debate. I support the Bill. I wish works which have overseas shipments rejected more to discuss the climate in which we must because of pesticide residue in carcasses. It seems consider this Bill and the position of the meat to me to be appropriate for this research section of the CSIRO complex at Cannon HU1 to have the specific responsibUity of tracing back the problem of pesticides, be it arsenical chlorates or insecticides such as DDT, which cause the rejection of meat on overseas markets and which compel the meat works associated with the rejection to have to be on a certify and test basis before shipments are allowed to continue. We cannot allow meat to be sold for export or for home consumption ifit is contaminated. I am disturbed that the Federal authorities seem unwUling to take initiatives in the matter of tracing back pesticide residues. I submit that where these residues are found every help must be given to the affected meat works because it is no fault of the meat works, no fault of the buyers and no fault of the producers. If we have a trace-back program we can eradicate the cause of these pesticide residues in the carcasses of meat-residue s which can have a disastrous effect on the human environment. The research unit at Cannon Hill had a most successful trace-back program with the bacteria salmonella. This bacteria was traced back and we found that no matter how good the The research unit has also conducted research",92,Pairs

The importance of this is probably sufficiently emphasised if we point out that the present price of beef on the hoof is only 34c a kilo whereas the price to the housewife is approximately twice that per pound. There is a lot of room to save costs in handling beef between the farm gate and the housewife's table. The beef industry could hardly be in worse circumstances. The producer's gross income is down by 40 per cent or 50 per cent at the same time as his costs have risen by some 25 per central! within the space of 12 months. No industry can cope with this sort of sudden cyclical downturn. There is a strong case for support for the industries, needs support at this time. I urge upon industry because it is generally beheved-it is the Government consideration of a deficiency also beheved by the Bureau of Agricultural payments scheme, among other schemes and Economics-that this situation will not last foramong other things, because I believe that it ever and that in one or two years' time we might might most closely meet the requirements of the expect better prices. If this is the case it is absolindustry. utely essential that we have breeders to take advantage of this situation and that the industry has not been allowed to collapse. If we are to save these breeders the people who own these animals will require an income in the meantime. I ask the Government to consider proposals that forthwith. will give income to the owners of these breeders. I ask it to consider proposals that will maintain the price of beef to the producers of beef in the time. short-term-to consider something that, in fact, is counter-cyclical support as proposed in the Green Paper on Agriculture. I am thinking of a type of deficiency payment scheme whereby beef as it is sold for slaughter receives a payment that will bring its price up not to levels that would motion by Dr Patterson: expand the beef industry but to levels that would cushion the inevitable traumas through which it must go-to levels that would cushion the rate of Question resolved in the affirmative. decline that would spell its destruction and ensure that cows were not available to carry this industiy, which apparently has a bright long term future, into that future. I ask the Government to examine a deficiency payments scheme because I believe it meets the following criteria: It would be simple to administer, the machinery would not be complicated, it could be instituted relatively quickly and it would be equitable. It would boost growers' returns and it would boost them now while it is needed. It would be paid direct to the producers Program-Palestin e Liberation Organization at of the beef and not to the other side of the market. It would be paid to the people who are at present in trouble. It would avoid the prohibitively high cost of storing meat for a long time. I think we have only to look at the experiences of the United Kingdom to make us at least seek an alternative solution to this problem of the high cost of storage. It would preserve the incentive to produce quality in that it would preserve the price differential between the different grades of beef. It would avoid the high risk that would be involved in retaining large numbers of beef cattle on properties during times when they would normally be turned off. This is a very risky exercise. If we pay growers to hold large numbers of cattle back on their properties, and we run into bad seasons, we may regret it. We may come through, but it is very risky.

I can assure the House that I was a lot younger than 31 years of age. Furthermore, the Bank was concerned by the then Labor Government and wanted to get it out of power. Mr Prowse wrote some treatises which he sent to the general manager of the Bank. At that stage, the Bank was recruiting people to work as full-time organisers for the Liberal Party to endeavour to put the Chifley Labor Government out of power. We all remember that the Bank of New South Wales was a highly poUtical institution. Yet this man, who received his chance because he was put into poUtical organisation against the then Labor Government and who was so heavUy identified with poUtical organisation, denied in the Press on 2 May this year that he was poUtically motivated in his attacks on the economic poUcies of this Government. He claims to be, of course, a high pundit of high finance in this country. Yet his bank is more responsible than any other simUar institution for the liquidity crisis in this country. As Assistant General Manager he must personally accept considerable responsibUity for the mistakes ofhis institution. Unlike its main competitor the Commonsenior officials of that bank-h e is not, as I said, wealth Banking Corporation, that bank did not in a posiuon to criticise anyone.

Finally, this bank of which Mr Prowse is the Mr Prowse should have a look at a Uttle of the Assistant General Manager, because of the history, particularly the recent history, ofhis own severe Uquidity crisis it found itself in and beorganisation. Mr Prowse cannot, with this backcause it did not read the signs-the Commonground, be as he claims to be not politically wealth Bank and the Nauonai Bank did and they motivated. He is undoubtedly politically knew just what was occurring; they had the economic advisers on their staff to advise them and accordingly did not get any problems-ha d to go into the short term money market and borrow at rates as high as 18 per cent because its own liquidity margin had fallen below the 18 per cent traditional margin. In other words it was very fortunate that it could turn to the Reserve Bank, a central bank, an organisation whose original establishment it had opposed and which was, of course, the lender of last resort. If the Bank of New South Wales had not had the Reserve Bank-the bank whose foundation it originally opposed-as a lender of last resort the position would have been very serious indeed. In other words, had the bank been operating in that way in the days before the war the situation would have been very serious. For these reasons I do not think that Mr Prowse, as Assistant General Manager of the Bank of New South Wales, is in a position to criticise anyone. Basically he is a public relations man. That is how he got his move along in the Bank. He has not progressed because of any financial expertise. In view of the history of his bank in recent times and the very serious mistakes it has made in the management of its own affairs-and Mr Prowse is one of the very, very The Bank has not been able to respond to the ditions which exist throughout the world today.",95,Adjournment

Israel's life is threatened. But let us not forget that this small country of 3 milhon people, surrounded as it is today by a hostile world of 100 miUion Arabs, is a creation of the United Nations. In 1947 the United Nations, albeit much smaller than it is today, voted by a two-thirds majority to create the state of Israel. Now we have this thug addressing it and saying that the only way in wbich there can be peace in the Middle East is by the disintegration of Israel. Unfortunately in my own poUtical Party, the AustraUan Labor Party, there are a fewa very few-peopl e who are supporting people like Yasser Arafat. I mention the well known Mr Hartley from Victoria. I have a lot of respect for many of the things that BUl Hartley stands for, but I do not happen to agree with him one bit on this issue. I am ashamed that a man who says that he is a social democrat should be supporting these countries of which only one-the Lebanon-is remotely democratic. PerhapsI should also include the small Arab state of Bahrein in that. The rest are autocratic, totaUtarian regimes, whichever way one looks at them. Let us compare them with Israel, which has in its Knesset 14 poUtical parties. Despite the opposition from the communist countries, there are 2 members of the Communist Party in the Knesset. On the day on which Israel was attacked during the October War they stood up and denounced their own country. There was a bit of a punch-up over it. As Bob Hawke said: 'How bloody democratic can you get?' There were, at the last count, six to eight Arab members of ParUament sitting in the Knesset. There were 2 Deputy Ministers. There is a totally free Press. No country in the world is more of a trade union country than Israel. The Histadrut runs the health scheme. I forget the exact figure, but I think that SO per cent or 60 per cent of the housing and construction is done by the trade union movement. A democratic socialist party runs the country and has done since 1948-sinc e freedom. Which of the neighbouring countries-Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan-meet any ofthose criteria? Mr Hartley and Mr Arafat say: 'We want a free, democratic, secular state of Palestine.' That, of course, wUl bring considerable mirth if one happens to suggest it in Israel. If tries. They must be accommodated. I believe that one says 'free' one is asked: 'Free Uke which one? Like Egypt? Secular Uke Algeria or democratic like Iraq?' Whichever way one looks at it, I do not know how any person who calls himself a democratic socialist could possibly support people who have proven on the one hand that they do not practise any of the principles that we of the democratic sociaUst movement throughout the world or in a democratic country like AustraUa profess to support. So my criticism is not simply of BUl Hartley. My greatest shame is for the United Nations that it should drop to this level. saying about the United Nations and Arafat is right, but what does the honourable member feel about the United Nations' ban on South Africa in the General Assembly this session? ber for Murray about that on another night if he wishes. I do not happen to believe that any country should be expelled from the United Nations. Mr LloydI believe that to be consistent the honourable member would have to support both issues. issue with the honourable member at another time. I believed that the United Nations had a great role to play in world affairs, but I believe that this incident is just a forerunner to what will be ultimately an attempt to expel Israel. Why has the world done this? Is it because suddenly the world has been struck with a conscience about the Palestinian refugees? Do not make me laugh. The Palestinian refugees have been sitting there since 1948. Certainly we know that there was no sympathy for them among their own people because they were left there as a poUtical weapon to be used against the IsraeUs. Why did countries like Australia, Britain, Germany and all the other European countries abstain from a vote to prevent this gentleman from speaking? Why did all those European countries give him a standing ovation and vote to allow him to speak? For one reason and one reason only-oil . That is the reason why interest is suddenly being shown in the Palestinian refugees. If they are really concerned about people starving and suffering around the world, why do they not do something about those suffering in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and South Africa? I am one of those who believe that the Palestinian refugee problem is a problem which must be solved by the Israelis together with the Arab counthe Palestinians have a right. I believe that they have to have a homeland, a State of Palestine which can be called theirs. Again, time does not permit me to canvass that question.

In the remaining moments of this adjournment debate I wish briefly to express my complete and utter disgust at the action of the airline parents wUl be worrying about what is going to pUots in striking for 24 hours tomorrow. I am not concerned about the reasons for their strike or anything else Uke that. The inconvenience of such a strike to the public was exemptified on the last occasion they struck. Perhaps the reason why I feel so strongly about this matter at the moment is because I have been visited in Canberra by one of the schools in my electorate-the WUliamtown Primary School-and the 34 chUdren and 2 teachers who are making the visit wUl be stranded in Canberra tomorrow because of the pUots' strike. I have been critical previously of the unions and all other organisations that have struck on various occasions. I have said that they have shown a lack of responsibUity. At a time when this country is facing many problems, for the complexity of which we of the Opposition have been highly critical of the Government because of certain steps it has taken, this strike action by a supposedlyI use the word 'supposedly' advisedly-responsibl e body of men is, I think, one of the best illustrations of a lack of responsibUity by a group of people. Inconvenience will be caused not only to this group of school children which happens to have come to Canberra from my electorate, but also to many members of the travelling public, including businessmen. The other thing I would like to say is this: What example is this strike action to those youngsters who have come down to Canberra to have a look at Australia's capital city? They are not able to get back home tomorrow. Their happen and how they are going to get back home and when they are going to get back home. All of this has happened because of the irresponsibUity of this group of people who are in a position of so-called responsibUity. I want to say that the adrninistrative officers of Trans-AustraUa AirUnes have done everything they can to help. I am most grateful to them for that. As I said earlier, in the brief amount of time left to me I want to express my disgust at the action which has been taken by the pUots which has caused this inconvenience not only to those young people but also to many others in the community. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m.",99,Adjournment
