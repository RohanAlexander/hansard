Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5303 Monday, 16 June 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Budget: (1) does nothing for jobs-the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem; (2) squanders, by breaking the promise to introduce superannuation co-contributions, an historic opportunity to build a massive new private savings pool, and does so in a way that undercuts decent retirement incomes for lower and middle income earners; (3) continues the assault on families, the elderly and the needy; (4) contains many mindless and counter-productive cuts affecting the quality and decency of life in Australia, and harming our international reputation; (5) for all its cuts and destructive impact, did not meet the exaggerated expectations the Government had created as to the size of its deficit reduction achievements and projected future surpluses; and (6) has been characterised by even the Government's best friends as lacking in shape, direction and vision.' minds today are jobs and job security. This budget does not address either of them; in fact, it does the opposite. The Howard government came to office with a promise to make people 'relaxed and comfortable'. In its first 15 months it again has done the opposite. It steadfastly refuses to set an unemployment rate target and it has slowed down the rate of growth in the economy. This is a government without leadership. It is the lack of leadership from Prime Minister Howard that is helping to destroy public confidence and so generating insecurity. The fact that the Prime Minister refuses to set a target rate for unemployment highlights in the public mind that this government, with this Prime Minister, does not have sufficient confidence in its own policies or its own performance to risk setting a target. It is an 'us and them' budget. It does nowt for industry and nothing to generate jobs. It is a budget that will make life harder for the aged, the sick and the unemployed. They are the trifecta that has always been the target of Liberal-National Party governments-from the McMahon government's SOc per week increase for pensioners, to the Fraser government's attempt to abolish funeral benefits and impose a tax on newspaper boys' earnings, to this government's incredible strategy to solve unemployment by forcing 10,000 young Australians to work for the dole. Let us never forget that Prime Minister Howard of today was Treasurer Howard of yesterday. The legacy of Treasurer Howard that we inherited in 1983 was a $9.6 billion prospective budget deficit. If we take the deficit from that government's final budget before we came to",124,Adjournment That People With Voting Rights Could Not Be Made

247,Mr Peter Morris (Shortland) (8.01 P.m.),"The two most important matters in people's5304 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 power in 1983, as a proportion of GDP its equivalent in today' s terms would be $28.6 billion. We inherited, along with that legacy, double digit inflation running at 12 per cent. That level of ,nflation was exceeded only during the Korean war. We inherited double digit unemployment. We inherited what was, for the first time in 30 years, negative growth. That was the great achievement of the Fraser government: being able to turn almost 30 years of continuous growth into negative growth. We inherited interest rates of 20 per cent plus-interest rates and cash rates that have not been surpassed since. When we compare the record on employment, in our government's last year in office employment grew by 176,000. In the first year of this government. total employment grew by 89,000-half of the growth under the previous Labor government. Male full-time employment in Labor's last year in office grew by 57,000. In this government's first year. it fell by 12,600. The number of long-term unemployed fell by 45,000 in Labor's last year in office. In this government's first year in office, long-term unemployment has grown by 44,000. The Treasurer claims the budget is directed at helping families, boosting small business, creating jobs and encouraging saving. But the mantra and the rhetoric do not solve the problem, no matter how many times they are chanted. But let us turn to the rebate for savings, the so-called savings initiative. Scrapping the superannuation co-contribution scheme will mean that workers now in their mid-30s, on average weekly earnings, will each lose around $110,000 from the lump sum they would have received on retirement. We turn to the rebate for savings-a two-stage introduction. It does not do anything for anybody now. No-one would get one cent from this initiative until the second half of 1999 because the tax year is 1998-99 and the rebate will become available in 1999-2000. No-one benefits anything from that. It is a 71/2 per cent rebate from I July 1998 and a full 15 per cent rebate from 1 July 1999. The rebate applies to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings, with a maximum rebate of $450. From the Treasury example, the rebate will apply to the whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at five per cent. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have few, if any, constituents in my electorate who have $60,000 invested. A family able to put $5,000 aside for savings earning five per cent interest would receive a tax rebate of only 72c per week when the ultimate receive the full amount at the end of 1999-2000. This savings initiative will not assist savings. I tum now to the deferred pension bonus plan. For the life of me, I cannot understand why it has been defined as a pension bonus plan. This is really a proposal to reduce pension payments. It is not about equity or fairness for pensioners or people likely to receive pensions; it is about reducing outlays by the Department of Social Security. There is a bonus of 9.4 per cent of basic age or service pension entitlements for each year of pension deferral, up to a maximum of five years, implemented from July of next year. The deferral is possible if the person continues with gainful employment for at least 25 hours per week and it can be paid as a lump sum on pension take-up. The maximum bonus is $21,251 for a single person, or $35,450 for a couple. A single person would be foregoing some $51,000 of pension to receive a payment of $21,251 after five years, if he or sht, lives that long. We look at the great problem of unemployment in this country. A lot of attention is given to youth unemployment, and rightly so, but there is a terrible problem among mature age people. The mature age aJlowance helps address that in a way. It is the mature age Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5305 unemployed-those people 45 to 50 years of age and over-who are so demeaned by being unemployed, many of them for the first time in their lives. They are more likely to have liabilities, kids at high school, problems with moving and lesser mobility for moving to other places to find work than the young Australians have. They are the people who would fill the jobs that are created by those retiring at age 65. This proposal, the so-called deferred pension bonus plan, as I said, is aimed at reducing pension outlays. That proposal actually holds mature age people out of work, decreasing their opportunities to get employment. I define it as a 'work till you drop' plan. If you can keep going for another three, four or five years, and if you have not passed on, then you may be able to get the reward. For most it will be a short-lived reward. It denies job opportunities for mature age people who otherwise would replace retirees and it exacerbates Australia's unemployment problem. Those who benefit from this scheme are likely to be better off and they do not need help as much as young families. We turn to child care in families. This government is rich in rhetoric on families. They utter the words ad nauseam but they do not practise the policies that help families. The most important things for a family are an income and to have somebody at work supporting the family. The policies of this government are slow growth rates and increasing unemployment which damage families and family structure, as will the cuts to child-care funding-$500 million last year and another $321 million this year. That will reduce the number of child-care places available and the amount of non-work related care which is subsidised. The basic fact is that child care is being made unaffordable for a lot of Australian families. Parents have to pay more, whether it be for reduced quality of care or higher fees. Then we turn to the sick and to the increase in the cost of pharmaceutical benefits. The new drugs tax is based on drugs which have a similar clinical effect. It is very different from our government's initiative, which was based on drugs which have identical chemical make-up. The $500 million cut from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in last year's budget and another $700 million cut in this year's budget will worsen the burden upon people needing medical care. Australians will pay more for the latest, the safest and best medication. People will be increasingly forced to choose between the safest and the cheapest medication. That new system takes effect from 1 February 1998. It is going to be implemented against six drug groups for treating high blood pressure, hypertension, depression, cholesterol and ulcers. The government will only provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups. That increase in costs, and the pressure upon people to choose between the best and the cheapest, is going to cause a great deal of trauma amongst aged and sick people. Going to the other end of the age scale, there is the work for the dole scheme. Now, somehow, that is a brilliant scheme-I do not understand the government's mathematics, but they must be absolutely brilliant when we have got 900,000 unemployed people, 90,000 are youth unemployed, and they are going to solve 90,000 unemployed youth by forcing 10,000 to go to work for the dole! A lot of debate has already passed about that, and more will occur in the future, so I will not dwell upon it here. I want to compare that to the cuts in the federal Public Service. This government is railing against unemployed people and applying more and more pressure to them, in many cases for jobs that just do not exist. Those on the other side in this committee and on other side in the main chamber know that very well. They can go through the posturing, but they know deep in their hearts-the same as we know-that for most of those people the jobs are just not there, 5306 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 no matter how hard they search. In the Public Service, 12,600 jobs have already gone, with 16,500 more to go with the closure of the CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, mainly in rural and regional Australia. Add to that the 20,000 jobs to be lost from Telstra and another 8,000 jobs to go from Defence. And to each of those figures add the multiplier effect, which is at least 1--2 to one and up to two to one. My accounting friends in the accounting and financial advising business in the Hunter say to me that business is absolutely flat, that numerous of their clients have not seen business as flat as it is and has been for the past few months. On 24 May, 11 days after the budget, I attended one of the largest clubs in my electorate. They were just concluding the quietest week that club had experienced in the past 12 months. They are the hard facts; they are anecdotal, hut they are the hard facts that I find when I move around my region. So at the hands of the 15 months of hard labour under Prime Minister Howard, we see not only a downturn in growth and increased unemployment, hut a hopelessness, a growing insecurity and a lack of confidence. I want to say something about some of the individual members of the government. I will not name them, but I am sure other members in this committee will recognise them. This is an arrogant, uncaring government, from the Prime Minister down. It is a government devoid of leadership, a government that clearly does not understand the consequences of its decisions. Somebody said to me the other day, 'Well, you have got to understand that this government is like a dog chasing the car. It has caught the car; but, having caught the car, it does not know what to do with it.' When I watch some of the ministers perform in the chamber I can relate to that, I can understand that. Ministers are not across their portfolios. Ministers display an arrogance, and at times a pomposity, that I have never seen before in all my experience-and I have seen quite a few ministers. Ministers do not answer representations. When one makes representations on behalf of constituents, they are entitled to get a response; but, no, you do not get a letter. After quite some weeks-even months-you get an answer back from a thirdor fourth-level staffer, or some minor character in a department, but not a response from the minister. IfI make ministerial representations, that is what I expect and what I always practised. If a member or a senator wrote to me, that member or senator was entitled to, and demanded, a response from the minister-and they always got it. I did not have to agree with what they wrote, I did not have to like what they wrote sometimes, but I had a parliamentary and ministerial responsibility to ensure that that member or senator representing his or her constituents received a reply from me. That is not the case with ministers of this government. Let me turn to my electorate and the losses that are occurring in the Hunter and the central coast. Belmont CES is closed. Belmont Medicare is to be closed. Newcastle immigration otfice is closed. Swansea Visiting Service of the Department of Social Security is closed. Amalgamation of Charlestown Department of Social Security and Charlestown CES is in process. Add to that the centralisation of payroll facilities in the Department of Social Security, and understand it. All of those changes together mean that there are massive losses occurring across our region from federal public offices. The Newcastle area office of DEETY A, the area for which stretches from the Hawkesbury to Coffs Harbour and out to the west, is to be abolished and replaced by a state office. It is back to the old structure of eight years ago-a head office Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5307 in Sydney with a few troops and instead of there being 120 staff in Newcastle there may be 15 or 16. Those jobs in regional Australia generate other jobs. They are the jobs in regional Australia that provide tertiary employment, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know very well. They are the jobs that are sparse and much needed in regional Australia. Three hundred and seventy five jobs are going in the Hunter and central coast regions, in my electorate, from federal offices. You can add to that at least another 375 from the multiplier effect, and I am being conservative. That means a reduction in the quality of service to the constituents that I represent, and all of us represent, through that region. It means longer delays, more mistakes and poorer service. This is not the BHP closure, which is two years away; this is federal government abolition of jobs in regional Australia. It is hitting hard and it is hitting where it hurts most-the people who need those jobs in our communities. I ask the government to at least offset the damage it is doing in abolishing these federal jobs. I cannot change the government; they are hell bent on doing this. I am sure there are also members on the government side who are very unhappy about this-some of them will feel the sting of it a bit later. I ask the government to think of the people who live in those areas and to think of the small businesses that depend upon the trade from those people. I ask the government to ensure that the headquarters, payroll and staffing of the PEPE, the Public Employment Placement Enterprise, be located in the Hunter, to ensure that a new teleservice centre for the Department of Social Security be located in the Hunter, and to ensure that at least one of the payroll centres in the Department of Social Security, which is going to Parramatta-of all places-be located in the Hunter, and similarly with DEETY A and Tax. This will at least be some compensation for the jobs that are being abolished by this government. Similarly, I ask for the constituency used Medicare office at Belmont. This is a new office. It was opened in July last year at considerable expense. Its growth rate is 20 per cent and it is continuing to grow. Thousands upon thousands of people are going to be inconvenienced by the closure of that office. Already, almost 6,000 people have signed petitions and there will be many more thousands. I ask the Minister to think of those people-not of me, forget that I am a member of the opposition-and remember that he has humanity and that he has a responsibility to everybody in the community and not just to government members. I read that rural Medicare offices will remain and that Medicare offices further down the central coast will remain. They will not be affected. The petition for Belmont reads: Your petitioners request the House to require the government to ensure that Belmont Medicare office remains open. Similarly, I read that the Family Resource Centre at Wyong, which services my electorate, is to be closed. Its funding is to be cut out at the beginning of next year as a result of the government's decision to abolish funding for family resource centres. ITRAC at Wyong provides an excellent service across several electorates across all of the central coast. It provides information to services such as the legal centre and the Central Coast Tenants Advice Service. It provides for better preparation and coordination of services in that area-services at the grassroots level where expertise is needed by all of those voluntary organisations. I ask that that be allowed to continue. 5308 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at the budget, do not tum to me-I have expressed my view-but think about the pensioners and what they think of the budget. The June 1997 edition of Voice-the pensioners and superannuants publication-says: 1997 Budget Ignores Pensioners. Cuts to PBS angers older people. Savings rebate no use to most pensioners. 14 New South Wales Medicare offices close. They are all main headlines from the Voice. The editorial for the first one-'1997 Budget Ignores Pensioners' -states: THE 1997 FEDERAL Budget will severely impact on low income older people for the following reasons. It concludes: There is some good news though such as extra funds for carers and Home and Community Care. But the Government's main aim is to help middle to high income earners and business, leaving pensioners asking: What about us? Mr Deputy Speaker, you can add to that the drastic increase and cost of entry to nursing homes and the furore that that is creating amongst retired people across this country, and certainly in the Central Coast and the Hunter. People are demanding to know why this is being imposed on them at a time in their life when they are most vulnerable. They are asking why they are being saddled with this kind of impost. Where is the equity? Where is the fairness? It has been taken out of the system. I support the amendment that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gareth Evans). I have expressed my view about this budget. I have asked the government to have some thought also for the impact of gambling in this budget. (Time expired) Bill (No.1) 1997-98 and in doing so oppose with equal vigour the amendment moved by the honourable member for Holt( Mr Gareth Evans). I support the bill because this second budget of the coalition is a strategic part of the government's plan to help the families of Eden Monaro, to create real jobs, to boost small business and to encourage savings. It will also repay a fair bit of debt which, in itself, will translate into great benefits for the people of my electorate. The opposition has made a great deal of noise in relation to unemployment in this budget. In fact, the first part of their amendment claims that the budget 'does nothing for jobs'. Therefore, let me spend some time comparing our approach to reducing unemployment with the opposition's dismal record and their supposed solutions. We all remember the one million unemployed people of the early 1990s. They were unemployed as a direct result of Labor's recession we had to have, the recession purposely induced to overcome their high interest rate regime. I will come back to that aspect a little later. Labor finally got a bit concerned about the high level of unemployment and decided the way to solve this was to create the magic pudding called Working Nation. This magic pudding did not have threepences and sixpences in it, it had dollars by the millions. In fact, there were a couple of billion dollars. 'Spend, spend, spend,' they said, 'that will fix unemployment.' In my electorate of Eden-Monaro a few organisations were rubbing their hands together as these labour market programs were thrown around. I recall back in 1995 being told by a number of these organisations that they had been contacted by the department and told that there was all this money to spend so could they throw some sort of project together that the department could fund. Labor's solution was to write big cheques for programs that were short-",129,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (8.21 p.m.)-I want to vigorously support this AppropriationMonday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5309 sighted and that provided only very short-term jobs, after which they were thrown back on the unemployment queues. The opposition also claims that they created 700,000 jobs during this period. Their definition of a job was of someone being paid by the government to attend one of their labour market programs. If someone over a oneor two-year period was enrolled in, say, three or four of these programs then that was counted as three or four jobs. What a joke! That is not creating jobs. That is simply moving people off unemployment into government subsidised programs and then the government claims it has created jobs. What the then government created was a lot of artificial positions paid for by the taxpayer, purely and simply to get a reduction in the horrendous unemployment figures they were responsible for as a result of the recession we had to have. In the course of this absolutely wasted exercise, they spent a couple of billion dollars they did not have. If directors of a company had spent shareholders' money in that fashion, the directors would not only be sacked but they probably would also face serious charges. We all know that the taxpayers, being the shareholders, well and truly sacked the directors in March last year. That is the opposition's record on unemployment. Our strategy is somewhat different. Our first task was to get the economy back in order. We inherited a virtually bankrupt organisation. If the spending had continued at the same rate we would have been out the back door quick smart. I will touch on that overall spending regime for a minute. We all know that the budget we inherited was in deficit to the tune of $10.3 billion. What needs to be understood and remembered is that that went on for five consecutive years, but at a greater level. Budget paper No.1, at page 2-63, shows revenue and expenditure for all financial years going back to 196061. It makes quite interesting reading. It shows that in 1995-96 the overexpenditure was $10.3 billion, as I have just mentioned; in 1994-95, the overexpenditure was $13.1 billion; in 199394, it was $17.1 billion; in 1992-93, it was $17 billion; and in 1991-92, it was $11.5 billion-a grand total for the five years of $69 billion of overexpenditure. Those opposite say that that is okay because, as a percentage of GDP, it is nothing. That is nonsense! As a percentage of GDP, those overexpenditures represent 2.1,2.9, four, 4.2 and three per cent of GDP-an average of 3.2 per cent for the five years. Those opposite also make claims that they inherited a worse situation back in 1983. We have just heard the member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris) make that accusation yet again. But that is not so; he obviously cannot read. I was quite interested in his claim, and I took the time to look at some of the figures. Looking at the last five years leading up to Labor taking office in 1983, you will see a deficit of $3.1 billion in 1982-83, and a surplus of $0.5 billion in 1981-82. The budget in 1980-81 was balanced. There was a deficit of $1.2 billion in 1979-80, and a deficit of $2.3 billion in 1978-79. This gives a total deficit of $6.2 billion for the five years. Compare this with the $69 billion deficit for Keating's last five years. I do not think that there has been a ten-fold increase in the ensuing period. In fact, the overall budget went up by just over double. In terms of percentage of GDP, the average for the last five years of the Fraser government was 0.9 per cent-once again, substantially less than the 3.2 per cent of Labor's last five years. No matter how you look at it, the figures show gross mismanagement of the economy by the former government. 5310 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 As I have said, our strategy is somewhat different. Our first two budgets have gone a long way to rebuilding the foundations of our economy. We have seen already the benefit of this rebuilding in a substantial drop in interest rates. This has meant the equivalent of over $290 per month in savings on an average home mortgage of $100,000. There is nothing that any government could do that is more basic than helping families with their mortgages. The other great beneficiary of the interest rate drop is small business. Small business was decimated in the early 1990s with interest rates of well over 20 per cent. I remember paying 21.75 per cent on my overdraft in my business during that time. If ever there was a disincentive to invest, grow and employ, it was those exorbitant interest rates, and I knew it only too well. Small business interest rates are now down to around nine per cent. I would like to see them lower than that and, with the increase in competition, I think that will occur. These lower rates, combined with low inflation, sensible industrial relations laws and a reduction in red tape, are the four key elements which will help small business. These are the four things that small business wanted us to address before last year's election. They have all been addressed, with substantial improvement shown. But the benefit of those changes is still coming. As much as people want to see miracles overnight, the reality is different. Small business suffered so badly in the roller-coaster of interest rates under Labor that it is no wonder it is being cautious about investment. With interest rates steadily decreasing over the past year and inflation stabilised at less than two per cent, businesses are now feeling some confidence about the future, and the benefit of that confidence will come over the next 12 months. That process will translate into real jobs-not artificial ones, but real, substantial jobs. I will digress from my prepared speech in this debate to say that I have seen it very recently in my electorate at the Bega Co-op. Over the last year, the members of the co-op made the decision that they would invest $20 million in a packaging plant. They have increased their export of cheeses, et cetera, from nothing to $4 million worth of exports in the space of a very short period of time. The next big step is to do their own cutting and slicing and those sorts of things. They did not invest that $20 million lightly. They had to have the confidence that interest rates were going to be kept down so that they could afford to go into that investment and chase those overseas markets. It is a great investment for the lower south coast and it will probably generate something like 150 jobs in Bega over the next few years. Because those opposite have made such a noise about jobs, I read the contribution to the budget debate by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson), the opposition spokesperson on employment. As the member for Batman made so much noise, I thought that he would have something positive to contribute, but it was not so. He had absolutely nothing to contribute, except 20 minutes of whining and whinging. The only hint of what he would do was just what the Labor Party did before-more spending, more artificial jobs, more debt. The members of the Labor Party cannot get it through their heads that it did not work. The member for Batman and his mates have never created a real job in their life-and it shows. They do not know the feeling of risking savings, developing a business and employing people-and it shows. When I look at the waste that occurred between 1991 and 1996 and I think of how that government expenditure could have been used, I nearly despair. Those billions of dollars could have done so much good. Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5311 My electorate of Eden-Monaro could have benefited substantially if those funds had been directed towards good infrastructure projects instead of mickey mouse labour market programs. It would have taken only a small proportion of that wasted money to build a new port at Eden, to upgrade infrastructure that would have helped to get a softwood mill in Bombala, to accelerate the fast train proposal between Sydney and Canberra, and to improve the Princes Highway along the coast and into the mountains. My electorate would have moved along very nicely with projects like these if that government money had been directed in that way rather than in the nonsensical way that it was. These projects are the priorities for the people of Eden-Monaro. Recently, I contacted Bob Mansfield, who is working out of the Prime Minister's office and breaking down some of the bureaucratic barriers that are there to get major projects going. We have wasted time over the last five or six years in not getting into these areas. This is particularly so in the south east where the hardwood industry has been decimatedmore recently, by the Labor Premier of New South Wales who continually pre-empts decisions. He does not want to wait for scientific work to be carried out in the forests. He runs around declaring national parks before anybody has done all the studies. The industry is thus being decimated at a greater rate than it should be. We could have had these other projects in place if some of that government money had been spent in a sensible way on infrastructure. We will move on these projects and our budget will set the climate that will allow these types of projects to be addressed in the years to come. We will make sure that, when we have paid back some of the debt, that the money we have is directed towards job creation projects like infrastructure, and not artificial ones that move people off queues into short-term programs, back onto queues, and then take the credit for creating two jobs because they have been given two programs to deal with in the first six months or something like that. This is a responsible budget and it must be supported. Another sector of Eden-Monaro that had it tough under the previous government and was desperate to see a change was the rural sector. As well as being small businesses suffering under high interest rates, that sector, particularly on the Monaro, has had the added burden of drought-to the extent that we have never seen before on many properties. There are dams and springs that are dry for the first time in memory for long-time owners on the Monaro. Stock prices have been way down and many farmers have had to sell stock before winter really hits because they have no feed and cannot afford to buy it. These difficulties have been recognised by the government, who last year increased drought assistance and in this budget allocated $200 million over four years towards an integrated rural package. In recent days I have been able to meet with the minister and keep him informed of the situation on the Monaro and he will await any recommendations from the New South Wales state government, which is currently assessing the circumstances. Our government will be ensuring the farmers of Eden-Monaro are assisted to get back on their feet. Wool, sheep, beef and dairy products are major income earners for Eden-Monaro and I want to see them playa big part in Australia's growth. Further micro-economic reform will also be a priority in the coming year. Things like waterfront reform will be crucial to the increased exports of our produce. Markets are opening up every day. We have seen the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Fischer) spend a lot of time overseas since we came to government, and it has been well used time. We have seen tariffs coming down in many countries. There are trade-offs happening. People 5312 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 have this perception that we are knocking down tariffs in Australia and our competitors are not, making our exports harder, but it is not the case. We are having big wins in a number of areas. We have seen, in places like Mexico and India, tariffs on wool and other products coming down and we are really opening up new markets. Those sorts of new markets are going to be of great benefit to the farmers of Eden-Monaro, who have been the producers of some of the finest merino wool, sheep and beef. Our dairy products from the south coast are really becoming a major export item as they make inroads into the new markets. I mentioned the Bega Co-op before. I was told, only the other day, that one of the areas that they have managed to get their cheese into is the English market. Never before had another country been able to get a produce in under their own brand name. There are a lot of cheeses from New Zealand and other places that enter the English market, but they go in and they are shown as Sainsbury's or Tesco or something like that in England. We have now got Bega with that Bega brand name actually in the supermarkets in England. I think that is a great thing and there will be a lot more of it. In the savings area the opposition have really lost the plot. Everywhere that they look for examples, they try to say, 'Well, this is the situation and these people will not be able to take the benefit for the savings plan that they put in place in the budget.' That is the whole point, the country has not been saving because there has not been the incentive there. What this is all about is creating that incentive to save. One group of people in my electorate who will benefit substantially from this measure are the self-funded retirees. I have a lot of self-funded retirees down the coast who have contributed enormously to the growth of this country. They have done the right thing by planning and putting away for their retirement. They would have got nothing from the l-a-w law tax cuts that became superannuation under the previous government. They would have got nothing out of that. They get a great boost out of this savings plan. I think it is a start. I would like to see a lot more for the self-funded retirees, but it is certainly a substantial start for them, along with the other measures that we introduced in the budget last year. Our strategy is based on substance. It is based on creating the right circumstances for private enterprise-small and large businesses-to invest, to risk their capital, to find new markets, to grow and to employ. These are the strategies for the businesses, for the families, for the people of Eden-Monaro. for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is not preceding me because it was one of the reasons I thought it would be rather fun to speak on this budget debate. I say 'fun' because I think it is terribly important that people understand the simplistic nonsense that I find she is repeating around the country. Sadly, there are a number of people who are taking to her rhetoric and believing that, in some way, there is an alternative. I guess it is also unfortunate because, in looking at the budget and where we are going in Australia, a lot of people need to understand the world in which we live. I want to come from the world in which we live back to the budget itself in the few remarks I make. The first aspect is one that we are all conscious of but do not have much to do with, and that is the expanding membership of ASEAN and the importance of ASEAN as a group of countries to us and to each other. Beyond that, the only two countries of the world who have more than a billion people, who are just outside the borders of ASEAN, also impact enormously on us. Of course, Australia's closest trading partner, Japan, is also outside the",134,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Sinclair (New England) (8.40 P.m.),"I am disappointed that the honourable memberMonday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5313 world scene as we move into the 21st century. People generally, looking at the ASEAN countries, think that Australia is still much more important financially. We are obviously a more sophisticated country. We have remarkable economic capability, we have done reasonably well in education and people, rightly, look at our achievements and say that we are still, in many respects, a society which can be proud of where we are and look with confidence into the next century and know that we are still going to have an edge on many others. As I see the world, I do not think that is so. By looking at the world around us, I want to identify firstly, in economic terms, some of the problems that I think people like the member for Oxley tend to dismiss too glibly. In the seven members of ASEAN up until now, you would see countries with a GDP of about $750 billion. That GDP covers a population somewhere in excess of 400 million people. If you then move from the GDP of the seven to the GDP of the 10, taking into account the accession of Laos, Cambodia and Burma-or Myanmar-to ASEAN, you would find that the GDP has only been increased by $50 billion to $55 billion, but it still is somewhere in excess of $800 billion. The population base has gone up to towards the 500 million mark. Let us look at that before we start looking at that wider world. Australia has a very small population of 18 million. To think complacently that we can draw boundaries and ignore altogether the reality of that world indefinitely into the future is extraordinarily foolish. It is just not on. Whatever prejudices people might have, they need to understand that those Asian countries inevitably look on us as a fortunate country. Every time a new cargo of boat people-if you call people a cargo-arrives on our shores, it is partly a reflection of the same opportunities which for generations they have seen in the United States. Today they tend to see them in Australia. In any measure of where we go from here, we need to understand the realities of today, not just the aspirations of being able to close up barriers and live on the fat of the land and be happy forever after. That is not on. No longer can we look inwards. If we do not look outwards, our capability to survive as an independent nation, preserve our living standards and offer our children and our grandchildren the opportunities that we believe are ours, is going to be lower. That is the first fundamental. One needs to look to that world around us. If you go a bit further, some figures this week identified the GDP of a number of the individual regions of Japan. Some of you might have seen them. It really hit me that the GDP of the largest region-that around Tokyo-is greater than that of China, South Korea and Australia combined. That is not Japan as a whole, that is one small area around Tokyo. Not only does that small area have a GDP as huge as that, but it is also a region where intellectual endeavour is significantly greater than many see in Australia. While for years it was said that the Japanese were very good at imitating others' capabilities, today to say that of them would be to deny the incredible advances they have made in technology, in the silicon area, in computers, and generally in electronics. The whole capability of that one of the many regions of Asia is significantly greater than the GDPs of China, South Korea and Australia. There are, in fact, three major areas that are significantly greater than China and Australia. If you take the first five, they are some of the most significant economies of the world. 5314 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 Without going into the details of other countries with their population bases, the one thing that we really need to register is not just where they are geographically, but also the size of their relative growth. While many of us feel that Australia's economy is now coming out of the rough, in reality the opportunities in our region are such that most of those economies are growing at about twice the rate that Australia's economy is growing. So, while you can say that most of the Asian economies will be eight plus, Australia will have a parameter of four or thereabouts. It is in that dimension that I think we have to look at Australia's budget and the adverse consequences of the rhetoric of the honourable member for Oxley and those who support her. Within the Australian economy there are quite real difficulties, and I want to talk a little bit about the economy because I think it is important. The first thing we need to remember is that we have been fortunate to be now coming out of, if not quite a recession, very nearly a recession. Certainly, in housing it looked to be a recession in most states. If you have a look at the rural economy, the fact that we have recovered from drought, rather than any other factor, has been the main reason for this significant lift in incomes. It worries me, however, that behind those figures there is a lot of fundamental change. I want to come back to that because it is the fundamental change in where we are going that we need to be concerned about. The housing upswing is now under way, perhaps more in New South Wales and Victoria than in some of the other states. One of the worries I have about our savings policy is how fundamental housing has been to the whole economy. Every small business tends to revolve around housing. I know that for years the economists have said that we place too much emphasis on home ownership. I do not accept that and it worries me that we seem to no longer recognise how important it is for people to own their own home and how important that has been as a catalyst to economic growth and to the falling interest rates. This has been a significant part of the program this government has been able to facilitate that has enabled the housing sector to grow. Falling interest rates more than anything now are starting to see that housing economy revive and, to my mind, that is going to be the real catalyst to recovery. With regard to business investment, if you look at the 1996-97 business surveys, they suggest that business investment has risen 15.5 per cent nationally, and 15 per cent in New South Wales, with Olympic-related projects there only one factor in that growth. In other words, we are starting to see a significant turnaround in housing and in business investment. As far as employment goes, there is no better catalyst to change than that reflects. I felt sad that the budget was not promoted more than it was. I know that it is very difficult with so many other major issues about to keep concentration on a budget. For most people a budget is just another financial set of figures and they do not understand the impact it has. I know that some have said-and certainly the opposition was suggesting-that the budget did not achieve a great deal. I thought that was one of its successes. For too long we have looked for spectacular change year by year in our budget. I am one of those who has argued for years that we ought to try and start budgeting for more than 12 months. I think that we are at a disadvantage in Australia because we have this mind-set that every 12 months you are suddenly going to get a new set of numbers and move away from that. In that first budget we produced I would have liked to look at a three-year program. People would have seen that it did not have to change fundamentally every year, but that we were really moving to a freely identifiable and declared objective. Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5315 In fact, that is what this budget has done. It is not just a separate budget; it is part of the product of last year's budget and is moving in its fiscal outcomes towards the surplus next year from which we can operate. As we know we will move from an underlying deficit of $3.9 billion to a small surplus of $1.6 billion next year and a substantial surplus of $5.4 billion in 1999-2000. To my mind, that is a significant when looking at the longer term. What we have got to do to get Australia stable and developing again is to stop year-on-year changes. Spectacular policies might be all very well but spectacular policy changes do not give the stability that economic growth and job generation require. There is a belief that because the fellow next door is doing something else that we should do something else and that therefore we will be better off. In fact, that does not work. In government as in business. even though you might not like all the financial and economic programs that are in place, it is better to have constancy . You can plan and you can get better outcomes as a result. The other significant change under the coalition has been the level of asset sales. Over the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 the level has been lifted to a net expected return of about $15.9 billion and that is going to mean substantial headline surpluses and negative funding requirements. That is going to ensure that government debt will contract by more than $20 billion, from 19 per cent of GDP, to around $84 billion or 13 per cent of GDP by June 2001. The significance of that is that pressure on interest rates as the economy revives is going to be downwards. If we can keep interest rates down, above all else it is going to help those two sectors I identified before, business investment and housing. To my mind, more significantly than anything else, those are the two areas where you are going to get long and permanent job growth. That is why I regard this budget outcome as being significant. There were, of course, two new initiatives-the private savings policy and the indexation of the pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The private savings policy I regard as a worthwhile step. My concern for a long while has been that there has been too much emphasis given to superannuation. I do not agree that superannuation is the only way by which people should be encouraged to save. We ought to have far more flexibility. Of course we have to generate savings, nobody can deny that, but we have to ensure that savings are not in any single sector. I mentioned housing before. I think housing is an important part of savings. But so too is reinvestment by small businesses in their enterprises. So too are savings that are deposited in banks. To highlight one of the bete noirs that many of us have had about industrial super, I still find it absolutely impossible to understand how those who have small sums deposited on their behalf into a superannuation account at the end of the year are charged for the administration of that money. When I was a child, when we were all young, many of us had Commonwealth Savings Bank accounts. If you had a few dollars, in my days it was a few pounds, you were paid interest on the amount. Why can't those who have got use of your money pay you for the use of that money that they hold, albeit as superannuation. It has always seemed to me to be bizarre that that is not the case. I believe superannuation is not the only way that governments should encourage people to save and aggregate their money. But I wanted to go beyond that to look at the general direction of where we are going. The important thing is to look not just inwards but also to look outwards. There is no doubt that 5316 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 our export generated growth is going to be the most significant part of the changes I see about us. Changes brought by the World Trade Organisation are important. Breaking down those tariff barriers has been far more successful than it ever was. The initiative that Joe Dawkins, the former member for Fremantle and former Treasurer and Minister for Trade, introduced through the Cairns Group was probably one of the most successful initiatives in our recent trade history. I was one of those who battled over the years to try to get the common agriculture policy of the European Community and the export enhancement programs of the Americans countered. The Cairns Group for the first time brought together a very effective and ongoing group that has been able to battle against some of the price setting policies of the more powerful and affluent Europeans and Americans. I commend Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, for the efforts he has made because the Cairns Group has done an enormous amount to free up an area of our exports which is still very important. And as far as rural Australia is concerned, it continues to be important. It is the rural sector about which I want to express my principal concern. Commodity price volatility remains with us. We have had better access through the WTO, but we are still in a very difficult position. Wheat and sugar industries are in the process of tidying up their marketing arrangements. One would hope that, out of that, they are not going to destroy the very good market access that we have enjoyed. Sugar now has to compete far more than it used to, and the industry's technology gives advantage to the developing world. It is not going to be as easy to sell sugar as it is at the moment, and sugar prices remain volatile. It should also be noted that, if we are in a good season, we produce 20 million tonnes of wheat: in a bad season, the United States produces more than 150 million tonnes. We need to recognise that we export a great deal of our product-wheat, sugar, beef, wool, and increasingly mutton and lamb, and many other agricultural goods and produce. Our difficulty is that we still have no capacity in the rural sector to set the prices-in other words, to budget accurately ahead. It worries me, because out of that we have a serious defect in many of the family farming business operations around this country. I believe that the policies the government is putting in place in investment, small business and certainly as far as the rural sector is concerned, are on the right track. I am still very worried about the rural sector and price volatility. That is going to be one of the challenges that this government and state governments need to address over the course of the next few years. The thing that worries me most is that, if we are going to protect the small business sector, it is intellectual property on which we have to rely. Years ago Bob Hawke talked about the clever country. For years CSIRO research in the rural sector was a very important part of our being able to maintain our competitive edge. I am concerned that at the moment we are not giving the priority to research that I believe is necessary if we are going to maintain that competitive edge in the rural sector. Two things are important for the revival of the rural sector. It is not only volatile markets but what we do ourselves. It is not just production research, it is very much looking at the ongoing processing, the development of finished products, and the marketing of those goods. The big challenge for us in Australia is to make sure we look at the world around us, recognise where we are and, if we are going to be competitive in the future, spend more money on Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5317 research, individually and collectively, as a nation. We must maintain the CSIRO and its range of achievements, and we certainly must look at the marketing of our product. If we can maintain research and we can maintain assistance for marketing and promotion, then I believe we can overcome those problems of small business in the rural sector. If we do not, then I suspect, no matter how good the budget, we are going to have ongoing difficulties in employment and in aggregating savings and, above all, in being competitive in the world. If we are not competitive, I am afraid that the sorts of policies that the honourable member for Oxley proposes are likely to leave us in a very much inferior position for the future. Bill (No. 1) 1997-98, and to commend my government on a number of visionary and positive initiatives announced in our 1997-98 budget. I note that there has been some criticism from some sectors claiming that the budget is somewhat bland and boring. May I suggest that handing down a budget that meets all commitments without having to borrow a single cent, thus resisting the normal tendency these days of accessing bankcards, could be more appropriately called living within our means as a nation. I would call that being responsible. If dull and boring is being responsible and restrained, then so be it. What is even more exciting is the $1.6 billion surplus expected next year. We should really dwell on the significance of this achievement. In just three years since our election to government we will have gone from a $10.5 billion black hole deficit spiralling hopelessly out of control towards bankruptcy to an expected $1.6 billion surplus. For the benefit of those on the other side, we will not only be starting to repay some of our massive foreign debt but we will be able to again start expanding services to those most needy in our community. IfI may say so, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is quite an achievement. Clearly one of the best indicators of the success of the budget is the decision by the Reserve Bank to drop a full 0.5 per cent off official interest rates 10 days after the budget was announced. That is the fourth drop in interest rates that we have had since coming to office, and the significance is reflected in the fact that at this point in time our interest rates are the lowest since the 1960s. This means that the family home buyers are now paying $276 a month less for their average mortgage. In other terms, this represents a pay rise of approximately $400 a month before tax-not a bad effort for just over a year, and I have no doubt that things will get better. One of the most visionary aspects of this budget is, in my opinion, the introduction of the tax relief on savings rebate. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me paint you a picture. In this country two children of the same sex can be born of the same womb on the same day. They can experience the same family environment, be offered identical education opportunities and on leaving school be offered identical jobs at the same rate of pay. During the course of their working lives one of these twins saves his hard-earned wages; he may even take on a couple of extra part-time jobs. In doing so, he will miss out on much of the joy associated in seeing the growth and development of his young family. He forgoes personal pleasures, struggles with mortgages and loans for the betterment of his family but all the time he puts away just that little bit of extra money so that he will not be a burden on his family or the wider community when he reaches retirement age. The other brother has a different view. He likes to live life to the fullest-I guess some people would call that selfish. He drinks and gambles away his wages, goes on endless",138,Representatives Main Committee
250,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (8.59 P.m.),"I rise here this evening to support Appropriation5318 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 holidays and accepts no responsibility for his family. He is a real good-time guy, one who enjoys and indulges himself throughout life, but on retirement he finds himself with hardly a penny. There are no prizes for guessing who the bureaucracy will fall over to help, and I can assure you it will not be the Mr Responsible. But at last things are starting to balance out and the Mr and Mrs Responsibles of Australia, and all of those independent retirees who will definitely be included in this category, are finally starting to be recognised. An amount of $450 in tax savings does not sound much but to independent retirees it is very significant. Its application to the broad savings spectrum, from shares and debentures to trust incomes and interest, will enable these worthy citizens the opportunity to maximise the benefit. As I was saying earlier, moving into a surplus will give us an opportunity to expand on programs and this is one that I would be very keen to see developed further. It is a small start but certainly one in the right direction. The $1 billion Federation Fund is another great initiative. For years now successive governments have shirked their responsibilities to continue to upgrade national infrastructure. We are changing that. I must say that I have already moved to establish a Federation Fund committee in my electorate to ensure that we have maximum opportunities for accessing our fair share of this fund. There have been numerous other initiatives worthy of acknowledgment. The $18 million allocated for defence infrastructure in Leichhardt and a further $1.5 million for the Daintree buy-back as part of our commitment to the environment are just two good examples. Families living in remote areas will receive additional support through changes in Austudy. Children will be given greater opportunities for work through the modem apprenticeship scheme and the one-stop apprenticeship shop which recently opened in Cairns. I will address these initiatives and many others separately on later occasions, but on this occasion, however, I would like to focus on several issues which are of special importance to me. I have had a long interest in the area of aged care, disability and palliative care. In my electorate there is an enormous demand for these essential services. I am pleased that a number of reforms with respect to these important issues were announced in the recent budget. The national carer action plan, changes to the child disability allowance and further support for the aged and frail members of our community are welcome measures. I believe these measures will be particularly meaningful in rural and remote regions, which comprise a large proportion of my electorate. These measures alone will not resolve the acute shortage of beds in nursing homes and hostels, nor the lack of appropriate accommodation for people with disabilities. However, they are an indication of the government's recognition of the specific needs of people in the community and are a very significant step in the right direction. Firstly, I will raise the issue of carers. I must commend the government for significant changes announced in the Budget with respect to carers. These changes are very positive and will make a vast difference to the many carers who are giving their love, commitment and time to caring for people with disabilities. The $16.60 increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit-an increase of 28 per cent-will be of enormous benefit to many carers in my electorate. My only regret is that this measure will not come into effect until mid next year. The DNCB is paid to carers looking after people who would normally be in nursing homes or hostels if they were not being looked after at home. Keeping potential nursing home and hostel residents in their own homes longer makes a great deal of sense to me. It means they Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5319 are in a familiar environment where they feel comfortable and secure. It means less pressure on current facilities and a cost savings to government. Increasing the DNCB is therefore a very wise measure in my opinion. The carer payment of $347.80 a fortnight, which will soon be made available to carers of children under 16 with severe or profound disabilities, will also help many families in my electorate. The many parents who, up to this point in time, have not received recognition nor assistance from the government for caring for their children with severe disabilities will now not only have recognition but also assistance in real monetary terms. Parents, like carers, need assistance and support. Extending the carer payment to carers who are required to take care of an adult and that adult's child is also recognition of the fact that the work of many carers normally goes far beyond their call of duty. I note, however, that this positive measure will not come into effect until March 1999. This is almost two years from now and it means that there are many carers who will be missing out and that those who need immediate relief will not benefit. I feel this is quite regrettable. I am particularly pleased with the increase in the number of days of leave that carers can now access-up from 42 days to 63 days--without having their payments reduced or terminated. Considering the stressful, distressing and frequently physically exhausting nature of their work, carers could do with more time off. This is necessary just for them to recuperate and energise so that they can continue their work as carers more effectively for a much longer time. Without the threat of penalties, carers can now concentrate more fully on their work. I would go so far as to say that carers are the most unrecognised heroes in our nation. They are totally selfless. Interestingly, it is their compassion, commitment and generosity which best qualify them for the position of carers. They are very special people who do great and wonderful work in the area of caring. At this point I would like to bring to the attention of the House one such person in my electorate who lives up in Kuranda, just west of Cairns. His name is Norbert Waldo He has been a carer for well over 20 years and I believe deserves very special recognition for his work. For all those years he has cared for Mrs Elvira Berg and has also helped raise her two children. I must say that I was incredibly touched when I learned of Elvira's story. While still in her mid-20s, her and her husband were involved in a car accident. The car was driven by a gentleman who, while under the influence of alcohol, missed a red light and drove straight into them. Elvira's husband was killed instantly. Elvira herself spent a night in hospital. Unfortunately, the doctors did not pick up a blood clot and nerve damage. Soon after, she lost all capacity to move, to talk, and has been bedridden for over 27 years. Fortunately for Elvira, Norbert was found as a carer in her time of greatest need. His background as a hospital foreman meant that he knew the exact needs of Elvira and was able to accommodate them. His commitment and faith in the person he cares for, his generosity and selflessness are certainly very commendable. Changes announced in the budget relating to the child disability allowance are, I believe, also a step forward. However, caution needs to be taken to ensure that unnecessary draconian assessment methods do not develop that would prevent families who rightly deserve assistance from being eligible for it. The notion of more reliable and simpler methods of assessing eligibility for the child disability allowance is, I believe, reasonable. I am pleased that the 5320 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 inclusion of a list of manifest and chronic medical conditions has been made which will enable families to fast-track access for the child disability allowance. I believe the measures introduced in the budget with respect to the child disability allowance are generally very positive. It is particularly pleasing to know that the government recognises the sensitivities involved in and the special needs of families who have a child or children with disabilities. I am sure that those families who are already receiving the child disability allowance and those who will be receiving it at the end of June 1998, will be relieved to know that they will continue to receive payments until 30 June 2003, without being subject to further medical reviews during this period. Few families will mind reverting to the new assessment system at the end of this period. I note that the new child disability allowance applicants who do not qualify for the benefit under the new table assessment system but who have a chronic medical condition will qualify for the health care card. This will assist in meeting the costs of medication and will benefit families in my electorate. I believe this measure could easily be adopted in other areas as well, particularly where it concerns people who are on low incomes, part-time workers or self-funded retirees on modest incomes who are not eligible for the health care card but who clearly need one. I urge the government to consider this seriously. I note that an allocation of over half a million dollars has been made to support the elderly members of our community who suffer from dementia. I am particularly pleased that $19,000 of this money will go towards the Cairns aged care assessment team. This assistance will enable the team to retain and further expand the psychogeriatric services currently provided in the Cairns area. The Cairns aged care assessment team plays a vital role in the recognition of signs of dementia and the assessment of respective needs. Although $19,000 is very much welcome, it is nowhere near enough to meet our current needs and more needs to be done in this area. Palliative care is an area which I also feel very strongly about. I cannot help but think of the issue of euthanasia when the pros and cons of palliative care are debated. Many of you I am sure would be aware that I voted against the Kevin Andrews private members bill which overturned voluntary euthanasia in the Northern Territory. I take this opportunity to remind the chamber that I voted against the bill not because I am pro-euthanasia but because I am enormously concerned about the federal government's interference in state and territory internal affairs. I was particularly concerned on this occasion as I was very much aware that approximately 85 per cent of Northern Territory residents voted for the euthanasia legislation in their territory. In light of this majority, I do not believe that our government had the right to overturn the people's will. I must say that, in overturning the Northern Territory euthanasia laws, the federal government must now look more closely at the issue of palliative care with the view of seriously addressing the current shortcomings. The allocation in the budget of $14.7 million for palliative care is a positive step in the right direction. However, I am convinced that this is nowhere near enough to meet current needs. I cannot help but feel that this allocation will only scratch the surface. I am also very firmly of the view that the Northern Territory legislation had nothing to do with a community hellbent on killing less fortunate citizens. It was more of a cry for help out of sheer desperation in seeing their citizens dying slowly and, in some cases, very painfully, due primarily to an Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5321 almost total lack of palliative care funding. I personally believe that once appropriate palliative care is made available, the call for euthanasia as an option will greatly diminish. In closing, let me say that this budget is one that is finally starting to remove the blinkers. It is one that shows that we have a government that is capable of lateral thinking and is not prepared to continue to offer bandaid solutions. It is a government that is looking to establish new and innovative ways of dealing with age-old problems, and one that is finally starting to get its priorities right. It is going to go some way to identifying, supporting and rewarding the most needy in our society, as well as those who are, without doubt, the most worthy. I am confident that with continued successful financial management, we can continue to grow and further develop those essential programs. I commend this bill to the House. I must say that this government is to be congratulated on the second budget in our first term. I notice, as an aside, that the Labor Party has dropped out of this debate. By their absence, in dropping off the speakers list, they are doing one of two things: they are either endorsing without criticism this appropriation bill; or they are showing that they have lost interest. I think it is probably the second. The debt inherited from the previous Labor Keating-Beazley government has been significantly reduced. This budget has Australia paying off $5 billion worth of Beazley's bankcard debt, without having to raise taxes. That is in this current second budget. Not only has this government been able to reduce the debt in its second budget, but also the next budget will produce a surplus-the first surplus for a decade. We should be congratulated for that. This government is getting us out of debt, and the people of Australia are benefiting from this. If anybody knew before the last federal election what debt was, it was the Australian people. The Labor Party, though, is trying to convince us that this budget contains many mindless and counterproductive cuts affecting the quality and decency of life in Australia. This is not what the people of Australia think. The people of Australia are experiencing low inflation and low interest rates. Again, as an aside, I remember the scuttlebutt saying that if Keating could have got interest rates down, he would have gone in November rather than March 1996. Families under Labor were struggling to pay their mortgages in the early 1990s because of high interest rates. They are now experiencing the benefits of this government's responsible financial management. In 14 months, the coalition government has presided over a reduction of interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 6.99 per cent. An average family on a mortgage of $100,000 will now be at least $275 a month better off. That is better than any wage rise. This is a real achievement for the battlers of Australia-John Howard's battlers. I know that many families and individuals in Swan have mortgages around this amount and they will benefit from this. You can really convince people when you talk about their wallet. The member for Dobell( Mr Lee) says that interest rates are down because unemployment is up and the economy is flat. If the member for Dobell had just hung on, he might have remembered that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the Hawke and Keating governments, not only was unemployment high but interest rates were up around 18.5 per cent in some sectors. Debt was high and the economy was in a lot worse shape than it is in now. Small business interest rates were around 26 per cent in the late 1980s. That is what the Labor Party did for small business.",143,Representatives Main Committee
251,Mr Randall (Swan) (9.17 P.m.),"In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98,5322 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 There was a slowdown in the economy last year, but there is evidence of a pick-up in the economy now in the form of investment figures, lower interest rates and increased housing starts which will ultimately feed through to the labour market. We are in a process of correcting the unemployment figures. It cannot happen overnight unless we are irresponsibly throwing money around like the previous government did. I believe that in the next year we will see the gradual improvement result in better employment figures as well as a managed economy. Labor is trying to convince us that this budget continues an assault on families, the elderly and the needy. Under this budget, carers who stay at home to look after an elderly relative or child with a disability will receive a long overdue increase in domiciliary nursing care benefits and an extension of the carer's payment. Approximately one-third of my electorate of Swan is aged and I know that this is going to assist many of my constituents. Labor is trying to convince us that this budget does nothing for jobs, the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem. One hundred thousand new apprentices will get a boost from the $265 million that has been set aside to create real jobs. There is $50 million to expand vocational education in high schools, $24 million for new national network apprenticeship shops and $20 million to help disadvantaged unemployed people gain an apprenticeship or trainees hip. The $1 billion Federation Fund will create jobs next year when the projects commence to mark the federation of Australia. Australians will be involved in building projects of national significance to commemorate the federation of Australia, and so we should. This $1 billion is not a training scheme, it is a tangible project which will support construction, infrastructure projects and their associated industries as well as providing the spin-off to employment. These are all measures directed towards reducing the level of unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment. It is quite ironic that in my seat of Swan, before I was able to take over from the previous member, who was also the minister for unemployment as I like to call it, Kim BeazleyMr Eoin Cameron-Thank God you took it. an absolute disgrace and the former minister, Mr Beazley, should be indicted for it. older sector, actually. There is going to be $21.6 million for the work for the dole initiative which will, importantly, enable people to get back into the community. As anyone who has been long-term unemployed can testify, they start to feel removed from the ordinary everyday association with their peers, et cetera, if they are long-term unemployed. It is a well-known fact that once you are in the employment sector it is far easier to get a job with the networks that you create. This work for the dole scheme will break the damaging cycle of unproductivity, isolation, low self-esteem and health problems which many unemployed people experience. In my own electorate of Swan approximately 7,000 people currently receive the newstart allowance, the allowance paid to longer term unemployed people. These are some of the people that the work for the dole scheme will assist.",147,Representatives Main Committee

254,Mr Randall,"It is well below the percentage that he had. It has been taken over by theMonday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5323 But the Labor Party would rather be obstructive and complain about the goven:ment's initiatives and our attempts to put some hope into the lives of the long-term unemployed than do something constructive. Their proposed amendments to the work for the dole bill only highlighted the ALP's inability to do anything without their union mates' say-so, and that is because their union mates are running their agenda, and we know that. Just have a look: you have got Bob Hawke, former ACTU president; Simon Crean, former ACTU president; Martin Ferguson, former ACTU president; and Jenny George, who tried to get a job on the Senate ticket. It is a retirement village for former ACTU presidents. The Labor constituency should be quite cynical about their motives. The ALP is concerned that the work for the dole scheme will introduce even more people into the work force who are unaccustomed to union interference; in other words, people who are self-reliant and self-motivated. The ALP knows that there will be safety nets in place for work for the dole. They know that work for the dole participants will not replace those in existing jobs. The ALP knows that there will be occupational health and safety regulations and other conditions to ensure the participants are properly treated. In fact, a nice newsletter from Cables Downunder says that in Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s Depression, as a part of unemployment relief, councils applied for funding to underground all cables, as part of the work for the dole scheme, so it has been around for some time. Poor Kim Beazley! He is faltering in his leadership. He has Simon Crean looking over his shoulder, and the member for Holt( Mr Gareth Evans) would not mind being king in this House because he did not go too well in the other one. Mr Beazley is trying to find something to remind him of the old days of Labor. He would like union interference in the work for the dole schemes, just as he supported union interference in the recent strikes in Western Australia. In fact, Kim Beazley is a disgrace when it comes to supporting Western Australia. He is anti Western Australia. He supported the previous blockade in 1993 or thereabouts, and he also supported the current union action in Western Australia. In fact, he was up at their so-called workers' embassy, encouraging them to continue. The power shutdown alone cost the state of Western Australia $100 million-totally endorsed by Kim Beazley. In fact, unionists who were not providing services were saying, 'This is not a strike; it is a protest.' What is the strike about? What is the reason for 25,000 people marching up St George's Terrace in Perth? What is the reason for the extraordinary scenes of abuse and aggression at Parliament House in west Perth, preventing members of parliament from entering the House to carry out their duty? It was an absolute disgrace to see the former President of the Upper House of Western Australia being barred from getting into his own House by a bunch of union thugs-quite reminiscent of what happened to this House last August when the world as we knew it was going to end because of the current budget and the current legislation. They smashed the front door down, dragged the female federal police into the crowd and kicked the living daylights out of them. What has this legislation done, other than improve the lot of unionists and workers in Australia? They do not want secret ballots. I go through a secret ballot when I get elected, and most of us go through a secret ballot. What does the Labor Party with their union mates have to fear from secret ballots'? Nothing other than accountability.",148,Representatives Main Committee
255,Mr Sawford,"Is he a friend of Crichton-Browne?5324 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 Australia, was asked by Channel7 News on the evening of the strike why the unions were striking. What was his explanation? Secret ballots. They do not want secret ballots. They want to see these blokes stick their hands in the air because they know that, if they vote against them, they will cop a visit and some sort of retribution. They do not want these people to have their democratic right of voting without encumbrance. As complex as he tried to make the explanation, Tony Cook said nothing more. He just kept on about secret ballots. We knows why the secret ballots are not an option for the union, because they want to be able to manipulate and control their members by eyeballing them, knowing who does not do it, and turning up and standing around their families. The unionists have been very active in letters to the editor columns in this campaign by asking that, if the parliament thinks secret ballots should be mandatory for unions and workplaces, why they are not so for parliamentarians. Where is their logic? How do they arrive at such a ludicrous, unrelated suggestion? The fact of secret ballots is, alone, hardly a reason to react to the Western Australian Industrial Relations Amendment Bill in the way that some Western Australian workers were incited to react-the bill to which Kim Beazley is so vehemently opposed.

Another part of the bill that the ALP unionists held the state to ransom for was the point of political expenditure. Why should my wife, who is a schoolteacher and chooses to be a member of the Western Australian Schoolteachers' Union, have to compulsorily contribute her union dues to be used as a fund for the Australian Labor Party and eventually used against me at the next federal election? My wife's own salary being used to fund an election against me: it is wrong. She should have the optionyou silly man! Western Australia. It is totally wrong to use the funds of conservative voters to vote against the people they want to support. The act now ensures that members of unions will be able to direct their political donations to the political party or candidate of their choice. They will be protected from having their moneys applied to political purposes without their consent. This is the type of legislation that the member for Brand is against. It is why he incites Western Australians and the ALP disciples to become abusive and aggressive, so that they smash down this House and smash down the Western Australian parliament. That is their only way of trying to make their point. I think you turn the public against you when you start smashing up the democratic institutions of Australia. No wonder the member for Brand is so frustrated! He has got the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) sitting in his dad's old seat-the safe Labor one that he really wanted.

I say to the member for Brand, 'You have got no hope of getting Fremantle, even if Carmen does not keep going there.' Why put the member for Brand into the seat of Fremantle? How do you tum a safe Labor seat into a marginal one? You get Kim Beazley, the current member for Brand, to run for it; he will run it down to a very narrow margin.

We are talking about political corruption-doesn't she want to have a look at that? Commissioner Kenneth Marks ruled that Dr Lawrence was untruthful about her involvement in the tabling of the petition. The sad part about all of that is not that the member for Fremantle hurt herself but that she hurt honest people like the former state health minister, Keith Wilson, whom she vilified. A former state transport minister, Pam Beggs, stood up at the royal commission and said that it was not true. But Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle, could not remember.

The budget impacts on, and assists, those small business initiatives announced in the March budget last year. A small business innovation fund of $120 million to the Commonwealth to commercialise technology ideas, capital gains tax exemption on retirement, and simplification of record keeping are all benefits for small business as well as a single entry point and common licences to help small businesses when they are dealing with governments. What will complement those initiatives even further is the opposition's acceptance of the workplace relations exemption regulations, which propose to exempt small businesses. We can expect continued obstruction from the Labor Party. We know that you are trying to stop businesses with under 15 people from being exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions. I really hope that you continue to stop it, because I would love to go to a double dissolution on native title and the Wik decision, on the unfair dismissal provisions, and on work for the dole. I would increase my majority and I would be very happy to do so. We know that, as far as unfair dismissal goes, Labor originally supported this and recognised it as an incentive to employ younger people in particular. But this legislation is currently in the Senate where the ALP and the Democrats do not support anything unless there are millions of taxpayers' dollars attached to it. They want to throw money at it and, in this case, it is not going to happen. As I say, I hope it becomes a trigger. I do not for a moment deny that there are some unscrupulous employers-I mentioned this in the House today-who would unfairly dismiss staff. But, realistically, employers have nothing to gain by going through the lengthy selection process, spending time and money training new staff, allowing them to develop into productive employees and then dismissing them and doing it all over again.

With home loan interest rates now below seven per cent, they decided it was too good an opportunity to miss. Just nine years ago, as a Brisbane city councillor, I had constituents crying over my desk that they could not pay their rates because under Labor their mortgage interest rate had rocketed to 17.5 per cent. Now, thanks to this budget and the 1996-97 budget, interest rates are at their lowest level since 1972. To most this means a cut in mortgage payments of around $292 a month-far more than any union-delivered wage increase. You do not have to have a degree in economics, or even a vague understanding of the finances of the nation, to recognise the impact on the community of these changes.

273,Mr Mcdougall (Griffith) (9.37 P.m.),"Last week two of my young constituents toldMonday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5327 Australia: a savings rebate to encourage saving. A rebate of 15 per cent on up to $3,000 of savings, which includes personal superannuation contributions, will give people a motive and a profitable reason to save. Since this government was elected, we have seen a lowering of inflation. This is of benefit to all Australians, including independent retirees. When your income is limited or fixed, spiralling inflation means rising costs of goods and services while low inflation means more for your money. Anyone who does not understand this should try buying a cup of coffee in Tokyo, where you will not get change from $10, or take a trip to Zaire, where inflation is now running at 600 per cent. Four years ago, a traveller received three Zairean dollars for an Australian dollar. Today you get $162,000 Zairean dollars for one Australian dollar. Our cost of living is, in my opinion, still far too high. It is, again, a legacy of 13 years of Labor government. It is now obvious to even the most inexperienced punter that this budget is leading us well on the way to financial recovery and therefore to social recovery. Social recovery will also come with a change in attitude. After more than a decade of untargeted immigration, handouts to any group who knew how to make enough media noise and a second generation of people with no expectations of jobs, urgent and dramatic changes had to be made. Firstly, let us look at the emotive issue of immigration. Despite the claims that we are being discriminatory by making changes to the concessional family category, the feedback I am getting from my electorate of Griffith has indicated strong approval for this move. Our new course in family reunions is one which most other countries have always adopted, with a focus on immigrants who have skills. As much as we would like to be a country of plenty, the taxpayers of Australia are hurting and simply cannot afford to sponsor migrants who have to be supported for several years after their arrival. It is just as important for the families of immigrants that those who come to join them and live in our country also have jobs. When we came into office we inherited a migration program dominated by the family stream which represented almost 70 per cent of the program. The previous government had simply opened the gates. Little or no serious consideration had been given to the impact of entry of persons with low skill levels and little or no ability to speak English. A respected member of my Chinese business community expressed her concern at the number of Chinese who had trouble finding work and assimilating due to their inability to speak, read or write English. She also told me that she knew of immigrants who chose Australia simply because, as she said, 'It was the easiest country to get into'. This government is restoring balance and integrity to our immigration program. Our goal is to make life as easy as possible for those who make Australia their new home. Our measures are consistent with taking responsibility for not only the future of those immigrants who have settled here, but also the new arrivals. If this is being discriminatory, as the opposition so loudly proclaims, then I suggest that their concerns are more for votes than the well-being of this country. Our priority lies with the reunion of migrants entering as the spouses or children of Australians. Parents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles can apply on their own merits and if they qualify, will be welcomed. By introducing a two-year waiting period for social security benefits for migrants, we have redirected a substantial amount of welfare dollars into the community. 5328 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 It must be noted that this government has a commitment to skilled and business migrants who, we all know, benefit the economy and create jobs for Australians. Those of my constituents who look closely at this government's employment program will see that we are not focussing on shuffling funds by moving people off the dole onto the endless and often pointless training schemes. This was the cycle for the unemployed as established by tilt; Keating government: off the dole to reduce the figures; onto a training scheme with a marginal chance of a job at the end, and then back on the dole. A young man who came to my electorate office to have his CV photocopied had done six courses during the year, including a six weeks course in panel beating. I ask this House: who would allow a person with just six weeks training to start knocking dents out of their car? I am not alone when I say that I get many calls from constituents complaining that they have a job available but cannot find anyone with enough basic skills. A local builder told me two weeks ago that he had more work than he could handle and desperately needed to hire another three carpenters. He said any good carpenter was as busy as he was. He was now having to knock back work because he could not find anyone experienced enough to hire. This brings us to the $265 million in this budget set aside for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for the next year. Employers cannot afford to train young people without assistance. This bill introduces a $1,500 completion payment for employers whose apprentice or trainee achieves Australian qualification framework level 3 competency. In other words, we are training young people in jobs. Then there is the work for the dole pilot scheme, with funding of $21 million. This is not a shuffle off the dole scheme; this is giving people on the dole the most important thing they can achieve-that is, a work ethic-while placing them with a team to work at a real job, one that is of value to the community and therefore of value to the participant. I do not need to remind anyone of the demoralising effect of being unemployed. This can lead to the belief that you are unemployable. We can and will tum this around with our school to work strategy which has already been piloted in Queensland with great success. We also have introduced our Green Corps program, which creates training for people in one of the most important areas-the environment. People joining the Green Corps are working alongside environmental specialists and learning skills that are vital not only to the future of this planet and our nation but vital to the immediate community in which they live. I remind the House of the $1.25 billion in this budget to fund the Natural Heritage Trust over six years. The government was opposed tooth and nail by the opposition and minor parties in establishing this fund-the largest restoration program for our environment. Besides its vital importance to restoring our rivers, vegetation and land, this massive injection of funds will create employment. This bill makes it clear that this government is establishing the environment for jobs and training for young people from the moment they leave school, not after they have spent years losing confidence as they queue for the dole. The opposition and many politically motivated groups in the community are demanding faster action in creating jobs. This government will not create illusory jobs. This government is establishing a sound foundation for industry to create jobs-real jobs with lasting benefits. If the previous government looks at its own track record in my electorate of Griffith, there is a major area where jobs could have been created but this has been ignored. Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5329 I take you back to when the federal government, in consultation with the state and local government in Brisbane, set about upgrading Brisbane Airport and the Brisbane port. The port, at great expense, was moved to the mouth of the river at Fisherman's Island. The federal government committed funds to these two major projects, as well as funding for a national gauge rail line running from Acacia Ridge to the port. This was completed in November 1994. This grand plan was known as the gateway strategic plan, an initiative by the then Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson. This was a plan for industry along the Brisbane River from Colmslie to Moreton Bay. The region along the northern corner of my electorate is well-positioned to take advantage of this strategy and we looked to receive major investment from the commercial and industry sectors. Industry would create not only construction jobs but long-term employment. After exhaustive public consultation a regional strategic plan known as SEQ 2001 was evolved, which included the gateway strategic plan. I point out all of this because it shows just how much work and planning went into creating the infrastructure to encourage industry in the suburbs of Colmslie, Cannon Hill, Murarrie and Gibson Island, all of which are in my electorate. This strategic plan has gone into stagnation. I look at the rail line, the port, the airport and the arterial road, and ask the same question as my constituents: what happened to the promised jobs? I can tell them what happened at least to the last 200 which were promised by BHP. Last year the Brisbane City Council refused approval for BHP to establish a $160 million steel plant right in the heart of the area earmarked for such industry. I investigated the project. It fulfilled all criteria. It was knocked back purely for political expediency-and with it went 200 construction jobs and over 70 permanent jobs. With signals like that from Labor's Brisbane City Council, it is no wonder industries pack up and leave Australia, taking their jobs with them. This government has shown, with its first and now with its second budget, that we pay our bills before we throw taxpayers' money around for political gain. The changes created by this budget are establishing a sound foundation for Australia to redirect its focus on work opportunities, to retrain young school leavers and to pave the way for employers to hire apprentices. This training is for jobs which exist. We are creating an environment for savings as this budget establishes for the first time a savings plan for all Australians. It is very easy to swing a cudgel to make holes in the budget strategy as laid down by this government, but the facts and figures are there. This government has stopped the endless flow of dollars from the pockets of Australians. By the end of this next term, John Howard will have put this country back in the black. But it is more than dollars in the bank-this government has a social policy to match. We are changing the attitudes of two generations brought up to believe that the government was an employer. We have set in motion aged care reforms to tackle the urgent, if not critical, need for reform in the nursing home sector. The opposition can rant and rave about the introduction of accommodation bonds, but they cannot alter the fact that the nursing home sector is in crisis. The Labor Party cannot deny that our senior citizens, who are in need of special care, have been ignored. The Labor Party cannot deny that our nursing homes are having trouble keeping afloat and that many are unable to provide adequate care and facilities for their residents. The Labor Party argues that we are not putting enough money into the nursing home sector. Funny about that; it had been busy taking it out. The Keating government reduced capital 5330 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 funding to nursing homes from $200 million in 1989-90 to just over $10 million in its last year. We have not only introduced accommodation bonds as a capital funding program for nursing homes, but also increased the government subsidy for dementia care by 30 per cent. We have redirected funding for child-care assistance to increase the number of low-income families able to qualify for assistance from 19,000 to 51,000. There has been relative silence from the opposition on this budget reform, but I am not surprised. Under the previous government, non-working parents were receiving 50 hours of taxpayer funded child care per week. This has been reduced to 20 hours. We have acknowledged that non-working parents who are studying or looking for work do need child-care assistance, maybe for up to 50 hours a week, and we have also increased assistance for those using outside school hours care. This is a government which has produced a budget for economic and social growth, and I support this bill. Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98, the 1997-98 budget, together with the estimates for the coming years. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) for putting together a document that not only meets the requirements of our nation today but, more importantly, meets the requirements of our nation in the period leading up to the next millennium. This budget is clearly focused on improving Australia's savings record. It is clearly focuseu on providing a stable economy in which business can grow and in which business can develop. Up until now there has been a growing tendency in government budgets to focus on issues that seem to please the electorate as opposed to budgets that focus on issues that are good for the electorate. There is a fundamental difference, of course. It is easy to envisage the Treasurer coming down the flagpole of Parliament House every budget with a bag full of goodies like Santa Claus and delivering a lot of goodies to people in the electorates and to businesses. I will remind the House that North Sydney, in my electorate, is the third largest business district in Australia. I discussed the budget with some of the 36,000 small businesses in my electorate, which is a very large figure, and with many of my 125,000 constituents. I encountered a disappointing response in all those discussions and that was, 'What's in it for me'? What do I get out of the budget?'. I have called it the Santa Claus phenomenon. Santa Claus comes twice each year to the Australian people-once on 25 December and again when the federal budget is announced. We have to change that attitude. It is a very difficult change to incorporate into the Australian ethos. It is very difficult. It is difficult when you have the New South Wales Carr government promising to give the parents of every school kid a cheque for $50 at the beginning of the school year just because the kid turns up to school. It does not matter whether they go to Newington or whether they go to Mount Druitt High, they get a cheque for $50. It is classic middle class welfare. Even worse, the Keating government introduced the pregnancy benefit. if you like. Every woman who had a baby was to receive a cheque in the mail for $200, and that was meant to ease the pain. It was not means tested so, in effect, it was a new form of middle class welfare. My response to that is that we cannot have middle class welfare at a time when we are trying to change the attitude in Australia so that people must rely on themselves for their future and save for their future.",152,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Hockey (North Sydney) (9.55 P.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on theMonday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5331 Too few Australians would be aware that every week 7.5 million Australians expect a Department of Social Security cheque. That includes age pensioners who are, of course, in many cases, deserving of their age pension. That is 1.673 million people. In addition to that there is family tax payment; farm household allowance; mature age allowance; mature age partner allowance; Newstart allowance; Newstart mature age allowance; parenting allowance; partner allowance; rehabilitation pension; sickness allowance; sole parent pension; special benefit; widow allowance; widow's pension; wife pension; youth training allowance; bereavement allowance; carer pension; child disability allowance; disability support pension; disability wage supplement; disadvantaged persons scheme; double orphan pension, and so on. When is it going to stop? When will people stop expecting that they are going to get some form of benefit? There are 7.5 million Australians who expect a Department of Social Security cheque. Not for one second would I deny those who need help a helping hand, not for one minute, not for a second, because if people deserve then they deserve it. But 7.5 million Australians are not deserving of Department of Social Security support. There are 7.2 million Australians that are paying taxation and of the total budget of $133 billion. $53.4 billion is spent on welfare. Over 40 per cent of the budget is spent on welfarehealth, $20.7 billion; education, $11 billion; defence, $10.4 billion; economic services, and that incorporates repayment of our national debt, $8.3 billion; general services covering administrative services and a range of functions in support of the other areas, $6 billion; and of course payments to the states, $17 billion. That payment to the states is supplemented by the states' own taxation system, which roughly accounts for $33 billion around Australia. So the total tax take around Australia is around $150 billion, of which one-third goes in welfare to 7.5 million Australians. I suppose what I am trying to say to the people in my electorate is that we should support the people that need a helping hand. That is, part of the most basic Liberal phenomena and theme in the 1990s has to be to support people that deserve a helping hand. In my electorate, there are people that can afford and are prepared to pay their way in the 1990s and in the years beyond. It is those sort of people that are starting to come to terms with the fact that we cannot expect to get middle class welfare. We cannot expect to get a whole range of schemes that are going to prop up business. I have got a simple message, particularly for big business and it is this. As soon as you start to develop a welfare mentality, we can almost give up the game, because you are meant to be the proponents of self sufficiency, you are meant to pride yourselves on making a buck, earning that buck, producing a buck and then making a profit out of it. If you start to cry out for business welfare then you are letting the side down and you are making yourselves not only nationally uncompetitive but more importantly internationally uncompetitive. It is that part of business welfare when you see significant business interest groups in the Sydney Morning Herald, in the Australian or in the Financial Review saying, 'What is in the budget for me? What did I get out of it'? I will tell you what you got out of it. You got something out of it that you never got in the late 1980s or in the early 1990s under the Labor party. You are getting a long-term stable economy. And what does that mean? That means low inflation, that means low interest rates and lower interest rates and it also means most importantly that you have got an economy that 5332 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 is starting to grow and to improve its exportation particularly to the biggest consumer markets and the fastest growing consumer markets in Asia. In short, what does that mean for business? Businesses went through a very volatile period under the Labor Party in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were sold a pup during the 1980s that a boom would continue forever. The Labor Party sold it. You saw Bob Hawke and Paul Keating arm in arm with the Alan Bonds and the Christopher Skases and the Russell Gowards and all the various players that were out there-the entrepreneurial godfathers of the Australian economy, arm in arm. And what happened? Those people that they were shaking hands with and being photographed with in their black tie suits went to the wall quite dramatically. We are still feeling the effects of that. The most serious effect of that was not the October 1987 crash. The most serious effect was not the movement of money out of equities into real estate. The most significant effect was that it blew the confidence of small business in Australia. We came into the 1990s following the credit squeeze instituted by Paul Keating when he was treasurer. We came into an environment with fairly high inflation, but the government was trying to rescue the economy and failing miserably with the net result that again small business seemed to suffer the brunt through high interest rates, uncompetitive inflation levels and significantly falling consumer confidence.

And 10 and behold, this extremely revealing document seems also to indicate the ebb and flow of the political fluctuations in Australia. What we saw throughout the 1960s was an underlying balance of a surplus between one and nearly four per cent of GOP. In the mid-1970s, the underlying balance suddenly went into a deficit. Suddenly, we were running deficits of around minus two per cent of GOP and, of course, that was the effect of the Whitlam expenditure years when, basically, underlying outlays jumped around five per cent of GOP and he increased expenditure by 25 per cent in three years. And we start to wonder why we still have not recovered from the Whitlam years. Of course, revenue did not follow it and Australia went into significant deficit. In the early 1980s, we managed to recover. We started to have a couple of surpluses but with the recession in the mid-1980s, we went back into a deficit and, of course, as revenue was booming in the late 1980s we went into a surplus again. That was primarily linked to the massive creation of false capital in the Australian economy and, of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s Australia once again went into a deficit as a part of GOP and we have not actually recovered. In fact, this year the deficit will be around minus 1.3 per cent and in 199798, it will be 0.7 per cent. It will not be until 1998-99 that we will actually achieve a balance for the first time since 1990.",156,Represent Atives Main Committee
275,Mr Hockey,"It is the most revealing table in the entire budget because it gives a total5334 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 16 June 1997 What does this mean for business? Over the next few years we are going to try and create a stable environment for you to do business. There is no doubt that interest rates have to come down further. When small businesses are paying 9.5 per cent and we have an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent, you start to really recognise why they are not making the super profits that everyone expected. You start to really recognise why they are not employing more people because within our taxation system there are significant disincentives for people to employ other people because of payroll tax, the superannuation guarantee levy, and a whole range of other factors that make the oncosts of employing someone far too great for a business to cope with. So how do you get business to employ more people? How do you get business to start to generate its own expansion? It is simple: you start to make businesses profitable, and that is a partnership between the economy and the businessmen or the businesswomen themselves. In the first place, this budget focuses on the economy. It is saying that we want to give you the right indicators and the right environment so that you can start to take a calculated risk to expand your business. You are not going to have rapid increases in interest rates. We are going to start to give you lower interest rates for the longer term. The best indication of how successful we have been in this is the significant narrowing of the gap between the 10-year bonds of the US and the Australian lO-year bond benchmark to just under 60 basis points. That is the narrowest difference between the US lO-year bond and the Australian 10-year bond for many years. What does that mean? It means that international investors are starting to gain confidence in Australia. When they start to price our lO-year bonds at the same level, or close to the same level, as the US lO-year bonds, they are saying, 'Listen, Australia is actually a stable and growing economy to invest in and we have confidence in Australia.' What does that mean? The Governor of the Reserve Bank expressed it perfectly when he appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. He said that there is growing confidence in the Australian economy and that at no time in Australia's history have home loans been more affordable or more accessible to the Australian people. That was a very significant comment. More importantly than that, the Governor of the Reserve Bank said that we have to get increased competition into small business lending. At the end of the day, banks are there to make a profit for their shareholders. We must recognise that. The banks' profit comes about through their making one loan, managed by three people, of $500 million to a major corporate customer, rather than making a multitude of small loans to small businesses-500 loans at $1 million each or 1,000 loans at $500,000 eachbecause the resources going into the cost of managing the loans and the possibility of business failure is far more significant with small business than it is with big business. Therefore, the banks will lend to a big business every day because it is easier and cheaper to manage than it is to lend to a small business. How do we create competition in that environment? Banks have to play their part, but we also need to look to other means. One of the Wallis inquiry recommendations-which I will not go into today-was that we should be looking at trying to improve competition in the banking sector in the provision of lending, particularly to small business. There is little doubt that through this budget we are providing the stable economy that Australians have been yearning for. We are concerned-and we should be concerned-about Monday, 16 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5335 wage growth. We should be concerned that there is not an outbreak of wage demands, that people are not going beyond the pale in terms of negotiating increases in salary over the next two to three years. I am very concerned about recent claims that Commonwealth Bank employees are looking to increase their remuneration by around seven per cent per annum. If that happens, rest assured that Australian businesses will suffer the pain. Even if it is offset by productivity improvements, the people who are going to suffer are the businesses that cannot make the profit to pay the salaries. There is only one way, in a low inflation environment, that they can meet the expectations of, essentially, their shareholders, and that is to start improving productivity to perhaps unreasonable levels. You can only do that by improving your equipment, looking for new markets and working out better industrial relations, or simply by retrenching people and getting people to work longer hours. Maybe that is one of the reasons why we had a very disappointing jobs outcome in the last month. Australian business needs to stop focusing on reducing its employment levels. It needs to focus on how it can become more profitable and, therefore, employ more people. I commend the bill to the House. It is a landmark bill. It puts in train the budget until the next millennium. It puts in train the basis upon which we are going to build a stable economy for Australian business. More importantly, we are building an environment in which the Australian people can continue to have confidence that we as a government are acting on behalf of all Australians, particularly Howard's battlers. They are the big beneficiaries of this budget through the various announcements that have come to pass. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
