But he is absolutely ignorant of this subject. orable member kindly confine himself to the subject under discussion? am doing so. honourable member has been discussing the agricultural knowledge of the honourable member for Bland. greatest deference to the Chair, I think that ""my remarks are very much to the point, inasmuch as the honourable member for Bland, who is endeavouring to influence the Government against the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta, is assuming a special knowledge upon this question, and I am endeavouring to show that he is ignorant. The implement to which I referred is not to be obtained here, and we should afford every facility for its introduction, so that our farmers may have the benefit of the latest inventions. I think that the honourable member is in error in speaking of the implement that is being imported by the Victorian Government as a fertilizer and seed drill. The Victorian Government are importing a sub-soil packer, a special implement that is used in connection with dry farming. Fertilizer and seed drills, which were, in the first instance, imported from America, and improved on in Australia, have proved of incalculable benefit to our farmers. The old system of fertilizing was a very expenpensiye and cumbrous one, and the introduction of the fertilizer drill and chemical manures has in many ways contributed to economy in cultivation. It is now possible by supplying the necessaryplant foods to use the same land over and over again without resorting to the rotation of crops. Soon after the implements were introduced into Australia, the local manufacturers started to turn out a similar article, with improvements to suit local conditions, and now the local production is sufficient to riieet all our demands. Not"" only so, but the cost of the drills has been very materially decreased. Under these circumstances, I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta w i ll not insist upon the recommittal of the item. ments manufactured? centres; but there is no reason why they should not be made in every State. employed in the industry ? tion.

Laanecoorie informed us that Melbourne manufacturers were making seed drills, but I am informed that they import the parts and merely.put the machines together. are imported. manufacturing operations here have not reached such astage that everything required for. the construction of the machines can be made here, and therefore we should not place any obstacle in the way of importations. It is owing to the inventive genius ot the Americans that our farmers, instead of sowing 2 bushels of wheat per acre broadcast, are now able by means of seed drills, to perform their sowing operations with three-quarters of a bushel per acre. Practically everything that the farmer needs is subject to high protective duties, and I think that we should show more consideration for our heavily-burdened agriculturists. Only last night the representatives of the gold miners of Western Australia, and of the coal miners of New South Wales, challenged the proposal of the Government to extend a' preference to fuse and blasting powder imported from the United Kingdom -They rightly contended that those articles are the tools of trade of the miner. Surely the tools of trade of the farmer are equally entitled to consideration. Honourable members must realize that the prosperity of the country depends upon the agriculturists and the miners. By so much as we levy duties uoon their implements, by so much do we reduce their profits. We have been told that at various times in our history the States Parliaments have recognised their obligations to our primary producers. That fact, however, does not lessen' our responsibility in that connection. I , therefore, ask honourable members to assist the deputy leader of the Opposition to remove the duty which it is proposed to levy upon seed drills and fertilizers. It is quite true that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission, in their report upon agricultural implements, did not recommend any alteration in the existing rate of duty upon seed drills and ferI need tilizers. This is one of those questions which I feel justified in leaving to the deliberative judgment of the House, without attempting to influence honourable members either one way or the other. I shall content myself with reading from page 15 The honourable member for of Progress Report No. 5 of the Tariff Commission. Under the side heading of "" D r ill s , "" I find the following: Seed drills have been in general use in Australia for about thirty years, but in the year 1900 the manufacture of grain drills, grain and fertilizer drills, was commenced by a Victorian implement maker, Mr John Mitchell. For the first two years he fared very badly ;! then he took up an agency for bidders, and put on a large staff of travellers, with the result that, since igo2 his drill sales have been improving. At the present time about 5,000 drills ore imported into, and sold in, Australia every year. If all these drills could be manufactured in Australia instead of being imported, it would mean a tremendous increase in the number of hands employed. At present only between 500 and 600 drills are made in Australia every year. There is, however, every prospect, under better fiscal conditions, of the number increasing. Victorian drills vary in price from ^34 to £40, and ^47, according to size. and learned member tell us what is the price at which imported drills are sold? presented to the Commissionthat this branch of industry was being strangledas was the case with harvesters-n o recommendation was submitted by the Tariff Commission upon the subject of the duty which should be levied upon seed drills. The recommendations of that bodv in respect of agricultural machinery and implements are divided into three groups. learned member has not read the whole of the evidence bearing upon these implements. Sir JOHN QUICK I do not propose to do so, because it would occupy too much time. The Commission reported :That in accordance, as we believe, with the foregoing principles we propose to recommend that the duties be readjusted and distributed in the following groups :Implements and machines invented or specially improved in Australia-Stripper harvester, stump-jump ploughs, strippers, disc cultivators, horse and other power winnowers, I2£ per cent, additional to present duty; total, 25 per cent.

The second group comprises ordinary or commonplace implements and machines, such as ploughs, harrows, cultivators, n.e.i., chaffcutters and horse gear, scarifiers., castings, plough mould boards, corn-shellers, and cornhuskers. These articles we recommended should bear a duty of 20 per cent. The third group embraces lighter and less extensive implements, specialties, & c , upon which we recommend that the existing duty of 1 2 per cent, should be retained. 1 tend to support the motion of the honourable member for Parramatta, and in this decision I have been confirmed by tlie speech which was delivered by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. He informed the House that these implements were being manufactured very successfully in Australia, and that, as a matter of fact, they were being sold cheaper than the imoorted article. If his statement be true, it is conclusive evidence that there is no need to levy an increased duty upon these implements. cheaper now than they were before the local industry was started. The imported seed drill and the local article now command about the same price. were sold at a cheaper rate before the imposition of the duty, it proves that the industry is sufficiently established to exist without the aid of that duty. If it has flourished to such an extent that locally manufactured drills can be sold cheaper than can the imported article, there is no need to continue the duty. local article reduced the importer's profit. facturers can reduce those profits still further if they continue to progress as they are progressing now. blotted out by the remission of the duty. ber has shown that the locally manufactured article can be nlaced upon the market cheaper than can the imported article. have already contradicted the statement. ber said was that the present price of these implements was lower than the price But, certainly charged for them before the local industry was started. ment of the honourable member, it shows that there is no justification for the inplough-shares, creased duty proposed.

He omitted to read other portions of the report, which support an entirely different view. Uoon page 16 of that report I find the following: At present the demand for Australian-made drills is not big enough to warrant manufacturers laying down expensive plants and going in largely for their production. the importations. demand is not large enough. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The demand would be large enough if the 5.000 drills which I said that they are sold are annually imported into Australia were manufactured here. ceedsIt is admitted that the American manufacI f the local article turers have made some improvements in the making of seed drills, in the shape of malleable castings, which are superior to grey ordinary castings; a malleable casting is stronger and tougher. That statement shows that the imported drills are used because of their superiority. That is why they are in greater demand than is the locally manufactured article. The report continuesI t is alleged that, owing to deficiency in local supply, Australian manufacturers have at present to import these castings to use in connection with Australian-made drills. They have to import these castings in order to enable them to manufacture their seed drills. It will thus be seen that by imposing an additional duty upon them we should be handicapping the local manufacturer. turer will pass on the duty to the conhow unsound is the position taken up by the Minister.",16,First Group

T h is clearly shows that it is necessary at the present time to import these parts. manufacturers asked that they should be free, whilst the South Australian manufacturers desired that they should be taxed. one manufacturer, Mr Martin, of South Australia, asked for these duties. Agriculturists say that the locally-manufactured machine is too brittle, and that, although the imported article costs more, its superiority is so marked that they prefer it . I agree with the honourable member for Wilmot, that there appears to be an overweening desire on tlie part of the members of the Government to pile taxation on the farmer for the advantage more particularly of Victorian manufacturers, and that in taking up this attitude they receivethe support of certain honourable members who are supposed to be representatives of farming constituencies. lieve in making the lot of the farmer, who is handicapped more than any other section of the community, as happy as possible by decreasing taxation in his favour. I would go so f a r as to remove all taxation from .agricultural implements and machinery. On the other hand, the policy of the Minister has been throughout to unduly advance the cost of implements and machinery !fbr flnrmitig purposes. The farmer has, so to speak, to pay "" through the nose"" for everything he buys in order that an advantage may be given to city manufacturers. It is time that we gave the farmers a show. It is time that an emphatic protest were made against this constant piling up of duties against him. A t page 4205 of Hansard of this session the Minister of Trade and Customs is reported to have saidI t has been represented to me that seed drills and fertilizers are very largely made here, and that there is no reason why all our requirements should not be supplied by local manufacturers. I have already quoted from the report of the Tariff Commission a paragraph showtralia to only a very 'limited extent, and that it would be inadvisable for local manufacturers to iricur any great expense in In parasetting up a plant to manufacture them, since they can be imported with more advantage to the farmer, who regards them as superior to the local article appreciate the view expressed by honourable members of the Opposition, that it is desirable that we should, as far as possible, COOK The Victorian relieve the people of taxation and I sympathize with their objective when they lay stress upon the hardships endured by the farmers as a result of the establishment of agricultural implement making works in Australia. They have laid great stress on the point that if we do not continue to import these machines the farmers will be taxed to a very serious extent. It is to be regretted that they are not prepared to accept information offered by those whose practical experience enables them to speak with authority upon this question. I do not suppose that any electorate embraces a larger proportion of farmers than is to be found in that which I represent; and I do not think that there is a farmer in my constituency who is not prepared to admit that the man who wishes to obtain expensive scrap iron will buy the I beimported article. On the other hand, if he desires a cheap, reliable article, he will buy the Australian production. member thinks that all farmers who buy the imported machines are asses ? and object to such words being attributed to me. If the honourable member, instead of seeking to distort my statements, will allow me to state my case in. my own way, I shall have no cause for alarm as to the conclusions which the people may draw from it . We are told again and again that a protective duty for a time increases the cost of the article to which it is applied. Fortunately, that fallacy is exploded so far as its application to the articles under consideration are concerned. We have it on evidence that, prior to the imposition of a Federal Tariff per cent, duties. Tariff, none of these farming implements are subject to a duty of more than 1 2 1 per cent.

80,Mr Kennedy,"Unde r the Federalhowever, they were dutiable at 15 per cent., but the price lists show that, notwithstanding the reduced duty, no reduction has been made in the price of these imported implements. The importer does not ask for protective duties; he appeals every time for a reduction of duty. It has been proved by evidence, given before the Tariff Commission that, although the Victorian duty on seed drills and ploughs was reduced under the Federal Tariff, no reduction was made on the selling price of the imported implements. It is strange that if the manufacturers of the imported implements had to pay more for their raw materia], the Australian manufacturer, who would have been subject to exactly the same conditions, did not see fit to increase his prices in the same degree. I was one of the first to recognise that that section of the Commission which recommended an increased duty on certain agricultural implements made one important omission in fail1 ing to recommend that a reduction in the selling price of the locally-made articles should be required. The Government have provided in the B ill that a reduction in the price of harvesters shall follow the imposition of the increased duty, and I ask them to insert a similar provision with regard to seed drills. If that be done, we shall be able to test the prophetic powers of those honourable members who say that the increased duty will raise the price to the consumer. We could provide that within a certain period a reduction of 10 per cent, in the selling price shall take place. Would the Opposition be satisfied with a provision of that kind? member guarantee that the Victorian implement is as good as the imported ? prove that it is.

He will admit that the general use of the combined seed drill and fertilizer is of comparatively recent date. use concurrently with the introduction of harvesters, but the seed drill itself is an old machine. The honourable member will also admit that the seed drill of to-day is far more reliable and better adapted for the purpose for which it is intended than was the machine of ten years ago. sponsible for the improvement that has taken place? Have not all the improvements been due to the practical knowledge and inventive genius of Australian ' mechanics? A standard machine, known as the Superior drill, when first imported from America, was placed in the hands of two or three agents, but made no headway in the market. Eventually, an engineer and implement-maker secured the agency, and within three years, as the result of his labours, the implement practically took pride of place, and came to be generally favoured by the farmers. This was the result of considerable expense-whic h was doubtless borne largely by the owner of the implements and much work on the part of this engineer, who brought to bear his ability and knowledge of local conditions, and effected considerable' improvements. ever they were, went back to America, and were improved there. instead of the man getting any benefit from his invention, the owners of the machine got what profits there were in it , and, as soon as it was perfected, took the agency out of his hands and gave it to another man who had been sent from America. the honourable in speaking of the Woods machine. the Superior drill. machine. abroad have to be adapted to local conT h e honourable memditions, the best results being obtainable only when local knowledge is applied by men of skill and experience. These machines are now being made in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, and are equal, if not superior, to any imported machine. No imported drill has as perfect a carrying wheel.

I intend to vote with the Government on this occasion. My object in rising is to make a personal explanation with reference to a little comedy of errors in which the honourable member for Wentworth and I took part on the 6th September. Upon referring to the Hansard, report, which I feel sure is absolutely correct, I have come to the conclusion that the honourable member for Wentworth was, perfectly justified in putting the construction he did upon my words, in the same way that I was justified in placing upon his words the construction that I did. It was not my desire to accuse the honourable member of cooking accounts. But from my knowledge of the rings in America, I think that they would be capable of cooking anything. In our cooler moments we are induced to take a view different' from that which occurs to us when we are under the influence of excitement, and I feel sure that the honourable member for Wentworth will accept my explanation in the same spirit that he displayed when we recently had a private conversation. made by the honourable member for Melthe parts of these machines must be imbourne, I wish to withdraw anything of a ported. personal nature that I may have said regarding him upon the occasion referred to. the last occasion that the duty upon seed asked for a duty upon these parts was Mr drills was under consideration I was unavoidably absent, but I paired in favour of it. I do not intend to reverse the vote which I then registered. I think that the thanks of agriculturists generally are due to the honourable member for Parramatta for having brought this question forward, because, as the result of his action, they will obtain a concession in the shape of a reduction in the price of seed drills. I am certain that the Minister will give effect to his promise, and I think, therefore, that everybody should be very well satis-i fied. With me it is a question of what my constituents have to pay for these implements more than one of the duty which should be levied upon them. So long as a reasonable market is secured to them. I am indifferent as to what rate of duty is charged. I should like the Minister to add to the list of exemptions the "" sub-soil ment. It was only introduced a year or two ago.

It would be better for us to allow the position to remain unaltered rather than to place our political imprimatur upon the making of an admitted profit of 60 per cent.

A l We do not need to push our though representing a farming constituency he is prepared apparently to increase the competition which farmers have to face, We have and at the same time to deprive them of the advantages of competition in regard to the machines they use. As there is admittedly a large margin of profit in the manufacture of these machines, one of the most effective steps that a local manufacturer could take to secure a large trade would be to grant a substantial reduction in prices. He would have a wide margin to work There is already a difference upon, and if his machine were as good as others, reduced prices, without any Government assistance, would enable him to secure a materially enlarged trade.

For the purposes of argument, I have been speaking of cases whicb might arise in a single State.

To my mind protective duties which benefit only the manufacturer fall far short of conferring any real advantage upon the community. It is desirable that some portion of the direct benefits derived from the imposition of duties should, if possible, go to the employees, and there are also considerations relating to the consumer which have tp be faken into account. Looking at the duty side of the matter for the present, I recognise that these proposals represent ah effort to insure that the increases of duties which we have recently been considering in connection with agriculturalimplements and machinery, shall be accompanied by proper wages conditions for the employees in the industries concerned.

233,Mr Mccay (Corinella) [2.0],"Befor edesigned to benefit. As I understand the position, the great difficulty which has arisen is due to the limitation of our powers under the Constitution. I understand that the Attorney-General has advised that in dealing with this matter it is necessary to be constantly on our guard lest we infringe that provision of the Constitution which declares that taxation shall not discriminate between States or parts of States, because various methods which might be effective and which might work without any accompanying injury of substance, are inadmissible owing to that constitutional provision. I must confess that, so far as I have been able to give very hasty consideration to the question, it appears to me that if the view of the Attorney-General be correct, that the freeing of manufacturers from excise on compliance with State industrial conditions of any kind-whethe r they be in the nature of the decisions of Wages Boards or of State Arbitration Courts-woul d be an infringement of the provision relating to non-discrimination in matters of taxation, we have arrived at an impasse from which, at the present moment, I can see no escape. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade 'and Customs are aware that in this regard my desires are exactly the same as their own. I have previously made suggestions in this connection. ready to settle a matter of this importance to-day, and I think* that time would be saved if we were afforded a further opportunity of considering it. I do not make this suggestion with a view to bringing about delay the honourable and learned member? journ the discussion of this matter, and allow honourable members a further opportunity to consider it. Although the Cabinet has been engaged in considering it very fully from all stand-points, members of this' Committee have not had an opportunity to do so. I must confess that the taxation aspect of the question had not occurred to my mind, and with every respect to those who entertain the view to -which I have alluded, I am not prepared to give my adhesion to it. standing, as I do, that it is the view which is entertained by every legal member of the Cabinet, as well as by the permanent Crown law officers, I am compelled to give it the weightiest consideration. be correct, I fear that the way out of the difficulty is not visible just now. Personally, I am not in a position to discuss the matter with the clearness of. view that I ought to possess. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister does not think that we should be more likely to save time if our ideas upon it were allowed to clarify. It is a matter of first-class importance.

In their present form, I fear that the proposals of the Minister will mean injury to consumer, employee, and manufacturer alike. wili boil down to the manufacturers paying the Excise, the employees deriving no benefit, and the consumers failing to get any reduction in price.

It all depends upon the authority to whom this Parliament can delegate its powers of determination. If it can delegate them to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration as an individual, and not in his official capacity, and limited by our constitutional powers, why can it not delegate them to John Brown, and if it can delegate them to John Brown, why can it not delegate them to the Wages Board of a State? Boards be acting in a Federal capacity ? there to prevent us going a step further and accepting in a Federal capacity what is declared by somebody else? Then we have been told that such, a proposal would ba a contravention of the provision in our Constitution relating to our powers of taxation. able and learned member's argumentthat we might accept the decisions of Wages Boards would involve a discrimination, because it is based upon the idea that those Boards would retain their status as State authorities. ment declare that it will exempt from excise anybody who is complying with anybody else's decisions? The decisions might be those of the British Board of Trade, for example. Whiy cannot we adopt federally what has been done in a State capacity? If we cannot do that, it appears to me that paragraph e is limited in exactlv the same way.

In two paragraphs of the motion the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is recognised, but apart from those provisions we are proposing to allow the Parliament to decide whether the conditions prevailing in a particular class of industry or, it may be, a particular business, are fair and reasonable. from the decision of such matters the prejudices arising from fiscal opinions or associations? be asked in regard to the greater part of not to be allowed to discuss a motion proour work. arn referring to a proposal to give the Parliament power to deal with matters which the Opposition are taking f u l l advantage of have hitherto been delegated to a specially the opportunity. constituted tribunal outside. motion to force a manufacturer to come to to Russia, where his special qualifications Parliament. material whether a manufacturer or his He brings forward a drastic proposal like employees are to be forced to do so.

It would be absurd to contend that the fact that a man holds office is evidence of his qualifications to decide a matter of this sort. Besides, we cannot tell who our future Ministers will be.

But those who are in favour of it should try to make it workable and simple. create most serious and absurd situationsContrary decisions will be given, which will destroy the effective working of our industries. The request of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that we should have more time for consideration, is a reasonable one. We should be given an opportunity to determine whether the difficulties which have been pointed out cannot be removed, and if they can be removed, to find means of removing them. Every honourable member must recognise that the complications surrounding the carrying on of an industry will be very great if the men employed in a factory are subject during the time that they are working on one set of articles to one tribunal, and during the time that they are working on another set of articles to another tribunal. A man engaged in making wood-work might be subject to a State authority when that, wood-work was intended for one set of machines, and to a Commonwealth authority when it was intended for another set of machines. sary to keep a'record of the work actually being done by the employees.

If I am very doubtful the determination varies from the original decision, we shall have nothing but confusion, because operatives for a portion of their time will be subjected to the control Asi t stands at present, it will of the State authority, while, in regard to another portion of their time, that control will be overridden by the Federal authority.

It may be said that where higher rates of wages and shorter hours are fixed by our Commonwealth tribunal, as reasonable and fair, *he manufacturer t can free himself from the Excise by carrying on all his operations under the specified conditions. difficulty that might arise. The manufacture of implements might' constitute only a minor portion of his work. The manufacturer might engage in other lines of business, and whilst he might be compelled to pay throughout his establishment the higher wages stipulated by the Commonwmealth authority, his competitors in other lines of business, who might not be manufacturing implements, could carry ontheir operations under the more favorable decisions of the States tribunals.

As the result of the partial criticismI could carry my criticism much further-whic h has been directed to the proposals, new considerations have arisen, and it is important that in a matter of thiis kind, which may affect our industries very considerably, we should have the fullest time for consideration and for making good any shortcomings that may be exposed by criticism. agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the. step now being taken is a very important one: From 'the stand-point of protectionists, I think that it marks an era in our legislation. No previous attempt has been made in the manner now proposed to secure some definite proportion of the benefits of protection for the employees. Therefore this proposal, combined with the provision which is intended to protect the consumers . by limiting the selling price of the article, marks a step of great importance. bandage up -protection. very often impossible to achieve the .object aimed at without bandages. Judging from the tottering condition of free-trade, even bandages would not be of much avail. It is in the highest degree desirable that we should provide the simplest possible machinery for making this proposal effective. There is some force, in the criticism offered by the honourable member for North S'vdnev with reference to the difficulties that confront the manufacturer who has to comply with both State and Commonwealth requirements. I can quite understand that it is difficult, especially in view of the constitutional limitations, to arrive at the easiest way of giving effect to these condiBut just consider the tions. If we. were prepared to go to the expense of providing the same machinery that we use in connection with the sugar bounty system, we should have comparatively little trouble. That is to say, we could levy an Excise duty all round, and provide for a bounty by way of rebate to those manufacturers who complied with certain conditions. I can see that the constitutional difficulty would be at once avoided if we could adopt this course. But the machinery required would be considerable, and Excise offievery factory. If there is any effective method short of that cumbrous plan, we should adopt it. As I indicated before lunch, I do not see how the use of the Commonwealth label would constitute a discrimination in taxation such as would be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. But, upon that point, I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Attorney-General and the law officers of the Crown. It does not seem to me that the same objection would apply to clothing with Federal power some of the States authorities, such as the Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts. I do not know whether the interjection of the Attorney-General a few minutes ago indicated that he perceived the distinction between accepting the determinations of States Wages Boards as such, and accepting, for this purpose, the decision of a State Wages Board clothed with Federal authority. that the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney was more promising. I am endeavouring to frame an amendment to meet the case. hear that. The criticism of the honourable member for North Sydney, aided by interjections by mvself and the honourable and learned member for Corinella. and others, have at least achieved something. It would be preferable from every standpoint to recognise a standard established by an outside authority rather than depend upon any Ministerial or parliamentary determination.

If we adopt that course, we shall minimize complications, and lead to much less friction. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) [ -57]--It bas been urged that more time 2 is required for the consideration of the matter now before us. but I am prepared to vote upon it at 'once. to me that we are introducing an entirely novel and most complicated principle, which, if it has anything to recommend it , should be applied to all our industries. If we are doing right in regulating the wages paid in certain branches of manufacture, we are doing wrong in not extending the same principle to other branches of industrv. We have to look at the genesis of this proposal. Only a short time ago, the Government proposed to impose abnormally high duties upon certain agricultural machinery, and it was then suggested that we should simultaneously impose an Excise duty, and associate with it the principle of giving relief from Excise duties to those manufacturers who complied with certain labour conditions, and sold their goods at certain prices. I am not prepared, at a moment's notice, to apply a new set of principles, not only to taxation, but to the regulation of the social conditions of the people. I was not able to obtain a copy of the proposals until after the luncheon hour, and I do not think that we should, at short notice, be called upon to deal with the most complicated system of Excise of which I have ever heard. The Attorney-General appears to think that he can softsoap us into accepting the proposals by adopting ihe suggestion of the not of honourable member for North Sydney. member agree with that? Mr G. B . EDWARDS' I agree with some of the honourable member's criticisms, which were of the most destructive character. He spoke as the result of his wide acquaintance with commercial undertakings, and furnished the best of reasons why the Government proposals should not be adopted. It is impossible for anybody to predict what the ultimate effect of these proposals will be. This Excise duty is not imposed for the purpose of producing revenue. It is levied for the purpose of levelling down a protective tax which has been imposed upon stripper-harvesters. Could we not I certainlv prefer the achieve our purpose in a much easier way by lowering the irhport duty ? The Government have been compelled to accept a suggestion whicii emanated from the Labour corner, and to adopt what is known as the "" n e w "" protection. That"" n e w "" protection is intended to improve the social conditions of the operatives who create wealth. It seems able member's objection to that? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I stated the other night that if a new fiscal policy of that character is to be introduced, I shall be obliged to review my position as a free trader. My objection to protection has never been based upon the assumption 'that it would result in better conditions for the worker, but rather upon the fact that under it the worker is robbed, for the benefit of a small number of individuals. If we are going to introduce a system of protection under which we seek to improve the condition of the workers. T shall have to reconsider my position. But a Parliament which seeks to bring into operation a great principle like that for the _ sake of a few units in the community, is manifestly doing an injustice to the great majority. must not imagine for a moment that it was the Labour Partv which originated the "" new "" protection.",37,Excise Duties

Mr G. B. EDWARDS -But we shall need to go further than that. We shall require to add the following proviso:Provided further that if , in the opinion of the Minister of the day, a higher price is being charged to the consumers of these articles than ought reasonably to be charged, the proviso immediately preceding shall not apply. We might then go further and provide for the social habits of the people, for the sobriety of the workers, and for manufacturers paying their debts. might complete the circle and end up by leaving everybody in relatively the same position that they now occupy. would make the position more complicated. Mr G. B. EDWARDS view the complicated nature of these proposals, and the fact that the few commercial men in the House cannot predict their ultimate effect, it is only fair to ask the Minister to allow honourable members a few days in wRich to consider them. frequently said that these novel proposals seldom f u l f i l either the predictions of their opponents or of their supporters. I think it behoves us to look at the, matter more carefully before agreeing to propositions so novel in character and likely to be disastrous in their effects. member for North Sydney has pointed out, the Clyde Engineering Company in New South Wales manufactures a number of the articles which will be subject to these. Excise duties, and also turns out locomotives. Their workmen are frequently moved from one branch of the establishment to another. A man may perhaps be engaged upon a locomotive to-day and up a stumpjump plough to-morrow. Under these proposals we should compel that firm to comply with all the conditions relating to the employment of their men, if.they wish to escape the payment of the Excise duty. I merely say that this is the going through, I agreed that an Excise duty' should be levied, and I am merely giving effect to my promise. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -When the suggestion came from the Minister's friends in the Labour corner, it was taken up very readily indeed. I do not think it is fair to expect honourable members, at such short notice, to agree to these proposals. For my own part, I am prepared to vote against them at once. opposed to anv provisions of this character ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -No. When I voted in this House in favour of the establishment of an Arbitration . Court, I thought I was providing a means for regulating the wages of industrial employees. Have we failed to do so? If we have not, these provisions are not required. honourable member knows, there is no machinery of that kind. In short, we Mr G. B. EDWARDS -But we have provided Federal machinery. Until it is announced that our attempts to regulate wages are a failure, we have no right to tack on to Excise duties provisions relating to the social condition of the workers. Having in [3.12].

He said that we had endeavoured to place upon the statute-book provisions to regulate the It has been wages of industrial workers, and that, if we had been successful, these proposals were not required. I would point out to him that the Federal Constitution-grea t as it is-is not altogether symmetrical. It is the result of a good many compromises, and provides that taxation must be levied As the honourable without regard to States. Conciliation and arbitration have their foundation in the States. We have no power to legislate concerning conciliation and arbitration in respect of industrial disputes unless those disputes extend beyond the limits of any one State. Therefore, we have two conflicting principles, and that is how the difficulty arises. In regard to taxation, we must exclude from our minds all considerations of States. We must deal with Australia as a whole, without discriminating between State and State, or between parts of States. That is the awkward feature of the situation.

I think that the provision giving the Minister power to decide whether the terms of an agreement are fair and reasonable ought to be retainedj because in some distant parts of Queensland or South Australia, or even Tasmania, if might be found inconvenient to refer the question to the State industrial authority in another part of that State, or to a Judge of the Supreme Court, or the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. just as inconvenient to refer the matter to the Minister, who might be still further a wav. cuit. more convenient to refer the matter, through a Customs officer, to the Minister for determination. I think that it would be wise to give manufacturers an opportunity to do that which may be found best suited to their convenience. The only desire of the .Government is to facilitate the settlement of these matters, so as to avoid any block in industrial occupations. That is the position of affairs. I think we are all agreed that some provision of the kind should be made. The only point in dispute is as to the wav in which we should secure the object we have in view. I have detailed the considerations which have animated the 'Government, and with these obdeal with the motion at once, more especially as the Bill itself will have to be considered in Committee. Mi.

384,Mr Toseph Cook,"I hold that theyus, which cover a much wider range of duties than those immediately under discussion, but it is not proposed to attach to them the provisions which we are now considering. Although we are going to increase the protection enjoyed by a number of manufactures, it is proposed to apply industrial conditions in regard to the manufacture of agricultural machinery only. A Federal Parliament, working under a Constitution which forbids discrimination, has no right to differentiate in this way. With every desire that the labour conditions applied to manufacture shall be as liberal as possible, -I am unable to see that these provisions will be anything but unworkable. Apart from that, whatever is done should apply to the whole range of protected industries. I suggest, therefore, the withdrawal of these provisions for the present, in order that a Bill may be framed which will apply equally and universally. the efficacy of these provisions by giving -them only a small scope at first? is aimed at, they should be applied to the industries which are most highly protected, not to those whose protection is low. the whole Tariff. not of the whole Tariff, but of the schedules of duties with which we have dealt in connection with the preferential proposals relating to Great Britain and New Zealand. Why should we not apply to those duties, which mean more protection to local industries, the conditions which we are applying to the duties on agricultural machinery, and thus do justice between one set of employers and another? suffer injustice because justice is done to another ? just for the honourable member if , though able to do justice to two persons, 'he did justice to one only. We can make these provisions apply to all the industries affected by the duties which we have been considering during the past week or two. argument is a very adroit one. for the equitable treatment of the industries affected. We have it in our power to deal with them all alike. somewhere. unequal start ? raised in this Chamber when the establishment of the first Wages Board relating to the clothing trade was proposed. it down as one of the principles of the new protection that, when duties are imposed, consumers and employed, as well' as manufacturers, shall benefit. But that principle is to be applied only partially, although we are in a position to apply it generally and equitably. We deny justice to employees in industries which are being protected by duties of 40 per cent., although we are ready to impose these conditions on industries protected by duties of only 20 per cent, or 25 per cent. I. congratulate the Minister upon the introduction of these proposals, which I think embody the wishes expressed by honourable members generally last week. The criticism which has been levelled against them must be regarded with satisfaction by those who believe in the principle of the proposals, since no one has been able to raise objection to it. The objections taken have been directed almost solely to the form adopted, while the honourable member for Parramatta complains that the proposals are not sufficiently far-reaching. It is refreshing to hear that complaint coming from the Opposition. Any proposal to extend the scope of this legislation will have my hearty support. A beginning must be made in all 'things, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out. The establishment of Wages Boards was objected to on the ground upon which. the honourable member for Parramatta objects to the proposals before us, that it would be unfair and inequitable to single out any single industry. But it has been found that those who make the most of that objection always seek to limit the Wages Boards to the smallest compass. If we are going to adopt the principle that when protective duties are imposed, the workmen engaged in the protected industries shall be given better conditions, we must carry into law some such proposals as theseand we must make a start somewhere.

When it is entered upon, I shall endeavour, if I am here, to have conditions such as are now under discussion applied wherever possible, and I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta will lend his assistance. honourable member for South Sydney has stated that the introduction of these proposals amounts to a declaration that our Conciliation and Arbitration Act is at fault. .Nothing of the kind. That Act passed, not merely to regulate wages or conditions of labour, but to appoint a tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes, with a view to the prevention of strikes. Seeing that the honourable member is prepared to vote for Australian rates of wages, I am surprised that he intends to oppose these proposals. The legal difficulties surrounding the whole matter must be admitted. They are due chiefly to the fact that we are working under a written Constitution which expressly provides against discrimination between the States. It is admittedly difficult to apply general principles when conditions are dissimilar, unless exceptions are made, and 1 do not think that it is possible to suggest any simple plan. The Government have made a very fair attempt to do what is desired, and we shall, soon be able to see how their proposals will work. In regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, we must wait until a dispute coming within the meaning of the Act arises before we can know whether our legislation is likely to be successful, but if we put these proposals into effect we shall very scon see how they will work. them to be limited. will be no difficulty' in finding out whether the proposals are workable if they are once carried into effect, and, at the worse, if found to be unworkable, they can be remedied by the new Parliament two or three months 'hence. Honourable members will admit that if the scheme does not work, it can only delay the operation of the duties. Therefore we shall not expose the community to any risks. The present conditions would prevail until we could bring a workable scheme into operation. I can quite conceive of complications arising; but I do not anticipate that insuperable difficulties will be met with. I trust that tlie Committee will pass the resolution. We shall have ample time before the Bil l is introduced to consider any objections, and to endeavour, if possible, to devise a better scheme. Personally, I should have preferred to adopt the method suggested by the 'honourable .and learned member for Corinella, and TheI am sorry to learn that there are constitutional difficulties in the way. I first saw this novel proposal, I felt that I could not support it. orable member to do so. reasons may be different from those which the honourable member imagines. It seemed to me that it was proposed to enter upon a course of action entirely different from that which Parliament had hitherto adopted, namely, that of intrusting the settlement of industrial matters to tribunals altogether dissociated from politics. It also seemed to me that the proposals were calculated to encroach! upon the autonomous right of each State to regulate its own industrial affairs. Under the Constitution, we have no authority in industrial matters, except in regard to disputes extending beyond any one State. Therefore, I thought we should be invading the State domain. The amendments suggested by the Attorney General, to a certain extent overcome both of my objections, because hie presents the alternative of an appeal to bhe President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court or a Judge of a State Supreme Court, and through them to any person or persons in whom may be vested the authority to deal with State industrial It is an advantage for matters. Therefore the decision would be left to b'he local authorities. My third obThere jection is of an entirely different character. I disapprove entirely of the application of .Excise duties to businesses such as that with which we are now dealing. I quite agree with the observations of the honourable member for North Sydney. Both He and I have had considerable experience with regard to the operation of Excise duties. There is no more embarrassing OT unsuitable means of raising taxation or attaining any object through taxation, and in other parts of the world Excise duties are levied in few cases except those of spirits and tobacco.

Honourable members who have not a practical acquaintance with business cannot conceive of the difficulties that will be created. I do not see how the authorities are going to carry on their work without greatly impeding the operations of those engaged in the manufacture of implements. The work must be conducted in bond, under the supervision of lockers, and this seems to be the most clumsy expedient that could be adopted. Ministers will have to discover some better means of accomplishing their ends than that of imposing Excise duties. that the honourable and learned member for Corinella made a reasonable request when he asked that time should be afforded for the further consideration of these proposals, with which honourable members were not acquainted until just prior to the adjournindustrial ment for luncheon.

If we fixed a uniform price for the whole of Australia, one of the anomalies that would occur would be that farmers who had paid high prices to secure land close to markets and to manufacturing centres, would be charged as much freight as farmers in distant parts who had secured their land cheaply because of its remoteness from markets. ber say that the maximum selling price fixed in the Bill will be the real selling price ? months hence the price is £ 6 5 , it will not be fair to charge the man who lives only 100 miles from a factory as much as is charged to men living 1,000 miles away.

I do not see how we can equalize the conditions all round, and it certainly would not be fair to load up the men who are near the source of supply, in order to confer an advantage upon those who live at a distance. I think that we should insist upon a fair selling price at the factory and allow the freight charges to be added. These machines are now being made in New South Wales and Victoria, and I have every hope that they will shortly be produced in Western Australia also. as I can judge, the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is impracticable. The only fair way of fixing the selling price is by providing that the machines shall be sold for a certain figure at the facJOHN FORREST -Thes e machines tory.

A farmer in the Goulburn Valley would have to pay 50s. freight upon a machine sent to him from Melbourne, and thus the cost to him would amount altogether to £ 8 3 ios. A farmer in Western. Australia would probably have to pay £ 5 freight from Melbourne to Fremantle, and thus the cost of the machine landed on the wharf would be about £ 8 6 . trolled the market, harvesters were being sold in the agricultural areas of Western Australia for as much as £ 1 0 0 . Within the last are now endeavouring to get beyond the control of the combine and to secure a reduction of prices. This proposal works out just as equitably for the farmers of Western Australia as for those in close proxN o ; rail or wharf. imity to the seat of manufacture. If we fix a maximum selling price at the factory, the Western Australian farmer will get exactly the same proportion of rebate as the farmer in Victoria. It is only reasonable to assume that before very long a factory will be established in Western Australia for the manufacture of harvesters. The present freights are high, and as the agricultural industry expands in that State there will be every inducement to manufacturers to open workshops there. In the meantime it would not be fair to fix a maximum selling price in that State.

444,Mr Henrywillis (Robertson),"I would remind honourable members that these machines were sold at one time for £ 6 3 each, when orders were given for three machines in one lot; and yet it is proposed to fix a higher maximum. In view of the restrictions under which the manufacturers will be placed, they will derive very little advantage from the proposed increases of duty. Under the socialistic system proposed, the workmen will want their shares of the profit. that as it is evidently intended under the new system of protection. to protect every one, we should safeguard the interests of the residents of the various States. If we keep out the imported article it is only right that we should make provision against anyState being penalized. If it is proper for us to protect the manufacturers of Victoria, we should also see that no injury is done to the consumers in other parts of the Commonwealth. We do not use strigpers in Tasmania, but legislation may shortly be introduced affecting other classes of manufactured goods, and, therefore, I desire at the outset to make provision for equitable treatment all round. If tfie Victorian manufacturer has to pay very heavyfreight upon machines which are sent to Western Australia he may be induced to make on the spot the machines required there. a large factory can always produce a machine at a less cost tha'n can a small factory. seems to me that we should be careful not to inflict an injury upon people who are resident in the smaller States. I have had a little experience of what the Victorian manufacturers will do. I know that in the matter of Australian-made bedsteads, some manufacturers appointed a single agent in towns in the distant States, and refused to supply anybody else. The retailers are thus prevented from obtaining the Australian-made article. that we should not merely study the manufacturers, and that if we arrange for a place of delivery it ought to be in the capital facturers in mv own constituency. of each State. of Trade and Customs) [4.52] I regret that I cannot accept the amendment, and for several reasons. A provision of that kind would operate very unfairly to the manufacturers in all the States. Let us suppose that a large establishment for the manufacture of these machines started operations in Perth. If it were compelled to deliver them in Melbourne or Sydney they would not be compelled to deliver them. It merely provides that if they do sell in other States, they shall sell at a fixed price. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Unde r the amendment they would be compelled lo deliver them in other States at the maximum price, otherwise they would not be permitted to sell them. The Bill compels delivery of the machines at not more than a certain price at the railway station or wharf nearest to the factory. In reply to the fears expressed by the honourable member, that the establishments in Melbourne and Sydney will come into competition with those in Perth, I would point out that the Perth manufacturers will still enjoy a natural protection of £ 4 or £ 5 per ton by reason of freight charges. I do not know whether the honourable member is aware of it, but there are small factories preparing to start operations all over the country. There are three or four in my own electorate, and in the adjoining electorate there are others. Why cannot factories be started in Perth or Brisbane just as easily ? But I would point out that plovers have to pay 25 per cent, more for labour than do the employers in other States orable member had better blame the Wages Boards. Boards there.

If that be so, we need to extend to this question of fixing a maximum selling price a, larger amount of consideration than I have yet devoted to it . I thought that what was contemplated was a maximum selling price for Australia, and that internal competition, assisted by the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation B ill , would reduce the price of these machines to the consumer near the factories very much below the amount mentioned in the B ill . But now it seems to be accepted that it will do nothing of the kind, but that the maximum selling price specified in the Bill merely represents the price which will be paid for the machines by the consumer who is mosf favourably situated. everv instance? port the argument of the honourable member that internal competition will regulate the prices. to bring the prices down. assume that the man who is resident close to a citv will be able to obtain his machine for less than the maximum selling price, whilst the individual who is not so advantageously situated will be required to pay the maximum. maximum price all over Australia.

In paragraph 3 of the report of that section of the Tariff Commission which recommended an increased duty it is set forth that that increase should be I desire to fix a granted subject to the imposition of conditions as to the retail selling price not reasonable conditions of labour in the industry, and, in the case of harvesters, a reduction in the selling price within a certain date. The lines suggested by those engaged in the industry were practically adopted, and it was recommended that the price of a standard machine, within two It might possibly years, should be reduced from £ 8 1 to £70. As the rate of duty has been increased by 12J per cent., that represents a reduction of 14 per cent, on the selling price, whereas the proposal embodied in I repeat that we ought this clause is that there shall be a reduction of 20 per cent.

It was what I expected when the duty was fixed at £ 1 2 . I said then, as I say now, that the amount of the duty need not concern the Australian user of machines. Within the next eighteen months we are to get a reduction of 14 per cent, on the' selling price of standard machines. that he thought he could bring the price down to £ 6 5 within that time. sion reports that within two years the price of the standard machine, which is now selling at £ i i , could be reduced to £ 7 2 . That machine has a width of comb of from 5 feet to s f t . 6 in. But there is a machine, facturers themselves have admitted that one now in its second year, and found to be satisfactory last year, which has a comb of the width of 6 feet. It was being sold for £87 ios., and, under the Bill, must after the ist February, 1908, be sold for £ 7 0 , which, I think, is too great a reduction in the time. If the Australian market were wholly conserved to the local manufacturers the reduction might be brought about, but under the circumstances it is too great. given before the Tariff Commission, the cost of the imported machine, including all charges, is only £ 4 1 . manufacturers have refused to state their actual factory costs, and the Tariff Commission had before them only the same evidence as was before the Minister of Trade and Customs when he fixed the value at £ 6 5 . I should like the Minister to adopt a recommendation which was put before him at an interview, and endorsed by a section of the Tariff Commission. That is, that the machine now selling at £ 8 1 should be reduced in the first year to £ 7 $ , and in the second year to £ 7 0 , a total reduction of 14 per cent., and that a pro rata reduction should be made in regard to the 6 feet machine. There are also machines from 4 f t . 6 in. to 5 feet in the comb, which have been selling for .£75, and they might very well be brought to £ 6 5 within two We are proposing years. In my opinion, it would be best to make three classes-machine s under 5 feet to be reduced to £ 6 5 in two years, machines under 5 f t . 6 in. to be reduced The implement-makers, and that to £ 7 0 , and machines under 6 feet to be the Tariff Commission reduced to £ 7 5 That is practically what was in the mind of every honourable member who voted for the £ 1 2 duty, and would carry into effect the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. of Trade and Customs) [5.18] -Perhaps it would be better to have three classes, because virtually no provision is made for the 6 feet harvester, which was being tested out West last season. I think, however, that the rates I have fixed are very reasonable. The duties will check importations to a large extent, and next year there will be a large increase in the local output. Of late there have been serious complaints as to the prices charged for harvesters, which have been altogether too high. The manureason for keeping prices up has been the expense to which they are put in sending agents through the country to extend their trade. I think, however, that, taking into account the duty-which I should like to have been higher-they will do very well, though, perhaps, an exception might be made in favour of the third class of harvester, at an increase of £5. Bill makes provision only for stripper-harvesters 5 f t. and 5 f t . 6 in. wide, but there is in use at present a harvester 6 feet wide, or very nearly so. I think that provision should be made for strippers of sizes between those specified, because, as the clause stands, harvesters 5 f t . 1 in. in width would not come under the Bill. I hope that the Minister does not. intend to increase the selling prices. provided for in the Bill.

OF ELECTIONS : PROROGATION. External Affairs) [6.6] -In movingThat the Bouse do now adjourn, I desire to say that the first business we shall' take next week will be the Bill covering the schedule of preferences to Great Britain. Immediately following the passing of that measure the Estimates will be taken; and I hope that there will be an opportunity during the week to deal with the Postal RatesB ill, and other minor measures. to congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the fact that the Mace is on the table. Hitherto, on Mr Speaker leaving the chair, it has always been removed. I do not Qcnow of what use it is, but it seems to be the emblem of Mr Speaker's office. Perhaps tbe fact that it has been retained on the table whilst you, sir, are temporarily occupying the Speaker's chair, is an indication that Mr Speaker will be translated to' a higher sphere, namely, that of the High Commissioner in London, and that we shall have the pleasure of seeing you elected in his place. -Could the Prime Minister make any definite statement as to tbe intentions of the Government with regard to the close of the session ? Some honourable members have already left for their homes, and others have fixed upon certain dates for leaving Melbourne. The Prime Minister will realize that it is not fair to keep one set of members working here whilst others are allowed to go back to their constituents and enter upon their electoral campaigns. Those honourable members who have to travel by sea to the distant States have to make their arrangements some days beforehand, and, therefore, I should like to have some indication as to the date upon which .we shall be relieved of our duties. [i 8]7 z [6.9] -The long list of Bills upon the business-papei of the Senate would seem to indicate that we shall be detained here for some time. I think that an effort should be made to close the session at as early a date as possible, and I should like some information as to the intentions of the Government. think that it would be equally interesting to honourable members to know upon what date the election is likelv to take place. External Affairs) [6.10] I hope that with assiduity, we shall be able, so far as this House is concerned, to practically dispose of the remaining business next week. Our labours may, however, have to be extended into the first days of the following week. Most of the measures now before the Senate have already been before us, arid will not require to engage our further attention unless requests or amendments are made, as in the case of tbe Spirits Bill. I hope that, by applying ourselves closely to the work before us, and with some good fortune, we shall be able to dispose of the business upon the notice-paper next week, and, if necessary, give attention to any Bills that may come back from the Senate during the following week. As to the date of the elections, I would point out that two of the' measures passed by an absolute majority last night require to be dealt with in a similar manner in another place. After they have been so approved, two months must elapse before the elections can be held. That means that the elections cannot take place until the last days of November or the first week in December. Question resolved in the affirmative.
