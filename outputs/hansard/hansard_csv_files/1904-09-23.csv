Debate Resumed From 22nd September Son","That the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House. issues raised in connection with this motion of censure is that, although the fiscal question has been sunk by the people, a movement is being made to raise it again, and I wish to present to the House a few of .the reasons why there is an objection on the part of the Government to the raising of it. To show what kind of friends the farmers and pastoralists will have in the present Administration if they get their way, I would like to refer to what happened in my own electorate just prior to the last elections. I was opposed by a single-taxer, a gentleman of the school to which the honourable members for Lang and New England, and some others, belong. He took the trouble to go all the way from Mudgee to Sydney to hear the right honourable member for East Sydney state the policy of the Free-trade Party, and, in presenting his case to the electors, no doubt carefully followed the right honourable gentleman and the official organs of the party, the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald. The occupations of the people in my electorate, although somewhat varied, come chiefly under the three heads-pastoral , farming, and mining pursuits, and in appealing to these people for support, he denounced taxation through the Custom House as something wrong. But, as revenue w.as necessary, he supported a revenue Tariff, such as has been advocated both here and on the hustings by .the leader of the Free-trade Party. He wished to levy the same Tate of duties on all importations. What that rate would be does not matter much for the purposes of my argument, but I think that Sir William McMillan has stated that it would require an average duty of afoout 15 per cent, to raise the amount of revenue necessary.. He would therefore have reduced those",12,Setup

3,Mr Spence (Darling),"On e of the duties which now have a protective incidence, -and would, on the other hand, have placed duties on articles which are now admitted free. It will be interesting to see what effect that would have upon the people in the country districts. Under our Tariff, only the articles which are specifically named are subject to duty. In addition to those articles there is a long list of articles specifically exempted from duty, while all other articles not mentioned are also admitted duty free. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Tariff has about the biggest free list possessed by any Tariff in the world, and contains over 1,100 items in its list of exemptions. I therefore followed my opponent round the electorate, and pointed out to the people what would be the effect of his proposal. them that the articles which they mostly used are now admitted free. In connection with pastoral work, shears, shearing machinery, woolpacks,. cornsacks, galvanized iron, fencing wire, and wire netting, are all admitted free; while the farmers are allowed to import over twenty items of farming machinery free, in addition to .the articles which I have named, and which they use in common with the pastoralists. Furthermore, household commodities of which there is a large daily consumption, such as tea and kerosene, are admitted free, while cotton goods, which are so greatly used for the clothing of families, pay a duty of only 5 per cent. My opponent was actively supported by a canvasser for Messrs. Paling and Co., of Sydney, and he was urging upon the electors the desirability of adopting a free trade policy, such as that advocated by the Prime Minister, under which the dutywould be taken off pianos, and the taxes upon the necessaries of life increased. The policy of the Prime Minister is to reduce the duty on the luxuries of the rich, and to levy imposts upon the necessaries of the poor. This would have been a very good policy for Messrs. Paling and Co., who at present have to compele with a local manufacturer, who derives a certain amount of benefit from the protective Tariff. Very few of our struggling settlers are in a position to afford pianos, and these buy only one piano in a life-time. The Prime Minister is sinking the fiscal issue temporarily only, because he has made no secret of the fact that both sides are to keep their powder dry, and to hold themselves prepared to fight the fiscal question at the next election. Therefore, 8 G2 after having obtained the co-operation of the alleged protectionists, the free-traders, will endeavour to secure the introduction of what is called free-trade, but which is a mere sham and a humbug. How could our settlers be benefited by the introduction of a system of free-trade which would require them to pay higher duties upon the necessaries of life? I am in favour of allowing the Tariff to stand for the present, because under it the people enjoy a certain measure of free-trade. As-a matter of fact, I have been more loyal to free-trade principles than have some of those honourable members who are now supporting the Government. In connection with the question of preferential trade with Great Britain, the honourable, and learned member for Ballarat advocated the I showed raising of the Tariff against the foreigner, whilst maintaining the present duties against Great Britain. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, favoured the lowering of the Tariff wall, so far as Great Britain was concerned, and maintaining it against the foreigner. Therefore, he advocates the adoption of a protectionist policy against the foreigners, and a half-and-half free-trade policy towards the old country. I would point out, however, that about one-fourth of our imports are upon the free list, and that in regard to the articles therein enumerated we might give Great Britain all the preference necessary if we were to impose duties upon imports from foreign countries. The free list embraces tools of trade and a number of other articles which can be manufactured in England as well as elsewhere, and it seems to me that the possibilities of adopting the preferential principle in connection with this section of our Tariff might profitably engage the attention of our statesmen. The Prime Minister has boasted that in New South Wales he relieved the poor of some of their burdens, and placed them upon the shoulders of the rich; and I think that he might proceed still further in the same direction in connection with any contemplated alterations of the Federal Tariff. I do not see that any objection can be urged against the proposal to appoint a Tariff Commission. It is highly desirable that we should inauire into the working of thei Tariff, with a view to remedying any defects, and removing anomalies. The appointment of such a Commission could not be regarded as committing us to the revival of the fiscal issue. So far as I am aware, the only person who has proposed Tariff revision is the Prime Minister himself. He declared, some time ago, that he was desirous of lowering duties which have a protective incidence, with a view to imposing an equal duty all round. read the terms of the alliance to which he has subscribed? Do not the words, "" In cluding Tariff revision,"" appear there? of degree. the Tariff only, that may or may. not be called Tariff revision. The words to which the Prime Minister has drawn attention do not necessarily imply that we wish to reopen the whole of the Tariff issue. question' of preferential trade were to ripen I do not think that it will, within the life of the present Parliament, even if we avoid a dissolutionI claim that we should be able to enter into arrangements with the mother country without any interference with the existing Tariff. Both parties to the coalition subscribe to the idea that a preference should be extended to British goods. would be benefited by the imposition' of an all-round duty of 15 per cent., is simply to attempt to deceive them. The endeavour to persuade them to regard the Labour Party as their enemies is also prompted by deceit and hypocrisy. orable members who sit behind the Government, that the single tax is a panacea for all evils. England and others favour that doctrine, and it is most extraordinary, therefore, that they should join in a denunciation of Socialism. The adoption of the single-tax, which they regard as the solution of the labour problem, wftuld mean that, for the purposes of the community, the State would receive the whole economic rent of land. In other words, all the unearned increment would be appropriated by the State for the general good. Can we conceive of a more socialistic proposal than that ? I should like to ask the advocates of that doctrine who constitute a big section of the Ministerial supporters, and who are continually telling the farmers that the Labour Partywish to steal their land, what they would do with this vast revenue when it had been collected. Those who have bestowed most attention upon the matter admit that they would then give the community the benefit of free railways. Would not that be Socialism ? Where is the difference ? I repeat that those who denounce Socialism most loudly are themselves pronounced Socialists, ' being specially directed by Governments, only they choose to call things by different names. Personally, I have no faith in mere namesI desire to get at realities. The whole of the Government attack upon the Labour Party has centred around the term "" Socialism."" It is a bogy, but even bogies exert some influence. I think that I clearly demonstrated last night that the organizations to which the Government are If we deal with one item in appealing to fight their battle are of a most reactionary character, and that' they represent merely a class-the smallest in the Commonwealth-whic h is constantly demanding from the Government concessions If the which it is not prepared to extend to others. It does not recognise equal rights to every section of the community. The members of the Labour Party receive the support of the wage-earning class chiefly, because their interests in the past have been neglected. We are here to definitely voice their requirements, and chiefly because the needs of other sections are very carefully studied by other honourable members. To assure our producers that they I do not intend to touch upon the destruction of industries which would follow the carrying out of the Government policy, further than to say that under their proposals we should not have either a free trade Tariff or a protective one. A soAmongst honcalled revenue Tariff would be merely a sham. I wish to show what the Socialism are some who believe that we advocate really means, and to appeal to honourable members opposite to give The honourable member for Ne.v us fair play in view of the necessity to do something to improve the welfare of society, and I use the term in its br.oadest sense. I am pleased to think that we have at last entered upon the consideration of a question that certainly constitutes the one great issue of the present day-the question of how to improve the lot of all classes. The Socialism which we believe in recognises that the present social system is running more or less rapidly-rapidly , I think-in a direction in whidh' it cannot be permitted to continue. Changes must be made. I shall endeavour to show that the developments taking place in all phases of industrial life among the civilized nations of the world are in the direction of collectivism. The whole industrial movement is in the direction of Socialism, and it is only because words convey different meanings to different minds that that fact is not recognised. This industrial' movement towards Socialism is not a conscious one. It is-not",12,Confidence

5,Mr Spence,"It is merely a questionLabour Parties, or Socialists-. velopment of the socialistic movement, some phases of which have been touched on during the debate, is the result of an analysis on the part of the people of the conditions that are being created by the commercial classes and by others -who are antagonistic to labour ideals. Just as we find strong evidence of approval of socialistic movements, in the practical sense of the term, on the part of the present Government, so we find an evolution in the same way taking place throughout the industrial life of the civilized world. wealth, has underlying it the great prinI t is too late for honourable members opposite now to attempt to stem the flood. We call upon them to recognise the movement, and to join with members of the Labour Party who, perhaps, have obtained a fuller insight into, the wretchedness and misery of life, in endeavouring, so far as possible by legislation, to secure better conditions for all who work, whether by muscle or by brain. The basis of modern trade and production is simply that of profit. canno't employ labour unless he makes a profit on it. In the broad sense of the term of starvation without it, and yet it is said there are only two economic -elements to be considered, land ' and labour. is now being massed, and placed under captains of industry. The individualist is disappearing, and it is therefore somewhat surprising to hear some honourable members talk so freelv about the necessity to protect the rights of the individual, and to develop individual power. What the Socialists contend is that the existing social system is destructive of individuality. recognise that the employment of labour depends upon whether the employer can make a profit on it , and that the measure of gain is affected by factory legislation imposing certain conditions on employers of labour, and by conciliation and arbitration laws, which have a very important bearing They recognise that, as the result of these -conditions, employers are interested in keeping men out of work. a most remarkable state of affairs. It is deplorable that men who control vast interests should be able to profit by the misery of their fellow beings-that workers should be kept out of employment in order that the cost of production may be kept down. But, if men remain out of employment, the demand for the output of those who are producing for a profit is lessened. If the workers form strong trade, unions, and become so powerful that they can make The dedemands on employers for conditions which they are unable to meet, the employers may close down their works. They are able to stand out longer than their workmen, and in that way may practically starve them into submission. From the point of view of self-interest the workers recognise that this is not a desirable state of affairs, and they say that the only proper solution of the difficulty is for them to provide employment for themselves.. The socialistic movement, which has been referred to as having for its' object a co>-operative Commonciple of-increased co-operation on the part of the people. In one sense we are a cooperative people. We are all dependent upon one another. No man can live by himself, and of all classes those who are called independent are in reality the most dependent. They could do nothing but for the labour of those whom they would not think of admitting into their drawingroom. Some of them would not even be able to A man cook a meal for themselves without the labour which they employ; they would die that they are independent. That is a Labour misleading term. Notwithstanding all this talk of individualism on the part of certain persons, it is interesting to note the way in which men are forced to do things that they do not want to do. By way of illustration I would refer to an incident that occurred recently to a gentleman associated with an anti-socialistic organization operating more particularly in this State. We have The masses heard of an organization called the Farmers' and Property Owners' League, which is giving its support to the present Government. That league has in its employment a gentleman named Sievwright, who has been carrying on the work of organization. I am not acquainted with him, but he seems to be an educated man. I am told in that respect upon them. that he is a solicitor, and yet such is our social system that this intelligent, educated man was brought before a court That is a week ago and cross-examined .as to why he had neglected to support certain relatives. I regard that case as one of the saddest 1 pictures and most striking parodies on our present social system. Here is a gentleman of education, with a profession by means of which he ought to be able to do well for his family; and yet, in order to live, he has week by week to preach doctrines which he himself must feel are not true. Mr Sievwright will be expected to organize the farmers and denounce the Labour Party as the enemy of the producer-to tell the farmers that there is no need for arbitration laws, and that there is plenty of work for everybody. rather disgraceful that there should be such exposures in connection with old-age pensions. about the inquisitorial character of an income tax, and yet this man is called upon to publicly declare the fact that his sisters are unable to obtain work, that his daughter has to give her services for half-a-crown a week, and that his brother works in a solicitor's office for a wage of 30s. All this is an absolute travesty on our present social system. We hear much prating about individualism, but what do we observe, for instance, in connection with our leading newspapers and the press generally? Some of the best brains are engaged in advocating in the columns of the newspapers doctrines and policies in which they do not believe. What chance is there to develop and maintain individualism when, in the mere struggle for bread and butter, a man is forced to do that which is revolting to him? I know reporters and others connected with the press who have to earn their crust by writing what to them is personally unpalatable, and who feel that what they do is not honest. something in the idea, of Socialism, if by that means such a state of things may be altered so that every one may have a chance to do the work for which he is most fitted, and thus lead to the better industrial organization of society. At present people have to select occupations, not from choice, but from force; every father of a family knows that in seeking openings for his sons and daughters, he cannot always find the industry or trade for which they are most suited. I should like to remind honourable members of the position in our great manufacturing industries where men and women become simply parts of the machinery. Where, under such circumstances, is the room for the development of individual liberty ? Where is there room for private enterprise ? enterprise"" is another favourite parrot cry of those who have no knowledge of its true meaning; they cannot realize that for enterprise of the kind there is no opening when each mechanic is forcibly fitted into a groove. destruction of human life, and also the Where is the room for private enterprise in the case of the coal miner, who has to produce at so much .per ton, knowing that the harder he works the less chance there will be of continued employment? Such a Mr Sfence. man is forced and driven, and his position can only be described as one of wage slavery. In every industrial branch of life Personally, I think it similar conditions prevail. Men know that the harder they work, and the more they produce, the more they are depriving their We hear a great noise made fellows of employment. There is a cry of denunciation if such men do not work hard enough; we hear complaints of what is called the "" Ca-Canny"" system in English trade unionism. What is the object of this denunciation ? It is to allow some few persons to become rich. Where is the gain? Professor Warren tells us in his interesting study of the subjectInsufficiently and poorly-paid employment is the greatest single cause of degeneracy. We hear honourable members speaking of paying men according to what they can earn; and yet we already have conditions of life in which adults and children are insufficiently fed, and even then on adulterated food. And then because these poor people have no possible chance of developing physically or mentally, soas to hold their own with the stronger, they are punished by being told that they shall receive only what they are able to earn. That is a great blot on the system which honorSurely there is able members opposite favour, and desire to maintain. Have those honourable members ever really studied the matter. As Henschell saysTo allow a class of society to live in idleness and wax fat on the degradation and demoralization of their fellow-men seems to me to be little less than a crime perpetuated by society, and an evil in the sight of God. That is a statement _ by a great thinker; and I have other quotations which I have been careful to make from the writings of those who are not associated with the Labour Party, but are observers and students, whose writings I commend to those concerned in the great attack on a movement which is undoubtedly coming, but which is very much misunderstood. The present system only tends to build up an idle rich class, with a "" Private sweated poor at the other end of society. One of the great evils, probably the greatest, is the moral degradation which inevitably follows. Then there has to be taken into account the further result of the class hatred bred of the class feeling inseparable from present conditions. I think there is a great deal of suggestiveness in a short quotation which I wish to make from Dr. Edward Caird, in his presidential address to the Ethical Society of England a age we must have some improvement. In short time ago. Dr. Caird saidAs a class, men of culture are not in much danger of being possessed by a frantic love of evil organizer and mouth-piece of the Federated and hatred of good, but sometimes they are in Employers' Union? We have heard many danger of losing a belief in the greatness of the quotations of what Tom Mann has said, issues of existence which are hid under its littleand a great fuss has been made about his ness, and in the worth of every human life in spite of the triviality and meanness of its appearviews. I am glad that people are taking ance. That is the position of which the Labour Party complain-that there is not enough for every word he has uttered. I do not thought given to those numerous individuals know whether every honourable member in who are, to some extent, lost sight of, and this House would like to be held always reare treated, perhaps, as we are all, from sponsible for every sentence he utters, it want of thought, inclined to treat those may be under some little excitement, but with whom we are not brought in close conwe are told that we must be responsible for tact.

This is the Government mouth-piece. This wright and others, as the organizations are able to raise funds to pay them, is going round to educate the community. The most extreme labour man and the most extreme Socialist in Australia would not say anything resembling that which Mr Walpole said. This man holds that marriage, as well as long-sleevers and theatres, is a luxury, and that working men should not have any of these things. Of course, they should not. be other than slaves. they are slaves. I believe that Aristotle gave expression to a' great truth when he said that the working classes would always be slaves until machinery did the work Our attitude, in contradistinction to that assumed by Mr Walpole, may be stated in various ways, but I quote a few words used by Archdeacon Wilson, who states it very wellWe must press forward the popularization of and in the boom time for no less than the ideal of making human beings the supreme aim of our nation. The members of the Federated Employers' Union are opposed to that. They favour individualism, the development of private enterprise, non-interference by the State; and profit-making is their sole consideration. can beat the Americans at going insolvent. The honourable member for Parramatta made reference to some great law. By interjection I asked the honourable gentleman what law he meant. reply, but I presume that the great law to which he referred is one with which people of his school of thought have always associated themselves. They call it "" the law of supply and demand."" These people have a set of phrases which they have repeated for a century. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Parramatta is a. century old, but his are ideas which were held a century ago, and the honourable member has practically stopped there. It requires but five minutes"" reflection to enable honourable members to perceive that private enterprise is interfered with in almost every way already, and that there is no such thing as persons being allowed to do as they like. If they were, the social state would be one of pure anarchy. great aim is the development of the individual, the human being. The nation is a nation of men and women. I understand that the statement to which I have referred made in reply to a vote of thanks, moved by a clergyman. I presume the clergyman expressed some approval of what Mr Walpole had said, and I suppose he now feels called upon to some extent to stand by what was said in reply to his vote of thanks. Mr Walpole did but give expression to what others who think in the same way have not the courage to say. Men of this class believe in non-interference with the law of supply and demand, because if that law is not interfered with they will be able to secure very cheap slaves, and in their own short lives they may become very rich. I do not caie to follow a certain line of argument at They should not great length, or I might show that riches We say that themselves take wings and fly when more powerful competitors succeed in crushing out those who possess thern.

That was said a long time ago, but the truth of it will be evident to every one. Unless we consider the interests of each and all, society must fail. The members of society must be studied entirely from the collective stand-point. Men and women must be continually considered from that standpoint.

Thomas Carlyle, the great thinker, saidThis that they call the organization of labour is nise that the only trend of events which is the universal vital problem of the world. It is the ? uture pretend to govern men. I commend' that saying of the old prophet to the present Government for their careful consideration-the organization of labour is the universal and vital problem. It is the one problem which is looming large in 1 connection with the foundation work of this great Commonwealth. the supporters of this Goveirnment have something to learn as to what that organization means. Socialists say that the movement referred to is the organization of society as a whole, guided by Government; that is to say, that the evils of industrial evolution, which become every day more and more apparent to every thoughtful and observing person, must be removed, and that certain changes must be introduced by legislation that will permit of social evolution on healthy lines. It is because we recognise the course of this evolution that the Socialist movement has arisen. It is because the founders' of that movement have studied it, arid know the direction in which it is going, that they have become Socialists. They are the only body of people in the world who have a solution to offer, which they claim to be practical in connection with these great problems. I admit that there are Socialist's-in New. South Wales, for instance, we have the Australian Socialists' League-wh o wish to have great reforms brought about quickly. They wish to have them effected by Act of Parliament-in a day. extremists. They make attacks upon the Labour Party. They oppose us at the elections. They run candidates who generally forfeit their deposits. But they are not discouraged by that, and run them again. I think that one Socialist candidate of this school in New South Wales received nine votes in a labour constituency, That fact shows what strength there is behind their proposals. That is the answer which I give to those who twit us with holding the extreme views of the Socialists to whom I have referred. certain propositions enunciated by such Socialists, arid which agree to some extent with the principles of more moderate .Socialists, who do notwant reforms to be effected quite so quickly, and accuse the moderates of holding the opinions of the extremists. The healthier class of Socialists, of whom there are many, recoglikely to -lead to beneficial results is that roblem of the whole future for all who will in which would allow matters to develop themselves steadily and slowly, making changes in our law which would at the same time afford an opening for further developments on right and healthy lines. I desire to make a few quotations to show that there is a justification for certain of the claims which we put forward in support But,, apparently, of a position which will have to be faced very shortly. They will show that our views are not merely abstract, and will also indicate to what an extent advanced opinions have been uttered by leading men, great thinkers, who in their day were strongly denounced as being extremists, and as enunciating doctrines which were destiuctive of the rights of property. Let me show what extreme things have been said by some great writers even within a recent period. Henry George saidThis thing is absolutely certain : private property in land blocks the way of advancing civilization. The two cannot long co-exist. Either private property in land must be abolished, or, as has happened again and again in the history of mankind, civilization must turn back in anarchy and bloodshed. One could hardly have a stronger statement than that. Professor F. W. Newman saidTo make away into mercenary hands as an article of trade the whole solid area on which a nation lives is astonishing as an idea of statesmanship. That also is a very strong statement. In But those are connection with the principles of those who They are really against us. have fought against the private ownership of land, I might quote the old Mosaic law, which is to be found in the Book of Leviticus, and which should be remembered by every one of usThe land shall not be sold for ever, for the land 1 is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. That is true; we live upon this earth only for a short time, and it is a duty imposed upon us to endeavour to improve the conditions of the millions who will come after us. John StuartM ill , who is a favourite Those honourable members take author of even some of our Conservative friends, saidThe land of Ireland, the land of every country, belongs to the people of that country. No man made the land-it is the original inheritance of the whole species. Its appropriation is wholly a question o i general expediency. When private property in land is not expedient it is unjust. Next let me quote a passage from the great W. E. Gladstone. He saidThose persons who possess large portions of the earth's surface are not altogether in the same position as the possessor of mere personality. Personalty does not impose limitations on the actions and industry of man and the well-being of the community as possession of land does, and, therefore, I freely own that compulsory expropriation is admissible, and even sound in principle. A great man in Gladstone's position could scarcely have made a stronger statement than that the expropriation of land was sound in principle. What do my honourable friends opposite say to that? Spencer, who recently died, and who was a very great thinker, saidI t may be perceived that equity utters dictates will have to be recognised. The position to which we have not yet listened, and we may then learn that to deprive others of the use of the earth is to commit a crime inferior only in wickedby Professor Moore in the following quota-, ness to the crime of taking away their lives or personal liberties. Now, I do not wish, however, to deal with the land question. privately-owned land in Great Britain yields to the owners of the parchments which signify their titles to their properties, a revenue of .£250,000,000 per annum, and represents a capital Value of £8.000,000,000. to make of that fact is this: The greatest problem of to-day perhaps arises from the changes which are made in industry by the introduction of machinery is very well put by an American writer, Daniel de Leon, who saidThe ladder up which mankind has been climbing ford saystoward civilization, the ever more powerful tool of production, is the stormy centre around which the modern social storm rages.

Mr Spence. are gradually becoming obsolete. Men do not talk so strongly now about that phase of the subject The great work which has been done in that connection has led in Ireland and England, even in London itself, to the resuming of areas in municipalities, and the compelling of owners to pull down old buildings-thing s which we are also doing in Australia. The point I wish to establish is that we have gone beyond that stage when such proposals created alarm; we have now reached a period when statements regarding the taking over of machinery and the control of production create alarm. Just as in the other case the State found that it had to interfere to carry out the view of Archdeacon Wilson, to give the Herbert people a chance to live and so insure the preservation of the race, so we contend that in regard to machinery the same need that every individual is in is put very well tion: The fate which befalls the individual in society is not the fate which he merits always, but is I may remark that necessarily that which his group makes inevitable. Historic justice is not individual but social. I shall now read a quotation to show what Socialism is not, and then endeavour to make clear to honourable members the reason for these references to the land question The use which I wish and other changes of ideas. Robert Blatchford, who is an English Socialist, and the editor of the Clarion, gives in his Merrie England an answer, which I shall quote The position in reply to the statements made by the leader of the Government and other random Speakers about what Socialism is. BlatchSocialism does not consist in violently seizing upon the property of the rich and sharing it out amongst the poor. Socialists do not propose by a single Act of Parliament, or by a sudden revolution to put all men on an equality and compel them to remain so. Socialism is not a wild dream trees into our open mouths, the fish come out of the rivers and f r y themselves for dinner, and the looms turn out ready-made suits of velvet with golden buttons without the trouble of coaling the engine. Neither is'it a dream of stained-glass ar.gels, who never say damn, who always love their neighbours better than themselves, and who never need to work unless they wish to. No; Socialism is none of these things. It is Gladstone, in his great measure, a scientific scheme of national government entirely wise, just, and practical.

A perusal of its pages would give them more correct ideas on the subject. study, what they are aiming at. That they differ in opinion on details is a matter of no consequence, because that occurs in regard to all proposals. of Louis Gronland who has gone largely into details of how to run a co-operative Commonwealth, would not suit the English or Australian people. The Germanic brand of Socialism is intended for a people who have grown up under a different system, under which every man located, and has to fit into a plaGe. It would be natural for writers in that country to be tinged with bureaucratic ideas. But that is not the view generally adopted by English Socialists, and certainly not by the leaders'of the movement here which is being termed Socialism. I propose to read a quotation to illustrate the spirit which underlies Socialism. It displays an earnestness which should be recognised, and which justifies us in calling upon our opponents to show that our proposals are wrong and impracticable. It is taken from a work by J. Bruce Glasier on the religion of Socialism, and it is submitted to the consideration of honourable members because statements have been made in this Chamber about the religion of Socialism. The writer saysAnd by implying that Socialism has, or is, a religion-wha t must we be understood to mean? This and no more : that Socialism gives us our highest ideal of the conduct of l if e, and calls from us the highest service of thought, emotion, and deed-that it is our aim and prophecy, and to it is due the utmost and gladdest devotion of all our gifts and powers. The next quotation I propose to read is ta,ken, not from one of the great writers, but from John Tamlyn, of Burnley, a propagandist and active worker in the movement, who is well acquainted with the every-day life of the people, and does not reason out his subject on abstract lines. Here is one view which he presentsWhat is Socialism? mends itself to me as a practical working definition. Socialism is an attempt by State Organization of Labour to make every individual of the community perform some honest part of the labour of the community, and to prevent individuals becoming parasites, and shirking -behind the labour of their fellows. Socialism recognises the fact that man has the same selfish instincts as the other animals. Socialism recognises the further fact that when men are left to their own free w ill to seek their own good in Society-thei r tendency is, obeying the lower instincts of their nature, to seek their own good at the expense of their fellows. Socialism declares that in spite of all the preaching to love their neighbour, at present this is the case : the common good has decayed, and a few heap up masses of wealth on the one hand, Socialists understand, from close while thousands live in the direst poverty on the other. Socialism declares that such a state of things, which allows each individual to seek his own particular good at the expense of his fellows, is not Society but anarchy. ley. This quotation is taken from one of the propaganda tracts which are scattered broadcast among the masses of the people. AndI challenge any honourable member on the other side to say that it is not i . can be reasonable answer to the statements made by the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government that Socialism would make all men equal, destroy individuality of character, cause a dividing up, tempt the weak to live on the strong, and so on. But no Socialist advocates the dividing up or taking away of the property of other persons. Let honourable members refer to the writings of those who are authorities on the subject, and study those writings, and then let them discuss the problem on its merits. Only mischief is done by making political cries of words, instead of paying attention to the true meaning underlying those words. The leader of the Government is reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 1st September to have saidHis own belief contained two ideals : He believed it was a true ideal in politics to use the national power in every conceivable way to advance the welfare of the community. The other ideal he had was to leave individual power as free as he could, consistently with proper national legislation. The mistake of the Socialists was that they would destroy the one ideal so that they might push the other to extreme limits. Under the Socialist's ideal the weaker man would be leaning on the stronger. We accept the first two statements'. The ideals of the right honourable member, so far, are our ideals. But we deny that any Socialist holds the views that he sets forth in his third statement. To put such views forward as socialistic ideals is to misreI will give what compresent the Socialists, and it. shows . that the right honourable member, has, not. paid, proper attention .to the.subject. , Apparently he has been reading Lord Salisbury, from one of whose speeches I .will, quote a much stronger statement-on e which honourable members might use in their propagandist work LordSalisbury saidThere is Socialist legislation, and that is the most popular, which is pure robbery.

They are simply proposing to steal that which does not belong to them. With them no kind of negotiation or terms is possible. They are the enemies of the human race. must resist them with all the energy and organization in our power. Later on in the same speechI leave out a passage which has no relevancy to my present argument-h e saidThere is a third proposal to which the term Socialism is freely applied, and that is where it is proposed to use the machinery of the State for the purpose of achieving objects in which the community generally is agreed. Socialism in itself, I can see no harm whatever. It is the kind of socialism there spoken of that we advocate; and that is the kind of socialism in which the leader of the Government has declared himself to be a believer. We claim that he occupies the same ground as we do, so far as those views are concerned. Although he calls himself an anti-Socialist, his own words show him to be a Socialist. The first passage which I.have read from Lord Salisbury's remarks misrepresents the aims of Socialists. thing is proposed by them to which the term "" robbery"" could be rightly What we really wish to do is to prevent robbery. But the term robbery, or exploitation, is not used in the ordinary sense; it does not refer to something illegal. In dealing with these questions it must be our endeavour to get behind mere legal ideas. If that was not done in connection with all legislation, we should have no new laws. Our existence as a Parliament is an acknowledgment of the fact that existing conditions and existing laws require to be altered, and we are constantly old Acts. Therefore, the mere fact that something is legal does not justify it; it may at the same time be immoral and injurious. A law may suit the conditions of society at the time of its passing, but later on its enforcement may create great injustice. Moreover, our aims are impersonal. Altogether there has been a great misinterpretation of terminology. that if all exchanges between man and man were on the lines of equivalent for equivalent, no one would become richer than another. It is only because men are able by means of the law to take advantage of their fellows, that they succeed in becoming richer. It is claimed, of course, that superior ability should obtain its reward, and no doubt superior ability is sometimes a natural gift. At present, however, the Mr Spence. poor cannot give their children the opportunities which the rich are able to give them, because the struggle for existence is so keen that ambition can play We no part in their lives. I wish now to give one or two illustrations of the kind of socialism which we consider practical, which is now in operation, and which we think can be extended; and I will afterwards show the justification for extending it . In the old country there is a vast amount of voluntary co-operation, and millions of pounds are invested in co-operative concerns. In some Now, in that cases co-operative societies grow their own grain, carry it to their own ships, while their own people bake it. All concerned are shareholders, and the middleman has entirely disappeared. Such systems would prevent what we have recently read of in Victoria-the monopolization by middlemen, to the extent of thousands of pounds, of butter bonuses granted to assist the unfortunate farmers. In Kilmarnock, in Scotland, 86 per cent, of the community are shareholders in co-operative societies, while Noin several places in England, 60 per cent., and in many other places 10 per cent, of applied. the people are shareholders in co-operative societies. This co-operation is voluntary, and has been organized, not by great statesmen, but by the despised trade unionists. It is doing away with middlemen as unnecessary. In seventeen of the towns and municipalities of the United Kingdom, the profits on electric lighting last year amounted to between ,£300,000 and ,£400,000, while five municipalities which manage their own tramway systems obtained profits amounting to £400,000. Glasgow, which amending was included in the five, obtained a profit of over ,£200,000. Those are instances of the success of municipal socialism. We do not propose that everything shall be done by the State.. The term ""State,"" when used by socialistic writers, is understood to. mean the public, and the work I have spoken of Has been done by the people for the people. wishes to make co-operation compulsory, whereas in the cases to which he has referred the people acted voluntarily. except with the consent of the people. the people. with the consent of the majority of the people.

We desire to educate the people to such a point that they will appreciate action upon socialistic lines. Adam Smith said that it was impossible to legislate beyond the aggregate intelligence of the community. must agree to observe the law. Laws are made to compel small minorities to do that which the community voluntarily does. All laws are based upon the customs of the people, upon their voluntary observances. -No laws can be enforced except by the voluntary obedience of the majority of the people. Of course, there will always be a few people who will not obey the law voluntarily, and they have to be compelled. Laws are required even in connection with voluntary co-operative enterprises, for the registrakept in splendid order , and are under the tion of companies, for defining the duties of the directors, and for otherwise providing for the proper management of such concerns. We cannot do anything of a voluntary character except under the law which protects the individual. The State-owned tramways in Sydney notably illustrate the advantages to be derived from the application of the socialistic principle to that branch of enterprise. superior to those afforded by the Melbourne tramways, and the fares charged are among the lowest in the world. Much the same could be said about the Glasgow tramways. In Glasgow public washhouses have been established to which housewives can repair and perform in an hour or two work which under ordinary conditions would occupy a whole day. notice of honourable members the extent, to which the socialistic principle is applied in our midst. I am sorry that the honourable member for Wannon is not present, because I wish to direct attention to one or two cases in his electorate. In Hamilton, the largest town in the Western district of Victoria, sometimes called the Chicago of the West', gas is supplied by a private company at the rate of 13s. per 1,000 feet. _ A t Port Fairy, a very much smaller town, the gas works are owned by the municipality, which supplies gas at the rate of 10s. per 1,000 feet. ted as Port Fairy so far as the coal supply is concerned ? is only a fishing village, and cannot be compared to Hamilton. At Port Fairy, the baths are owned by the municipal council, whichprovides hot sea-water baths for 66., whereas the charge made at the privatelythe benefits of voluntary owned baths in Melbourne is is. 6d. pality to provide hot salt water baths for 6d. ? pality cannot afford to run its institutions for nothing. Now, returning to Hamilton. Some years ago the cattle sale-yards were in the middle of the town, and were in a disgracefully insanitary conditio?!. They were privately owned, and the two auctioneers who conducted most of the sales had to pay half their commission for the right to use the yards. Eventually the municipal authoiities woke up and established yards outside the town, which are ; charge of an inspector. There are now eight salesmen in Hamilton, all of whom use the yards, and the revenue derived by the municipality ranges from £ 5 0 0 to ,£800 per annum.. I have compiled from memory a list of the various operations which are peiformed amongst us upon a collective basis. I do not say that in all cases the State exercises control, but in every inThey provide facilities much stance the collective system is in operation. In fact, most people would consider it very difficult to eliminate that element. In the first place, we run our Defence Forces upon the collective system.

Among other things, the State also deals with sanitation and other matters relating to health. Municipalities are required to attend to local sanitary arrangements; and when they ne gleet to do so they are brought to their bearings by a Central Board of Health. In this way the people are coerced by the State to do anything that is necessary in the interests of public health. In Sydney, the city of the beautiful harbour, the State Government found it necessary to step in and appoint men to clean up the back yards of persons who would not do this work for themselves. That step was rendered necessary owing to the outbreak of the plague. whom were property-owners, had appointed an inspector, who carefully shut his eyes when he visited premises owned by them. One lane which had been passed as clean was subsequently inspected by State officials, and 70 tons of filth were removed from it. The fact is that we cannot do without coercion. It is necessary for the State, in the interests of the community, to interfere from time to time with private enterprise. In spite of the adverse conditions surrounding almost the whole of our industrial system, the average length of life of persons engaged in industries has been increased by about two years since the State insisted upon the observance of sanitary laws. more than two years. estimated the average, but I would rather understate it than overstate it.

The Government of Ne,w Zealand own coal mines, and in 'Australia the State carries on assaying .and prospecting. The Postmaster-General is a strong Socialist, in the sense that he would give every possible assistance to those engaged in the mining industry. As a member of the State Parliament, he showed that he favoured Socialism, by supporting the erection of public batteries for the use of miners. A considerable sum of money has been spent by the States Governments of New South Wales and Victoria in prospecting, so that it may well be said that we, as a community, engage in mining. We interfere with private enterprise to such an extent that there is scarcely any branch of industrial lif e in which the State does not take a part. We also engage in the export trade, and the New South Wales Government has established a fund for the relief of those injured Aldermen of the city,. most of while following mining pursuits.

But Socialists recognise-and the opposition to the idea is now one of the biggest difficulties which they have to surmount-that machinery is in the same position, and its control must be taken in hand by the community. Machinery is being introduced very rapidly, That statement by Mr Sidney and it is displacing men. When land -was occupied only by sheep the door was dosed on the natural opportunity, which all should have, of access to the source of all wealth. That is generally recognised and admitted, and we claim that the position is exactly We do not be the same with respect to machinery.

67,Mr Kelly,"Would the honourable memI do not object to reasonable interjections, but I am now dealing with a very important question, which I hope the honourable member for Wentworth will study, because I am unwilling to give up hope that the honourable member may some day become a democrat. It is only because honourable members have not studied the matter that they fail to remachinery develops into a monopoly we cognise that the position with respect to land and machinery is the same. After all, what is machinery? We have taken many of the latent forces of nature from the land, the present industrial system is distinctly which is the storehouse of nature. We have exploited nature to some extent, and have availed ourselves of some of its forces. We have made use of substances found in nature. Iron and steel have been placed in certain relations to each other, and, utilizing certain forces of nature, we have taken and whisky trusts. We say that here we have control of them. The principle is exactly the same as that involved in men taking control of land, and shutting other men off thatland. The man taking control of machinery which displaces labour, shuts that labour out from benefiting by the introduction of that machinery. So that, unless we have machinery under the control of the community, and unless production becomes production for use of the community, rather than for profit of the individual, we can have no hope that we shall be able to do away with the social evils and misery which now exist. I think honourable members must see that. They are aware of the alarm which was created by the proposal to nationalize land; but that that is a wise proposal is now recognised, and admitted even by the Premier of Victoria. honourable gentleman has undertaken to give effect to the principle, and no one is likely middlemen who are now engaged in the to charge him with being a Socialist, or, at all events, a conscious Socialist. The other half of the Prime Minister has advocated the same principle, and I wish honourable members opposite to see that it is inconsistent on their part to abuse the nationalithat that can be done. I defy any man who zation of other things when, to a limited extent at all events, they agree to the nationalization of land. It need hardly be asserted that, no one proposes that we should take anything from anybodyWe propose to take land, but we do not propose to do so without compensating the owner of that land. As a matter of fact, we compensate him handsomely. We pay him for something he never produced at all. We pay him for more than his improvements, because he very often takes the unearned increment to which he is on no moral ground entitled. In connection with the nationalization of machinery, we see no reason why it may not be gradually effected, by following on the lines which I have already indicated. We may gradually extend the number of factories managed and controlled by the State, or 'it may be that when the ownership of may see fit to take over that monopoly. This is the present policy, in a practical way, of the Labour Party. The trend of in the direction of trusts and monopolies. In America the whole telegraphic system of the country is in the -hands of two companies, bossed by a single syndicate. There is there also what is known as the "" TripleAlliance,"" in the shape of the oil, sugar, already reached a condition of monopoly in one industry, the tobacco industry, and that other monopolies are coming. When industries have reached that stage we say that the community should take them over. We do not say that they should all be taken over now. We are quite willing that the evolution should go on, and should in fact be conducted by the anti-Socialists, if honourable members please, who are at present working as hard as they can for Socialism. Those of us who have studied these questions know that we are proceeding in the right way, and we desire that others shall come to believe that if is the right thing that monopolies should be taken over by the State. All monopolies enormously cheapen the cost That of production, and we shall be able to do away with a vast number of unnecessary general struggle for existence, and at the same time serve to increase the cost of the article to the consumer. We desire that all that should be wiped out altogether, and it is only by the adoption of Socialism gives any study to this question to propose any other means that is not a revolution. We cannot change men suddenly by Act of Parliament; the alteration can be effected only by a gradual change in the ideas by which they are governed. Unfortunately many persons go around with their mental eyes shut, and they fail to recognise these things.

68,Mr Spence,"I am not quite a fool.she has had to bump him with an umbrella before he has recognised her. We desire that the minds of men shall be concentrated honestly on this subject, not for any party reasons at all, but because we believe that when they think the matter out. fully they will realize that the Labour Party, whose members have studied these questions, are not proposing drastic and extreme measures. We do not propose to put society on a right footing by means of Acts of Parliament. anything from anybody, but we do propose to allow to the poor and down-trodden some chance of a reasonable living. What has been our work, so far, but to attempt to secure by means of trades unions proper conditions, and something like a living wage for working men, and by our factory laws to secure for them reasonable hours of labour? These measures are all palliatives of existing industrial conditions. The real and final solution of the question must come from every one having an equal opportunity to earn his livingj and from having that opportunity assured to him. do his best when he knows that the harder he works the' more the price of his labour will be cut down? What nonsense it is to talk of individuality being developed under such conditions ! fierce struggle for existence in which the workers are driven to work by the lash and by the fear of starvation staring them in the. face; and, to make matters worse, their employers sneer at them. I know that the honourable member for Parramatta is an intelligent man and a student. worked amongst the coal-miners himself, and he knows that there are men in this country engaged in manual labour who are equal in ability to honourable members in this House. We who have worked amongst them, and know them as mates, are aware that the intelligence, and the brain power of this country is not concentrated in its Parliaments, and certainly not in the Commonwealth Parliament. telligent men have less class-feeling than somehonorable members would think. They have no hatred against the employing class. that it is the system that is at fault, not the individuals who benefit from the system. Personally, I am an admirer of the tyrant, wherever he may be found. He has his value. I have often said, and I say again, that if I had a hand in the erection of monuments to eminent people I would erect them to the tyrants of the world. I have no feeling of hatred towards the most avaricious capitalist or sweater. He makes men realize that there are faults in the social system under which they live. He awakens them from apathy, and causes them to realize the necessity for bringing about a more healthy condition of affairs. Many of those who condemn the Socialist pro gramme clearly show that they have no knowledge of the subject. They merely We do not propose to take appeal to the prejudice and the class-feeling of people. The preaching of reactionary doctrines never had any other. effect than to lead the masses in the direction of democracy. I had a number of other points to make, but I will not deal with them to-day. I should require a couple of hours more to complete my points, but I will leave them for another opportunity. I have made a remark about the constitutional position. I wish to repeat it. It is a fact which honourable members opposite must realize-that the people of Australia elect their Parliament on the broadest franchise, and that nothing in the way of legisWhat impulse is there for a man to lation can be done except with their approval. We must demand that every candidate who submits himself to the people shall state definitely what he proposes to do. The people should set their facesWe see now a against the independent-the man who hides what he intends) to do when he gets into Parliament, and who takes upon himself the privilege of declaring that he is to be the best judge of his actions as a representative. That is not how representative institutions should be conducted. It He has is not in accordance with the true principles of democratic government. I again ask this Government what they propose to do? They seem to have no policy except to appeal to class prejudices. The Government declare themselves to be anti-Socialists; but I hope the people will realize that it is not safe, especially at the present juncture, to entrust the administration of affairs These into men who have no' definite programme. There is safety only in intrusting the government to men who know what they want to do; because when a man has studied a They are aware subject, and knows what he wishes to achieve, he is less likely to fall into errors than are those who are driven along blindly. The Government having no policy in a concrete form, simply live on the vague misunderstanding of a word. They are supported in the country by the ideas of men like Mr Walpole, who' has argued that marriage is a luxury, and who would deny to a working man the chance of going to a theatre or having a drink of beer perhaps to make him forget his miseries. to appeal to the country on the policy that marriage is to be declared a luxury? They should declare what they mean, or it must be dragged out of them. I am sure that the honourable member for Wilmot, before he will consent to vote with the Government, will want to know what he is committing himself to. he would be opposed to anything that could be shown to be for the general good. That is all that the party to which I belong is seeking. We have a right to be judged by our platform, and not by any prejudice created over the mere misunderstanding of a word. adopted the title of the Labour Party, not because it is a nice sounding term, but because it describes our aims. The very adoption of the word labour is a proof that we intend to use our powers in the interests if our Electoral Act provided for the holdof mankind-for the development of all that will promote the happiness of manhood and womanhood. That is the great aim which we have before us. sire to so change the conditions under which society is governed, that men and women shall possess equally a good environMinisterial statement fizzled out because it ment, to the end that we may be able to produce a race of whose qualities, physical and mental, we shall have just cause to be proud. that a motion of no-confidence in the Government can be discussed without the introduction of personalities. The honourable member for Darling lifted this debate from the region of personalities, and carried us into the clouds, and it is now time for us to descend to earth. two matters on which he touched in the same manner as he did in his electioneering campaign. He tried to make his constituents believe that if the free-traders had their way they would impose a duty on seven or eight hundred articles, which are now free. But he forgot to tell them that the Tariff, as introduced by the right honWe have, however, decided to sink our orable member for Adelaide, was considerably modified by the free-traders. the protectionist half of the Ministry. Darling has a perfect right to give free traders credit for what they do. We are quite prepared to stand our ground. We have been able to defend our position. New South Wales has been dragged into this discussion a good deal, and very unnecessarily, I think. But she is quite able Do the Government intend to look after her own finances. At the last general election, she showed the Labour Party that she intends to do without their aid, for she returned to power a party which is not at their domination.

We may have to go to the country very shortly. will then have to consider his own chances of re-election. ously. We have to look at all these matters straight in the face. The motion for the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, of which the honourable and learned member for Indi gave notice just prior to the moving of this motion of censure, was merely an electioneering move. Almost all the talk about the necessity for revising the Tariff has come from two or three of the protectionist representatives of Victoria, We do not hear anything about it from the protectionists of the other States. terms of the honourable and learned member's motion, however, are so indefinite, that it might'equally well have been brought forward by a free-trader. The free traders are just as anxious as are the protectionists for a satisfactory Tariff. orable member say that the giving of notice of the motion was a political move? diately before the moving of this motion of want of confidence. Although the honourable and learned member for Indi could have given notice of his motion months ago, he deferred doing' so until the present time, so that if there happens to be an election he will be able to tell the electors that he was ready to do something for them. In my opinion, there should be no alteration of the Tariff until the constituencies have spoken in regard to the matter. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who was at the time Prime Minister, let it be distinctly understood in Victoria prior to the late general elections that he declared for fiscal peace, and that position was afterwards accepted by the right honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Bland. When the new House met, the three parties had agreed that in the interests of legislation the fiscal issue should there are only two parties in the House, the question is being brought forward again, so that if there is an appeal to the country, those who have gatven notices of motion may be able to profit by their action. The Prime Minister has been twitted for refraining from referring to the old-age pensions question when making his policy speech; but we must accept his statement that he did so through an oversight, and we know that the policy of the Government in regard to the matter was declared by the Attorney General in another place, and subsequently by another Minister. The. leader of the Opposition has stated that it was the intention of his party to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme during the present Parliament, whether the States were satisfied or not, to use his own words. The Government, however, propose first to consult the States' in the matter, which is the more reasonable course to take. At the present time New South Wales and Victoria, which contain two-thirds of the population of the Commonwealth, have old-age pensions systems in force, and if there is anything in the boast of the Labour Party The that Queensland and Western Australia are under Labour control, I ask why do they not bring old-age pensions laws into force in those States? The old-age pensions system is a very difficult one for the Commonwealth to provide for, because, in order to obtain through the Customs House the £1,500,000 which would be necessary to establish it, £^6,000,000 would have to be raised, in order to comply with the provision of the Constitution which requires that three-fourths of the Customs revenue raised by the Commonwealth shall be returned to the States. It would be preposterous to propose the levying of so much additional taxation, and the fact shows that the Labour Party are not in earnest when they speak about providing for Commonwealth old-iage pensions without making preliminary arrangements with the States.",32,Opposition Members Hear Hear

130,Mr Fuller,"I do not say anythingbecause I believe that it was necessary for us to combine in the interests of constitutional and responsible government. I went before my constituents as a free-trader, and as such was returned to the State Parliament, as well as to the first Federal Parliament. present Parliament recognised that they were in a minority, and had to consider the best position to take up, in view of the fact that they had been defeated on the fiscal issue. We have not given up our free-trade principles. Let not my honourable friend from Tasmania think that I , at any rate, have done so. We have entered upon this coalition for the life of the present Parliament, believing that it is necessary in order to secure responsible government in the interests of the people. The' honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, when speaking in this House shortly after the last general election, said that now that we had a fiscal truce there was practically no difference between honourable members sitting behind the Deakin Government and those of the then Opposition. An honourable alliance between those honourable members was the only way in which to secure a return to responsible government. ance between the two sections supporting the Government, what are the terms on which it is based ? cerned, the terms arethat as long as the Ministry carries on constitutional and responsible government in a proper way, without raising the fiscal issue during the life of this Parliament, it will receive my support. As soon as this Parliament has expired I shall be perfectly free to go to my own or to any other constituency, and to fight, as I have done in the past, for the free-trade and other principles in which I believe. member for Darling, in the course of his speech this morning, said that honourable members on this side of the House were only the sham friends of the farmers; their true friends being the members of the Labour Party, and those at present in alliance with them. them a land tax. members will acknowledge that I have endeavoured to do my duty to the farmers, as well as other classes, of Australia ever since I entered this House. Where were those honourable members, who now profess so strong a desire to help the farmers and the pastoralists of Australia, when I appealed time after time to the But free-traders on entering the House, a year or two ago, to secure a remission of the fodder duties, in order that the pastoralists and others in New South Wales and Queensland, who had suffered severely from the drought, and whose flocks were dying by thousands every day, might secure fodder with which to save the lemnants of them? Where were the Labour Party, who now pose as the friends of the farmers, when I and the honourable member for Canobolas sought a revision of the fodder duties? Did they endeavour to assist us? of the Labour Party may have done so, but the party as a whole did not. At that time they were in possession of the Opposition cross-benches, and were driving the Barton Administration. They occupied a position of vast influence, but while they now pose as men who desire to pass legislation to assist the great farming and pastoral interests of Australia they never ' attempted then to exercise the great power they possessed to assist them. The assertion of the honourable member for Darling, that the Government and their supporters are sham friends of the farmers, reminds me that the party of which he is so strong a member has itself been guilty of a few shams. It will be remembered that -when the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was introduced by the Barton Government, the right honourable member for Adelaide, who was then Minister of Trade and Customs, resigned because the Cabinet refused to accept his view that it should also include certain navigation clauses. If the right honourable member was anything at all in that Administration, he was the spokesman of the Labour Party, and I think that the way in which that party subsequently stood by him redounds to its credit. Subsequently the Navigation Bill was introduced, and was submitted to a Royal Commission, but the Watson Administration proposed to insert these navigation clauses, which then formed part of that measure, in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. What was its object? The Government knew perfectly well that, as the labour representatives from Western Australia were strongly opposed to the inclusion of these clauses in the Bill,",35,Opposition Members Hear Hear

Every one was. agreed that the proper course had been adopted in referring them to the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, but the Watson Government brought forward a proposal to embody them in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, in order that it might be whitewashed, together with its supporters, in the labour constituencies of Australia. The whole proposal was an absolute sham. The late Government knew that there was no likelihood of securing the insertion of those clauses. There was a second sham perpetrated by the late Administration in connection with the preference clause. that so strongly was I supported by the trade unions in my constituency at the last election-so true a representative of their interests did they regard me-that , notwithwill refuse to register under the Bill.

But the services of the honourable and learned member far Darling Downs were brought into requisition, and an amendment was accepted by the late Prime Minister, which meant that a union with any political ""trimmings"" or character would not be able to take advantage of the Arbitration Court. Now we are told by the honourable member for Darling and others that, in consequence of the amend-, I may here say ment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella having been accepted by the House in preference to the amendment of the late Prime Minister, trade unions I say that the late Prime Minister and the late Government emasculated the Bill, from a trade union point of view , when they 7 accepted the amendment of the honourable The amendment of the and learned member for Darling Downs. That, in my opinion, is sham No. 2. There is also another sham which was perpetrated by the Watson Government, supported by the Labour Party. That is in connection with the employment of lawyers in the Arbitration Court. Those of us who have had close communication with the It is the system adopted by the trade unions of Australia, as I . have had in my constituency, know that one point insisted upon was that no lawyers should be employed in the Arbitration Court. gave way to the honourable' and learned member for Indi. honourable members who are supposed to represent the labour political unions throughout Australia? The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has shown himself to be a champion ""bridge builder,"" not only in this but in other matters which have come before Parliament. The services of that honourable and learned member were again brought into requisition, with the result that the Prime Minister accepted a disgraceful suggestion that lawyers should be allowed to appear in the Arbitration Court with the consent of the President.

The honourable and learned member for Corinella, and practically all members, including the leader of the Opposition, thought that those terms and conditions should be set out on the face of the Bill. The amendment, which was adopted, read as follows :And provided further that no such preference should be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is, in tbe opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants. The present leader of the Opposition proposed to substitute for that amendment the following: The Court, before directing that preference shall be given to the members of an organization, shall be satisfied that the organization substantially represents the industry' affected in point of than in proving what was provided numbers and competence of its members. The honourable member for Darling is, perhaps, the most experienced trade unionist in this House, having, I understand, been president of the union which he represents for some fifteen years. said that in consequence of the amendment which was carried, his union will refuse to register. applies to his union does not apply to all the unions in Australia. numbers of shearers join that union from time to time, then cease to be members, and go back to their homes, and subsequently join again. I can, myself, see that there would be some difficulty in their case. The honourable member said there would be great difficulty, and I am quite prepared to accept his statement, because he is a man who has had great experience. admits that that difficulty would not apply to other unions. there be in the application of the amendment of the Minister of Defence to the coal-mining industry? ficulty would there be in finding out whether there was a majoritv of the workers in favour of giving preference to unionists ? There would be none whatever. Take the great coal-mining industry of Illawarra and Newcastle. Practically the whole, of the men engaged in the trade belong to the union. that trade, which extended beyond the limits of one State-and that would be the only kind of dispute to which this Bill could apply-ther e would be no difficulty in ascertaining the opinion of the majority of .the men engaged in the industry. But there is a further point. There are a large .number of workers who think that their whole welfare depends upon the passage of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. We have an Arbitration Act in force in New South Wales which deals with all State disputes, and will continue to deal with them whether the Federal Bill be passed or not. The Federal measure is intended to deal with disputes of magnitude extending beyond the limits of a State. In the great coal-mining industry in which, as I have said, a large number of persons in my constituency are engaged, if a dispute should occur and should extend beyond the limits of the State, there would be no difficulty in proving the opinion of the majority of the workers. There would, indeed, be less difficulty in proving the opinion of the majority for in the proposal of the ex-Prime Minister-that the applicants "" substantially represent "" the majority. A majority is a simple clear thing that the smallest child in a public school could understand. All that the representatives of any industry would He has have to prove to the Court would be that they had the vote of a simple majority. prove first of all that they were likely to be Knowing how affected by an award. sentation as provided for in the honourable member's amendment would have to be argued about in every case that came before the Judge in every possible connection. It would be a matter for judicial interpretation. It would be a matter of Judge-made law in each case brought before the Court.

In the debate on this question, the leader of the Opposition made these remarks, which may be found on page 4045 of Hansard-The practice in nearly every case, in all the Arbitration Courts, has been to grant a preference only when the majority, reasonably ascertained, is in favour of such a preference. I am not so foolish as to anticipate that the practice laid down by the Arbitration Courts of New Zealand and New South Wales will be departed from by the Judge appointed to the Federal tribunal. Any one who imagines that the Judge in the Federal Court would lay down a new line of procedurethat he would grant preferences to unions which manifestly represented only a minority of those employed in the industry or in the district in respect of which the preference was asked-can not have paid any attention to the general procedure under legislation of this kind. As the honourable member very properly pointed out, the practice in the Arbitration Courts has been to grant a preference only when the majority has been reasonably ascertained. The Government do not desire that preference shall be granted to minorities. Feeling perfectly satisfied that that was the wish of tlie honourable member, and, I presume, of other members of his Administration, I cannot understand why they took such strong exception to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. able. that on various matters in connection with find that I voted on that occasion, the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , the not against preference to unionists, but late Government had to back down. In as to the conditions on which it should fact, they had backed down on so many ocbe granted; when they know that all casions, that they were tired of being de| sides of this House, including the late feated. question, and the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella appeared to afford a favorable opportunity for them to make a stand. I feel that I am quite safe in saying that a number of the followers of the late Ministry did not approve of the action of its head on that occasion. We know that the late Ministry climbed down in connection with, first, the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and then the political nature of the unions. We also know that they climbed down in connection with the question of lawyers appearing in phrase casts no the Arbitration Court and agreed to allow Being them to appear only with the consent of its president. I felt, as any honourable man must have felt, that the late Prime Minister was tired of this continual climbing down. He felt that themoving of this amendment by the honourable and learned member for Corinella furnished to him the opportunity to make a stand, which he did, although he practically said that there was very little difference between that amendment and his own. So far as I could see, there was about as much difference between the amendments as there is between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. When all these circumstances are pointed out in the various labour centres, where the unions have in some cases passed resolutions objecting to the action of their representatives here, in connection with this Bill, it will not be a matter for the consideration of the delegates only, but also of the rank and file, who constitute those bodies. For example, the men who constitute the union in the Illawarra district-ove r 2,000 strong -are , as regards political and other matters, amongst the best informed class in the He further saidcommunity. Many honourable members, if they went amongst those miners, would be surprised to find out what a grasp and knowledge they have of political matters. When I , who have hitherto enjoyed their confidence, and I believe their respect and esteem, point out to these Illawarra miners that the sole thing I did was not to vote against preference to unionists It will be remembered that result.

So far as I am concerned, I will support the Government on this occasion. I . am not altogether enamoured of the alliance which has been come to, but I believe that it was necessary in the interests of good government, and the electors of Australia have declared in favour of a. fiscal truce, for the time being,, at any rate. Even the honourable member for Melbourne Ports went to the country pledged to the observance of a fiscal truce. MoreN o ; from Sydney. over, I represent a district whose people belong to two of the large producing interests of the Commonwealth -the dairying industry and the coal-mining industry. It is the producers on whom Australia depends, not upon the great cities I hope that of Melbourne and Sydney, which are mere parasites upon the country. The wealth of Australia is earned by her pastoralists, her farmers, her miners, and her other producers, who are spread over the face of the If the honourable member for land, not by the few manufacturing' industries on the banks of the Yarra and the Parramatta. That is shown very clearly when we get a severe drought, and the pastoral industry, for example, suffers. Therefore, anything that would cripple our primary resources would be one of the worse things that could happen to us. I believe, however, that the legislation proposed, and the socialistic doctrines promulgated, by the Labour Party, and those who support them-and their supporters now include the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable members for Bourke and Hume-would , if put into force, be inimical to the best interests of Australia, and I shall, therefore, fight against it as much as I can.",42,Opposition Members Hear Hear

That state of things appears to me to make it unnecessary to try to prove that the Administration does not possess the confidence of the House. all times practically dependent on the Opposition to keep a House. There are, however, one or two other matters to which I wish to refer in the few minutes which remain before the adjournment-becaus e I cannot be expected to finish my speech today. One of the facts that lie before us at the present time is that the three parties in this House are to all intents and purposes one party, and that that is why the present confusion exists. has been in power since the Parliament met -and this is the third Administration which ""ave have had-ha s put the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill in the forefront of its proin socialistic legislation, but I cannot undergramme. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat brought in the B ill, and professed to be in favour of its principles; but if he had been true to those principles the measure would by this time have been placed on the statute-book. When he was defeated in Committee, however, on a question of detail, he resigned office in a pique, and the Watson Administration supplanted his own. That Government, in its turn, resigned because it was defeated on its proposal to grant preference to unionists, which it regarded of vital importance. have the Reid-McLean Administration, and the question naturally suggests itself, "" W ill *hey make anything vital?"" 'reflect credit on the intelligence of the Housei f the three parties find themselves so much in general agreement-and almost every member of the House has declared that the measure is urgently needed-and cannot agree as to details. that there is no opposition to the principles embodied in the B ill , and that fact is borne out by the action of each party as it has come into power in turn, in declaring that the first measure on its programme would be the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. What we really want to know is, When the first Parliament asare honourable members sincere in their professions of belief in the principle of conciliation and arbitration? Are they in , earnest in the desire to settle industrial disputes amicably and peaceably by judicial authority? orable member is right, and that beyond the shadow of a doubt what we have seen is sheer and unmitigated political hypocrisy. If honourable members are anxious for industrial conciliation and arbitration, why has there been They are obviously at all this waste of time over details? We have been here for many months, and have nothing to show as the result of our labours. The only point upon which we differ is as to who shall occupy the Treasury bench, and that fact is a reflection upon the earnestness and integrity of honourable members.. If we were earnest in our desire to legislate in the best interests of the country, we should put an end to the present unseemly and un-Godly scramble Every Government thai for office. I could understand the last two Governments being displaced, if they were succeeded by a new Administration which was prepared to declare its utter disbelief stand any section of honourable members pretending to be in favour of the measure that has been before us since the beginning of the session, and making a dispute with regard to petty details a pretext for ousting the Government from office.

As a matter of fact, the present Government is an anti-social' istic combination is truth?"" has never yet been answered, and the question ""What is Socialism?"" is not likely to elicit a satisfactory reply until men are supplied with consciences, as well as with the power of reasoning, and are able to appreciate mental and moral truths. The root of the word ""Socialism"" is the Greek word socios, meaning a friend, an ally. Therefore, Socialism means nothing else than an alliance, a friendship, a brotherhood, an association or co-operation for a given purpose. All Governments are in their very essence socialistic. If the words ""Socialism"" and ""alliance"" are to be regarded as synonymous, we should not seek for any special definition of the former term, because we are sufficiently familiar with the meaning of the latter. If honourable members in this House were divided into Socialists and anti-Socialists, the latter other Legislature might well be proud. would eventually prove to be anarchists, because anti-Socialism and anarchy are practically identical. Those who are opposed to Socialism, or alliance for the purpose of maintaining law and order and good government-and the term is capable of no other definition-mus t needs be anarchists. I must protest against the references which have been made to paid agitators in the Labour Party, and to the engagement of Mr Tom Mann as an organizer. We have been told that we have set a bad example, but we might be more reasonably charged with following a bad example. We have followed in the footsteps of the Employers' Federation, and we claim that, whilst one side is using its wealth to hire agitators, the Labour Party, which has no press to support it, would be very foolish indeed if it failed to take advantage of the services of a man who is so well fitted for the work of organization. So long as one class in the community is permitted to employ agitators, the other side cannot be blamed for following its example. A great deal has been said during tbe course of this debate-in order that it may be scattered far and wide-agains t the -morality of this proceeding. As to the 811 2 morality of the teaching of our representative, I claim' that it will compare very favourably indeed with the unseemly and dangerous instruction imparted by the paid agitator of the Employers' Federation. At any rate, we never acknowledge or countenance! any attack upon the sanctity of the marriage tie. But the hired agitator of the Employers' Feneration has descended to the lowest depths of immorality by declaring that marriage, which is the foundation of our family life, and the one institution in our civilization that is worth preserving, isa luxury which should be placed in the same category as long beers. That is the teaching of this moralist, this instructor in the ethics of politics. He has proclaimed to the world that the Labour Party is to be re* probated for all that is vile, because it will not endorse that sentiment. To me it is manifest that the present Administration do not possess the confidence of this House, and if for no other reason than is supplied by the programme which they have presented, they should be deposed. So far as the members of the Government are concerned individually, there are no men in this House whom I should be more pleased to see upon the Treasury bench. They are gentlemen of whom . this Parliament or any I find no fault with the personnel of the Cabinet, but I claim that it is possible to respect them without in any way agreeing with their political views. I very much deplore the washing of dirty political linen which has taken place during the course of this debate. Whatever our differences may be, I trust that they will always be differences of principle, and that our respect -for each other will be maintained. In my opinion, the coalition between the avowed protectionists and the declared free-traders in this House is an unholy one. On the other hand, the alliance between the Labour Party and the liberal protectionists is a natural alliance, because their members have many things in common. The liberal protectionists are democrats. Personally I hope to see the day when the term "" Labour Party"" will ' disappear. "" Democratic Party"" would suit my taste far better. Nevertheless the word ""labour"" is associated with all that is honourable, and I have no objection to it. But there are those who do object to it, and I hope, as the result of this alliance, to see a new party spring into existence which will absorb both. We shall then have a clear line of demarcation between the democrats and the conservatives. Our alliance is not based upon a",44,Opposition Members Hear Hear

History demonstrates that no movement will ever make for the good of the community which is founded upon a mere negation. If we are to achieve any good, it must be by having something positive. What is there that is positive in the programme of the Government? Nothing but what has been taken out of the policy submitted by the Watson Administration. Some time ago, a very ludicrous advertisement was posted up all round Melbourne. It pictured a certain distinguished gentleman in a very unbecoming, not to say nude, state. Later on, his figure was obliterated, and the public were informed that he had gone to be clothed at a certain establishment in the city. The recollection of that advertisement leads me to sayspeaking in a political sense-that he went to the bathing boxes of the Labour Party, stole their clothes, and came back dressed in arbitration breeches, a conciliation coat, a free-trade waistcoat, and a protectionist belltopper. The present Administration found the Labour Party bathing, .and stole their clothesv Such a grotesque figure is not likely to commend himself to the people as one who is properly clothed, and in such a state of mind as to warrant him being charged with the conduct of the political affairs of the Commonwealth. Because he is so grotesquely arrayed I think he should be arrested, and a speedy termination put to his Ministerial existence. If I am a prophet as well as a parson, we shall find upon an appeal to the electors that the Government do not possess their confidence. The Ministerial programme is a miserable piece of patch-work, which contains nothing but that which has been filched from their predecessors in office. Debate adjourned.
