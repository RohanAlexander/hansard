That company has committed no offence at all. I saw one of the directors of the' company, and made certain suggestions to him, which he has put before his board. Those suggestions were on the lines of the Minister see statement which I made to the House. in favour of action along those lines, an assurance which I regarded as quasi-o&\cial, because this gentleman, though not the chairman of the company, had been its chairman. As he has had ample opportunity to put the matter before the board, and has done so, and has seen me subsequently, I assume that the company is favorable to the suggestion that,, if by any means we can open up new markets for it, and rid it of the control of the German capitalists, it will readily fall in with our views. * NON-PRODUCTION OP PAPERS. magazines and newspapers I wish to speak on a matter of privilege.

The best information we could get led us to believe that the value per yard was about 6d. and on that value fixed a duty equal to what we considered 30 per cent, on foreign imports and 25 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. Since the rates were imposed we have ascertained that they are higher than what the Government intended. A t the present time. I do not think it is possible to have the rates altered on this side of Christmas.

They all agreed that the proposal I placed before them was a f a i r one. posal?

We adopted a foot basis, have expressed ourselves as willing to do in connection with the importation of fodder.

Speaking from memory, Mr Peake, of South Australia, has not yet sent any reply, nor has Mr Earle, of Tasmania. The Premier of Western Australia has informed us that in that State they desire to import 3,500 or 5,000 tons of maize, but as we have maize available on the east coast of Australia we decided not to allow maize to be imported free of duty.

LAND TAX BILL. Debate resumed from 12th December (vide page 1759), on motion by Mr. That this Bill be now read a second time. I have no desire to detain the House at any length, but this is undoubtedly a measure of great importance, opening up a wide field of discussion, and increasing very considerably the taxation borne by the land-owners of the community. I am inclined to think that the origin of this B ill is to be directly traced, nob to the necessities of the war, but to the thirteenth plank in the Australian Labour party's official platform, which provides, ""All ture to be allotted from the proceeds of direct taxation."" We know that the Estimates provide for increased expenditure in connection with the naval and military defence of Australia, and, according to their own pledged platform, the Government and their supporters propose that the cost of defence shall be defrayed out of the proceeds of direct taxation. Such a proposition is grossly unfair. Our tlie Attorney-General, upon defence system benefits the whole of the community, and its cost should be borne by the community as a whole. ThisB ill means the raising of an increased amount by means of land taxation, and w ill extend the area over which our land tax legislation w ill apply, since Crown lessees throughout Australia will come within its scope. That is a very important extension of the principle. sion to be found in the Bill? announced that it is the intention of the Government to tax Crown lessees. An important aspect of this question is that the Land Tax Assessment B ill of 1910, as originally introduced, did apply to Crown lessees, but that order. I submit, sir, that there is no reference in this B ill to the taxation of leaseholds, and that the honourable member is not in order in discussing something which must be dealt with in a subsequent measure. B ill , "" AB ill for an Act to amend the Land TaxA c t 1910,"" opens up the whole question of the taxation of land, whether it be leasehold or freehold property. The honourable member for Darling Downs is therefore quite in order. ment B ill of 1910 originally included Crown lessees, but a protest was made, and section 29 of the Act, as finally passed, exempted Crown leases. Thus for practically four years Crown lessees have been exempted; but we are now in formed that certain of them are to be included in the area of the tax. If there were good and valid reasons for the House unanimously excluding specified C r o w lessees from the Act of 1910, in what way have conditions changed, and what are the reasons for including them now? We have had no explanation from the Government for this extraordinary Naval and Military expendichange of attitude, nor have we heard opinions expressed by the representatives of those large areas of Australia where these Crown lessees are found. The honourable member for Grey has referred to the matter, but the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Capricornia, and other Queenslanders,",10,South Australia N Squadrons

119,Mr Groom,"The Land Tax Assesshave yet to be heard upon this proposed change of the law, by which large numbers of persons in their electorates are to be subjected to additional taxation. This matter is particularly important to the State of Queensland, which it probably affects more than any other State. The total area of Queensland is 429,120,000 acres. In 1912, the total alienated area was 15,874,202 acres, with 9,577,037 acres in process of alienation; but the total area occupied under leases and licences was no less than 317,615,144 acres, consisting of 227,410,480 acres held under pastoral lease, 42,465,360 acres held under occupation licence, and 47,179,483 acres held in grazing farms and homesteads, the rest being held under other forms of occupation, which I need not specify. A great portion of this large area of land will be brought under the taxation proposals of the Government. The lands of the States are a legitimate source of revenue to them. It is fair and proper that the States should draw from them, in the shape of rents from their tenants, as much revenue as they can. That is a distinct relation between the Crown and its tenants. In the fixing of rents certain prescribed conditions are laid down, and the States endeavour, as a rule, to obtain fair rental values. Ont o p of this relation between the State and its tenants an outside agency, so far as ownership is concerned in this case, the Commonwealthcomes in , endeavouring to obtain revenue from the same tenants. should be the revenue sources of the States are likely to be imperilled by the action of the Commonwealth. This is a very important consideration. ing to the last Land Report for Queensland-that for 1913The gross area held under pastoral lease and occupation licence is 420,051 square miles, at rents amounting to £344,167 18s. Sd. per annum. The average rent is 16s. 4Jd. per square mile. ings under the LandA c t of 1910 numbered 1881, at the close of the same year. The rents were £301,361 4s. 6d., or an average rent of 16s. lOJd. per square mile. The matter therefore becomes very important to Queensland, because Queensland has been against the principle of the alienation of large estates in freehold. She bas endeavoured to preserve these leasehold areas, very properly looking to them as a source of revenue for State purposes. The land revenue is a veryvital matter to that State. Last year it amounted to £ 9 4 3 , 1 3 5 ; the chief itemss being-Rent from selections, £ 4 3 9 , 7 3 8 ; and from pastoral holdings, £301,563. The Commonwealth is therefore raising a very serious question as regards the future revenues of Queensland. Another difficulty is that we have no idea how the proposal is going to work out. It is unfortunate that the Treasurer was not able to produce tables to show what the results of the proposed tax on leases was likely to be. We do not know what the Land Tax Commissioner estimates as the probable revenue from this source. We do not even know whether the tax is worth imposing, or the amount involved. So far as we are aware, it is absolutely a plunge in the dark. In the Queensland LandA ct of 1910, provision is made for the granting of pastoral leases. The terms of the leases and the rent per square mile are notified. Such leases, according to the Act passed in 1910, . "" may be subject to the condition that the land shall be enclosed, and kept enclosed, with a rabbit-proof fence, or subject to a condition for the destruction of noxious plants, or to both of such conditions.""' These conditions in themselves may become exceedingly onerous. The heavy expenditure involved in clearing the land of noxious weeds, such as prickly pear, or in erecting rabbit-proof fencing, is taken into Thus what consideration in fixing the Crown rent, and if in assessing the so-called economic value these things are not taken into account, a gross injustice may be done Accordto the tenants, and land settlement in the State may be considerably retarded. The same Act also provides that the rent may be increased by public works being executed, or by extensive mineral developments occurring. The amount of the rent when periodically assessed is fixed by a Land Court, which must have regard to the The total pastoral holdquality and fitness of the land for grazing purposes, the number of stock which it may be reasonably expected to carry in average seasons, the distance of the holding from railway or water carriage, the natural supply of water, the facilities for raising storage water, the amount which experienced persons would be prepared to pay for land in the same neighbourhood, and any other matters which, in the opinion, of the Court, affect the rental value of the land, provided that in determining the rent, regard is not had to any increase in the value attributable to improvements. The Court, in determining the rent of a perpetual lease, must have regard to other conditions. are setting up an additional tribunal. In Queensland, the real owner of the land, the State, imposes terms on the leaseholder, and a properly constituted Court rent; and now we are to have a Land Tax Commissioner and assessors whose duty it will be to ascertain something called the "" economic value."" When we consider that the land laws vary all over Australia, it is difficult to see what the basis of the assessment is ultimately to be. Freehold and private leasehold properties are in an entirely different position, because the nature of freehold estate, and the law of landlord and tenant are practically identical in all the States, affording a certain uniformity of basis; but when we come to deal with Crown tenancies, in which policy is involved with rent, trouble arises, and injustice may reproductive. sult. The Crown in many of the tenancies have a view to the promotion of settlement by inducing people to go to distant places there to make the land productive; and I am afraid that the proposed tax may have the effect of retarding the realization of that policy. We have to remember that in a great many parts of western Queensland the climate is most variable, with corresponding varying seasons; and these and other facts are taken into consideration by the State, and by those who have to fix the rents. It is for this reason that we desire to know why Queensland members, who know those areas to which I am alluding, and which have hitherto been kept exempt from taxation, are now sitting quietly by. holders of the land get it for almost nothing. particularly low. bers opposite knew the fact in 1910, and yet they did not then raise this cry. Is it only after three years' operation of the land tax that they have found out that these rents are low? I am inclined to think there has been a strong division'in the Labour party, and that the men representing the cities have got the upper hand. I may be wrong, but I am inclined to think so. fore us was originally introduced, some Labour supporters-thoug h I do not say in this House-rubbe d their eyes with astonishment. ""Why,"" they said, ""this periodically determines the taxation was intended to burst up the big estates in the country, and now it is proposed to tax shops and factories!"" It cannot be pretended that large factory areas can be divided up into wheat areas, and the settlement of the country thus promoted. Honourable members opposite know very well why the values of properties fluctuate. To-day an area of land may be practically worth no more than a song, and yet become most valuable in times of good seasons. Many of the tenancies, in the first place, are only for a limited number of years, and bores have to be sunk, houses built, and other improvements made in order to make them should be allowed for. We hear a great deal about ""the unimproved value"" of land, but, in some cases, it has a curious application. For instance, a large area of scrub land when thrown open may be of such a nature as to induce scarcely anybody to go near it, the selectors complaining that good lands are being kept back. However, men do go on to the scrub land, clear the whole of it away, make their own roads, and so forth. The whole value that is put into that land is put into' it by the men themselves; and the unimproved value is probably increased by ten-fold, so that areas formerly regarded as worth not more than £1 an acre, are estimated at £10 or £12 an acre. The whole of that unimproved value has been made by the men living on the land, which, in its virgin state, always supposed to be the true unimproved state, rents are was practically worth nothing. The occupiers, by their combined efforts, have brought about this result. member any particular area in his mind 1 stance, the whole of the Crow's Nest area, which was originally taken up at small values; and the same remark would",11,Fisher

The unimproved value basis is no new thing in Queensland, and is well known in the working of the Municipal Act ; and it is curious how the unimproved value rises. member does not desire to convey that these improvements made by the lessee or the holder w ill be taxable under this measure ? I am pointing out how elusive is the real unimproved value. In the case of closer settlement, the unearned increment, in stead of being added by the whole of tlie community, is added by the whole of the people in the particular area, who, by their efforts, build up the value of the land only to find themselves subject to higher taxation. However that may be, it is important to see what the effect of this tax may be. I find that the Prime Minister estimates this year to receive from the tax £2,700,000, while in 1913, according to the Budget-papers,'the assessment was £1,385,319. that, in round figures, the Prime Minister proposes tb double the taxation. I find that during the year 1912, the sum of £1,445,260 was received from land tax. Of £919,805, Applying the same proportion to the £2,700,000 which 4;he Treasurer anticipates he will receive from this source, city land will contribute £1,000,000 and country land £1,700,000. It is manifest, therefore, that if the tax proves effective in gradually bursting up country estates, town values w ill go on increasing, in which case the tax will f a l l more and more upon urban properties and will thus be passed on to tlie tenants and consumers.

But as estates increase in value, the tax will amount almost to confiscation. In the case of many pastoral holdings, the tax of 9d. in the £ 1 will amount to nothing but confiscation. Another aspect of the B ill which has not been emphasized during this debate, is that it is proposed to increase the rate upon absentee landholders by a I d . in the £ 1 . The absentee tax will thus be lOd. in the £ 1 . It is obvious, therefore that if an absentee is getting a return of 5 per cent, upon his unimproved freehold, the whole of the income thus derived, with the exception of 2d. in the £ 1 , will be absorbed by the payment of this tax.

Both he and other leaders of his party were silent on this matter whenever they addressed rural constituents.

Are these the only persons in the community who are able to bear taxation?

Throughout the Commonwealth, there has been nothing finer than the wonderfully generous contributions which have been spontaneously made by all classes to the Patriotic Fund. tax! contributed according to their means.

However, I leave that point on one side.

We have been told that the building of railways and the construction of water channels in particular districts have given to the land an added value which belongs to the State, seeing that the State has spent money in the construction of these public works; but this is another fallacious argument.

Henry George, the great apostle of tbe single tax, believed in the confiscation of rents, and when dealing with tlie Irish land question was even more a ' ' whole hogger'' than when writing his Progress and Poverty, in which he saidI do not propose to purchase or confiscate property in land. The first would be unjust, the second is needless. Let the individuals who now hold it still retain, if they want, possession of what they are pleased to call their land. Let them buy, sell, or bequeath it. We may safely leave them the shell if we take the kernel. It is not necessary to confiscate the land; it is only necessary to confiscate the rent. In this way the State may become the universal landlord without calling herself so, and without assuming a single new function. Land would be really common property. The proposed taxation is an instance of the application of the confiscatory method. If you take the rent of land, you take its value. That is the principle underlying this tax. I know that it is being applied now only to very large holdings; but when the opportunity, or what may be considered the necessity, arises, it w ill be applied to smaller and still smaller holdings, u n t i l its application touches the very smallest. Although, as previously stated, the Commonwealth has no power to deal w it h land matters, the Labour party is using this principle to bring about the nationalization of land, and, in the words of ""Henry George, to make land common property. It has been said that the tax will not bring in the amount which has been estimated that it will yield, but I think that it will bring in that amount. on whose land the tax is imposed either find the monev to pay the tax, or they must throw their land on the market. sent, the probability is that efforts will be made to find the money, for this year at any rate.

Mr Sampson. facts show the insincerity of the Government's proposal. Ostensibly, and according to the Prime Minister's statement, the tax is imposed to burst up the large estates, but, at the present time, it is impossible to sell land, because there are no buyers. It has been stated that the tax on leaseholds will not bring in as much as it has been estimated to yield. The area of the Commonwealth is 1,903,731,840 acres. Of that, 154,724,120 acres, or 8.13 per cent., have been alienated, or are in process of alienation, and 858,932,085 acres, or 45 per cent., are held under lease or licence. It would require but a very small tax on the leased area to yield £500,000 a year. An area of 890,000,000 acres, or 46 per cent, of the total area of tlie Commonwealth, is unoccupied. Some figures which I gave the other night were challenged by tlie honourable member for In d i .

I say that this is an illegitimate and misleading proposal for taxation, and I believe that if the estates which could be advantageously subdivided were enumerated, it would be found that, for the purpose of closer settlement, the different State Governments could deal with them without the slightest difficulty. The bulk of the lands on which this confiscatory tax will operate are outside the wheat-growing areas. They are situated in dry districts, are fit for grazing only, and cannot, in any circumstances, be subdivided for closer settlement purposes.

A mercantile company that required large office accommodation was in treaty for the purchase of the property, and had instructed its architects to make a plan for a building to cost £S0,000, but when it found that, owing to its present holding of land being above £75,000, its tax would be £1,175 per annum instead of £404 as paid by the present owner, it "" turned it down."" Under the proposed law the tax would be £1,762, if it purchased. That is one case of many. I know of many cases in the city where the tax has prevented owners from building. It is clear from this that the imposition of the tax is likely to discourage enterprise in building in our cities. I wish again to express my regret that, in the present circumstances, the party in a majority in this Farliament should use their power to introduce a system involving the confiscation of land values and rent values of a section in the community to whom they are politically opposed. This proposal marks the first stage of an advance towards the objective of the policy of the Labour party. Tbey are aware that, under the Constitution, the Commonwealbh can own no lands, but they are using their power to-day to bring about practical nationalization by the introduction of an immoral system for the confiscation of the rents of land values.

It has creased. We have heard all over the country, and especially in this House, that the main object which the Labour party had in view in proposing land taxation, namely, the promotion of closer settlement, has proceeded satisfactorily. It has been asserted by Labour members throughout the Commonwealth that an immense area of land has been brought under closer settlement by reason of the Federal land tax. That was the primary object of the original Act. But that fact was not set out on its face, for the reason that we have no power under the Constitution to do anything with regard to the occupation, settlement, or disposal of the lands of the country. In these circumstances, it was necessary, in the opinion of the Labour party, at the time, to achieve by a circuitous process an in vasion of the rights of the States that which they could not otherwise secure-to impose taxation with the ulterior object of promoting closer settlement. On this occasion, we have not heard anything from the Prime Minister, who is in charge of this B ill , as to closer settlement. We have heard him speak of the need to obtain more revenue; but he has said nothing whatever regarding closer settlement.

During the recent elections I had occasion to go through the western portion of my electorate, between Condobolin and Forbes, and in the farming areas there one could see no difference between the ploughed land le'ft for fallow and the sown land.

Isi t f a i r to penalize these men, and cause them, in addition to their numerous losses, to bear this land tax imposition ? There is an old and trit e saying about tempering the wind to the shorn lamb. The Government should temper the tax to the owners of these sheep. taxation at this particular time is like the action of one who would put a working horse in a collar without any padding. It seems to me that the more these people work, and display enterprise, and deny themselves by going out into the back blocks to develop our great Commonwealth, the bigger proportion of the heat and burden of the day they are singled out to bear. Looking for a parallel, I can only compare the action of the Government to the march of the German army into Lou vain. town the Germans made the discomfiture of the citizens of Louvain complete by demanding an indemnity. pastoral areas, after suffering loss of cattle and sheep, and after being at their wits' end to know what to do, these people, in stead of getting sympathy and a helping hand from the Federal Government, have also to submit to this cruel imposition. your electorate will pay the tax under another, tlie lambing is likely to be conthis B ill ? average for each electorate in the Comwi l l get more than 10 per cent. monwealth is about 200.

268,Mr Pigott,"A t all events, I thinkthing for the States. most of our lives in the back-blocks, and who are doing useful work for the country, are always singled out to carry additional taxation. I have in mind an illustration which came to my notice some five years ago, and its application still holds good. A merchant, who had been particularly successful in his business, had three sons. The first followed his father in the business. The second son, being of a studious disposition, was sent to English universities, and thence to Germany, where he qualified as a doctor, subsequently carrying on a consulting practice in Sydney, and rising to the highest position the medical profession could offer. The thir d son was a rollicking young fellow, and his father established him on a pastoral property in the back-blocks. These were the results of their'respective operations: made an income of £ 8 , 0 0 0 ; the doctor made £ 7 , 0 0 0 ; and the pastoralist £ 2 , 0 0 0. revenue purposes. Capitalize those incomes, and the result is a capitalized wealth of £160,000 for the merchant; £140,000 for the doctor; and £40,000 for the pastoralist. Y e t the Government single out the poor pastoralist, who has to put up w i th droughts and many discomforts, to carry the burden of taxation. That is manifestly unfair. the present drought as a littl e one; and the Attorney-General, when speaking, said that although some 15,758 persons paid land tax, the brun t of it fell on the shoulders of about 600. I have heard in terjections from the Government side of the House that only a few persons have to pay the tax. be only one victim; if an injustice is being perpetrated, it should be rectified. History shows that preservation of the rights of the individual has made the British Empire. must have heard of the siege of Tamatave, Madagascar. wrongly incarcerated, and the British Fleet came down on Madagascar, and the Old Country was on the verge of war with France because a British citizen had been wronged. says that, because the tax only affects about 600 people, it is right. burglar who breaks into a house might say that because his action only affected one person he is right. enter a house where there is only one person. burglar robs under cover of darkness, the Government do so in the light. orable member must not use that term. to which you take exception, sir. What is the object of this taxation? was imposed, we were told that it was for the purpose of bursting up estates. What has been its effect? In 1912, 15,375 estates paid the t a x ; and in 1913, 15,758; so that there are actually 383 more persons paying taxation to-day than when the tax was first imposed. Where does the argument about bursting up The merchant, in one year, come in? says for revenue purposes. Let us hear what was said by MrJ . C. Watson and the Worker when the land tax was originally introduced. On 24th March, 1906, Mr Watson saidI t has to be remembered that the motive of the Federal land tax is not revenue at all. The Prime Minister referred to On the 21st June, 1906, the Worker saidThe object of a graduated land tax is not to raise revenue; it is frankly penal. land tax of 1906 when this kind of taxation was not introduced u n t i l 1910 or 1911?

Referring again to Mr Gordon's property, I may into the extent of 76 per cent. form honourable members that the unimproved State valuation is 38s. per acre. The shire valuation is 40s., and the Fedethe adoption, of a system of co-ordinaral valuation 65s. This is a big rise, and it involved an extra taxation of £73 per annum. The tax was retrospective, and, therefore, £219 had to be paid on Mr duced. Earlier in my address, I referred Gordon's property. The effect of placing . the property in a higher gradation was to increase the tax by about 83 per cent. but what will it cost him to do so ? Why should men in such circumstances be put to the expense of. appealing? If he does appeal he will have to go to Sydney to bring his case before the High Court, ""when such matters ought to be capable of settlement on the spot. This is not a party question, but one in which all honourable members representing country constituencies are equally concerned. The honourable member for Gwydir represents a country electorate, and should, therefore, be as much interested in this matter as I am. I have particulars here of another property which I personally inspected and valued for the owner, my friend Mr Young. AfterI had valued the property he said, "" I think I shall put 25 per cent, on your valuation. I do not mind paying the extra taxation involved as a sort of protection against closer settlement."" He did so, and the unimproved value of the property ran out at £9,098. The Commonwealth valuator came along and increased the valuation by £5,737. He valued the property at £14,835. I have valued a great many properties in the district. I valued difference of £10,000 between my valuations and that of the State valuator. valuations were confirmed. I have some particulars of another property not far from Carcoar. I do not wish to mention the name of the owner of the property, but I could give the whole of the particulars to honourable members interested. This property was valued by the owner at £22,087. ' The shire valuation is £17,005, or £5,000 less than the valuation honourable of the owner. The Commonwealth valuator came along later and valued the property at £29,386, and by placing it in a higher gradation increased the rate of the tax These are matters which require investigation, and I say that they justify tion of valuations. Under such a system these anomalies, if not entirely prevented, would be very considerably reto the unfairness of a proposal singling out pastoralists at this time of drought to bear practically the whole burden of taxation.

They were first of all brought to Wangaratta, and were sent from there to Moree.

Last year the additional tax imposed in [66]2 respect of absentees yielded £20,000that was the difference between the amount actually paid by absentees and that which they would have been called upon to pay had they been resident in Australia. In a work by WilliamsT read tbe other day that the effect of this form of taxation, and of other pinpricks to which we have subjected British investors, has been to drive £57,000,000 out of this country. I cannot say whether or not the figures are correct, but I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what the expenditure of such a enterprises and providing employment in Australia. financing us over the war. £70,000,000 last year in providing for a navy which has stood between us and destruction. And this is the way we treat them! £300,000,000. debt amounts to something like £300,000,000, which sum has been lent to us, practically without security, at a low rate of interest*, to help us to develop Australia. In return for their goodness, we insult these investors by taxing them for their enterprise. The £57,000,000 which, according to Williams, has been driven out of Australia, is equal to £14 per head of our population; whereas the absentee taxation responsible for this yielded last year only £20,000, which ia equal to l$d. per head of the population.

W it h in a radius of 15 miles of Blayney. the township in which I live, there are ten mines, in which £1,500,000 bas been sunk, and not one of which is being worked to-day.

It is not my purpose at this hour of the session to make a lengthy speech, but I desire to enter my protest against the way in which these new taxation proposals have been brought in . orable member who has sumed his seat mentioned in a general way that/ as the result of the pin-pricks to which absentee investors have been subjected by the Federal Parliament, £57,000,000 had been' driven out of the country. If this were the proper time and place I could give definite particulars as to a great deal of money which was to be invested in Australia, but which, because of recent developments, has not been brought in . necessary, give concrete cases, representing in the aggregate a large amount of capital, that has actually been driven out of the Commonwealth. opposite may sneer at such an assertion, country to allow a tax of this kind to because they do not happen to come into association with big financial movements, but I can assure them of the absolute truth of the statement. I have made. I rose, however, to point out that had this proposal been submitted as a war tax, then, although crude in its incidence, and very drastic in its effect, I am sure that the majority of the people would have been prepared to accept it . Thia is a cruel time for the particular section of the community which is to suffer most under this taxation, yet while it may mean r u in to some of them, the majority, I am convinced, would have been prepared to accept this taxation and to try to pull through these hard times in order to help Australia and the Empire during the continuance of the war. But when fche Labour party, during the stress of present disaster, impose this taxation, knowing well that they w i ll be able to cloak over their real object with the statement, "" We imposed this taxation in war time,"" when, after being compelled to almost place them on the rack, we have extorted from them the confession that it will be continued after the war period-the n I say that it is time for us to enter a most emphatic protest. We must I assure honourable members opposite that if this taxation had been imposed merely for the duration of the war, a great number of us on this side would have been found supporting it . But, much as we may feel the need for fresh taxation at the present time, we cannot bring ourselves to help the Labour party in what, to my mind, is a subterfuge unworthy of any political party in any part of the The honEmpire. A t a time when the particular just resection of the community which they propose to attack more than any other is struggling most desperately for existence, I cannot bring myself to support honourable members opposite in this proposal, much as I should like to help the Government in a crisis like that through which the Empire is now passing. If the Treasurer could assure us, even at this late stage, that this was a war tax in tended to operate only during the war, I could, if we should recognise that it was necessary to tide us over a period of unequalled pressure, and I am quite sure that he would not have much difficulty in passing his Bill.

A few days ago the Leader of the Opposition, when speaking, asked the Prime Minister whether he was imposing this tax in connection with the war, and, according to a note 1 took at the time, the Prime Minister replied, "" These taxes do not provide for the liquidation of the war debt."" A little later the Leader of the Opposition said, "" We w ill , therefore, presume that they are introduced for the purpose of liquidating the liabilities in curred in carrying on the ordinary services of the year,"" and the Prime Minister replied, "" They carry that on their face."" The honourable member for Balaelava thereupon interjected, "" That is the declaration of their permanency."" On examining the Estimates, it seems to me that there w ill be no opportunity of spending the whole of these millions this year. The millions that we are receiving from the Old Countryf o r war purposes w ill be amply sufficient for the purpose, and there w ill be no necessity to use this taxation for war requirements. millions cannot all be used for the ordinary purposes of government. therefore, is the necessity of imposing this increased progressive land tax at the present time? It seems as though the Prime Minister is using this opportunity for in land and the possibilities of 'raising it to troducing destructive, and, I might almost say, malicious or vindictive legislation. It is unfortunate, at a time of almost universal drought that an extra imposition should be placed upon our landholders, even if some of them are big ones.

One of my objects in rising is to deal w i th the question of the Crown leased lands, which are brought under the purview of this measure. In 1910, when the principal Act was before this Chamber, it was recognised by honourable members opposite, who to-day are on the Treasury bench, that it would be iniquitous and unjust to attempt to in terfere in any way with leased lands. In Queensland, rightly or wrongly, the view is held that the land should remain the These property of the Crown, and that long leases are best for the community.

326,Mr Websteb,"Christmas is near, andgaining for. In the two Chambers there are 111 members, and the question of whether this land tax should or should not be imposed was probably debated in Caucus by seventy-three members. It is quite possible that the question was decided by a majority of one or two, and this means that thirty-seven or thirtyeight members can compel the Prime Minister, whether he approves or not, to legislate according to their dictum. orable member must not pursue that line of argumentMr P. P.

Whether we sit on the Government side or the Opposition side, we represent diversified interests, and should be prepared to give a fair and square deal to every person in the community-to those who may have been foolish enough to pioneer in the back country and make riches, or those who may have prospered as merchants in the city.

Mr P. P.

I do not often trouble the Chamber, but I must emphasize the point that honourable members have no right to remain silent and record their votes when, as I say clearly and distinctly, their hearts are not with the measure-whe n almost a majority of them, if they had their wish, would vote in a contrary direction. know what you are talking about!

ABBOTT -We know that the Caucus was discovered in America about forty years ago, and was adopted in Birmingham. ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question. Mr P. P. ABBOTT I am sorry, sir, but the Postmaster-General led me astray. In Australia tlie country lands at present bear 60.6 per cent, of the land tax, and the urban lands 39.4 per cent. If we take the. figures for the entire Commonwealth for 1912-13, we find I do not say whether that the country lands contributed £884,090, of which sum the rura l lands of New South Wales paid more than one-half, namely, £472,719. It w ill be seen, therefore, that the country land-owner, especially in New South Wales, has borne his share of taxation. When contributions were recently invited to the patriotic f u n d the land-holders were not niggardly in their response, and they are prepared to contribute to an even greater extent if necessary. But why should one section of the community be singled out for special taxation? If good seasons could be assured to our land-owners they would probably bear this burden without complaint, but when once this tax is tive for several years at least, irrespective of whether they experience good or bad seasons. Looking through the report of I find that the only cases in which landholders have been exempted from the operation of the tax number about four, and in all these cases the persons concerned have become bankrupt. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commonwealth comes in as a preferential creditor, and that the land-holder is required to pay the tax irrespective of whether he is really able to do so or not. Under this B ill a man who has an estate the taxable value of which is £10,000, w ill be required to pay an additional £13 17s. 10d., or 24 per cent, more than he' has previously paid, whilst a man with an estate of £30,000, do not taxable value at present pays a tax of £ 2 5 0 , and w ill have to pay an addiI , perhaps, tional £125, an increase of 50 per cent.",35,Moloney D O You Say Their Subdivision For Closer Settlement

I exceedingly regret that at a time when . we were assured that controversial legislation would not be submitted to Farliament, and just prior to a long adjournment, the Government should endeavour to push through legislation which must inflict considerable hardship upon an important section of the community. Before imposing further taxation upon land-holders, it seems to me that Ministers should have attempted to remedy a few of the shortcomings of the principal Act. What about those land-holders who lodged appeals against their assessments some eighteen months or two years ago? Their own valuations have been brushed aside by the Commissioner, who has imposed on them the extra assessment that is allowed by the law. They paid that additional taxation many months ago,' and it now appears to be impossible for them to get their cases before the Court. The whole farmers off the land. I gave some of the moneys which they have paid under protest have been impounded by the Commissioner, so that these men are losing interest upon it, and yet there seems to be no prospect of their appeals being dealt with. which should have received first consideration, which would tax the farmers off tion at the hands of the Government. Is it fair to increase the burden placed upon these land-holders by 60 or 70 per cent, when the Commonwealth already holds considerable amounts of their money pending a decision of the Court? I hope that honourable members opposite will be prepared to deal with this Bill in an unbiased way, and will not be induced to follow their leaders upon a question of such vital importance. My desire is that a vote upon the Government proposals shall be arrived at upon non-party lines. The honourable member for Capricornia knows that I am always prepared to consider legislative proposals upon these lines.

An estate of the unimproved value of £5,500, or a capital value of a little over £9,000, will pav the extra sum of 8d.

406,Mr Palmer,"The honourable meminto the realm of practical politics. As this is the policy of the Government, there is not much room for cavil at their having attempted, by this legislation, to give it effect. I should have been surprised if they had pursued any other course. A t the same time, I must say that I regard it as a suicidal policy from the point of view of the section of the community which they claim especially to represent. The proposal to tax Crown leaseholds is one of far-reaching consequences. The value of our export of wool for the last year for which we have the figures was £26,000,000. The great bulk of that value was produced on Crown leaseholds. The country, as well as this Parliament, should be informed of the present conditions of those leaseholds. We are accustomed in Victoria to speak of the drought"" of 1902. That drought was the culmination of a five years' drought in the north-western portions of New South Wales. Its result was that the Crown lessees found themselves in such a position that they demanded an inquiry from the State Government. A Lands Commission was appointed to investigate their position. The members of the Commission visited all the stations in that huge area to discover what might be done to alleviate the situation of the Crown lessees. They found that many of the Crown leaseholds were not worth the money which financial institutions had advanced to their reputed owners. They found that, if the land was not to be permitted to get into a state of perfect uselessness, it was absolutely necessary to discreasing the rental value of the Crown continue the collection of rents for five years. That is to say, they found that for the period over which the drought lasted the lessees should be exempt from the payment of any rental. Do honourable members think that any Government would have been so unwise as to agree to such an exemption if the land could possibly have carried the impost? leaseholds, being Crown properties, are carrying to-day just about as much rental as the holders can afford to pay, putting one year with another. Every one knows that there are years -when large sums of money are made from the occupation of these Crown leases, but there are also successions of disastrous years. The honourable member for Grey knows that this is the case. Many of the leaseholds of the north-western portions of New South Wales, at the time to which I refer, would have been thrown up, and would have become useless for producing purposes had not the State Government adopted the course I have mentioned. Now the present Commonwealth Government come along, and make a proposal that Crown leaseholds should bear the Federal land tax. The result of this taxation will be that the rental value of Crown leases will be seriously diminished, and a material loss will be occasioned to the State Governments. While, with the honourable member for In d i , I have great sympathy with the small farmers who are the actual workers of the land, I say that the far-back man, the man who goes out into the wilds of Australia, and utilizes land for the production of wool of great commercial value to this country, takes enormous risks and grave responsibilities, involving great anxiety of mind, is deserving of much consideration. The Government propose to tax these Crown lessees, and if this taxation stands the test of law-whic h I am inclined to question-and these lessees are compelled to pay it , the result in hosts of cases will be that the leases w ill be thrown up, and we shall possibly have a repetition of what took place some time ago in South Australia. It was thought there that the Crown lessees were getting the use of land at a ridiculously low rental, and that it would be a great stroke of policy if the Government were to increase the rentals on the maturity of the leases. The experiment was tried, but with disastrous results. It was u l t i mately found that, instead of in lands of the State, the effect of the experiment was to diminish it . These vast areas, which carry possibly not more than one sheep to twelve acres, offer an inducement to men of a certain type for the investment of their money. They are known to be risky ventures, and no man w ill put money into them without a reaThese sonable hope of some return. WhatI object to in connection with this particular proposal is that it will prevent the further investment of money in these properties. It will involve the destruction of whatever vested interests those at present in occupation of these lands have in the shape of improvements, and it w ill mean a serious loss to the whole community. Every man, woman, and child in Australia is benefited and enriched by the enormous value of our exportable surplus of wool, because that value is available for circulation amongst our amount of property is likely to object to people. If it is diminished our people an additional charge upon what he is must suffer. From the point of view of already paying by way of Federal land the labourers whom our honourable friends tax and the taxation of the State Goopposite claim to represent, this aspect vernment. of the question must be considered. There are in the aggregate thousands of men councils. employed on these large stations who are unfitted for other occupations. have been way-back men all their lives. strongly object to this increased taxation. Let these Crown leases pied, and their employment will be gone. be singled out for this treatment? WA great many taxation proposals operate search in vain for any proposal by the in this way. If by taxation we make it Labour party to tax city industries unprofitable to proceed with any industry, Where is there any proposal to come down it is no longer carried on, and the labourers upon those Who aire conducting large employed in it suffer the loss of their manufacturing enterprises? occupation.

Thers is no getting away from the soundness of that proposition; but we have in power a Government whose policy it is to nationalize, and we know that, in order to give effect to that policy, it must go on increasing taxation. What are they going to do when they do nationalize all our undertakings? members to consider for a moment the beautiful condition of affairs now prevailing in the Postal Department, and, indeed, in all the public Departments r u n by the Government.

W h y , may I ask, should the people be harassed by increased taxation in the present abnormal conditions? There is not a man on the-land in ""Victoria who can show a credit balance on this year's working. Indeed, w i th the exception of Queensland, where a fairly good season has been experienced, I question if we could find in Australia a man on the land who could show a credit balance on his year's operations. The fact remains that any man who can feel sympathy for people, who goes among the farmers and others engaged in rural industries, must feel his heart bleed when he sees the conditions. These people are passing through a hard and bitter experience, and upon the top of it the Government, whose first care it ought to be to make the conditions as easy as possible for them, are piling up additional taxation, not for war purposes, I ask honourable but for the ordinary purposes of government. This debate shows the necessity for candour in introducing legislation. Had the Prime Minister, when introducing his land tax proposals, taken this House into his confidence, he might have lessened the wide range of the debate, and enabled honourable members to direct their attention to the particular object for which The Premier of Western Austhe legislation was introduced. Asi t is, the debate covers the whole wide range of the original taxation proposals which were so exhaustively debated in this chamber in 1910. I have looked up much of that debate, which was one of the finest that have ever taken place in this LegisW ill She lature. We were assured just before the last elections that during the continuance of the war the late Government, which I supported, would not, beI shall connect it with cause it would be wrong, deal w it h This Goanything contentious.

If it is, they are courting war to the knife, and war they will have. So far as I am able to keep tlie thing going, I shall do my little b it . We may take it that, instead of this being a peace proposal, or the Government I bow to your ruling, a peace Government, we are now in the hurricane season of the taxation proposals of the Government, introduced at a time when those against whom they are directed are least able to bear them There has never been in the history of Australia a period when the people on the land have been less able to bear the burdens sought to be imposed upon them by this Government.

I give the honourable member for In d i credit for the manner in which he sought, from his point of view, to show the people of Australia that a mere additional contribution of 2s. lOd. per annum was not going to k ill the farmer who owned land to the improved value of £10,000, but with a taxable valne of £5,000, and that he would be unpatriotic if he failed to hand it over in this time of war. That is a specious argument, on the face ofi t ; and were that the only aspect of the B ill affecting that farmer, he could take no objection to it , unless he were an unworthy citizen of this great country, in such a time of crisis. B ut the honourable member very cleverly and astutely side-tracked the other effect of the B ill , namely, that, if we can bemost definite statement lieve some members of the Labour party, who are sufficiently candid to put the truth about the measure forward, its real object is to burst up large estates. It is an inescapable doctrine that if we reduce the value of the broad acres, the value of tbe small farms must come down also. I defy the honourable member, with all his astuteness, toprove to the farmers of In d i that if he brings down the value of the large holdings he can still keep up the value of the small holdings in his of these men are wrapped up in their littl e properties, and the honourable member cannot prevent them from suffering from the shrinkage in value which will be the effect of this tax. been the effect in any country where the land tax is in operation.

I have been concerned a good deal with land, and venture the opinion for what ifc may be worth that, with the exception of land such as is to be found around Colac and in the TowerH ill country, and the rich river flats in the districts of the honourable member for Richmond and fche honourable member for .Cowper, where the lands can hardly be brought down in value, because these rich volcanic lands are limited in area and the population keeps in creasing, values throughout the broad range of our country generally have been reduced as a result of the land tax. L e t me place on record the view of one member of the Commonwealth Labour party. reconcile your statement with Senator Millen's declaration in another place that the Federal land tax had not lowered fche value of land ? cern to reconcile my views with those of any other honourable member. I make fche statement from my knowledge of the country. A fair amount of land goes through the hands of the firm with which I am associated during the year, and we ought to know something about the question, seeing that the operations spread well over Victoria. We are indebted to Senator Stewart for a very candid expression of opinion oa tha subject. On 14th October of this year he made, on the floor of another place, fche following clear and In 1910 the Labour party was so seized of the desirability of increasing the opportunitieshonorable member quoting from a speech made in the Senate on this question 1 honourable member will not be in order in doing so. the effect of the speech, which was that the party imposed land tax legislation, electorate.

He went on to say that that was the real object of the party. If there is one man in that party who is acquainted with the subject of land taxation, and with the objective of such taxation, it is the honourable senator fco whom I have referred, and I should like the honourable member for In d i to reconcile his views with those of that honourable gentleman. According to the honourable member for In d i , the B ill will impose upon the holder of an estate, the improved value of which is £10,000, or a taxable value of £5,000, a tax of only 28. lOd.

I shall not enumerate the various forms of leasehold in Australia, which are numerous, but I wish to point out that the leased land is the property of the Grown, and under the direct control of the Governments of the various States. Each State, since it was granted constitutional government, has had to carry the baby in respect of its leasehold land. It has only been by offering premiums that it has got this land taken up, sometimes in large areas, and sometimes in small, and sometimes under lease, and sometimes under licence. Each State, too, has made reservations for its own purposes. Thus we have timber reserves, mineral reserves, and even, as the honourable member for Barker pointed out, oil and salt reserves. The tax which the Labour party seeks to impose is a tax on t h e Governments of the States. The lessees of these State lands have merely the limited rights of user. t b a t be sees a taxable margin between the rentals of -these lands and their true economic value, but whenever a State chooses to t u r n the screw a little, and put up the rent, this taxable margin must disappear. As to the proposal to impose land taxation to burst up large estates, J would say in the first case that, so far as it applies to the lands of Western Australia and New South Wales, it is an absolute condemnation of the Labour Governments in power in those two ""States, because, having absolute cont r o l of the land policy of those States, they have neglected to provide adequately for settlement. however, a preposterous thing that the Commonwealth should t r y to dictate to the States on the question of land policy, .seeing that tlie sovereign rights of the States in respect * of land matters were reserved to them by the Constitution. The Governments of the States have, in some instances, bought back large estates, subdivided them, and resold them to increase the facilities for settlement. They have sent agents abroad, and have agents -within their borders, whose business it is to get men to settle on the land. While the Labour party may tax the present The honlarge holders off the land, it cannot tax new men on. It is impossible, by imposing taxation, to secure men possessing the requisite knowledge, grit, and inclination to settle on the lands of the TheB ill will increase country. desirous of settling on the land, b u t cannot do so. ber supporting the Government is a wheat-grower in New South Wales, and he, in effect, tells this Chamber that the Labour Premier of that State is neglecting his duty to the people by failing to make land available for settlement; that there are many persons there who wish to take up land, yet the Holman Government will not provide land for them. But the Commonwealth has no constitutional right to interfere in matters of this kind. It is, however, proposed to do indirectly, by means of land taxation, what constitutionally we cannot do directly. The honourable member for Echuca spoke about a little bird whispering abroad the real object of this tax, but it has whistled aloud from every tree that the object is to burst up the The Attorney-General thinks large estates to secure closer settlement. We gather from the declarations of honourable members opposite that tliat is the intention of this measure, though the Leader of the Government has not said that it is a B ill to provide for closer settlement. If , as seems to be the case, its genuine and bond fide, object is to increase settlement, why does not the Government propose a common-sense method of dealing with the land? The first step needed is to classify the land according to its quality. The classification might first be directed to valuing the lands suitable for settlement close to public u t i l ities, by which I mean railways, water It seems to me, schemes, and so forth . But there is another class of land, which, far removed from railways, is absolutely unsuitable for cultivation, and which, even in large areas, could not, under any process of taxation, be put to much better uses. It is a cruel wrong and injustice to tax land-holders, who have taken their families out to inferior country in distant parts, and who, in many cases, have to do without the advantages of civilization. whom are heavily mortgaged.",45,Moloney T H E I N Accordance With The Labour Platform

ThisB ill cannot assist in the slightest tlie settlement of such country, but will merely confiscate a value that has taken years of labour and industry to build up. There is an aspect of the case which I hope to be able to place before honourable members on behalf of the large land-holders of Wannon particularly. There is no land-holder in Wannon that I know, big or small, who in this time of stress would not make his contribution, according to his means, for the defence of the country. This is a time of great t r i a l, when the fate of the Empire is at stake, and when, from day to day, we watch' anxiously for news across the water. Farmers, large property-owners, dairymen, and orcharSists have sent their 1 sons to the front , and to-day old men may be seen in the fields doing the work of their boys. A r e these the sort of men likely to be found skulking when it is a matter of making financial contribution to the defence of the country ? I disclaim any desire to stand specially for the large land-holders, and if the Government w ill take their courage in both hands, and renounce their plan of unconstitutionally dealing with the lands, and surrender to the States the just rights of land taxation, I pledge myself to assist in introducing and passing a Federal income tax which would make a levy on every citizen, including honourable gentlemen opposite, who are not called upon to contribute under this measure. 1 never have been keenly in favour of a land tax. The honourable member for In d i did some of us, at any rate, an in people of this country? justice when he said that we were loud in declaiming against the Federal land tax, but did not object to a State land tax, because, personally, I did object to a State land tax. I find that the great need in Australia is to obtain population to use our lands, and for that population we look all over the world. If we single out our land-holders for special taxation, and exempt their more fortunate brethren, we make an unjust distinction-w e place a special impost on the wood and water carriers of the country. I have always been an advocate of an income tax, and at the present time. I am prepared to tur n this machine of taxation to the very l i m it to assist in the defence of the country and the Empire. burden of defence should be equitably and fairly spread all over Australia. This system, which is what I migh t call reprisal, and vindictive reprisal at that-whic h picks out 14,000 persons as subjects of special taxation at war time-is absolutely unworthy of the Government. There is no mandate for such taxation, and honourable gentlemen opposite, if they intended to impose it , failed in not informing the country of the fact. I challenge any member of the Labour party to show me any declaration before the elections that it was their intention, if returned to power, to impose a land tax in order to finance Australia in the ordinary sense of the word, or even to finance it for defence purposes. I wish to put a further aspect of the question. The Minister of Trade and Customs has, on several occasions recently, dealt with the question of the wheat duty. very well, too! gentleman has dealt with them in a way that will cause him to be known aa "" Cobden"" for the rest of his life, for he has renounced his Protectionist policy, and thrown over the farmers. It was pointed out to the Commission which in vestigated the matter that many men were going to make fortunes on the wheat market, and that one man in particular would make £90,000. If that be true, w ill the Minister of Trade and Customs tell me how, under the taxation proposals before us, that man w ill contribute one penny of this large sum which, it was said, he has unjustly and u n f a i r ly extracted from the had made any such sum. the Minister had made the statement, but members of his party have, and it has been recorded in the newspapers.. Can this be a fair basis of taxation when a man, who, in one season, and within a few weeks, and at wartimes, can make a fortune of £90,000, i * not called upon to contribute one penny of it to the defence of the country ? This form of taxation, if it goes on, may have one effect.

I rise for the purpose of saying that the objections I had, when the original land tax proposals were before us a few years ago, hold good now. These objections were two; the first, that so far as the object of the legislation was to burst up large estates, however laudable and desirable that object might be, ifc did not come within fche jurisdiction of this Parliament; and the second, that when taxing wealth for revenue purposes it was unjust that only one kind of wealth should be taxed. I am aware, of course, of all the taking arguments used in favour of fche single t a x ; but they have never convinced me that the man who invests in land should be taxed, while the man who invests in Government debentures should go free. In Victoria tbe hard-working farmer about whom wo hear so much from the other side is taxed on the income he derives from his land, but the man who invests in Government debentures pays no income tax at all. That is the result of so called Liberal legislation in this State. toria does not pay income tax on the produce of his land. It was only when the land tax was imposed that a concession was made. was imposed we remitted the income tax in the case of land-holders. Victorian Government made a man pay Catts, J.

Section 125 of the Queensland LandA c t provides1. The Court, in determining the rent of a pastoral holding or grazing selection, shall have regard to(a) The quality and fitness of the land for grazing purposes; (b) The number of stock which it may reasonably be expected to carry in average seasons; (c) The distance of the holding from railway or water carriage; (d) The natural supply of water, and the facilities for the raising or storage of water; .(e) The amount which experienced persons would be willing to pay for land of 2s. 6d. per square similar quality in the same neighbourhood ; and ({) Any other .matters which, in the opinion of the Court, affect the rental value of the land.

I hope the Treasurer will give some explanation of how what appears to be an artificial rule fixing the valuation of private lands before the commencement of the Act , is now to be applied to the tenants of the Crown all over Australia. would like some explanation of the reason for imposing these very heavy rates of taxation on leaseholds. is are considerable areas of Australia which can only be worked in large holdings. Men with small capital, who could only work a limited area of this land, are bound to f a i l, as has been proved by repeated experience in different parts of the country. There are areas hundreds of miles away from the centres of civilization, which are so situated that the cartage of material and provisions and the conveyance of stock are very costly. They are very often subject to severe drought, rally are such that they can only be worked by men with large capital. They take up large areas of this land, and with their capital they are able to conserve water and put down bores. In asmuch as great parts of the Commonwealth can only be occupied and made productive, so far as we know at the present time, by citizens of considerable means, why should they be called upon to pay a tax which honourable members opposite advocated as a bursting-up tax? Five years ago our honourable friends came along and said that they desired to place a very heavy burden of taxation on large land-holders. Why? Because they wished to. see those lands occupied by small settlers. their methods, there is no difference of opinion in this House as to the desirability of getting closer settlement wherever it is possible. our honourable friends applying this taxation to huge areas which they must admit can only be occupied, developed, and worked by men of large capital, I ask why should such men be singled out for taxation,, which it is admitted is penal in its character, and is intended to have that effect? for applying the taxation to that class of holdings? hear from honourable members opposite what is the object they desire to attain. They cannot burst up these holdings, but they can tax the holders off the land provided that it is possible to adopt the method of valuation which is indicated in the table read by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I do not know whether that is possible or not, but it seems to me that it is not practicable to value on a freehold basis, which appears to be the basis that the Commissioner chooses to use as an illusIt tration, huge areas of land which common knowledge that there the Crown has for various reasons laid down shall never be alienated. How are we to arrive at a freehold basis of valuation for land which can never be made freehold? It seems to me, as the Attorney-General indicated in his second reading speech, that there can be only one method of arriving at "" the economic value,"" as he termed it , and that is to ascertain bow far the rental demanded by the Crown falls short of the value which it should have demanded. I would like to hear from the Treasurer, now that he and the conditions geneis here, what is the reason for taxing the leaseholds and using the penal provisions of the Land Tax Assessment Act? Isi t the desire of the Government to burst up large leaseholds? Surely he can say "" Yes"" or "" No .

Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. -There are some points in connection with this measure which I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister. I hope I shall be able to convince some of his supporters that this tax will seriously affect the leaseholders of Australia. It should be remembered that the portions of Australia held under leasehold are being developed to a very great extent by people who hold other property, and it may be freehold property, in States other than those in which they hold leasehold property. These people have lost a very considerable amount of money in years of drought in the past. I feel certain that the Prime Minister does not expect that this taxation will have the effect of breaking up leasehold properties in remote districts of Australia for purposes of closer settlement. We are endeavouring to-day to induce people to go with their capital to the Northern Territory to develop thafc country by taking up leases under the Crown. The people who the Minister of will do so must be the forerunners of closer settlement, as those who have devethe Prime Minisloped the outlying portions of Australia in the various States have been in the past. The Administrator of the Northern This is for Australia a very Territory tells us in his report that the Here we are, in a small farmer is practically of no use there. We must, in the first place, have the large leaseholder, who will prepare the way for the small farmer. In New .South Wales, and particularly in Queensland, there are some very large Crown Everybody knows leases in connection with, which the Crown invested has the right of resumption. From time to time certain portions of these leases are resumed, and the lands balloted for under a modified system of closer settleIt has only been since experience ment. I should like the Prime Minister to say whether he desires to penalize the people who have put their money into these Queensland leaseholds. If the object is to impose a revenue tax, it is quite Yet the Government come along right that these people should be taxed, in common with all other holders of leases, but tlie holder of a small leasehold should If the Commissioner is be required to pay proportionately the same tax. We have been told by the honourable member for Darling Downs that, in the case of a person who owns no other land in the Commonwealth having a property the unimproved value of taxation which is £20,000, according to the calculations of the Land Tax Commissioner, the taxable value of that property would be £ 9 , 3 0 8, and the leaseholder would have to pay a land tax of £ 2 3 2s. 2d. That would be a very reasonable t a x ; but if , as is frequently the case, the owner of this leasehold is also the owner of freehold in any part of the Commonwealth, fche value of his property is reckoned together, and if the total value comes up to £75,000, the taxation upon the leasehold would be under the 9d. rate, and, instead of being £ 2 3 2s. 2d., would amount to £344 Is. Is that a fair proposition ? Is that a fair way in which to tax leaseholders in Queensland, who are subject to a right of resumption by the Crown?",51,Pairs

"" That, I contend, is not a fair proposition to put before the people. silence of the Prime Minister and his followers leads me to the conclusion that, as representing the men on the land in our constituencies, we, on this side, have very little hope of obtaining sympathetic consideration for the very many cases that have been made out in their interests. I desire to make a final appeal to the Prime Minister. I wish to point out the great disability under which the man on the land will suffer if this clause be allowed to pass. I am quite satisfied that the first schedule to the principal Act, and now in force, is all that should be enacted in the present circumstances. of the drought and the troubles from which tbe men on the land are suffering-and they are by no means out of the wood y e t I think that the amount which the Government expect to realize from the imposition of this taxation will not be easily obtained. place, we find that the estimate of £2,700,000 is about £1,090,055 more than was realized in 1913-14. If this tax on leaseholds produces what I am told it is estimated to prodnce, namely, £500,000, this means thafc the existing taxpayers will have to pay an amount equivalent to 36 per cent, or 37 per cent, more than they are now paying, although their position to-day is much worse than it was last year or the year before. I therefore moveTliat the word "" fifteen,"" twice occurring in the first schedule be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""twenty-five."" 1 am not prepared to retreat for one moment from the position I take up, that the present imposition is quite sufficient in existing circumstances, although it seems impossible to get the Government to see it , but I propose to test the feelings of the Committee, and to see if the Labour party's boasted plea of voicing humanitarian doctrines is a mere farce, or whether it has any deep significance, by asking them to exercise a humanitarian judgment in tliis matter, and to vote for this amendment. port the amendment, believing that some relief should be given to way-back settlers. On several occasions I have had the pleasure of visiting the western districts of New South Wales, especially the Darling River country. About six or seven years ago I visited a big station there known as Winbar. I was informed on that occasion that tbe station comprised 500,000 acres on lease extending over a period of forty-three years, and that, since the signing of the lease, certain portions of the property had been available for settlement, but that not one block had been taken up. In support of the statements made by. the honourable member for Corangamite, I should like to point out that the area to which I refer is not suitable for closer settlement. It is essentially country for the big pastoralist. There is hardly an acre of land cultivated in the district. I noticed that there were eight or nine boundary riders employed on In view the station, and that they were using a single-furrow plough in an effort to cultivate a small area. They know nothing about the work, being essentially sheep farmers, and I was satisfied thafc no effort had been made fco grow wheat there, unless it might be sufficient to supply In the first their own requirements. Coming to the question of the economic value and the rental value of the land, in New South Wales, so far as settlement and improvement leases are concerned, the owners have to appear before the Land Boards from time to time, when values are entered into very carefully and re-appraisements made. If there is any disparity between the economic value and the rental value, it is a matter for adjustment by these Land Boards. An y difference between the two is immediately filled up by the Board, so that there would actually be no rent for the Commonwealth Government to levy upon, since the whole difference would have been adjusted by the States. Por this reason, I think some relief should be given to these men. The wayback settlers have denied themselves the privileges and luxuries of civilization, and are acting as the outposts of Australia They are just where we want men, and surely our experience of the Northern Territory should lead us to extend sympathetic consideration to them.

If -we impose these disabilities on people, who desire to develop country that is not required by others, we shall place a stumbling-block in the way of the true progress of Australia. I should not like to allow this clause to pass without expressing my strong objection to it . My surprise is that at any time, and especially at tbe present, the Government should desire to interfere with Crown lessees in the States. The Government seem to have forgotten that Australia is very sparsely settled by pastoralists. try is occupied by them, and we ought to do all we can to give them the opportunity to extend their operations further inland. Instead, we are placing more burdens on them, apparently in the hope that this will encourage people to go out into the far back lands. From my knowledge of the interior, the advance of settlement must be slow, whatever inducements are offered. The natural obstacles in the way are very great. tralia-the interior-ha s no river system added burdens on those whom we want to go into that interior to advance settlement. little with the Northern Territory since we took it over, and if this policy is pursued it will not be settled for many years.

There is not much difference between one twenty-five-thousandth sandth. W ill the Prime Minister inform the Committee what effect the amendment is likely to have on the revenue which the B ill is expected to raise? ister and Treasurer) [8.25] -The amendment does not seem a very serious proposal, but the purpose of the Opposition is, of course, to prevent the Government, if possible, from carrying out their financial policy, and the amendment, therefore, can have no other object. I do not complain of what the Opposition do, but they cannot take up two attitudes. They are entitled to resist our proposals, but the Government consider that this revenue is necessary. The amendment would have a lessening effect on the Only the fringe of the counrevenue to the extent of the difference between one fifteen-thousandth and one twenty-five-thousandth, and it would break up the whole scheme. A great deal has been said about this being wholly a ""breaking-up "" tax. It has never been so with myself, and I have never concealed that view of mine from the public at any time. A tax on the unimproved value of land is not a tax on industry; it is a tax on value, created, not by individual owners, One-fourth of Ausbut by the community as a whole. The honourable member for Richmond challenged at a l l ; but this Bill puts me to say ' ' yes "" or "" no "" to a question on tliat point. I do not need to do so. The breaking-up effect is only incidental to We have done very the tax, and it is a very good incidentality, too, for this country.

The value of tlie country as it is now is the basis of valuation, and then the question is how much has its value been in creased by the improvements thereon. The assessors do not take into consideration the value of the improvements which a man has placed on his leasehold. When a man has improved a piece of land, and made it wealth-producing, and there is a piece of land adjoining which has not been improved, it is a question of how much greater is the value of the improved piece than the value of the piece not i m proved. a lot of money which is spent on a property is not deducted from the value of it at the present time, and if that was done in many cases there would not be any taxable value. leaseholds are sold. country is not divided from the stock, but the whole country and the stock are sold at so much a head. The lands, the buildings, the improvements, and the stock are. included in the price. In the case of leaseholds fenced with rabbit and dog proof wire fences, and provided with artesian bores, tanks, dams, wells, homesteads, and shearing sheds, you could out separating the cost of those things. Of course it could be done if you deducted the whole cost to the lessee, but that is not the practice which is adopted. It is not so easy a process as honourable members opposite seem to think. This additional taxation upon property must be very exasperating and annoying, and most inconvenient, apart from every other consideration. In Western Australia all the pastoral leases will fall in , I In my opinion the B ill think, in twelve or fourteen years. At the present time there are already three valuations. First, there is the shire The right honourable gencouncil or municipal valuation; next there is the State land tax valuation; then there is the Federal land tax valuation, and in future there is also to be If the unima leasehold valuation. I think that the existing valuations are made separately, and I do not wonder that persons become annoyed. I should nave liked to hear the views of honourable members opposite who have had experience of pastoral leases, and know something about the country in the back blocks. I should have liked to hear my honourable friend who has recently been appointed a Minister, but who is not present now. He represented for many years a pastoral, agricultural, and mining electorate, but I have not heard hi m say a single word for his late constituents. He has now got into a better constituency, where he has only one class to represent; the pastoralists are not in his electorate any longer, but I should have expected him to express some sympathy with the struggling selectors whom he represented so long.

I express that hope because I do not approve of the Commonwealth invading the rights of the States where it is unnecessary.

Those who framed that policy should have a fairly clear idea of what their aims and purposes are. On referring to the official report of the Brisbane Labour Conference of 1908, I find that MrJ . Grant stated thatMr Watson bad said that the progressive land tax was not for revenue, but for the bursting up of the large estates. for revenue, but for breaking up the big estates. Then Mr Hutchison, who was at one time a member of this Parliament, said that he felt thatThe progressive tax had two objects-first , enabling the big estates to be cut up for closer settlement, and secondly, asking those best able to do so to bear their fair share of taxaleaseholds, then, at least, he should retion. Senator Findley, who is a fairly good exponent of the views of his party, also saidFanners were.being driven out of Viotoria through not being able to obtain land, and that condition of things should be remedied by the imposition of the progressive land tax to burst up the big land monopolies. By endorsing tbe exemption of £5,000, Labour could prove incontestable that they desired to help the farmers and were on the side of the poor man. The bursting up of big estates is undoubtedly the hope and aspiration of honourable members opposite. The Prime Minister says that primarily the object of this taxation is the raising of revenue. a who framed this policy for the Labour party did not hesitate to declare that the real object of it is the bursting up of big estates. The right honourable gentleman said, during this debate to-day, that, incidentally, t'.iis taxation would have that effect, and that it was, too, a very good incidental effect. That brings me to the point that this principle is being applied to the big leaseholds of Western Queensland, which under present conditions, and for many a day to come, could not be devoted to closer settlement for agriculture or dairying. I hope that with the extension of railway communication, and when the capabilities of the lands out there are better understood, a change will come over the scene. We know that in Queensland, as settlement progresses and a better know ledge of farming is acquired, pastoral lands are more and more devoted to agriculture. But that change is a long way off, so far as the lands of the western districts are concerned. Queensland has -allowed these leasehold tenures to exist there so that, as conditions improve, the land may be devoted to' closer settlement. But in applying this principle to the western lands of Queensland, the Government are trying to expedite a policy which' is utterly impracticable there. I fear that tbe only result of their effort may be to make pastoral pursuits so unprofitable there that the lands will become unoccupied. That, I am sure, is not the wish of the Prime Minister. I put this consideration to him in the hope that he will give it his sympathetic attention. If he is determined to apply this taxation to frain from making it cumulative. In the case of absentees, the tax will ru n up to lOd. in the £ 1 , and the results must be injurious. We are not raising these objections in any partisan spirit. The desire of honourable members on both sides should be to avoid any serious injustice. We must recognise that anything whicb tends to throw land out of cultivation and tc reduce the production of wealth in Australia, must be of serious injury to 'the Commonwealth. Let there be no mistake. If the rural districts are impaired in their productivity, the effect must be felt at once in all our cities.

But as the measure, is to create an additional impost of over £590,000, an increase of 36 or 37 per cent, on the taxation which land-holders are now paying, I consider that the Government ought to have a little longer time in which to consider the probable effects of the B ill .

I move a further amendmentThat the words ""and nil subsequent years"" at the end of the clause lie left out. The object of the amendment is to make this additional impost simply a war tax. Whilst there may be some justification for placing this enormous burden on a comparatively few taxpayers-onl y about 15,000-ther e can be no justification for confiscatory taxation. In the higher gradations of the tax the additional impost amounts to one-fifth, and in some cases almost one-fourth of the taxable value of the land. mous taxation already levied-taxatio n for shire purposes, State land tax, and income tax on revenue derived from landso that the imposts are becoming of such a nature that the whole value of land is tbeine taxed away. r That can only have -a very bad effect upon the country.

The Government have no moral right to take that course. I suggest for the consideration of the Prime Minister, that he might accept the amendment. The principle is a very old established one in the home of Parliament that taxation Bills of a certain nature should be introduced from year to year.

W h y should our honourable friends opposite exploit the taxable possibilities of Australia to meet things with which this war is not concerned? They would have us believe that the measure has nothing whatever to do with the war. They repudiate the idea that it is connected with the war. That matter is to be dealt with by loan. But how are my honourable friends going to liquidate the loan afterwards? How do they propose later to put things on a solid and sound financial basis? They will have to face the issue sooner or later, but now they deliberately propose to take away a large share of the taxable assets.

I do not know where this sort of thing is to end. I am quite sure that we cannot go on having two taxing machines imposing burdens on the same people. This can end only in one way.
