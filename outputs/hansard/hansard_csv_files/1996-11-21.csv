Ms JEANES (Kingston) (10.01 a.m.)-I rise to speak against the Euthanasia Laws Bill. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge the input from many of my constituents to my decision on this bill. There is no halfway with the issue that this bill seeks to override, no shades of grey. You are either required to vote for the practice of euthanasia or against it. Under our democratic system, therefore, I simply cannot represent the views of each and every one of my constituents because in the end the democratic process requires me to vote in line with the views of some and against the views of others. But that is what life in this place is all about. I have always held the view that elected members of parliament should perform their roles somewhere between the Burkean notion of representation where the elected representative has a strong sense of what is right and what is right for their constituents and the participatory model of representation where the constituents actively participate in each and every decision that the elected representative makes. I feel that I have achieved such a mix in this case. The decision that I make on this issue is finely balanced between the principles that I believe should underpin public policy pertaining to euthanasia and its practice and the views of my constituents. The underlying principle in this case is that no-one has the right to deny any person who is terminally ill and bearing insufferable pain the right to say for themselves enough is enough. In making my decision in relation to the specifics of this bill and the law that it seeks to override, I drew on my experiences in watching the health of two of my grandparents deteriorate in the period leading up to their deaths. My maternal grandfather died after a long and painful fight with bowel cancer. One of my last memories of my grandfather was when I visited him in the nursing home and I was trying to interpret what he was saying to me. He was having difficulty making me realise that he wanted me to get him his sputum mug. I cannot remember a time when I felt more inadequate and this is the picture that too often flashes before my mind when I remember my grandfather. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Menzies( Mr Andrews), this parliament or any other parliament in this country has no right to deny me the opportunity not to be remembered by my grandchildren in this way.",157,Total 22 769 23 759
387,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"took the chair at 10.00 a.m.7320 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 My grandfather had no intention of asking for assistance to end his pain and suffering. He was a very strong, stubborn man. But just because he displayed incredible strength and stubbornness, it does not mean that someone else in his position should be denied the opportunity to request such assistance. My paternal grandmother died late last year. It is very sad that she did not have the opportunity to see me arrive in this place as she had been a great supporter of my interest in politics for many years. But had she still been alive, she would not have known that I was here anyway as her mental condition had deteriorated over the previous two years or so. As with many elderly people, her short term memory was severely compromised and she became very weak in the last few months of her life. But I still remember her delightfully as my grandmother. Despite her confusion, she died peacefully without pain and she was well cared for at the masonic village in the electorate of the member for Hindmarsh ( Mrs Gallus). Opponents to euthanasia claim that people like my grandmother will become victims of foul play, that they will be euthanised against their will. The Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally III Act 1995 is clear and it states: A patient who, in the course of a terminal illness, is experiencing pain, suffering and/or distress to an extent unacceptable to the patient, may request the patient's medical practitioner to assist the patient to terminate the patient's life. The key words here are 'unacceptable to the patient'. No-one else but the patient can know what is unacceptable to them and no-one but the patient can make the request to the medical practitioner. The Northern Territory's act also includes the conditions under which the medical practitioner may assist a patient to end her or his life. It includes strong penalties for those who seek to deceive or use improper influence to procure consent and it includes the provision that the medical practitioner shall 'report the death to the Coroner by sending to the Coroner a copy of the death certificate.' To do otherwise than to follow the provisions in the act would be to contribute to an act of murder and thus prosecutable and punishable under the Northern Territory'S law. People.like my grandmother could not possibly have chosen the course of euthanasia as she was not competent to do so nor was she in pain and nor did she have an illness that threatened her life. She simply died peacefully one morning from old age. The Northern Territory's act could not have been applied to her and those who threaten that old people will be killed for convenience are guilty of creating a disgraceful and unnecessary hysteria amongst the elderly and vulnerable. Sadly, this fear is a recurrent theme in the letters that I receive from some elderly constituents. AllI can do is write back and reassure them that the fundamental tenet of the Northern Territory'S legislation is that of consent by the patient. The Northern Territory's legislation gives more protection to terminally ill people, who endure pain and suffering, than they currently have. At present they have no protection in the form of a legislati ve framework and nor do the doctors who selflessly assist them to end that pain and suffering. While an exact figure obviously cannot be provided, it is generally accepted that around 14 per cent of doctors admit that they have assisted terminally ill patients to end their lives. The Northern Territory's legislation gives protection to those doctors who feel that they should assist with their patient's request. It gives patients protection in that it requires their consent Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7321 and gives them a cooling off period to consider their decision. It requires that they are assessed as competent to make that decision. In my state of South Australia, we have an excellent system of palliative care which is underwritten by legislation. The legislation enables doctors to administer pain relief to the patients even if that treatment contributes to the death of the patient. It seems to me therefore that there is a very fine line between the palliative care legislation that those opposed to euthanasia proclaim as the answer to the treatment of pain in terminally ill people and the Northern Territory's legislation. Both acts provide for the active intervention of the medical practitioner to assist the patient relieve her or his pain. Death can be the consequence under the provisions set out in both acts. Intent can be the same under both acts. The Northern Territory act is more honest because it requires the patient to consent to the intervention that causes their death. Opponents to euthanasia also argue that, in this day and age, palliative care can effectively deal with the pain experienced by patients. Doctors working in palliative care claim that around eight per cent of their patients still request assistance to end their lives despite receiving the best available care that medical technology can deliver. Palliative care does not work for everybody. Northern Territorians have already passed the legislation through the appropriate democratic processes. The people of the Northern Territory elected their members of parliament in 1994. The parliament passed the legislation in 1995. The legislation was challenged in the supreme court earlier this year and the challenge was dismissed. I am somewhat bemused that I stand here, hardly well known for my hardline position on states rights, particularly when related to matters of environmental protection, raising the issue of the right of people in a state or territory to have their democratically elected representatives make legislation in parliament in line with that parliament's constitutional responsibility. I would like to remind the member for Menzies of his concern expressed to the House in August 1994 about the usurping of the rights of people in the states when the then Assistant Treasurer sought to do something he disagreed with. I suggest that the member for Menzies is attempting to do the very same thing that he accused the previous Assistant Treasurer of in 1994. Both the member for Menzies and I have at some stage advocated the right of duly elected state and territory parliaments to pass laws. I suspect that the reason that we differ on the right of the Northern Territory to make legislation pertaining to euthanasia is purely and simply that we have a fundamentally different view on euthanasia. That is all this debate is about. This debate is simply about the right of the people in the Northern Territory, who voted for a government which passed a bill allowing euthanasia under certain circumstances, to be able to choose euthanasia under very tragic circumstances. It should also be about the right of all Australians to have the opportunity to choose to receive such assistance to end their pain and suffering, as many of my constituents who have watched family members die in pain have said to me. The member for Menzies has shown this House that he believes that his interference in the lives of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory is more important than their right to have such a choice. In closing, I would like to refer to the concern that John Stuart Mill expressed in regard to threats posed to the liberty of citizens. Unlike the member for Menzies, I believe that Mill would support the practice of euthanasia. Mill was concerned about the threat to individual 7322 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 liberty posed by the state. He argued that there were two types of acts-self-regarding acts and other-regarding acts. Any intrusion by the states on self-regarding acts constituted tyranny. Any intervention, therefore, by this parliament on the right of Northern Territorians to have the opportunity available to them to choose euthanasia is a tyrannical intervention. After much reflection and assistance from my constituents, I have formed the view that the right that deserves priority in this debate is that of terminally ill people to choose for themselves to die with dignity and to end their pain. No one individual, no organised church or community group, no one member of parliament or no parliament should have the right to deny them that opportunity. that, at the moment, two debates of great moment are running: one on prejudice and one on euthanasia. It is interesting to observe that in both these debates, parliamentarians are being implored and beseeched to reflect the will of their constituencies by representing the mainstream view; the majority view. Whilst the debate on prejudice is raging in a form which is both malevolent and vicious, the debate on euthanasia is being held with a great degree of common sense, courtesy and civility. If one speaks about free speech, this is one example of how to have such a debate. I think it would do all of us some good to reflect on that. While we are doing so, we might reflect on what representing our community means and how we should approach it. We have all received letters from people advising us that we should reflect their will. This has become a mantra for some people in recent years. Of course, they would not deny the will of the 100,000 other people we represent. They assume that we have no way of knowing the will of the rest of the community. But representing people is not simply about reflecting their will; it is also about leading. If we simply reflect what people think, we stagnate as a society: nothing changes, there is no innovation and there is no development. On the other hand, if we simply lead and do not reflect, eventually no-one follows. The balance between the two is the fundamental issue in both these debates. On the issue of prejudice, it would appear that the majority support a position of prejudice. On the issue of euthanasia, it would appear that the majority support people's right to chose their exit from this life. The ironic part is that the position of parliamentarians is almost in the opposite direction to those two majorities. That bears some thinking about. In this complex life we lead, and given the complex role of democracy, the way those things are worked through will have great importance in the years ahead. The way we as parliamentarians handle those two issues will make and shape what we see as democracy into the next century. I am delighted that we are handling this particular issue with aplomb and with a majority view. On this particular issue we have personal experiences, personal views and philosophical positions. I find it very difficult to accept the point of view of many of my colleagues that a system can be devised where pushing one button is ethically allowable whereas pushing another button is not. I find it impossible to accept the claim that people who turn off a life support system are not doing so intentionally: that somehow the death of the person on the life support system is accidental or irrelevant to their act. I think that position is the position ofthose who have a conclusion and then try to manufacture the arguments to suit. There are no ethics in that. I think there is a great deal of dishonesty in the fabrication that, by turning off life support and allowing a person to die, they can say, 'Mea culpa, but I am not responsible. I did not do it.'",159,Representatives Main Committee
388,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (Lo.ll A.m.),"I do not think it is surprising or unusualThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7323 I wonder how they would relate to the story out of the UK about the cleaner who turned off the switch accidentally. You wonder whether or not they should be charged with murder; technically they should be. But, in the same way, so should any doctor or any member of the hospital staff who turns off the switch knowing that in so doing the person will die-whether they die from the illness, from starvation or whatever. That switch may well be a switch that supplies food, so they starve a person to death. Somehow they say, 'It's not my fault.' To assist a person to die somehow seems to be different. I find that the parallel is absolutely total. There is no differentiation in my mind, except for one thing: with euthanasia the person who is having the switch turned off or the button pushed off-whatever it might be called-has some say, some choice. The person on the life support system has no choice. If we then take the next step, which is the suggestion that this will lead to an outburst of murder, that suddenly doctors, nurses and families will be rushing off to kill people left, right and centre because they are expendable and disposable: the fact is that if doctors, nurses and families are like that, they will not want this legislation because it will impede them. In this case they will need the approval of the person involved. If people are so malevolent, if doctors are so bad, as to murder people because the law will give them permission to murder someone, why would they want the law to be passed? Why would the families who seek the benefit of someone's death want to put up an impediment to achieving that-the requirement of the person's approval-when at the moment they do not? If anything, euthanasia made legal will reduce homicide. What we are getting is obscuration. People are putting forward to the community the proposition that euthanasia equals murder. Voluntary euthanasia is not murder; it involves a decision by the person themselves. What we have now is murder. We have a case in Victoria right now-I read it with some concern last week-where a man is being charged with murder because he helped his wife to die and he tried to kill himself but failed. A man of advanced years who did an act of great generosity, of great love, is now charged with murder because he failed his own suicide. Week by week we are seeing more and more cases of murder suicides of couples who cannot bear to watch what is happening. A man has been charged with murder not because he killed his wife but because he did not kill himself. If he had died, he would not be charged and he would not be dragged through a court to explain why he was carrying out his wife's wishes. I find those who argue from a Christian position to be very unchristian. I had an experience in recent years of one in my own family who declined over time. He has spent some years not knowing anybody. I watched the effect on him, on his wife and on his children. I do not want to be in that situation ever. I do not want my daughter to see someone she does not understand and does not relate to. I do not want to see anybody have to do that on my behalf. I do not want the kind of life that would condemn both me and my family to what my family went through for that period of time. We all have examples of such cases and, if anything, that made it very clear to me that the idea of charity, of love and of care is not reflected by persistence with survival. Let us go back to our ethical systems, to pre-Christian ethics, and look at how values of life have developed. What we are finding nowadays with modem medicine and modem technology is that we can keep people alive in their bodies above and beyond anything we have ever dreamt of, beyond what our ethics were ever designed to cope with. We still call it the same word-life, l-i-f-e. Therefore, it still means the same thing. The kind of life that we are talking 7324 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 about for these people is not life as we knew it, is not life as it was around the time of Christ or even before and it does not have the same value placed on it. What people are doing in this situation is putting a value on life which is not life. This is a difficult debate. It is one in which we will all choose our own paths, as we do for most issues, quite frankly. It is one the community needs us to lead and needs us to do so with some depth and some moderation. This debate will not finish today, this week or this year. I think it will go on for years to come. I am sure that at the end of the day our community will say to us, 'Please give us the choice about our life. It is ours after all. Do not interfere. Do not tell us how to run our life, how to leave this life.' (Time expired) Territory legislation have essentially either argued that euthanasia or state sanctioned killing is a good thing or, alternatively, they push the so-called states or territories rights argument. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like you to listen very carefully to these words: Euthanasia legislation can have all the safeguards imaginable but, at the end of the day, the principle remains-one personkills another person. If that sounds dramatic, the simple fact is that that is exactly what is involved. In that sense, the numerous amendments that have been foreshadowed are irrelevant. You either support euthanasia or you don't. The simple fact is that there is a huge difference between helping a person to die as opposed to killing someone. I believe that distinction has been lost on the proponent and those who support the bill. The moment you legalise doctors killing their patients, even with their consent and with benevolent motives, you cross an important threshold. You debase the currency of human life. The potential for error and abuse, the risk to vulnerable individuals and the profound effect on society's values presents the most compelling reasons against allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia. Whose words were these, Mr Deputy Speaker? Were these the words of Archbishop Peter Hollingworth? Were they the words of the Catholic bishops conference? Were they the words of the Buddhist movement, or Hindus or Muslims or any mainstream religion? No. They were the words of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, in the debate on the Northern Territory legislation in the Northern Territory parliament last year. Obviously, Mr Stone, who has been such an opponent of the Andrews bill, clearly abhors euthanasia to the extent and to the same degree that those of us who are supporting this bill do. The Northern Territory effectively is asking this parliament to reject this bill on the basis of so-called states or territories rights. If the Northern Territory were a state, then that argument might have some validity. I would like to outline to the committee section 122 of the Australian constitution, which says: The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. That says it all. This parliament has a responsibility to overturn the Northern Territory law. Members, when considering where they stand on this issue, should be able to consider whether they support state sanctioned killing, otherwise known as euthanasia, or whether they do not. The states-territories rights argument has absolutely no validity. It is also interesting to note that some who oppose this bill found no problem in supporting the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill last year, which sought to overturn some aspects of",162,Representatives Main Committee
389,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (10.21 A.m.),"Proponents of the maintenance of the NorthernThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7325 the Tasmanian criminal code on the basis of using the external affairs power. I abstained on that bill but have absolutely no hesitation in stating that I will be voting in this parliament to support this legislation. I must say that the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill has been thought provoking. I have been impressed with the way that members on both sides of this argument have been able to put forward their views. One of our colleagues has said that this bill, in effect, has given us the opportunity to market the parliament. We have been able to show the Australian people that members of parliament are able to come to this place to vigorously and forcefully put forward where we stand on this issue and then make a decision. We will make a decision on this bill on our conscience. There does appear to be a great deal of confusion in the community over what is intended by euthanasia. Euthanasia is not the practice of turning off a life support system, where there is no hope of recovery, and allowing nature to take its course. Euthanasia is not effective pain management, even where increased doses of pain killing drugs might advance death. The question must be asked: is the purpose to relieve pain or cause death? I am opposed to state sanctioned killing, that it should be legal for a person in civilised society to kill another. The fact that it may happen now, in some isolated cases, does not mean that as a society, as a community, we should legalise it. There has been an inquiry in the Netherlands into what euthanasia practice is in that country. It is very interesting to note-I am indebted to the book The Challenge of Euthanasia by Brian Pollard-that there were a thousand cases of life-ending actions without specific request. So in the Netherlands, doctors are terminating patients' lives without request. There were also instances where there have been some withdrawals of life sustaining treatment without request for the purpose or explicit purpose of shortening life. So where does assisted killing upon request cease and unrequested murder start? This week's debate should also take note of the reports which we have seen from various parts of the world. In particular I would like to draw the committee's attention to the House of Lords inquiry in 1994 which concluded: It would be next to impossible to ensure that every act of euthanasia was truly voluntary. We have all seen the comments made by former Governor General, Bill Hayden, who refers to some frail elderly people as 'unproductive burdens'. In a speech in 1995 he said that 'succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered of some unproductive burdens'. How do these people who are ill-at a time in their lives when they are feeling vulnerable-feel to hear the former Governor General of Australia say that? At what stage would euthanasia, if legalised, cease to be an option and become an obligation? There could be people waiting for an inheritance. Would that give the unspoken message to those people who might be terminally ill that it is really time to flick the switch? I would be sad if we as a society got to a situation where euthanasia were legalised. I believe it would be sad if we as a community failed to overturn the Northern Territory legislation. The Northern Territory legislation is not simply a law for the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory would become the euthanasia capital of Australia. The Northern Territory would be a place where people from throughout the country went to to take advantage of the Northern Territory legislation. I am concerned that some of those people who are normally outspoken in their support of Aboriginals are in fact ignoring the fact that the Aboriginal community is very opposed to the Northern Territory bill. 7326 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 As parliamentarians in this debate, we have an historic opportunity to stand up for the vulnerable, the poor, the sick and the disadvantaged. I believe that we have an obligation to stand up and be counted. I would like to quote the Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Denis Burke, who has also been vociferous in his opposition to the Andrews bill. In disagreeing with Marshall Perron, he said: The member for Fannie Bay says that, if he helps 1 Territorian die with dignity, he will have accomplished something. I say that, if this Assembly by passing this bill causes the death of one person that could have been avoided, I am guilty, I am diminished. We are the lesser for it. I say that if this parliament, by failing to pass this bill, causes the death of one person that could have been avoided, we are guilty, we are diminished, we are the lesser for it. I commend the bill to the committee. members that the standing orders of the House apply to this chamber as well as the main chamber, and that standing order 55 should be observed in entering or leaving the chamber or crossing it. career, I have only exercised two conscience votes. The first, in 1975 in the Victorian Legislative Assembly was to abolish the death penalty and I had no doubts at all on the issue. On the second, in the House of Representatives in 1978, the Lusher motion to take away medical benefits for abortion, I had very real doubts. So it will be with the third, on the private member's bill to overturn the Northern Territory's euthanasia law. A debate in which the outcome is uncertain and depends on the quality of the discussion itself is of the greatest rarity-an occasion when this parliament itself can take a lead. How appalling then that this debate has been shunted off to a committee room with a lO-minute limit on speeches, without members actually listening to each other. In this debate, it is my conscience that I must follow-a conscience shaped by knowledge, analysis and, I hope, compassion. I adopt the words of Edmund Burke in his celebrated address to the electors of Bristol in 1774: Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion. I see both sides of the euthanasia debate all too clearly. No bther issue has troubled me so much because I am not sure that I am correct. Nevertheless, I have a moral obligation to vote-to choose. I cannot abstain-indeed, not to choose is to choose. The contribution of Sir Gustav Nossal to the collection of essays entitled The last right? puts the position with compassion and clarity and I adopt his words: Dying with dignity and in peace should be everyone's right, particularly in an industrialised country with high standards of health care. Nevertheless, I am against the formal legalisation of euthanasia. A wellordered society is a very fragile thing, as recent history (Hitler, Pol Pot, Rwanda) shows. I believe there are grave dangers in a society giving to anyone, no matter how well intentioned, the right to terminate a human life. However, I do believe that those who are terminally ill should come to the end as free of pain as possible and with as tranquil a state of mind as possible. This may necessitate the use of strong drugs in doses that imperil life. I certainly do not believe that fear of possibly fatal consequences should limit the dosage of narcotics, tranquillisers or other medications in such circumstances. It seems to me that the crucial thing here is intent. The intent to relieve pain and suffering is good; the intent directly to kill breaches what I consider to be societal norms. Enshrining a right to terminate life in legislation Would, I believe, do more harm than good, although I totally support the right of others to disagree with this view.",164,Representatives Main Committee

391,Mr Barry Jones (Lalor) (10.30 A.m.),"In the course of my 25-year parliamentaryThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7327 The valuable contributions of Mr Justice Michael Kirby and Sir Ninian Stephen are along parallel lines. I support the Victorian Medical Treatment Act 1988 and would commend it to the legislature of the Northern Territory. At the consideration in detail stage of the bill, after the passage of the second reading of the Andrews bill, I propose to move some amendments to the three schedules of the bill to incorporate the broad thrust of the Victorian act. The Victorian act, now adopted in South Australia as well, was introduced by a Labor government, drafted, as it happened, by Mr Kevin Andrews, who was later to become the federal member for Menzies, and endorsed by Archbishop Sir Frank Little. However, on several points my amendments would go further than the Victorian act. I know very well that the practical outcome of the Victorian legislation has led to a good death-literally, in the Greek, euthanasia-for very many terminally ill patients, but where death is the side effect of heavy sedation, a corollary of the treatment of acute and chronic pain, not the result of direct intention to terminate life, death by timetable, death by appointment. The practical outcome probably differs very little-merely a delay of hours or days-but the moral implications are completely different. It does not force a physician to pass over the Rubicon-to transform his or her role from a preserver of life to a terminator of life. There have, of course, been no prosecutions under the Victorian law. To the best of my knowledge, the law is working well. I have been following recent decisions in the US Supreme Court where a bare majority of judges is now re-defining limits to privacy-whether rights over matters involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime are central to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing equal protection under the law. Justice Anthony Kennedy said: At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. These words first used in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, an abortion case, have been adopted by other courts in euthanasia and assisted suicide cases. The US Supreme Court majority may be moving towards a distinction between the realms of 'private law' and 'public law'. Such private law would include sexual orientation, contraception, which used to be illegal in some American states, abortion-the great philosophical divide being on whether a foetus is to be regarded as a person-and assisted suicide. Some state courts have struck down assisted suicide laws, but these cases are yet to go on appeal to the Supreme Court. One could not imagine a more central illustration of privacy than choosing the way we die, and this includes assisted suicide or 'assisted passage', as I have called it. In matters of life, death and sexuality, the realm of public law remains in the areas where there are identifiable victims-where there is no consent, or where children and the incompetent are, correctly, deemed to be incapable of consenting. I am increasingly drawn to this division between private and public law and I would prefer less rather than more state intervention by way of regulation. At a time when economics rationalism is the dominant paradigm, with its obsession that all values have a dollar equivalent, the medical system will come under increasing pressure to speed up the turnaround time in hospital beds. In the Northern Territory, the fear of Aboriginal groups about how the law might be applied in practice is understandable, although, I hope, misplaced. 7328 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 I felt distinctly uneasy about Bill Hayden's view that 'utilitarian judgments ... cannot be totally ignored' as if loss of productive capacity was a prelude to elimination in a brave new world. I have always thought that the key element of civilisation is that we preserve at infinite cost elements of life and experience which cannot be justified on purely utilitarian grounds. When this bill is carried, will the Howard government put more resources into palliative care? I hope so, but I could be permitted some scepticism. I have real difficulty with the idea of institutionalising euthanasia by setting up legislative protocols. A very highly qualified House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics 1994, chaired by Professor Lord Walton of Detchant, a neurologist, was repelled by its observation of Netherlands practice. The committee concluded that there was a high risk of involuntary euthanasia being applied and where terminally ill patients are under a burden of guilt, as well as disease, and feel they must relieve and end the suffering of family and friends and the drain on resources. This guilt pressure may prove to be the thin end of the wedge. The resource, or utilitarian arguments for euthanasia can also be applied to the issue of capital punishment and I repudiate both. I am well aware that passive euthanasia occurs already and will continue. On balance, I have more confidence in the role of medical practitioners operating under existing moral and ethical constraints within the profession, and with the provision for 'living wills' and the appointment of agents, than providing an institutionalised code, supervised by a state or territory. The great British judge Patrick Devlin, in his 1985 book Easing the Passing, quotes his summing up in the famous trial in 1957 of Dr John Bodkin Adams: If the first purpose of medicine, the restoration of health, can no longer be achieved, there is still much for a doctor to do, and he is entitled to do all that is proper and necessary to relieve pain and suffering, even if the measures he takes may incidentally shorten life. This is not because there is a special defence for medical men but because no act is murder which does not cause death. We are not dealing here with philosophical or technical cause, but with the common sense cause. The cause of death is the illness or the injury, and the proper medical treatment that is administered and that has an incidental effect on determining the exact moment of death is not the cause of death in any sensible use of the term. But ... no doctor, nor any man, no more in the case of the dying than the healthy, has the right deliberately to cut the thread of life. With all due respect to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, I had not thought of it as providing moral leadership for the rest of the world, especially as there is a deep division between those members who are committed to the principle of euthanasia per se and those, such as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who feel obligated to support the Rights of the Terminally III Act as an assertion of territorial sovereignty, a position shared by the legislators of the ACT and Norfolk Island. Cocos Island and Lord Howe Island are silent on either issue. Oddly, the Northern Territory's remonstrance does not refer to section 122 of the Commonwealth constitution which gives this parliament a specific head of power over legislation passed in territorial legislatures. Until the Northern Territory becomes a state, or until the constitution is revised, there can be no moral, legal or political objection to the Commonwealth parliament exercising its functions. Of 128 sections in the Commonwealth constitution, I estimate that there are 32 which are either irrelevant, anachronistic or purely transitional-without counting those sections relating to the exercise of monarchical power. Section 44 which led to the Lindsay by-election is one of them; section 122 is another. Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7329 I am singularly unimpressed by the argument that, because public opinion polls support euthanasia, the Northern Territory's law should be allowed to stand. If the Northern Territory decided to restore the death penalty, that too might generate rousing support as indicated in public opinion polls, but I would not hesitate to vote to overturn it if it was brought before this parliament under section 122. I am very conscious that, having been constrained by the clock, I delivered the early part of my speech with excessive speed, but it will read well. difficult issue to debate, particularly for politicians. In the course of a week we are expected to be experts on perhaps 15 or 20 things. In the course of a term or a career in this place we are expected to be experts on hundreds, if not thousands, of issues. Generally, we do not do a bad job, but on euthanasia the truth is that none of us can be certain that the stance we take is 100 per cent the correct one. The public out there support euthanasia-75 per cent to 25 per cent-whereas probably in this chamber the members oppose euthanasia 75 per cent to 25 per cent. But whichever stance we take, it is going to be politically harmful for us. There are two initial points I wish to make in this debate. The first one is on section 122 of the constitution. I believe that it quite clearly and absolutely states that the parliament can overturn any territory law. It cannot do so with a state. Of course, that begs the question: what would happen if we overturned this law? If the territory became a state in two or three years time and reintroduced the law, we would have no power over that state. The second point worth making is that in so many areas of medicine, science has bolted ahead of the law. That is exemplified in this debate here today. I am genuinely torn on both sides of the argument because I can see both sides have very valid points to make. On the one side we have the Christian arguments, the sanctity of life arguments, the moral arguments, the argument that this will be the thin edge of the wedge if it is introduced, and so on. On the other side we have the argument that you have the right to determine the course of your own life, especially the quality of your life, and the belief that we should have compassion for those in intractable pain, and so on. On balance, I come down on the side of the right to euthanasia. While my wife disagrees with me, my 85-year-old father is in strong agreement with me, so there is division even within my own family. There is one thing I wish to acknowledge. The opinions of most of us are shaped by the experiences of our past. Several years ago my own mother was very sick in a small country hospital for several weeks. I tried to visit her daily. I had to go through the room next-door to see her. In the room was an elderly lady who was deteriorating day by day. She had cancer of the cheek muscles-I think it must have been rhabdomyoma. It was slowly eating away her cheek muscles. It was exposing her molar teeth, the inside of the back of her mouth and parts of her skull. It was a gruesome thing to see on a daily basis. She could not eat. She could take a little fluid orally. It was trickled down her throat to ease the dryness in her throat, but most of it ran out of the side of her mouth. She became lighter and frailer with each passing day. She was in constant pain that was not relieved in any way by morphine. Heroin, of course, had been banned by then. It was only her pioneer toughness that was keeping her alive. There was an odour of rotting flesh. Nursing staff were reluctant to go in. She was suffering a gross loss of dignity. She had little control of her body functions. I do not know whether that woman, if she had been competent to do so, would have chosen to die. I suspect she would have. In her case there was no life support system to turn off. To me, the fact that her life was prolonged in the way it was, was an act of utter cruelty. The achievement-if that is what you would like to call it-of keeping her alive was nothing more nor less than an",166,Representatives Main Committee
392,Mr Cobb (Parkes) (10.40 A.m.),"I want to acknowledge at the outset that this is a very7330 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 obscenity. I was a farmer and a veterinary surgeon. IfI had acted in such a way with my animal clients I would have been hauled up, quite rightly, by the RSPCA and charged. I think that in the transition period as we go from nature taking its course into the realms of modern medicine that we have seen over the past decades-and will go over in the decades ahead-we are in danger of losing our way. The Eskimos used to take a walk in the snow, and the nomadic Aborigines used to leave the old and frail behind. But now we have palliative care: 99 per cent of the time it is doing a magnificent job and it is being improved all the time. But it is still sadly inadequate for a small number of sufferers. In our desire and duty to prolong life, in a very small number of cases, sometimes, paradoxically, we are destroying life in a quality sense by keeping these people alive. To force these people-small number that they may be-to stay alive and to suffer, to lose their dignity, when I believe nature and God, if you like, would not have subjected these unfortunate people to this gruelling marathon of torture before their death, I think is wrong. To do it in the name of civilisation, to do it in the name of modern medicine, to do it in the name of religion, I think is a cruel distortion of what is normal. We should meditate upon that. Some people do not have life support systems to be withdrawn. Some do not have doctors who are willing to overdose them to get the double effect to create their deaths. Others do not have the choice of suicide as some do, because they cannot do it themselves. These people who are being offered this choice in the Northern Territory are going to have it denied them if we vote against it. I fail to see the logic of that. If you believe in the sanctity of life, in the right of people not to suffer, not to have this dreadful indignity, I think it is tragic that these people could have that choice taken away. I believe the Northern Territory recognises the quality and value of human life in their bill.

You have to be over 18 years old. It has to be voluntary. It must be requested by the patient. The general practitioner must agree. A specialist then must agree. A psychiatrist then must agree. There are two cooling off periods, one of seven days and one of two days. The implications must be discussed with the family, and so on and so on. It is as foolproof as you can get it. To those who oppose this bill but still condone life support systems being turned off, sometimes without patients' permission, and also to those who condone overdosing of patients, sometimes without their permission, but who do not agree to this, I say, quite frankly, that I cannot understand the logic of it. We can kill people against their wiII, done for the most compassionate and noble of purposes, but we can oppose this, where it is done with even greater carefulness and regulation. That to me seems to be totally illogical. This bilI is not about overturning murder, as some have said. This bill is largely about assisted suicide in a most humane form. I believe that, if we vote against the Northern Territory legislation, we will do a small number of people a great disservice and condemn them to a degree of suffering that no human being should have to endure or would have to endure if they chose to take the alternative path that the Northern Territory government has offered. should not be being held here. This chamber was set up to hear the least controversial, least contentious pieces of legislation. What we have instead is one of the most controversial, most significant, pieces of legislation coming here. It is the only bilI this year where we have had a conscience vote, the only bill where the outcome is not predetermined, the only bill where the debate is not set piece and could actually change votes. As Michael Gawenda said: The debate on the Andrews Bill should not be shunted off to a Committee Room. Instead, it should be shown on national television so that all Australians can see and hear their political representatives wrestling with their consciences on this life-and-death question. For me this is a tough call. There are strong arguments on both sides. I understand the force of Bob Dent's message. I understand the force of the argument that people should be all owed to determine what they do with their lives. I do not personally think that suicide or attempted suicide should be a criminal act, although I do find it hard to work up any sympathy for those who leave children behind or, even worse, take them with them. But, as they say in the law, hard cases make for bad law, and I will come to that later. This is a fascinating debate because you find people in all political parties on different sides of the debate. If we examine why this is, I think it teIls us quite a lot about our attitudes not only on ethical and moral questions but also on what we see the role of the states and the government as and what government is actually there to do and not to do. While most conservative politicians are quite comfortable with free market economics-although, interestingly, some commentators like Gerard Henderson and Robert Manne are awake to its shortcomings; I have even heard this bill's author speak against privatisation--quite a few are uncomfortable about libertarian social policy, support censorship and have problems with, for example, abortion, homosexuality and euthanasia. That seems to be the basis for the different factions now springing up in the Liberal Party, such as the Lyons Forum, which has the view that government should intervene in these questions, and the John Stuart Mill Society, which has the view that it should not. I do not feel the need to address the views of either the Lyons Forum or the John Stuart MilI Society.",169,Representatives Main Committee
393,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wiils) (10.49 A.m.),"In my view, the debate on euthanasiaThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7333 I want to talk to those in my electorate, close to 300 of whom have written and some of whom came to see me about this issue. I want to explain to people like the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham), for whom I have immense admiration, good friends like Gary Jungworth and Eva Jones, who are Labor Party members, and one or two members on my staff, who think differently about this issue, why I believe that the progressive position is to support the Andrews bill and to oppose euthanasia. I believe that the state plays an important role in making our community better. I am not attracted to anarchy. I do not like the economic law of the jungle which leads to beggars in the streets and the dogs and armed guards patrolling the estates of the rich and powerful. That is how it is in some countries. I hope that the free market fetish of the Liberal Party does not bring it here. I do not think anything goes. I do not have any problem about government getting in there and outlawing things which diminish us as a society. It ought to be understood that euthanasia is, first and foremost, a contract between a doctor and a patient. The Labor Party has never believed in unlimited freedom of contracts. We do not believe in freedom of contracts that exploit workers, particularly children. We do not believe in freedom of contracts between heroin dealers and buyers. We do not believe in freedom of contracts between gun dealers and buyers. So the question is not about the freedom of contracts. The question is: what is the social impact of euthanasia? To answer this question, we first need to clear up some misunderstandings. The European Association for Palliative Care points out that there is a lot of misunderstanding of the difference between dying with dignity and euthanasia. 'Dying with dignity' has become a slogan of opposition to useless and degrading prolongation of life when a patient's organs, or those still minimally functional, can no longer support or permit the exercise of se1ffulfilling personal control over life's events. The association says: A time comes in the course of a disease when it is wrong to continue to prolong life aggressively and when it is right to honour informed patient's refusal of treatments that only prolong suffering. I agree with them. I was proud to be associated with the Victorian Labor government's dying with dignity legislation. I think that the Northern Territory government should now look to this as a model for its own situation. The association also says that the legalisation of euthanasia, the active intervention which kills a patient, is unnecessary and dangerous. With the development of modem methods of palliative medicine and palliative care they say that the civilised solution rests with a rapid implementation of programs of palliative medicine and palliative care not with the resignation to pressure for euthanasia. We have all received a lot of correspondence on this issue, but the letter which had more impact on my position than any other came from Father John Brosnan, who has been the Pentridge Prison chaplain for 30 years and is a famous opponent of capital punishment, which is a position I share. Father Brosnan said: There are important parallels between the state sanctioned killing which we call capital punishment and the state sanctioned killing which is now being called euthanasia. First, he said: If someone's life appears to be worthless, allowing that problem to be addressed by killing the person allows society to avoid having to take the harder and more expensive road of actually providing resources for a more supportive, interesting and caring way of life. Secondly, he said: 7334 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 Many of the opponents of capital punishment are not so much opposed to capital punishment in principle, but were most concerned at the possibility-indeed the certainty-that innocent people would be killed. That is my position also. As Father Brosnan pointed out, mistakes are inevitable. He said: With capital punishment and euthanasia every mistake is permanent. There is no turning back. In his letter he also said: The fanfare which accompanied the first lethal injection in the Northern Territory will not be around for those who will be the victims of pressure or abuse. Of course, the evidence from the Netherlands, where euthanasia has been allowed, is quite disturbing. I have got to say that the reports that 52 per cent of all euthanasia there is nonvoluntary is so alarming that I find it difficult to believe. Irrespective of whether that figure is right or wrong, the British House of Lords concluded after an analysis of the Netherlands situation that it had been impossible to set safe limits to euthanasia. I have also been influenced by the writing of Robert Manne, who expressed his concern. He said: Family pressure will be applied which will suggest to someone who is terminally ill that no good can come from their purposeless clinging to life, that they have become a mere burden, and that they owe it to their suffering family to request an officially sanctioned death. I certainly do not want my parents or anyone else to have to ask themselves that kind of question. I regard every breath of air I get on this earth as a privilege. There will not be much dignity about the way I go: I will fight for every last gasp. I will be dragged out kicking and screaming. I think that is the way most of us are made. I do not think that we should become disposable or be asked to consider at what point we are a burden and should be giving it away. Robert Manne also said: j Nor is it merely from family pressure that abuse may occur. We live, notoriously, at a time where the population is ageing, where our health systems are under great pressure, and where an economic rationalist view of the world is emerging triumphant in one sphere after another. In such circumstances, once the cultural bridge leading to officially sanctioned killing has been crossed, is there anyone who can seriously doubt that, in the long term, social pressures will build for cutting costs by rationalising the process of death in the case of the terminally iII? There you have it. Euthanasia is the economic rationalists' solution; it is the efficient solution. While we are productive, well and good. But, when we start to break down, stick us on the scrap heap. That is why I will be voting for the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I will respond to a couple of the arguments raised against the Andrews bill. Some people say this is an issue about states' rights. Jeff Kennett says that the Northern Territory is a duly constituted democracy. I have got to say that in Victoria he has sacked councillors and installed commissioners to run cities with a larger population than the Northern Territory, so I think that is really a joke. The Commonwealth has often intervened-without regard to states' rights-to set national standards, to protect world heritage, to combat racial discrimination, and to provide for sexual privacy. It should again here. Let us not in future have any cant or hypocrisy from those Liberal and National Party members who vote for this bill about states' rights. Some also say that the legislation does not reflect the reality of what happens in hospitals and that it subjects doctors to criminal liability for acts of kindness they commit every day. If that were the case, you would expect the AMA to be opposed to the Andrews bill. In fact, Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7335 the AMA has indicated that it believes that doctors should not be involved in acts of euthanasia. (Time expired) Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (10.59 a.m.)-I will continue the remarks that I made in the grievance debate on Monday, 28 October. BeforeI complete what I began during that 10minute address, I would like to remind the House where I come from on this issue. I practised medicine for 13 years. I have cared for many people who have died, and their families. I chaired the ethics committee of the Australian Medical Association for three years and have been involved in the examination of the improper behaviour of doctors. I was also involved in the development of public policy for the medical profession in Australia through the AMA. In fact, my own brother died last year-he was a member of the Society for Voluntary Euthanasia-from a disease which he had had for some time. So, I have some experience in looking at this from all sides. The debate is about euthanasia. It is not about territory rights and it is certainly not about state rights. It is about whether, in any part of Australia, we are prepared to see the fundamental tenet of society changed; whether, as a nation, we are prepared to legally sanction, one human being intentionally-no matter how meritorious the circumstances-setting out to end the life of another. For example, at the moment in Tasmania, we have a man who has admitted to heinous crimes. If convicted, the one thing that we can say with certainty is that, whilst many members of the community may feel that people like that should be put to death, he will not be put to death because as a society we do not believe in it. The member for Hindmarsh ( Mrs Gallus), my friend and colleague, said a number of things. She said that she is a Liberal and she is proud to be one and that, as such, she believes that people have rights and those rights ought to be defended. I saw her on television say that euthanasia was a human right which the Andrews bill seeks to deny people. The problem I have, whilst that is an attractive proposition, is that when one person exercising what he or she sees as an individual right diminishes the rights of those in similar circumstances then, as a society and as a government representing it, I think that we have to say, 'No. This is not something which we will allow.' The right of one person to choose the timing and the manner of his or her own death is not more important than the right of vulnerable others in similar circumstances to feel free of the guilt of continuing to live. We have laws which we have passed this year in relation to gun control which infringed the rights of individuals, and we did so because we knew it to be in the interests of the entire nation. Similarly, if one state government, or one territory, were to allow the free distribution and sale of automatic guns, for example, we would see it as a duty and a responsibility to say, 'No. You shall not do this. This is not in the interests of our nation.' I have heard people also say-in fact, I think that it was the member for Hindmarsh and I apologise if I am incorrect-that it makes the doctor watch a person suffer as that person dies. If a person is suffering physically as he or she dies, all we are doing is allowing the doctor to compound the negligence of his or her actions by assisting that person to die. People should not suffer unduly as they die. That they do suffer unduly is much more frequently a consequence of the failure of the doctor and the medical staff involved to provide sufficient treatment to them. They have not had access to palliative care and they have also not had the kind of psychological and emotional support that they need from their families and from their carers. 7336 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 The member for Hindmarsh also said-and I presume she referred to me-that there was a doctor in this parliament who had admitted euthanasia on two occasions. The point that I would like to make there is that I have said publicly on two occasions in my 13 years of practice in medicine that I have given treatments to people which have contributed substantially to the deaths of those people. The intent of the treatment though, was to make sure that those individuals were free of pain. The intent was not to set out to end the lives of those two human beings. The point is that people need to understand that the law can and does on a case-by-case basis make a judgment about the actions of a doctor. The law occasionally makes decisions about a person provoked beyond what is reasonable who then kills another human being. Personally, I think that is the way it ought to remain. I have heard many say that there are strict guidelines. The member for Parkes( Mr Cobb) referred to them in his address. He referred to this table which I will seek leave to have incorporated into Hansard. I think that people need to ask themselves: have you ever met someone who was told three years ago that he or she had three months to live? How many psychiatrists were protecting the welfare and rights of those patients at Chelmsford? If people think that there is a safeguard in having two doctors making a decision about the nature of an illness, and then one psychiatrist, or even two, or 10 psychiatrists, say that a person is in a fit state of mind to have his or her life ended, then I can say they may be well-meaning, but they are sadly misguided. Dr Roger Hunt circulated to us all a position statement from the Australian Association for Hospice and Palliative Care which I would also seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. He emphasised several position points of the association. He emphasised that optimal palliative care cannot relieve all pain. I have never denied that. He has emphasised their recognition of a divergence of views and of the fact that some people rationally request euthanasia. But what he did not emphasise to us was the final position point of the society. That is, that due to the inherent risk to individuals and society it opposes all legalisation of euthanasia. The members for Hindmarsh and Grayndler said, 'Get it out in the open.' AllI can say is, 'Don't make it easier than it already is.' I will paint a picture for you. IfI am the only doctor or one of two or three doctors working in a regional or rural centre 100 to 200 kilometres from the nearest base hospital, and if a person is sent to me who has carcinoma of the kidney, bowel cancer or any other disease from they will die and I know they will probably live for another four to six months, it is much easier to make them feel that euthanasia is an appropriate thing to have than for me to get out of bed every second night for the next six months and deliver the kind of care to them which they need. And if you think I am exaggerating, all I can say is that you should have further exposure to the medical profession. Doctors are human beings, just like everyone else, and their failings are those of human beings rather than scientists. We have moved into an era of legislative morality, as Hugh Mackay has said. I think we have now gone into a phase where we think there must be a law or a statute that is going to solve all human pain and suffering, and the contemporary problems we have in society. People are quite wrong to say that. Dr Roger Hunt and Professor Peter Singer have based their arguments for euthanasia on three central themes: that it occurs, that it is popular, and that palliative care does not afford relief from all pain. That a proposition is popular does not always make it right. The member for Oxley is popular. Is she right? Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 7337 While we are all going to die, for many people death is a largely hypothetical experience and when they respond to polls what they are in fact saying is: 'I do not want to die in pain. I want to die a dignified death.' The law is a blunt instrument; it does not have the finesse to deal with the decisions that are made in relation to the care of those who are dying. The law is about winners and losers. Although it might be appropriate for many of the things in everyday life, it is dismal in dealing with the concepts of fear, expectation, love and dignity. Proponents of voluntary euthanasia focus only on the needs of those individuals they feel ought to be availed of this right. However, my considered opposition to sincere, but misguided, attempts to regulate this area relates to the impact it will have on others. In a world of increasing economic constraints and an ageing population, the vulnerable are so easily manipulated in all kinds of ways. I always remember that when I asked a doctor, 'How did the patient agree to have this terrible thing done to them?' he said, 'I can talk a patient into having anything.' When news broke of Bob Dent's death under the Territory's euthanasia laws I believe a lot more went with him than his own life. He took the hopes of many people in this country. Every day there is one young Australian who commits suicide and another 50 who try-and they suffer also from despair. Let us not say, as a nation, that we think death is a legitimate solution for what we think are insurmountable problems. There is always hope. I think euthanasia is not a solution. That it should be advocated is an indictment of the society in which some are incapable of looking beyond their own needs to the protection of others. There is, in the end, a difference between right and wrong. There is a difference between the pets that we cherish and those fellow human beings whom we love, respect and venerate, for in each one lies the essence of our own humanity. Eventually we will all die, and when you witness and you experience the deaths of others you learn a lot about life. (Time expired) documents be incorporated in Hansard.

You may wish to table it in the House as an alternative. for Hospice and Palliative Care. the effect of extending the member's speech and that is not necessary from the point of view of explanation cannot be incorporated in the Hansard. Mr Barry JonesMr Chairman, I have a point of order. Is the chart that was sought to be incorporated by the honourable member for Bradford the same one that the honourable member for Parkes incorporated? from a newspaper article. This chart is the specific flow diagram that is required to be followed underMr Barry Jones-My impression is that it was the same, but I do not know whether it is a duplication. them, that they were different. Their words may have been similar but the layout certainly seemed to be different. I thought that I had, in fact, got the agreement of the committee to incorporate that in Hansard, but the other question relates to the position statement, and I understand the honourable member is happy to table that. Is leave granted for the tabling of the position statement document? Leave granted. to the parliament as addressing a national issue, does not make laws for the nation; nor does it uniquely enough draw its authority from the powers of the parliament provided for in section 51 of the Australian constitution, least of all the external affairs power. Unlike with the Tasmanian sexual conduct legislation in 1994, the Australian parliament does not have international obligations or human rights protocols to uphold with regard to voluntary euthanasia. Indeed, quite contrary to much of the public debate about this bill, it does not raise issues of states rights. Self-evidently, if its provisions related to any of Australia's six states they would be outside the powers of this parliament. That in itself raises an important principle, something much more important than states rights: the democratic rights of the 500,000 Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I do not believe that these Australians should have rights different from those of other Australians in the formulation of laws governing voluntary euthanasia. Citizens in the seat of Werriwa, for instance, vote for state parliamentarians to deal with this matter-as they do, I am sure, in the seat of Menzies and every other federal division. Citizens in Werriwa certainly have not entrusted me with a responsibility or mandate to make special laws for the territories on euthanasia.",177,Representatives Main Commitiee

402,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (11.12 A.m.),"The Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, while presented7340 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 The onus in this debate is not on the opponents of the Andrews bill to show that the Northern Territory laws in their substance and detail are perfect. After all, this parliament has no vetting procedure, committee or status for checking the detail of each of the laws of the territory parliaments. Rather, the onus is on the proponents of this bill to show why the federal parliament should make special laws governing euthanasia for the 500,000 citizens of the territories when, explicitly, it cannot apply the same laws to any other Australian citizens. By any test of reason or democracy, such an argument cannot be sustained. All the member for Menzies( Mr Andrews) advanced in his second reading speech was an argument that the national parliament has no meaning if it is not involved in life-and-death issues. What next: a private member's bill to appropriate from the territories their law-making powers on issues like abortion and capital punishment? This exposes, of course, that the mover of this bill is not really interested in reason, nor can he be committed to the ideals of democracy. In truth, he is more interested in the rule of God than in the rule of law. The member for Menzies holds out the handful of non-Christians supporting his bill as proof that he is not blending church and state. He seeks to defend his own motives by pointing to the motives of others. Nothing could be more irrational. History tells us of the folly of governments whenever they have sought to impose the morality of one part of society on a majority of other citizens. An interesting feature of our society in recent decades has been the clear decline of organisations based on hierarchy and coercion. Institutions as diverse as political parties, trade unions, churches and government departments have lost large slabs of public trust. In the global village, authority is having far less success in telling people what to do. This points to the central dilemma of the euthanasia debate. It should not be about forcing terminally ill people to judge life itself through the prism of someone else's moral code. The only way religious questions have ever been successfully dealt with in public policy is by fostering choice. State aid, the most poisonous debate in the nation's history, was only ever resolved by the way in which the Whitlam government offered parents choice in the education of their children. Tenninally ill citizens deserve nothing less than liberty in determining the manner by which their lives might end. Changes in medical technology in this century have given humankind new horizons, both for the extension of life and the hastening of death. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.15 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. themselves if a life without quality is a life worth living. Harnessing medical expertise in such a decision can hardly be regarded as an immoral practice. No rational person would ever want the federal parliament to be used as a court of appeal on conscience issues arising in another jurisdiction. In a matter such as this, where the national parliament does not have international obligations to uphold, politicians in Canberra should not be telling the territory parliaments what to do, let alone telling terminally ill people how to live the last days of their lives. In this debate, I ask: where are all the liberals-with a small 'I'? This is one of the great paradoxes of the bill. Our laws and society accept the authority of doctors to tum off lifesupport machines without the consent or choice of patients. Our medical practices condone the authority of doctors to inject terminally ill people with lethal injections-as they do most days and nights in Australian hospitals-without the consent or choice of patients. Our laws and society also accept these practices in another, more sanitised, form-the so-called double",179,Representatives Main Committee
403,Mr Latham,"In a free society, surely citizens should have the right to decide forThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7341 effects. Our laws have also decriminalised abortion in each of the states and territories, passing choice and control in the termination of life to pregnant women. So much for the universal sanctity of life. Why, then, do the member for Menzies and his colleagues wish to strike down the newly established rights of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory? Is it better for doctors, legislators and religious institutions to exercise authority in matters of life and death, than for terminally ill people to also have rights-to have the ultimate human right to control one's own fate? The opponents of euthanasia talk as if it were compulsory, not voluntary. The compulsion, of course, is on their part-prescribing for others how they might endure the final parts of their life. If terminally ill people-their bodies riddled with cancer or AIDS, their dignity gone and their loved ones waiting and suffering with them-decide that euthanasia is the right choice, then I say, 'Let that be their decision. Let that be their choice, not the choice and decision of people they have never known who sit in the federal parliament.' In his second reading speech, the member for Menzies spoke of his personal experience in watching loved ones die. While for each of us this is one of the saddest parts of life, I would suggest that, no matter our compassion, no matter our love, watching is somewhat different to feeling-to feeling at first-hand a serious illness. Let me say something of how I feel personally about voluntary euthanasia. As an MP, I acknowledge that it has never been simple for society to establish new rights of freedom and liberty. I admire the Northern Territory parliament for being bold and considerate enough to pioneer laws which seek to enhance the rights and liberties of terminally ill people. At a different level in my life, a defining experience on these issues of morality and mortality was when I had cancer two years ago. It convinced me, with clarity and passion, that feeling is very different indeed to watching. I learnt a lot from that time. The experience taught me many things: to enjoy more fully the simple things in life; to value and advance, as best I can in my finite time, the things I believe to be worth advocating; but most of all, as one deals with both living and perhaps ending life, that nothing matters more than having control of the choices, liberties and freedoms which ultimately make a human life worthwhile. This parliamentary debate, in the saddest of ways from my perspective, has also taught me something. That is, just how hard it can be-despite the best theories and intent of our system of governance-for politicians to establish new sources of liberty. Ultimately, liberty and freedom rely on someone else letting go of authority. Too often, through history, citizens have been forced to secure their rights through non-democratic means. Now, the House of Representatives-by a large majority, I fear-is about to take away the rights of terminally ill people in the Northern Territory. In the culture of our parliament, with its adversarial style, its parties and factions, its ambitions and personal struggles, the exercise of authority has in large part become a basic instinct. The exercise of power brings with it the cascading emotions of recognition and authority. Within such a culture, it is not easy to give power and authority away. It is not easy to transfer the right of the parliamentarian to tell people how to live or how to end their lives, to the rights of the individual to freely make their own choices. It is not easy to give liberty to others; it shifts control, judgment and, at times, status from the decision makers of a parliament to the decisions of each citizen. 7342 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 This is why I have always been interested in Ghandi's dictum that in public life, real power comes from giving power away. I hold this to be true with regard to the powers of the Northern Territory parliament and with regard to the power of terminally ill people to decide what is right and what is best for themselves. In the name of democracy, but most of all, for the cause of liberty and the rights of citizens in a free society, I urge the House and the committee to reject this private member's bill. member for Menzies( Mr Andrews) for having brought forward this private member's bill, and to indicate very clearly my strong support for it. It seems to me that it takes both courage and persistence to achieve much in this place. Not everyone who comes here has much of either of these qualities. But, I 'think that the member for Menzies has demonstrated that he does and I congratulate him for the action he has taken, despite subtle and overt opposition, not only in this place, but outside. There are a number of things that underpin the great democracy that we have: freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of religion, and other things. But one of the underpinning tenets of our democracy is that we give people and guarantee people the right to live. I believe that this national government is ultimately the guardian of the human rights of our citizens and so we have a responsibility, I believe, to be involved in this debate. I strongly contend that we ought to be involved in it. There must be a national response on this issue. The suggestion that one state could have different laws about this is, in my view, quite untenable. We have arguments about these issues of uniformity quite often: uniform company laws, road laws, and systems of education. But ultimately, if there were an argument for uniform laws on anything, this would have to be it. The prospect of 'euthanasia tourism', as it is called, ought not to be taken lightly. I put it to you, as a representative of an electorate on a border, that this is a serious issue when there could be different laws on each side of the border. So states' rights, in my view, are not the issue here and if they were, I must observe them as others have. For those who are the strongest proponents of states' rights in this issue, it would be instructive to examine where they voted on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, or, indeed, for those who were not here when we considered that debate who have spoken strongly about states' rights, where they would have voted, if they had have been here on that bill. And the answer, of course, is self evident. It is the reason that states' rights is not the issue. The issue is euthanasia. That is ultimately what we are talking about here and that point, of course, has been made by many others. Earlier today, a fine line was referred to by a member from South Australia between the law there and the law in the Northern Territory. It is not a fine line. It is a chasm between the law which allows doctors to make decisions about the treatment of their patients which may result in the hastening of the death of that patient, and a law which actually empowers doctors to kill patients. There is a chasm between the laws in South Australia and other states and the Northern Territory. Many opponents of euthanasia, though not all, are opposed to euthanasia on religious grounds. This is a stumbling block for those who have not got religious beliefs, and it is an easy point of criticism of thosof us that do have religious beliefs. They accuse us of crossing that line which is not clear but which exists-quite properly in a lot of respects-between church and state. Or they stoop to accuse us because we have religious views of attempting",180,Representatives Main Committee
404,Mr Bradford (Mcpherson) (11.36 A.m.),"I would like at the outset to congratulate theThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7343 to impose those views on others. This is not, I might observe, an easy place for those who have strong views, even indeed for those who have religious views. We are required, it seems to me on occasions, to bow down before the god of politics and there are consequences here in this place for those who refuse to do so. In my view, this debate about euthanasia ultimately, and perhaps inevitably, boils down to one's view of life and, therefore, one's theology. There will be people here who claim to have none, and yet, as the member for Lalor( Mr Jones) observed, in a sense by default, one has one whether one wants one or not. Ultimately, any intelligent person at some point-maybe when they are in the outback at night staring up at the stars-asks fundamental questions like, 'What am I doing here? What is life all about? Where am I going?' If one dismisses all that as irrelevant, then at least one has made a decision of sorts about those issues. I fully understand the view of the secularists or humanists on this issue. If you do not accept the sovereignty of God, however difficult a concept that might be, then euthanasia is the ultimate in terms of controlling one's destiny. It is a logical response. If one takes that humanist view of life, then euthanasia would be fairly easy and logical to follow. Others who are opposed to this bill I expect are not doing so for theological or religious reasons. They can argue accordingly. I am interested in hearing their arguments as they propound them. Let me also say, because it has been put to me by constituents who have consulted me on this issue, that human beings are not animals. Once again, that is a religious perspective. That is a theological perspective. People say to me, 'If my cat got knocked over by a car and it was suffering, I would have it put down.' If one has a concept of God's sovereignty or even of the existence of God, one has to understand quite clearly that man-human beings, homo sapiens-are created distinctly different, and with a different ultimate purpose in life and a different destiny, from one's cat or dog or horse. The views of my constituents on this issue, as on other issues, are important to me. The support that I have had for the anti-euthanasia position has been overwhelming. I suspect that there has been a very orchestrated attempt to portray that view, because I still get people telling me that the overall majority of people are actually in favour of euthanasia. However, ultimately I must make my own decision about this matter and about other matters. I am elected here as a member of the Liberal Party, though I take the point made by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) that I am certainly not a small '1' liberal. But I am also here as an individual. I am here as the individual that I am, whether people like that or notand, clearly, a number do not. The fact is that, as a member of the Lyons Forum, which the member for Werriwa throws at me as often as he gets the opportunity, I uphold the biblical ideal of family. That is anathema to some who do not share those views. So my position on euthanasia is at its essence-the bottom line-a theological perspective. I cannot separate that from my overall view of life. Whilst the views of my constituents on this issue and on others are important, they have ultimately elected me as I am, and I believe I am required to provide leadership on a number of issues. Many of my constituents agree with everything said by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)-perhaps more people in my electorate than in many others. Graeme Campbell's Australia First Party is alive and well in my electorate. But I have contended with the member for Oxley on most issues because I believe she has been wrong and ill-informed. When my 7344 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 constituents phone me and tell me that if I do not get on her side I will be out at the next election, I say, 'So be it.' The member for Oxley has put forward views which are, in many respects, anathema to my view of life. I believe in a compassionate response to our indigenous people. I understand that because of their degree of disadvantage they need special treatment. Despite the fact that many of my constituents tell me that those views are inconsistent with my prospects of re-election, that is not a concern to me ultimately. I have the same view on multiculturalism, immigration and overseas aid. I argue strongly for a compassionate response from a country as well endowed as ours towards those who are very much less well endowed. My position on euthanasia is one of strong support for the Andrews bill. I have placed on the record my commendation for and admiration of him. I believe that this bill will be carried, I believe that it ought to be carried, and I believe that that will be ultimately the right thing for this parliament to have done in the interests of our citizens. member for Menzies' private member's bill, but I have to support the reasoning behind it. The wording of the bill is, in effect, amending a state bill which I do not believe is warranted and which abrogates state rights on the issue. But, the topic of this bill and its intent, which is in the language of the bill, is as follows: (1) Subject to this section the power of the Legislative Assembly conferred by section 6 in relation to the making of laws does not extend to the making of laws which permit or have the effect of permitting (whether subject to conditions or not) the form of intentional killings of another called euthanasia (which includes mercy killing) or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life. (2) The Legislative Assembly does have power to make laws with respect to: (a) the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient; and (b) medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient, but not so as to permit the intentional killing of the patient. I am not in favour of the Commonwealth influencing states' rights on the passing of legislation, but this is an issue that is national, if not global, in its implications. I have had many letters from all over Australia as, no doubt, have all other members within the parliament. The letters came from organisations, church groups and ordinary individuals who want to have their input and their views registered. The majority of the ones I have received are from those who oppose legislation for euthanasia. Some do not oppose euthanasia, per se, but it is having legislation in place to allow a group of people to make a decision about whether a person with a terminal or chronic illness should be put to sleep. They are concerned that it could easily go wrong. I have enormous problems with the concept. Out of hundreds of letters received, one from Dr Colleen McCullough impressed me when she posed a number of questions. She asked: Is it moral or ethical for a government to contemplate legislative action which inevitably incorporates an element of saving large amounts of taxpayers' money when it simultaneously deprives other taxpayers of life? Is this motive genuinely founded in humanitarian principles, or is it a result of cold-blooded economic necessity? She echoed my own feelings, but puts them in much better words than I possibly can because that is the issue that I believe-is driving some of this debate. In fact, it chilled me when I",182,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Adams (Lyons)(11.46 A.m),"I have been put in a difficult position regarding theThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7345 received a letter from Western Australia asking me to vote against this bill on the grounds that, as it said: the loss of dignity, futile suffering and despair, caused by watching the loved family suffer as they watch their relations suffer, while powerless to help and all to prolong life which has no quality, is cruel, heartless and a shocking waste of taxpayers' money. I think that this person needs to think about the long-term implications of what is a waste of money and what is not. To think about life in money terms is wrong. Going back to Dr McCullough, who is now a full-time writer, she worked with the terminally ill over a period of 20 years and has witnessed, as she says, 'the full gamut of human suffering.' At the conclusion of her thoughts on the matter, which she addressed to the , New South Wales parliament, she summed up well what I also believe about the debate. She said: To kill life is to kill hope, and hope is what keeps most of humanity going. Hope that things will be better. Win the lottery, back the right horse, inherit a fortune. That a cure will be found for Alzheimers, AIDS, cancer. That the recipe will be found to regenerate central nervous system tissue. That we will all live to a healthy thousand ... than a healthy hundred. Which leads to the only proper conclusion. While there's life there's hope. Today in Tasmania we are suffering huge cuts to our hospital system, to health programs and to the community health areas. The federal government has cut $20 million this year and the state government is removing $30 million from its budget and people are having to pay large sums of money to get into nursing home care. Is an individual who cares for a family going to be forced into the decision of 'turning off the light' because that person feels the family cannot afford to look after them and they do not want to be a burden on their family? It is a real thing. I hear older people talking about it, especially if their family is trying to find suitable space for them to be properly cared for, but finding that there is nothing available as all spaces are filled. Should we treat our families in this uncaring way? No, we should not. It is vital that money be available and properly allocated for palliative care. If those who are in pain, or are terribly stressed by their illness, have proper care, pain-killers and a soothing, peaceful environment, life can be bearable and life can have hope. I can understand why people argue for the option to use euthanasia, and I know in certain circumstances it will and does happen. But the Northern Territory bill is not about discontinuing futile or heroic treatment; it is not about the refusal of burdensome and unwanted medical attention; it is not about the provision of pain-relieving, modem palliative care. It is about the use of a lethal injection to bring about the immediate death of another. Governments could choose to bypass a caring response for all dying people to legislate to assist the suicide of a few. The Sunday Tasmanian, on 27 October 1996, had an article from Dr Christopher Newell. It talked about his experiences with chronic pain, acute respiratory disorder and a lack of mobility and a quality of life. He said: I have so many disabilities it's not funny ... I thought I was useless and a burden ... I perceived myself very much as an economic burden and a useless lump of no use whatsoever to my family whom I thought I was damaging being alive. I could see no future in any meaningful relationship because nobody would want me. I was in deep depression and wanted someone to kill me. I desperately wanted to die. 7346 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 This is from a 32-year-old male with numerous disabilities, who just happens to be the eldest son of the Anglican Bishop of Tasmania. Four years on from this feeling that he had, Christopher is now married, the father of three daughters, senior lecturer in the division of community and rural health at the university and a private consultant in human services and ethics. What changed? It was not his health. That is much the same, though probably it is managed much more than it used to be and in a better way. But it is his attitude and the view of himself that has changed. Things became brighter because the people around him who cared, who gave him a reason for wanting to continue to be part of humanity, had given him hope. Thank you, Dr Newell, for sharing that very powerful experience of life. Hope is a very powerful tool in survival! Euthanasia does not allow you to make a mistake and say, 'Oops, sorry, I really didn't mean that. I do want to live after all.' I wonder how many people will have seen the film Shine. It has nothing to do with euthanasia, but it is about hope and achievement of a person with disabilities which may well have gone the other way if someone had not cared enough to try and give quality of life back. It is those people with disabilities who would be affected most when things go wrong with such legislation as euthanasia laws. (Time expired) time. I want to compliment all my colleagues-both from the coalition and Labor-on the speeches they have presented in this debate. Those who are arguing for and against the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 have done so very lucidly. I would like to compliment the member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones), for his contribution this morning. I found it very interesting and very informative. As the member for Lalor said, this debate has been pretty hard to think about because there are two issues. One is a moral issue, which is clear, and the other is a states' rights issue. States' rights do not mean much to Victorians. But they certainly do to Western Australians and that issue is a major problem for me with this debate. I have been fighting over those issues and I thought that what I should be doing, as a marginal seat member, was getting some advice from my electorate as well. SoI went out into my electorate, spoke to 250 community groups, and asked them to debate and vote on the issue. I have had responses from the majority of those. I also went out and sought advice from a whole range of different constituents. I looked at all the mail that came to my office and took out all the standard replies from both sides of the argument. I had put the Gallus argument, the Dondas argument, the Andrews argument and the Abetz argument to the electorate. I got a fair bit of response and it was overwhelmingly one way-and from Western Australia, it surprised me. That is, they want me to support the bill. That is what I will be doing. Thank you. parliamentarian has to face in this debate. Let me state from the outset that I do not think this is a matter of states' rights. I say that because, under our constitution, the Commonwealth has very defined powers and the states have reserve powers. If this legislation had been passed by the legislature of New South Wales or that of my own home state we would not be going through this debate now. But, for all practical purposes, we have got used to the fact that these issues-which go to the issues of how you run your police force, your licensing laws, whether you have registered",184,Representatives Main Commitiee
406,Mr Richard Evans (Cowan) (11.56 A.m.),I will enter this debate for a very short,186,Representatives Main Committee
407,Mr Holding (Melbourne Ports) (11.58 A.m.),"There are a number of factors that anyThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7347 brothels or how you handle questions of prostitution or drugs-are things which fall within the reserve powers in our concept of state responsibilities. For practical purposes, the Commonwealth has in the past treated the Northern Territory as a state. There is a legal argument that it is not properly a state, but the fact is that it has its own elected assembly and they have debated this issue up hill and down dale. In my own state, there was a very significant debate on how we handle the question of drugs. I would have preferred to have seen the Victorian legislature go further than it did in its response to its report on the issue. But I would not argue with the right to determine the decision that they made. Certainly, as a federal parliamentarian, my right intercede in that matter cannot be argued. States do not have rights; Australian citizens have rights. And Australian citizens encompass the citizens of the Northern Territory. As a former minister in this place, I spent much of my time in litigation with the Northern Territory government. At no stage did I ever argue-although I disagreed with the positions they were taking on issues like land rights-that they did not have the right to argue that way and to go to the High Court and argue their position. We have now dredged up a legal argument-probably a correct legal argument-that the Northern Territory is not a state in terms of legal concepts. That is probably true because at the moment there is a problem with how they deal with the question of how many senators they should have. We cannot have it both ways. If this was Commonwealth legislation, I do not know that I would vote for it because Australia, from my experience, comprises regions. The attitudes of people in Far North Queensland in relation to certain questions are not the same as those of people in the metropolitan capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. There is a distinct set of attitudes within the Northern Territory on a whole range of issues. They do not necessarily think like people in Melbourne or Adelaide. Their elected representatives have argued their way through this. In relation to areas of social experimentation which enlarge human rights as distinct from reduce them and where there are decisions to make, who am I to say that we cannot trust these elected representatives. We cannot say, 'There might be abuses as a result of this process. It might have these adverse social effects. We do not have enough confidence in you to say, as a group of elected Australian representatives, ""You won't deal with those abuses if they arise.'"" Perhaps if we are dealing with important areas of social experimentation, the best thing the Commonwealth can do is leave that area of experimentation alone and see how it works. What we have here is an attempt by those people to manipulate the legislators-and they are quite candid about it. Because of their deeply held religious convictions, they believe they have a moral right to impose their moral and religious imperatives upon an elected assembly. I do not accept that argument. I do not believe I have the right, because of my religious beliefs or my lack thereof, to say that I am going to gather around me the Lyons Forum-call it what you like-and then, because of those religious beliefs, tell a democratically elected assembly what to do. It is an elected assembly whose political concepts I disagree with in many ways, but it having been democratically elected, I accept it is operating in a jurisdiction which is within the general ambit of their rights, and I believe that intervention creates a dangerous precedent. I do not believe I have the right to tell people, irrespective of their religious beliefs or their lack thereof, who are suffering a terminal disease and are in pain and need assistance so that they can press a button to end their pain that they cannot do that. I believe that if people want 7348 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 to die in dignity surrounded by their loved ones and end what has been a painful experience for all of them, I do not have the right to say that, because I have a certain religious beliefs, they cannot do that. Therefore, I will vote against this legislation. I think this legislation is ill conceived. I think it is an abuse of the powers of this parliament. I believe it is an unwarranted interference with a legislature which, in terms of social experimentation, ought to have no fewer rights than any of the states. If the government of Victoria or the government of New South Wales had introduced this legislation, we would not dream of intervening. I believe the Commonwealth is entitled to intervene where there is legislation which restricts and limits human freedom and human rights. But this is legislation which gives Australian citizens who are in a desperate situation a right of choice. Many wiII not exercise that choice because of their religious beliefs, but others will because of their commitment to their family and their belief in what is a highly personal decision. I do not believe that any member of this parliament, whatever his religious beliefs, has got the right to say, 'I will teIl a feIlow Australian citizen how he will choose to die'. If this legislation had come before the Commonwealth parliament, I might wen have voted against it, because I do not know that the Australian community as a whole should move down this track. But on any view of it, this is an important decision that has been made within the parameters of a democratically elected assembly. I believe that if abuses arise, that assembly will be more than capable of dealing with them. You can take the option of applying a rule which says that that goes with the concept of state government-and the territory is moving toward state government, as is Canberra. If we are going to experiment in these ways, there is a strong argument for saying, 'Let it take place on a narrow basis, in a confined area, and let us see how it works'. If this is an experiment which enlarges the rights of Australian citizens, it should not be interfered with in the way in which it is being interfered with by members of this parliament on the basis of their deeply held religious beliefs. For that reason, I will be voting against this legislation. have much in common. We share an almost identical surname. We share a similar belief in the christian view of life, though he from a Catholic perspective and me from a Protestant perspective. We share, in common with almost everyone in this chamber-veryone, I suspect-a commitment to family life and the priority it should be given. For all of that, I did not thank him when he proposed this private member's bill. He is in the House now to witness first-hand these words. I did not thank him because, frankly, he put me in a position I did not want to be in. He put me in a position whereby I had to make a decision about something I did not want publicly to make a decision on. But. the debate having ventured to this point in time, I think the parliament is richer for this debate. It is richer for the way in which we as individual members have been forced to confront this decision. Frankly, it has forced us to ask ourselves how much we know, or how much we fail to know, about life's fundamental questions. Where did we come from? AmI merely the product of a passionate moment between my parents, or am I in fact someone with a destiny? I do not know the answer to that. Why am I here? That is the question that everyone asks themselves aII the time, and I do not know the answer to that either. Where am I going? I do not have the G.J1swer to that question. In fact, I think it is fortunate that I do not know",186,Representatives Main Committee
408,Mr Andrew (Wakefield) (12.07 P.m.),"The member for Menzies( Mr Andrews) and IThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7349 the answer to those fundamental questions, because my view of life is that it is those questions that make life worth living, and the mystery is part of the perfection of being here. I am here, participating in this debate, quite frankly rightly branded by the member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holding) as prejudiced by my own experiences, by my own upbringing, by the people I have known, and by my religious persuasion. I can bring nothing else into this debate. I am not at all affronted by the fact that the member for Menzies has introduced this dilemma into the parliament, because I do not see it as interventionist. He has a perfect right to introduce a private member's bill and I therefore have a right and an obligation as an individual-influenced by, as I said, my own upbringing, the people I have known and my religious persuasion-to vote as I see fit. My view of life is that life is a gift, that everyone has a right to live, and that life is all that matters in our society today. I do not know that I come into this debate able to participate from a particularly informed point of view because, to borrow the title of at least one famous book, I have had a fortunate life. I have never actually fronted the reality of a loved one suffering. My father passed away 10 days after a heart attack, but that hardly bears any resemblance to the sort of debate we are having here. I am not someone who has had to deal with the question of euthanasia and whether it would be kinder to minimise the suffering that a loved one was experiencing. But I am someone who has had a rather rare experience that has influenced the way I feel about the Andrews legislation. One night, many years ago, a colleague of mine, who happened to be a minister of religion in the small country town in which I lived, rang me because he believed his three-year-old daughter was dying. Three hours earlier she had been suffering, they thought, simply from influenza. Her condition was clearly misdiagnosed. It was an experience I would gladly have avoided, but I actually spent that evening with him while he waited for the ambulance to come some distance. Ultimately, she passed on while the doctor was attempting, in a futile exercise, to keep her alive. I wondered what would happen to that gentleman because of his profession and because of his attitude to life. The astonishing thing to me in that experience was that he would clearly gladly have given anything, even his own life, to spare his daughter that suffering. We can all identify with that sentiment. Because of that experience-I know it is true even today-he has been quite a remarkable, for want of a better word, witness for other people because of the experience he had. I came out of that experience aware of the fact that there are some things in life we cannot escape and that there are some experiences in life that we would give anything to avoid, but that life is not necessarily poorer because they happened. We only really know how to love people because we are conscious of what loneliness is all about. We only really know how to provide for people and how to make provision for future problems because we are conscious of what hunger is all about. We only really have an obsession with health because we know what illness is all about. I want to put it to the gathering in this Main Committee that part of what gives life its meaning is the grim reality of suffering. I wish it were avoidable, but it is not. We do society a great disservice when we imagine that in the 20th century we can eliminate all that is uncomfortable. Life is actually richer because of the things that we would give anything to avoid. Our whole concept of palliative care-which in many ways is an illustration of human beings at the cutting edge of scientific research-is more meaningful simply because of the grim reality of suffering and death. 7350 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 I am not suggesting that suffering is something that we should welcome; you all know me better than that. I am saying that what is wrong with the present attitude to euthanasia is that it suggests that suffering is something we can avoid. In my view, life becomes more meaningful because of the dilemmas we face, such as suffering, hunger, loneliness and illness. My dilemma with euthanasia is that it offers a convenient escape from life when life is about confronting those things that we would like to avoid. One of the dilemmas for us in the 20th century is that in the society of which I am a part grandparents are placed in nursing homes, so the deterioration of old age is unknown. Pets are conveniently put down by vets, so the suffering which previous generations were once familiar with is now largely unknown. As a result of that, many of us find ourselves, in my view, relatively ill-equipped to deal with this fundamental question in life-which is death. I have a dilemma with euthanasia. My dilemma is that it allows us to escape that reality that life is the richer for the confronting, and it allows the state to sanction killing which is something that I cannot condone. The member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holding) suggested that, in some ways, our participation in this debate was the poorer because we had brought into it our own religious prejudices. My view is that that is inevitable. Everyone comes into this debate with an attitude that is clearly a reflection of the experiences he or she has had, or failed to have, or that he or she has seen other people facing. I make no apology for that. I am in here making a difficult choice that is, of course, clearly, the result of my own prejudices. It is a choice that I feel I can responsibly make because I am an elected member of parliament, asked by my electors to do what I think is right, not necessarily what is popular. Many have suggested that what the parliament is doing here runs counter to the popular opinion of the community at large. Quite frankly, I doubt that. In spite of the indications to the contrary-and I am not so gullible as to be influenced by the number of letters I have had because I am sure the letters reflect what we would politically call 'a soft majority beside a hard minority'. My experience in my electorate has been that this is a question on which my electorate is divided on a largely 50-50 basis. There are some who favour the territory legislation, and an equal number who would favour what Kevin Andrews is proposing. I happen to think that this is not a matter for states' rights. I understand the concerns of the member'for the Northern Territory. But all of the evidence that we have is that, clearly, this is a matter that concerns the Northern Territory, and it is entirely proper and responsible, therefore, for the member for Menzies( Mr Andrews) to move his private member's bill, and for each of us to deal with it as we see fit. BecauseI cannot personally endorse a concept in which the state sanctions killing, and because I think the capacity to be able to choose that option makes society poorer, I find myself in support of the Menzies' bill. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (12.17 p.m.)-My contribution today will, I hope, underline not only the fact that I intend to vote against this legislation, but my reasons for doing so. They are strongly held reasons, and they tum around what I think is a very important principle that is being ignored in bringing this legislation before the parliament. IfI can put it very simply and, indeed, quote someone else's words, because I think they are compelling, and if the women of Australia will forgive me for the masculine pronoun, I think it says very clearly What it is that I object to. Professor Ronald Dworkin, in 1993 said, I think, compellingly: -aking someone die in a way that others approve, but he regards as a horrifying contradiction of his life, IS a devastating, odious form of tyranny. Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7351 I would put it as strongly as that myself. And one of the things that concerns me about this legislation is the fact that it is part of what I would call a growing conservative obsession with legislating against choice, of trying to hustle what is a grave moral decision which is inherently personal into the domain of public law. I partially quote Robert Hughes, in his essay, 'The culture of complaint' in making that observation. But, again, it is an observation which I strongly endorse. I would like to refer briefly to the statement of the honourable Marshall Perron, who was then the member for Fannie Bay, in the Northern Territory. In his executive summary of the Rights of the Terminally III Bill he said: the law as it stands actively ensures that many doctors will not intervene to assist patients to end their suffering because of fear of legal actionand I intend to return to that point in a minuteThis BillandI think that it is important for its opponents to realise this about the Northern Territory legislationdoes no more than formalise and decriminalise a practice which occasionally occurs now but a practice for which some patients regrettably cannot find sympathetic doctors prepared to risk their careers and liberty. I guess that is not surprising. He goes on to say: This Bill is about personal choice. It does not provide carte blanche for euthanasia. It contemplates no externally imposed end of life decisions for the aged, the disabled or for anyone else. In simple language, it provides mentally competent, terminally ill patients with the right to choose to shorten their agony peacefully and with dignity. It is restricted solely to adult patients who are terminally ill and able to make a judgement for themselves after advice from their doctor. I will return to that last point later because, at the moment, some decisions are made for and on behalf of patients but without reference to their desire and belief. In my view, that was partly what Mr Perron was trying to avoid in his legislation, trying to overturn what, at the moment, is often a decision made by a doctor or doctors without necessarily having the right intention. In other words, the patient may not have decided that he or she wants to die, but the doctors may have found it more convenient to decide that he or she should. I will briefly touch on one issue before I tum to my substantive arguments. This is the question of the community view on this matter. I think that, as members of parliament, we are certainly entitled to a conscience vote on key issues but we should also take account of the views of the community. This is one area where, for over a decade, for as along as the question has been asked of the community, and in whatever form, somewhere between seven and eight out of 10 Australians say that they favour euthanasia, described in the terms that it was and, indeed, is legislated in Marshall Perron's bill. It is not something that is changed as a result of debate or argument, publicity or lack of it. It is a very strongly held view. I might say, incidentally, that a significant minority of people with strong religious beliefs, and that includes Catholics, also have a view that euthanasia-in the terms described by a competent adult terminally ill making a decision about his or her own life-is justified. So, in many cases, even those people with the strongest religious convictions support the availability of the choice about this key matter in a person's life. If you look at the arguments on euthanasia, they tend to be centred on four main issues: firstly, the question of religious belief; secondly, the question of the decisions that need to be 7352 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 made by medical practitioners-the ethics surrounding end of life decisions, if you like; thirdly, the rights of the individual versus the common good; and finally, the value of human life. If you look at the religious considerations, I respect the views of those who are religious and who see it in the same way as the Anglican Catholic bishops in their submission to the House of Lords. They said, 'Life is to be viewed as His'-that is God's-'gift, given and taken according to His sovereign will. It is thus not at the disposal of any human being.' That is fine if you share that belief and I can understand people with strong religious beliefs endorsing that sentiment, but for many of those in the community-and I believe the majority-who do not share those views, it simply is not relevant to invoke God's will and God's gift of life because they simply do not share the belief. So, invoking religious arguments is only good enough for those people who share their beliefs. It is not sufficient grounds for the rest of the community to agree that euthanasia is somehow in breach of a universally held belief about the existence of God because it requires the individual to make a decision, If you look at the medical considerations, the profession itself makes a very fine distinction between the methods that they might use to relieve pain, which may inevitably lead to deathdistinguishing those means of allowing a patient to die, from agreeing to take part in assisting a patient to die. A great many organisations, including the AMA, do not support what they call active euthanasia but they are quite happy, indeed, to participate in passive euthanasia. I might say that, at times, and I have this on first-hand experience having worked in a medical faculty for some time, those decisions are not made with reference to the patients. It is decided that that person is in pain, that the palliative care is no longer working and, therefore, they will increase the dose of whatever pain-killer is available until such time as the patient dies. Interestingly, when you ask people about the euthanasia question, they are often less enthusiastic about that doctor determined decision than they are about the one they make themselves. It is difficult to expand on that important point in a short time, but I have the view that it is not good enough to make this distinction between active and passive euthanasia from the point of view of the patient. So-called passive euthanasia often takes away the dignity and choice that he or she would wish. Whether the doctor intends or merely allows death, it seems to me is not a distinction that makes a great deal of sense from the point of view of the person-the patient or his family and friends. Looking at the individual versus the common good, a lot of people would argue that, while it may be reasonable for the individual to ask to die on their own terms, it is not in the interests of society as a whole. Under this heading, you often get the thin edge of the wedge arguments that, if you allow the state to intervene in taking a person's life, it will open the floodgates of things such as the murders-and I do not call it euthanasia-undertaken during the Nazi regime of people with intellectual, physical and mental illness. Euthanasia does not contemplate that. It contemplates the individual making the decision not the state. So, in fact, it is precisely the opposite situation to that where the state intervenes to take a patient's life. I just ask members to contemplate this scenario. DoctorsA and B, I will call them for the moment, are in all respects similar. They are caring, respected doctors with impeccable backgrounds. Dr A's patient, Mr X, is suffering from a fatal illness which is now in its final stages. He is near death and in great pain and he has asked the doctor to put him out of his misery. DrA explains that he cannot do so but he will steadily increase the amount of painrelieving drugs. The effect of this will be that, over a period of time-perhaps a few days-the dose will be such that MrX will in fact die, albeit, he adds, as a consequence of his attempt to relieve pain. Two days later MrX does indeed die. Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7353 Contrast that with Dr B' s patient, a Mrs Z, who is in virtually the same situation. In response to her entreaties, DrB says that he will give her something to bring about the release she seeks and injects her accordingly. She dies within minutes without pain and suffering. Now according to the traditional moral principle in this individual versus common good reference to passive euthanasia, DrA would have performed a permissible act and DrB would not. Currently it is not uncommon for palliative care, for life-sustaining treatment, to be withheld by doctors with the primary intention of ending a patient's life. I think that is a much more damaging failure by the state to intervene to protect patients against a decision that they mayor may not have been party to. An often quoted fear is that legally sanctioned, assisted dying would threaten the lives of powerless and vulnerable people. Again, as I say, if it is properly legislated, if there are constraints on the doctors' behaviour, that is less likely, not more likely, to happen. And doctors are less likely to make decisions based on extraneous factors such as the level of disability, the cost to the community and other matters that really should not be at the forefront. Finally, it is often argued that euthanasia devalues human life and that human life, however, should be measured only in terms of its longevity. I would argue that quality is critical, and one of the key things that determines the quality of life for any individual is the ability, within limits, to control one's own life, to maintain a sense of authority over one's own destiny. If that is important while one is healthy and fit and able to make clear decisions, how much more important is it at that moment when the question is, 'DoI want to continue to live or not?' I think every citizen deserves the right to determine the moment and means of their going in a dignified and civilised fashion. where this debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 should be held. It is deplorable that 10 minutes only is allowed to express a view on a matter such as this and that the people of Australia cannot hear it and see it. My views have been influenced by the following: extensive input from constituents and the people of Australia; numerous discussions with people of all viewpoints; reading widely; lengthy experience as a barrister, having appeared in many criminal cases and cases involving wills; and knowledge that no country has formally legalised euthanasia. I am indebted to the 1994 report by the House of Lords committee. This committee was composed of people from both sides of the debate. It took evidence from a broad spectrum of people. The committee visited the Netherlands where euthanasia, voluntary and nonvoluntary, is practised. It sets a very high hurdle for those upon whom the onus of proof is cast to persuade me and the community that what is now unlawful should be authorised, justified or excused by law. That is, one person can in particular circumstances lawfully kill another by a deliberate act. As a barrister, I have seen and participated in endless cases considering whether confessions have been voluntary. I have observed at first hand the precarious position of persons under a disability by virtue of their inequality of bargaining power or due to age or infirmity. I have seen the fear of these people of those under whose influence or authority they have come. In the criminal courts an irrefutable case of a voluntary confession has turned out to be involuntary after full and complete argument on the evidence. In civil courts, wills have turned out to be invalid in the face of obvious written documentation to the contrary. It is much",188,Representatives Main Committee
409,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (12.27 P.m.),"I have already expressed my views about7354 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 harder to upset a valid will, for the person who has executed the will is deceased and cannot say whether the document was voluntary or involuntary or whether it was executed in circumstances that were unfair or whether the person was the subject of undue influence or pressure or duress. Let me take a real case. A lady in her nineties was cruelly practised upon by her son. She had been living in her home and, during the last 18 months to two years of her life, was removed to a nursing home that he and his wife were running. During the period that she lived in that home, she changed her will leaving her house to her son. She had previously left the house to her son and daughter. Not long before she died, she wrote a note on a little torn piece of Christmas wrapping. It was tied tightly in a handkerchief. It was smuggled by her to her great-nephew. She wrote: They made me sign over the house to them. But please destroy this. They have not treated me too good, but please destroy this. She was terrified when she furtively passed him the note. What appeared a voluntary and fair will was, by luck· and good fortune, discovered to be involuntary and unfair. This is one example of many, and it is on the word 'voluntary' and by the words of the Northern Territory act itself that the case for euthanasia founders. The argument about the Northern Territory legislation has been considered in an article on the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally III Act by Karin Clarke, a solicitor. Time does not permit me to go into it, but I recommend that article to all honourable members and to the people of Australia. I believe that the legislation in the Northern Territory is incapable of protecting-wholly, solely and beyond any reasonable doubt-those persons who subject themselves to euthanasia so that their choice is in fact a voluntary one. I will quote from paragraphs 238 and 239 of the report of the House of Lords: ... we do not think it possible to set secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. Some witnesses told us that to legalise voluntary euthanasia was a discrete step which need have no other consequences. But as we said in our introduction, issues of life and death do not lend themselves to clear definition, and without that it would not be possible to frame adequate safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia if voluntary euthanasia were to be legalised. It would be next to impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any liberalisation was not abused. Moreover to create an exception to the general prohibition of intentional killing would inevitably open the way to its further erosion whether by design, by inadvertence, or by the human tendency to test the limits of any regulation. These dangers are such that we believe that any decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia would give rise to more, and more grave, problems than those it sought to address. Fear of what some witnesses referred to as a ""slippery slope"" could in itself be damaging. We are also concerned that vulnerable people-the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed-would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death. We accept that, for the most part, requests resulting from such pressure or from remediable depressive illness would be identified as such by doctors and managed appropriately. Nevertheless we believe that the message which society sends to vulnerable and disadvantaged people should not, however obliquely, encourage them to seek death, but should assure them of our care and support in life. There is much confusion about rights. There is no right in law, in fact, morally or in any other way, to die. A person is at liberty to kill himself, but that is not a right. To establish the existence of a right there must be residing in another person a correlating duty either to do, or to refrain from exercising a power. That is, a right bespeaks a duty. There is no duty residing in anyone to kill somebody, but there is a duty to refrain from killing someone. There is a right to have one's life preserved, but there is no right to die. I have a right not to be Thursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7355 killed by someone. That right exists because there is a duty residing in that person not to kill me. When one considers the issue of states' rights as an argument, it is an intoxicating thought that, of all parliaments in the democratic world, one alone shines as a beacon-is at the forefront of unparalleled wisdom and understanding. Which parliament is that? Is it the House of Commons, representing more than 70 million people? Is it Congress, representing more than 280 million people? Is it any of the great recognised parliaments of the democratic world? Not a bit of it. An assembly representing the number of people residing in the Shire of Pine Rivers in my electorate alone possesses that clarity of foresight and human understanding that can decide by a bare majority so vital an issue. It does affect every person in Australia, not just the Northern Territorians. It is curious that the Northern Territory Assembly has not appreciated this. If it had it might have thought to consult much more widely than it did. That assembly has chosen to ignore all of the major reports from Canada, the United States, the House of Lords committee in England, and so on. The argument about states' rights is untenable and section 122 of the constitution settles this matter. This parliament has a pre-eminent duty to protect the life of every Australian citizen. It should not, and must not, shrink from that responsibility. Some speakers against the bill have demonstrated a misunderstanding of where the onus of proof lies. They have declared that individual rights ought not to be interfered with by the supporters of this bill. They have sought to claim a unique mandate, that somehow the individual is paramount over the whole of society. I have no problem with the question of autonomy, but it must not subjugate broad community interest. This line of argument at times trespasses into the region of emotional blackmail. The David Margan article in the Courier-Mail is in that category. The implication in the article is that those who oppose euthanasia lack compassion and love. With respect, this is not only offensive but simplistic and puerile. It does not provide argument. It is rhetoric without substance. I have acted for people charged with horrendous crimes involving children. Some have been convicted, some have not. At no stage were my professional skills and judgment compromised by my christian beliefs. However, Margan suggests that I and my colleague from Menzies( Mr Andrews), also a lawyer, cannot bring to bear our professional skills and judgment to this issue uninfluenced by our personal beliefs. The Northern Territory's legislation is an imposition upon the whole of society. The Andrews bill removes that imposition. It is an attempt to remove a law that amounts to a blot on the fragile parchment of life and intrudes on the extant duty of care the state owes to its citizens to preserve life. The Northern Territory'S legislation infringes the rights of the people of Australia. There are reasonable alternative means available, other than killing people, to assist people in the last stages of life. Since such care is available, why are we having this debate? Do we want to devalue the standards of excellence of the medical profession by turning them into tradesmen of death? Do we want the state to sanction and encourage them to abandon their efforts to improve palliative care in favour of their making a living out of killing? Are hospitals to institutionalise death? Do we say, 'Madam, the ward on the left is the killing ward. Sir, the one on the right is the caring one'? We cannot sanction state authorised killing because there is a suggestion that that is already happening. That is a particularly perplexing view of the situation. 7356 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 In the limited time available to me let me say that if one person is killed, euthanased, who did not voluntarily agree to being killed then I am afraid that that is one person too many. I have not been persuaded by those on the other side of this debate who bear the onus 'beyond reasonable doubt' that that cannot happen. The consequences of this legislation are far reaching. Abroad in the community will be a notion that life is not intrinsically unique. When people talk about opinion polls, I say that is irrelevant. I will give one example from a public meeting held in my electorate. A young woman who was suffering very badly from a serious illness spoke passionately about her right to die. Somebody then raised the question of the Sunday sport argument. She then changed her mind. She wrote to me recently saying that it was the Sunday sport argument that did it. You will remember that Sunday sport was regarded with horror 40 years ago. Look at it today, we all accept it. I was very impressed by that particular submission from that lady who changed her mind. It is informed opinion that we need to decide this debate, and the informed opinion suggests that this bill must be supported. (Time expired) bill and I am puzzled at times after listening to some of the discussion and some of the rhetoric that has gone on in relation to it. There are so many people out there whose lives become an agony. I firmly believe that when people have reached a stage in life where they want an exit from that life, and if there are stringent safeguards there for them to initiate a process that will satisfy that need that they have expressed, then they should have the freedom to do that. The debate has understandably raised an emotional dimension that tends to divert our attention from the central issue of this whole discussion and that central issue is about personal freedom. It is not a freedom for others to do with your life what they want to do, the central issue is about the personal freedom for a person, with the proper safeguards that have been set out, to make a decision about their own life. That element has to be emphasised because it is really about individual rights and an empowerment of the individual. As Professor Baume and other eminent medical practitioners repeatedly state, euthanasia is commonly practised, but the role of the patient in the decision making process has to be understood and respected. That is what I stand here in defence of the role of the individual in expressing their wish, their desire, about their own future, about their own agony. I do not feel that I, as an individual or as a member of this parliament, have a right to condemn somebody to continued agony. If that is their wish, and if we can put in proper safeguards for them to arrive at the decision, then they should have that freedom to do that. What is so extraordinary about this debate is what is not being said. That was partly what I was referring to in my opening words. So much is being said, but so much more is not being said. Euthanasia is practised frequently by the medical profession, sometimes with the knowledge of the person concerned, sometimes with the knowledge of family and friends, sometimes not. And let us not forget how many individuals there are out there who come to that stage of life and have nobody to share the knowledge with and nobody to consult. What do you think happens then? We know what happens. We are realists in the parliament. We move at all levels of society. So let us not fool ourselves by pretending that that practice is not happening. But who has the power in respect of that practice now? That power is with the medical profession alone.",193,Represent Atnes Main Committee
410,Mr Peter Morris (Shortland) (12.37 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am opposed to thisThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7357 It is interesting to look through the debate that has been taking place at the views coming from some sectors of the medical profession and the views coming from other sectors of the medical profession. All of us, and all of them, know that there is a frequent practice of euthanasia by the medical profession. The emotional appeals that come from institutional, and maybe political forums, from doctors themselves, from the spiritual areas-from the clergyhave to be seen in the context of restoring power to the individual. No matter how wellintentioned some of these views are, I come back to the central issue: the right of an individual to have control of his or her own future and life. People in privileged positions have always had access to an easy exit in the circumstances that have been talked about in this debate. They have always had it and they still have it. People in poorer circumstances do not. I think that distinction ought to be drawn very clearly. People without family or friends do not even rate in this debate and this discussion because the processes I have outlined earlier are already followed. But it is about choice of individuals, and I firmly believe that people should have that choice. I firmly believe that the processes are there, or can be put in place-I will come to the Northern Territory in a moment. Those processes are there to protect and to ensure that it is not action initiated by third parties, as I have heard so much about in this discussion. That is not what it is about at all. And when I mentioned emotional debate earlier, I was being kind and I am putting it down to that. It is emotion and there is confusion about it. But our discussion, and the Northern Territory legislation is about individuals' own initiated activity in respect of themselves. We will not go further into some of the other arguments and discussions that have come forward because they fall over at that point. If you read through the table that best describes the Northern Territory legislation, you say, 'What is this discussion that is going on?' So much of it is so far away from the process that is set out in the law and the process that is followed that I wonder why people are involved in it. As I said, this is a debate about empowering the individual so that individuals regain control over their own lives. You read from the diagram in respect of the Northern Territory legislation that, firstly, the patient makes a request. It is the first test. 'Does a medical practitioner wish to give assistance? Yes. Has patient attained age of 18 years?' You have to pass that. 'Is the patient suffering from an illness that in its normal course without application of extraordinary measures will result in death?' The answer is yes. The next question is: 'Is there any medical measure acceptable to patients to effect a cure?' If the answer is no, the next step is: 'Is the only medical treatment reasonably available confined to the relief of pain, suffering and stress?' If the answer is yes, the next question is: 'Has an independent medical practitioner with special qualifications in the patient's terminal illness confirmed the existence of the illness and the prognosis?' If the answer is yes, the next step is: 'Has a qualified psychiatrist confirmed that the patient is not suffering from treatable clinical depression?' If the answer to that is yes, then the next question is: 'Is the illness causing severe pain and suffering?' If yes, then 'Has the medical practitioner informed the patient of all medical treatment available including palliative care?' If the answer again is yes, the next question is: 'Has the information on the availability of palliative care been provided to the patient by a medical practitioner with prescribed qualifications in the field of palliative care?' And then, if the answer to that is yes, 'Are there palliative care options available to alleviate the patient's pain and suffering to levels acceptable 7358 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 21 November 1996 to the patient?, All the way through this it is the patient, the person, who is being addressed here-not some other ideology elsewhere, and not some other point of view, but the person who is suffering. If the answer to that last question is no, then comes the question: 'Has the patient formally indicated that he or she wishes to end life?' If yes, then 'Has the patient considered the implications for his or her family?, If yes, then 'Is the patient of sound mind and is the decision made freely and voluntarily?' And if the answer to that is yes, then more questions follow: 'Have seven days elapsed? Has the patient completed a certificate of request? Has a medical practitioner witnessed the patient's signature and completed the declaration? Has the certificate of request been signed by an independent medical practitioner satisfied as to the patient's soundness of mind and the decision being a free choice? If the patient does not share the same first language as all the medical practitioners involved, has the certificate been signed by an interpreter? Will any medical practitioner involved or close associate gain any financial or other advantage-other than reasonable medical fees-from the death of the patient? Have 48 hours elapsed since the certificate of request was signed? Has the patient given any indication that he or she no longer wishes to end life?' Lastly, when the request has passed all of those hurdles, assistance to voluntarily terminate life may be given. It is voluntary; it is the individual who initiates it; it is the person himself or herself who makes the decision and initiates the activity. As I said in my opening remarks, this debate is more important for what is not being said, and it is a debate and a discussion about giving back to individuals the right to make decisions about their own lives. (Time expired) this occasion very briefly, simply to put my position on the record with regard to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. A great many honourable members have spoken eloquently, passionately, sincerely and at some length on the issues in this debate, and I have certainly no wish to restate arguments or re-present material that has already been amply put on the record. I simply want to make clear the arguments that have weighed with me. I oppose the Andrews bill and I support the continuation in operation of the Northern Territory legislation for four main reasons. Firstly, there is my strong belief that individuals should be free to make their own decisions about matters which are of fundamental importance to them and which cannot or do not impact in any relevant way on the rights of others. There can be no more fundamental decision than the decision to live or die. I simply do not believe that it is the business of the state to do any more than put safeguards in place to ensure that that decision is absolutely voluntary and has some objective justification in terms of the medical condition of the person in question. Secondly, there is my belief that the Northern Territory legislation does in fact contain all the necessary safeguards to ensure that the decision to die is made both absolutely voluntarily and in circumstances where the objective medical justification for that voluntary decision-a terminal illness, and all the suffering and indignity that goes with it-is absolutely clear. The member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris) has again put on the record the key elements in the legislation, which I think do make it clear that it contains those necessary safeguards. Thirdly, there is my belief that on all the available evidence, which, admittedly, for obvious reasons, is largely unofficial, anecdotal and unsystematic, voluntary euthanasia is already an omnipresent reality in our society, with doctors constantly being put in the position of being asked to take steps to hasten the inevitable and to help people escape an existence that has",196,Representatives Main Committee
411,Mr Gareth Evans (Holt,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12.47 p.m.)-I speak onThursday, 21 November 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 7359 become simply intolerable, but without having any legal basis to do so and being put in a very difficult position, very often, as a result. We all know that this is happening and that there is a very large measure of community support, of tolerance, and of understanding, for its happening. My view is that in these circumstances it is usually much better for the law to adjust to reality rather than to be conspicuously at odds with it. Respect for the law is, as a general matter, simply not enhanced when it is seen as being out of touch with contemporary reality, with prevailing perceptions of relevant moral principles. Of course, we are very aware that opinions differ, and differ strongly, on what the relevant moral principles are in the circumstances of voluntary euthanasia. But this is at least one instance where the opinion polls are a good guide at least to what the overwhelming view of contemporary Australians is as to the relevant moral principles that should be regarded as prevailing or determining one's judgment about the rightness or wrongness of the acts in question. Fourthly, there is my belief that all the great advances in modem medical science and palliative care, which have clearly done so much to relieve the awful physical pain suffered so often by so many terminally ill patients in the past, simply do not outweigh what one might describe as the psychic pain that is caused for so many people by being reduced to a state of helpless dependence. I do not believe anyone could fail to have been very deeply moved by the statement made by Bob Dent, the first person to take advantage of the Northern Territory legislation, about his plight in this respect. That awful erosion, which he stated so movingly, of his capacity for independence, his sense of dignity, and his sense of personal worth. I really do find that statement a complete answer to those who speak, in all good conscience, of the capacity these days for people to die peacefully. There may be, indeed, a degree of physical peace possible; but if dying is not psychologically peaceful for the person in question, it is not peaceful at all. I make clear that the states' rights argument is no part of my position on this debate. I do not challenge the capacity of the Commonwealth parliament to act in this matter. Indeed, I have always argued for the widest possible interpretation of the Commonwealth parliament's legislative powers, particularly on issues which are of genuinely national, rather than merely local, importance. The reason I will vote against this bill is not because I think it was inappropriately introduced in the federal parliament or even inappropriately debated in this main committee, but simply that it is wrong, in my judgment, in what it seeks to do.
