My electorate is an outer metropolitan electorate. It is relatively large by metropolitan standards, and consists of a series of communities joined by the Princes Highway. Between those communities and within those communities there are very poor public transport options. As a result, the closure of any bank branch is really a crisis for the community, because it is often not possible for the people who use that bank branch to travel to any other part of the community or the electorate to do their banking. Immediately prior to my election as the federal member for Lalor, there was a spate of bank closures in Laverton, which left that whole area without access to banking facilities. As a result of that, the local community banded together and, after a very long effort, managed to have opened a Bendigo Bank, a community bank. I would like to note today my congratulations to Joe Inserra, who played a pivotal role in that community bank being opened and who has been rewarded by being recognised as the Hobsons Bay citizen of the year. Having said that, the bank branch closures have not ended. Since my election, we have seen two Commonwealth Bank branches that service the West Sunshine end of my electorate close, a Commonwealth Bank branch in Hoppers Crossing close and a National Australia Bank branch in Pier Street, Altona close. The Bank of Melbourne in Pier Street, Altona, is also closing. I wrote to Mr David Gutteridge, the general manager of the retail network of the Bank of Melbourne, on 19 December last year to put my voice of protest to that closure. I am yet to receive a reply to that letter. I think that really is unsatisfactory when the issue of that bank closure is of major concern to the community that works, lives and shops around Pier Street, Altona. On that occasion, I explained to Mr Gutteridge that there had been many other bank closures in my electorate and that the Australian community was tired of seeing banks make record profits at the same time as they walk away from any semblance of civic responsibility. Obviously, despite the record profits, the Bank of Melbourne is struggling to find the price of a stamp, and I have not had a response to that letter. However, once again, what the big banks will not do for it, the community tries to do for itself. In Altona tonight there is a community meeting to explore the possibility of opening a community bank in Pier Street, Altona. I would like to offer my best wishes to that meeting. I am obviously unable to attend, because federal parliament is sitting, but I hope that some constructive plans come forward at that meeting to address the problem with the lack of banking options in Pier Street, Altona.

I pass my thoughts on to the family on this day. On a more cheery note, I would like to express a great deal of gratitude to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Wooldridge, for his announcement yesterday that included the establishment of a clinical school in Dubbo to work in with the Department of Rural Health, which has been established in Broken Hill for some time. This government, especially since the last budget, has put an enormous amount of thought and dollars into delivering long term solutions to medical crises faced in rural New South Wales-indeed, in rural Australia. In particular, the Dubbo example of the clinical school has reason to be mentioned. Last year we announced funding for four years to establish a Royal Flying Doctor base in Dubbo. It is no coincidence that the clinical school has been greatly supported by the Flying Doctor base. The beauty of having a clinical school in Dubbo is that so many more medical students will spend part of their training in a rural centre, and they will receive outstanding experience in and exposure to a rural health practice by working in Dubbo, working with Macquarie Area Health, and also by being part of the outreach services provided by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The other point to be made is that it breaks down the misconception by a lot of city based people that working in a rural area is akin to working in Siberia. The presence of academic staff, PhD students and medical students and the ability of specialists and GPs to work with the university by undertaking the role of tutors and lecturers will in itself create a centre of medical excellence in Dubbo. This will radiate to the surrounding towns, which will benefit by becoming more attractive in their attempts to get general practitioners to work in their areas because of the links that they will have with Dubbo. This initiative is benefiting not only Dubbo, Narromine, Gilgandra and Wellington but also Bourke, Brewarrina, Cobar and right out to Broken Hill. I commend the minister and thank him for his efforts in this regard. Griffith Electorate: Australia Day Awards electorate of Griffith, we held an Australia Day ceremony which honoured 22 of our local citizens for their extraordinary contribution to the life and fabric of our local community. This has become an annual event in our community and, in our view, an important one in terms of honouring those who would otherwise not achieve appropriate recognition. We all read on Australia Day the list of annual Australia Day awards handed out nationally. In each of our communities we recognise also the extraordinary achievements of thousands of Australians throughout their lifetime who receive no such recognition. In particular, I would like to honour Maude Campbell, Robert Chester-Master, Doris Crocker, Susan Cull, Vic Green, Norm Moore, William Purcell, Shirley White, Heather Barnes, Jeanette Best, Martin Curley, Jacqueline Hobson, Helen Koppenol, Patrick O’Donoghue, Patricia Ryan, Doris Donald, Catherine Fox, Susan Kearney, May Kerr, Margaret McGuire, Peg Parkinson, Olwen Schubert; and, posthumously, Tsampika ‘Betty’ Pippos. Mrs Pippos died recently but was honoured for her extraordinary contributions to the Greek community in the southern suburbs of Brisbane. It is fair to say-and I said this on Australia Day-that, if we were to try to calculate the financial equivalent of the voluntary contribution of those people who were honoured in our Australia Day ceremony, the contribution by people in our room that day represented something like 500 to 1,000 years worth of combined volunteerism. Each of those individuals represented in their own lives some 30 to 40 years worth of continuing voluntary effort. If we were to factor that out in terms of the dollars saved by the Australian taxpayer with respect to services which would otherwise not have been delivered, we would see the extraordinary contribution which they have made.",126,Representatives Main Committee
323,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (9.46 A.m.),"On Australia Day, in Carina, which is in Brisbane, in my24154 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 I would also like to thank the Broadwater Road Uniting Church in the suburb of Mansfield in Brisbane. For the last two years they have provided an extraordinary musical accompaniment to our day’s proceedings. The professionalism of the young musicians and the singers was an inspiration to all those who attended this year’s ceremony. When we look at ensuring that we take the spirit of Australian volunteerism seriously, it is important that, across the Australian community-not just in the southern suburbs of Brisbane-we think about instituting comprehensively a set of local awards which recognise volunteerism in our communities. Too many people fail to achieve this recognition. On Australia DayI was pleased to honour these individuals for their extraordinary contribution to their community and their nation. Corporations Law: Older Australians and Resources) (9.49 a.m.)-I call today for the parliament’s support to change the Australian Corporations Law. The Australian Corporations Law states that persons who have reached 72 years of age may be appointed to a directorship of a public company only with a resolution passed by a majority of three-quarters of its voting members. For people aged less than 72 years election to the position of director of a public company requires only a simple majority. This is a ridiculous, discriminatory and outdated law that denies organisations the ability to access the wealth of corporate knowledge and experience that older Australians have to offer. It also runs contrary to government policy, which seeks to maximise the capacity of senior Australians to participate in businesses, associations and the wider community. The government has committed $6.1 million over four years to progress the national strategy for an ageing Australia in our 2000-01 federal budget. This initiative is specifically directed towards developing policies that promote the role of mature aged workers and their contribution to national economic growth and maximising the capacity of senior Australians to participate in and contribute to their communities. The aged care minister has often stated: Too often older Australians are portrayed in stereotypical ways that bear little relationship to the great diversity of experience and the contributions they have made, and continue to make, to their communities. I agree with the minister that this must be changed. This matter was brought to my attention by one of my constituents, Mr Terry Huey, who wished to stand for re-election to the position of director of the Royal Queensland Bowls Association, a position he has held for six years. But Mr Huey turned 72 last year and will be required under Corporations Law to secure a majority of three-quarters of all eligible voting members when he contests the position at the association’s 2001 AGM. This is in spite of the fact that Mr Huey has a lifetime of experience, is very healthy, has a very strong love for his chosen sport of lawn bowls and has plenty of time on his hands to contribute freely to the Royal Queensland Bowls Association. Mr Huey believes that at the age of 72 he is capable of carrying on in the role of director of the Royal Queensland Bowls Association and that it should be left to the members of the Royal Queensland Bowls Association to decide, based on a simple majority vote. The high bar should not be unfairly lifted for Mr Huey, or anyone else for that matter, simply because he is one year older than he was when he stood for office last year. While it may be too late to assist Terry Huey in time for this AGM, as it is due in March this year, I am determined to see the Australian Corporations Law changed and changed sooner rather than later to put an end to this discrimination.

I would just like to mention those eight people who received their awards last Wednesday. Mr Albert Roberts received the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to sailing. Albert is a founding member of the Teralba Amateur Sailing Club and has been a member for 53 years. He continues to be an active supporting member of the club. Mr Ken Lettice received the medal for his contribution to soccer. Ken was a member of and player for the Swansea Soccer Club for 28 years and played over 650 club games. He is a coach and committee member of the club. Mr Alan Kildey received the medal for his contribution to sailing. Alan is a founding member of the Teralba Amateur Sailing Club and has been a member for 53 years. He is still an active supporting member. Ms Lois Green received the Australian Sports Medal for her contribution to netball. Lois has been associated with the Newcastle Netball Association for over 50 years. She has represented Newcastle for 15 years and New South Wales for 10 years. Ms Nola Green also received the medal for her contribution to netball. Nola has been involved with the Newcastle Netball Association for over 40 years. She represented Newcastle in an open representative team for 31 years and has coached Newcastle netball teams for six years. Mr Noel Dunne received the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to soccer. Noel has given 40 years of service to the Toronto-Awaba Junior Soccer Club, maintaining the grounds and coaching junior soccer teams. He has just turned 80 and is still carrying out these services. Mr Chris Arnold received the medal for his contribution to AFL. Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure the successful amalgamation of the Newcastle AFL and the Central Coast AFL with the Black Diamond AFL. A beneficiary of that is my 10-year-old son, who is now playing Auskick AFL in school competitions. Finally, I mention Mrs Julie Andrews, who received her medal for her contribution to touch football. Julie has been a member of the Wallsend Touch Association for 14 years. During this time, Julie has been a committee person, a park player, a representative player and an administrator. Her outstanding efficiency and management skills allowed the association to become a stand-out club, funding and building its own clubhouse and erecting several sets of lights. The Australian Sports Medal was a fantastic way to recognise these local people in our community who have given so much, and my children and I have benefited from this. (Time expired) Carruthers, Mr Kristian Brendan Petrol Prices Carruthers, a young man aged 15 years who met his untimely death in a bus accident in my electorate of Gilmore last week. I was given leave to attend his funeral yesterday in Ulladulla, where the church was overflowing and beyond all capacity. The reason I speak about Kristian is, firstly, to pay my respects to his family-his mother, Bernadette, his father, Steve, and sisters, Genevieve and Jacinta. What struck me most was the respect for and admiration of this young man by his peers. Some 300 students attended his funeral. I say, with kindness and respect, that they came from all kinds of backgrounds, with all kinds of hairdos. I am sure that many of them would never have willingly set foot inside a church. Their grief and emotion were so strong that it empowered the whole congregation to lift itself and extend a hand in support and friendship to these friends. Never before have I seen such unity among so many young people. I hope that Kristian’s parents saw and received some solace from this, for it was their son who drew this enormous respect. I felt somehow privileged to be there and to witness this amazing energy.",128,Representatives Main Committee

Thank you also to the young lady who sang those beautiful, haunting hymns, so appropriate for the day. I say to all the parents of those young people who were injured, some 25 in all: keep strong. We need your continued wisdom and strength as you guide these young people into a future that has such potential. I would like to say thank you to Kristian. On another note, I notice that the honourable member for Hotham, Simon Crean, is again trying to bring my name into disrepute over the petrol issue. The member for Hotham has not been to my electorate of Gilmore. The member for Hotham would do better to explain exactly what Labor’s policies are in relation to the petrol excise. It would be a whole lot better if the member for Hotham asked the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, what he intends to do with the New South Wales state excise subsidy on petrol, thereby perhaps decreasing the cost of petrol by some 8c, as Queensland has done. I believe the member for Hotham is again trying to scare people. I say to the member for Hotham that it is very easy to do this, but that words do not count; it is actions that count. the time for members’ statements has concluded. (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2000 Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 does precisely that which its title suggests. The bill amends various pieces of legislation within the communications and arts portfolio to reflect the application of the Criminal Code to all Commonwealth offences. The amendments are intended to ensure that chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 is applied to all Commonwealth criminal offences by December this year. This is occurring across all portfolios, and the approach which the government is taking to the application of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code is appropriate and should generally be supported. The government has stated that, subject to several minor exceptions noted in the explanatory memorandum, the bill does not affect the operation of current criminal offences; rather, it seeks to ensure that the current criminal offences are not altered following the application of the Criminal Code to the Commonwealth legislation to which I have previously referred. These items are part of an across-the-board portfolio effort. On that basis, they are supported by the opposition. They provide no difficulty from our perspective. support for the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000. It is essentially a matter-of-fact and procedural piece of legislation to bring the communications and the arts legislation into line with all other government legislation so far as the application of the Criminal Code is concerned. This was brought about by a deliberate change to penalty provisions within the Criminal Code which was introduced by the Attorney-General last year. The consequence of that particular procedure was that other legislation also had to be brought into line to reflect that change. I do not want to delay the Main Committee for too long, but I would like to raise my concerns about the types of offences that could be subject to penalties under telecommunications acts. On many occasions in this place I have spoken about my concern that the telecommunications industry is not competitive enough.

329,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (9.59 A.m.),"The government welcomes the opposition’sWednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24157 sometimes by Optus-drive a stake through the heart of competition in telecommunications. We have many providers of telecommunications services in Australia now-dozens of them. Many of them are becoming household names, but many never will because they are providing services behind the scenes, in bulk, mainly to the corporate sector. For instance, many people would not realise that the communications system between Australia’s universities is provided by Optus. Although Optus is a household name, the company-not Telstra-provides the links between universities. Others in this place have come forward and said that, unless there is a Telstra badge on the box, it is not telecommunications. I think those arguments of 12 months ago-promoted in part by the opposition and in part by some members on the government side-have now been proved to be false. In fact, Telstra is just one of the providers. However, because Telstra is such an established provider of telecommunications and has such an extensive range of infrastructure, its activities are a matter of grave concern to the whole issue of competition. So, when I find in my electorate of Moreton that other providers have to duplicate infrastructure at great cost to the community and also with a great deal of pain in an emotional sense-and infrastructure is located literally down the road from a long-established telecommunications infrastructure owned by Telstra-because Telstra has made access to that infrastructure installation difficult, I start to wonder what the penalty provisions within our acts are actually trying to do. We can fine Telstra millions and millions of dollars a day, but they are such a big organisation that fines like that are often factored into their corporate plan and so the cost of doing is far greater than the cost of the penalty for not doing, and so Telstra will hold out. In a broad sense, I want to put the case that I believe the penalties that are offered and the application of those penalties often do not meet the cause of good competition in telecommunications. I also raise the issue of a constituent of mine, Mrs Healy-who, by her own admission, is not particularly good at the English language. She has been having difficulties with Telstrawhich is often described in the communications industry as the 800-pound gorilla of telecommunications. Telstra and their contractor, Microtunnelling Pty Ltd, came past Mrs Healy’s house in Fegen Drive, Moorooka. Moorooka is one of the oldest suburbs of Brisbane. In Telstra’s letter to Mrs Healy of 22 January they misspelt the name of the suburb-which I find in itself quite extraordinary. Nevertheless, late last year Mrs Healy had Microtunnelling come through and use a great deal of water to bore underneath her concrete driveway to put in some conduit tubing. Brisbane was very dry at that time of year. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure that, like me, you would understand a little bit about aquastatic pressure and the way that water can impact upon very dry clay soil in that circumstance. What happened when Microtunnelling introduced so much water in a concentrated way? Mrs Healy’s driveway shifted and sank. It cracked all over the place. Only a couple of thousand dollars at most was involved in fixing this problem, but Telstra has dragged this thing out long and hard. I think they are basically abusing Mrs Healy’s poor English language skills. At first, they said they were not responsible for the damage that happened to her driveway 20 feet away from where they were digging and that there must have been something wrong with the driveway. Whether there was something wrong with Mrs Healy’s driveway before Telstra arrived has nothing to do with it. The difference in the equation is that the driveway was working fine until Microtunnelling introduced a great volume of water, which spewed clay down and underneath the slope of the driveway and filled the drains at the bottom of the driveway some 20 or 25 feet away from where Microtunnelling was working. I have inspected the site and written to Telstra. Their latest letter to me is very legalistic. Moorooka is misspelt: there is an ‘Ma’ instead of an ‘Moo’. The letter contains the phrase ‘without prejudice’, and says that 24158 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 Mrs Healy has 14 days in which to respond to their proposal. I call on Telstra to be reasonable and fair and fix Mrs Healy’s driveway. I have used that example to illustrate my point: while this legislation brings into line the criminal code application of penalties and so forth across the telecommunications field, the shape, size, scope and reasons for applying penalties continue to concern me. I am afraid that Telstra-a great company that is worth a lot of money on the stock market and is highly valued emotionally by many Australians-is letting down its good reputation in their treatment of the industry as a whole, and particularly in their treatment of my constituent, Mrs Healy. I call on Telstra to act. I commend the bill to the Committee but emphasise that we must ensure that the outcomes and the integrity of the system that we are providing and promoting in this legislation are correct on every occasion. Moreton for turning eventually to the subject of the bill, despite his concerns about his constituent’s driveway. (10.06 a.m.)-in reply-It is appropriate that we conclude this debate with a contribution from the honourable member for Moreton, who has once again demonstrated his fearlessness. His meaningful and constructive contributions to each and every communications and telecommunications bill that comes before the House are extraordinary. At the same time, the honourable member is not hesitant about, or afraid of, demanding better services and business practices from the telecommunications carriers and companies. In this case, the honourable member has strongly pursued with Telstra the interests of Mrs Healy. I commend him for his stand and I trust that, when Telstra receive a copy of the Hansard transcript, they will attend to Mrs Healy’s problems and needs. This is an important bill as it is part of the government’s reform of the criminal law. The purpose of the bill is to amend offence provisions and acts within the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio to ensure that they are interpreted as originally intended after the criminal code commences. As part of the development of a national uniform criminal code, the Commonwealth enacted the Criminal Code Act 1995, which contains the Criminal Code. This criminal code establishes general principles of criminal responsibility and will commence on 15 December 2001. From this date, the general principles in the code will apply to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code may alter the way offences are interpreted by the courts. This bill ensures that, when the code commences, the criminal offence provisions in the acts within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously. It also ensures that the provisions are consistent with the code’s general principles. If these amendments are not made, the Criminal Code could alter the way that criminal offences currently operate. The bill also makes other minor amendments that are not strictly necessary for harmonisation purposes with the code but are consistent with the general criminal law policy to simplify offence provisions and improve their operation. I commend the bill to the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

331,Mr Mcgauran (Gippsland,"Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation)Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24159 duties of government: the defence of the nation’s sovereignty and its people. On6 December last year, the Prime Minister launched the Defence 2000 white paper, which outlined the government’s commitment to the Australian Defence Force and the security of the Australian nation. I take particular interest in this subject as I have had a long and strong association with the Australian Defence Force. Great influences on my life were, of course, my father, who served in the British Army in the first war and the Australian Army in the second war; my brother, who was a Rat of Tobruk; and my master solicitor, whom I did articles with, was the late Captain Harry Flood. He was a great lawyer who served very bravely as a commando in World War II, observing the Japanese in Timor, pursued by the Japanese and never caught. He escaped by submarine before they finally could get him. His life was constantly in danger and he observed, and reported on, Japanese movements and saved many lives. He was a mentor to me for my career in law and also generally. I myself have been a national serviceman and later a major in the Australian Army Reserve. When I was elected to the Commonwealth parliament, I was fortunate enough to become a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. My own seat of Indi contains major defence establishments such as the Army Training Centre at Bandiana, and the adjoining electorate of McEwen close by contains Puckapunyal, where I did my training in the armoured regiment in the coldest winter ever in the history of Australia. Those two army establishments play a major part in the life of regional Victoria, and the service men and women are important and good citizens of our communities. I also have a major defence factory, Australian Defence Industries, in Benalla, and share with Tim Fischer at Yarrawonga-Mulwala a major defence ADI factory. Tim and I also share an ADI establishment in Albury-Wodonga. I also, at the present time, have the honour of being the patron of the Bandiana War Museum. I recommend that members visit that area. You will be made very welcome and see one of the most outstanding museums in Australia, which is developing rapidly too. I am also a friend of the Australian War Memorial. So it is a big part of my life, as you can see. This white paper represents the most comprehensive reappraisal of Australia’s defence capability for decades. It provides major increases in defence funding over a 10-year period. It complements the government’s view of these strategic circumstances in which Australia is now placed in our region and beyond, and it lays down the most specific long-term funding commitment given by any Australian government in over 25 years. I pay tribute to the retired minister, John Moore, for his contribution and efforts, and to John Howard for his chairmanship in that. I also wish Peter Reith every success with the challenging defence portfolio that he now holds. The white paper importantly reaffirms the defence of Australia as the primary focus of the ADF, yet it also recognises the important changes that have occurred within South-East Asia and the South Pacific. It gives the ADF the flexibility and capability to play a positive role in promoting stability and cooperation in the region and it allows the ADF, where necessary, to be able to contribute to peacekeeping and coalition operations. The white paper provides the crucial strategic guidance that the ADF requires to implement an appropriate, realistic and affordable force structure in the early 21st century. What the government has committed to delivering through this white paper is based on Defence’s own analysis of its needs and requirements. It gives the ADF an unprecedented level of confidence about its future. The white paper has a number of unique features. It was developed through extensive consultations throughout government and with the National Security Committee of cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister. The National Security Committee is an innovation of John",132,Representatives Main Committee
332,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (10.10 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on one of the fundamental24160 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 Howard and has worked particularly well. Without doubt, John Howard’s government is the best informed government on defence issues since the Vietnam War. The committee’s endorsement, and ultimately that of cabinet, demonstrates the whole-of-government commitment to the white paper. The paper also demonstrates the achievements of this government in providing a framework for regional security. By being transparent in producing the white paper, Australia has contributed significantly to building broader confidence in South-East Asian security. However, the most innovative thing about the white paper was the public consultation process led by my good friend Andrew Peacock. It is with great pride that I reflect upon the fact that the white paper was written with the informed consent and input of the Australian community. The government took the unprecedented step of conducting a broad public consultation process to ensure that the Australian people were directly involved and able to be better informed about the security of the nation and the issues facing us. We sought their wise counsel on the way in which they would like the government to shape the future defence policies of this nation. Through this process there was an unambiguous signal from the Australian public that we should preserve our military capabilities and increase our defence spending-the message was loud and clear. Defence is one of the most expensive national undertakings, and this government has ensured that it is done effectively and efficiently. As a former health minister, I often wonder which is the more expensive portfolio: defence or health. I think defence probably is the more expensive on balance, and will remain so. In recent years the government has given high priority to reforming the defence organisation. We have a responsibility to the Australian public to continue to ensure that taxpayers’ funds are spent wisely. For the past 12 years Australia’s defence spending has been flat in real terms, and indeed fell slightly in the early 1990s. Over the same period, costs have increased in many areas of the defence budget in real terms. This produced a long-term squeeze on our capabilities and on the people in uniform. This government became concerned that our defence budget was no longer adequate to sustain the existing set of capabilities in the uncertain strategic environment we faced. Without action, defence spending as a percentage of GDP would have continued to fall, and with it our military capabilities. The Howard government is determined to ensure that the ADF will have the capability to fight and to win. To do this we need to maintain the full range of military capabilities we have today and significantly enhance many of them over the coming decade. Through the implementation of the white paper we will increase the readiness, deployability and combat weight of our land forces, which were long neglected by the previous Labor government. Progressively, we will upgrade our air and naval forces to keep pace with evolving technologies and capabilities. The defence capability plan, which was developed as part of the white paper, sets clear goals for the development of each major group of capabilities and provides detailed, costed programs for their development. It, too, is a unique aspect of this defence white paper. The defence capability plan covers the next 10 years and takes account of the need to invest in new capabilities, which will come into service in the decade commencing 2010. Within the disciplined framework of the plan, the government has made important decisions about the future of all our major capabilities. To achieve the capability enhancements set out in the defence capability plan, the government will increase defence spending by $500 million in the financial year 2001-02 and by a further $500 million in 2002-03, providing an additional $1 billion that year. This initial funding boost will be further supplemented in following years. The net result is an increase in defence spending that averages three per cent per year in real terms for a decade. The capability plan is underpinned by important strategic decisions taken by government on what it wants the Defence Force to be able to do. It is easy to lose sight of these beneath Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24161 the lists of equipment to be acquired but they are very significant. The government wants the Army to be able to respond swiftly and effectively to any credible armed lodgement on Australian territory and provide forces for the more likely types of operations in our immediate neighbourhood. To do this the Army will be structured to ensure that we are able to sustain a brigade on operations for extended periods and maintain a smaller battalion group for simultaneous operations elsewhere. Our air combat capability will be kept at the leading edge of capabilities in the region and have a sufficient margin of superiority to provide an acceptable likelihood of success in combat operations. It will be backed by capable naval forces able to operate throughout our maritime approaches and beyond. Australia will also maintain the most potent submarine and strike capability in the region. All of this will be backed by systems and structures that will exploit the advantages available to modern militaries through developments in information technology. The white paper also recognises the crucial importance of people with a commitment to raise the level of the ADF to 54,000 personnel and to make sure these people are trained to the highest ability. First class defence capability requires first class defence personnel. The white paper provides for recruitment and retention strategies. These strategies include restructuring the ADF’s remuneration, superannuation and compensation arrangements to make them more effective, efficient and flexible to better accommodate individuals’ needs. At the same time the white paper has given particular attention to the reserves and the cadets-very important components of the nation’s community. The white paper supports a number of policy initiatives which enhance the contribution of the reserves to ADF capability. These initiatives provide greater options for the employment of reserves whilst also giving the reserves a greater level of community support. The white paper also commits the government to expanding the Australian Services Cadet Scheme with an increase in funding to $30 million by 2002. Cadets engender community involvement and support for the ADF and represent a crucial link between regional and rural communities with the defence forces. Of course we know the Prime Minister was a cadet in his youth, General Cosgrove started his career as a cadet and the Deputy Speaker was a cadet as well. The cadets have played an important part in helping to shape not only their own lives but also the community and the nation. Many go on and serve permanently in the defence forces. The capability enhancements in this white paper will result in a $23.5 billion increase in defence funding over the coming decade-a significant increase in defence funding by any standard. This increase in funding keeps the faith with the Australian people and reflects their views as expressed through the public consultation process. We have listened and acted. This is a much more specific funding commitment than in any white paper over the last 25 years. It will provide the first significant real increases in defence spending in 15 years. We have taken the unprecedented step of providing detailed funding projections in the paper over the entire decade-a refreshing, transparent indication of the government’s approach and how it will deliver. I am delighted that much of the extra funding that the white paper provides will go to regional Australia. The regional development of Australia is an issue that I have always supported. I have consistently argued that regional development was an unrecognised issue in Australian politics. It is one of the reasons why I wanted to serve in the Commonwealth parliament. I am glad to see members on both sides of parliament wanting to take a greater interest in the life of regional Australia and forging a stronger partnership between city and country people. Well done! 24162 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 I hope the defence expenditure is the beginning of a greater recognition of Australia’s regions and their future role in this great country. The seat of Indi, which I represent and will be retiring from when the election is called, is of great importance to the Victorian economy. It is a federation seatSir Isaac Isaacs was the first federal member for Indi. As I have already mentioned, Indi is home to significant regional defence establishments and their families. I am very proud of those people. This white paper provides numerous benefits to regional Australia. The upgrade of the 350 M113 armoured personnel carriers brings joy to my heart as a former member of the armoured corps. It will provide more employment within my seat of Indi in Albury-Wodonga, because that is where the work will be carried out by the skilled technicians who work and live in regional Australia. Other parts of regional Australia will benefit from the decision to construct in Australia three air warfare destroyers, as well as the replacements for the Fremantle class patrol boats. The expansion of the Army’s high readiness force from four to six infantry battalions and a number of other initiatives will ensure that Australia is well looked after, protected and ready to face the challenges of the future. (Time expired) Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.25 a.m.)-I would also like to make some comments on the defence white paper-Defence 2000: our future Defence Force-that we are discussing at the moment. I guess it is important for me to give some background about my electorate of Gellibrand in order to explain why there are particular aspects of the defence paper that I would like to concentrate on today. Much of what previous speakers have already mentioned related, of course, to initiatives that the Labor Party has stated on the record that they support. There are a number of initiatives with regard to which there is bipartisan support and, in this defence area, it is clearly in the nation’s interest for us to identify common goals for the country and to plan 10 years into the future. I think it is a shame that we do not plan 10 years into the future for many of our other areas of public policy, but it is an initiative that has been supported by us. In explaining my electorate’s interest in the defence white paper and defence issues in general, I remind the House that my electorate of Gellibrand has a very proud history of involvement in the defence industry. It has played a key role in the defence industry by being the home to the ammunitions factory and the explosives site. Both these sites have been in operation since shortly following Federation. They have employed, over the years, thousands and thousands of constituents in my electorate. They have trained, in trade skills and many other skills, probably somebody related to every person who still lives in my electorate. They have also had a major impact on the way in which the area was developed and a major impact on the sorts of equipment and provisions that we have been able to provide to our defence forces in the past. In addition, many Defence Force personnel live in my electorate. There is still a significant amount of defence housing on the old rifle range. Fort Gellibrand, although it has some historical significance, is still home to the current commando unit that trains there. Jacks Magazine remains and, hopefully in the future, will be a historical site that is open to the public to visit. Of course, I could not ignore the fact that the Williamstown Dockyards remain in my electorate-the home of the ANZAC frigates. It has a significant impact in my electorate-such a significant impact that it would be hard to understate it. I would like to express my concern that the defence white paper does not perhaps provide quite enough security for the ongoing viability of the dockyards in Williamstown. There has been some public speculation about the future closure of that site. I would have grave concerns about that, as would many of the employees, including my constituents who work at that site and who rely on it. Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24163 In addition to the Tenix dockyards at Williamstown, AMRL still has significant operations in my electorate, although a decision has been made that they will relocate to Fishermens Bend so that DSTO is based in the one place in Melbourne. The Army engineering facilities remain there, and are also scheduled to move. I must say that this is rather sad for my electorate because it is signalling the end of some of our lasting connection with the defence industries. The discussion paper that was released by the government last year was welcomed by and debated in my electorate. We held a community consultation and I submitted, on behalf of the electorate, a submission to the consultation team. One of the very important aspects that was discussed at this community meeting was that the discussion paper had absolutely no reference in it to industry policy and the importance of defence industries. I have already indicated to the House why that is such an important issue for us. I was pleased to see that the white paper does contain a detailed section on defence industries. It is an indication that the public’s role in raising these issues was taken into account. Defence industries and DSTO are both the subject of a detailed section in the white paper, which I would also like to talk about. Other issues that were raised during the public consultation in my electorate were issues of morale and the role that our forces should play in the future of the region. Whilst those issues are obviously the key to some of the recommendations that are made about the sort of capability that we want for our defence forces in the future, that is not the aspect of the paper that I will be speaking on. When the white paper was issued, I was delighted to find that there was actually a whole chapter on industry. I am pleased that the government is making some noises to indicate that it does support the defence industry. In several places it says that its preference is that the equipment and needs of our defence forces be met in Australia where possible. It does not go that further step and actually propose any sorts of initiatives or planning that would guarantee that that would happen. Nor does it make it a specific requirement that the impact on jobs or the importance of having trained staff and personnel in Australia be of value. I am concerned that the statements with respect to industry perhaps do not go far enough. Obviously, this concern was heightened in my electorate by media reports over the Christmas break that the federal government may not contract to Tenix Defence Systems for future shipbuilding requirements. I think there may have been a little misreporting in that. Of course, all of us, sadly, are aware that the ANZAC frigate project will eventually come to an end, and that has been scheduled over time. We are aware that by the middle of this decade that project will be finished, but we are hopeful that ongoing projects will be committed to and that there will be a long-term viable future for the dockyards in Williamstown in my electorate. If future work commitments are not made to these areas, the impact on jobs really will be quite significant. I have some estimations from the Tenix group themselves, who employ 1,300 people directly. In Victoria, you will be staggered to know, the Tenix group employs 13,809 people-the figures are here-directly and indirectly. A large amount of work has been done on that. The Australian Industry Group did some research using the ANZAC frigate project to study the flow-on impact for employment if you do commit to such a large project. Obviously, the effect is not just on the direct employees; it is on all the contractors and support personnel that are associated with it. That impact cannot be underestimated. There are some interesting figures as well about the tax revenue generated by building these frigates within Australia. I think we do not take that into account when we look at the cost of committing to major construction projects in Australia. We also do not take account of the fact that, if we have close to 2,000 people out of employment and who are looking for 24164 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 alternative employment, that also creates a cost for the Commonwealth. So it seems to me that we need to be much more proactive in how we support our industry. That does not necessarily mean that we should be looking at protection. The government can play a role in trying to assist our Australian shipbuilders to get contracts overseas. I understand that in the past years there have been a number of overseas projects for which providers such as Tenix have been amongst the leading two or three bidders, particularly patrol boat type projects, and the government has pretty much refused to play an active role in promoting our industry overseas. That is obviously something that we really must take seriously. The government does have a role to play in promoting our industries, in advertising the strengths that we have and in encouraging overseas governments to be aware of the skills and services that we can provide. It does not mean that we have to pay for protection within industry. There is some cost in that promotion but it seems to me that the Australian public can expect the government to play a role in championing our leading industries in this way. In the white paper, at page 104, paragraphs 9.28 to 9.30, there is some discussion of the importance of the initiatives that the government says ‘will help naval shipbuilders retain their physical infrastructure and some of their existing work force skills’. This seems to me to be glossing over the key issue. We would not know from this statement that we are talking about actually retaining people with those skills, and retaining them in positions where they can use, maintain and develop those skills. The skills cannot be held somewhere outside the people who own them, who have obtained and developed them. It is very important for us to take seriously the need to plan for those staff to stay in some appropriate employment lest we lose them overseas-to our competitors in America, Germany and elsewhere. There is a need for more than a 10-year plan; we need to look at how this will have an impact on industry. The government also claims that it is committed to the engineering and design capabilities that we currently have in Australia. Tenix Defence Systems, which I use as an example because they are the ones in my electorate and I am probably most familiar with them, employ a lot of their staff in surveillance and imagery, intelligence systems, and we have some of the leading technology in the world. Whilst it is good to recognise that and to have the government say that it is committed to valuing them, it does not seem to me that it takes the next step: to ensure that we are actually going to build upon that. The government, in a number of places in the defence white paper, alludes to the fact that in the new year it is going to announce-as it has now done, last week-its innovation action plan, and it says there will be a number of initiatives to assist the defence industry and the DSTO in this area. Try as I may to go through the extremely impressive, glossy and seemingly detailed innovation action plan, I cannot find a reference anywhere in it to defence industry. I cannot even find any reference that would necessarily apply to an organisation like Tenix. There are a number of initiatives in research and development; however, they are for new, start-up companies, for new industries and for new technology. They are not for any of our existing cutting edge industries. Innovation does hold a lot of appeal; it is something we should encourage. I would not like the parliament to think I was saying that we should not support innovation in new areas. But at the same time we should be building on our strengths. YetI am afraid that there is nothing in the innovation action plan that appears to be doing that. We even have specific little flyers in the innovation action plan about how-using our migration program-we will entice people who have specific IT, engineering and design skills from other countries. But we say nothing of how we might keep those whom we already have here employed in vital industries of significance to the country in the future. I am critical of the fact that the defence white paper holds out the innovation action plan as providing some solace to defence industry, when it does not. We have world-class centres of excellence being promoted in information and communications technology and in Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24165 biotechnology, but we do not have them in our defence surveillance areas. They are not even available, it seems to me from the descriptions that the government has already put forward, to a company that uses technology but in a defence industry. If it is an existing business, it seems, it will get knocked out on every front. I am hopeful that my interpretation of the information that we have from the innovation action plan is wrong and that perhaps there is some scope in the future for companies such as Tenix to use some of these new initiatives to obtain some support for its development and its existing businesses. I will certainly be making representations in the hope that that will have some impact on the way the innovation action plan is applied. In respect of technology and public consultation, the defence white paper clearly states that there is value in keeping alive in Australia the knowledge, skills and technology that have been generated from Australia’s defence industries. But it seems to me that there is a risk that they will go unless we do something more active. I have referred to the report of a study that the Australian Industry Group undertook. That report estimates that 20 per cent of the businesses involved in the ANZAC ship project obtained new technologies as a result of the project. So the flow-on in terms of skills, jobs and developing technology is quite dramatic. It is something that we really must pay more attention to. While I am disappointed that the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory will be moving from my electorate of Gellibrand in the next few years, the role of DSTO is very significant, and many of the staff and personnel will transfer to Fishermens Bend. Although they are worthy of a specific chapter in the defence white paper, there is nothing in the innovation action plan that allows DSTO to take proper advantage of some of these new initiatives. I am hopeful that the government will see fit to amend some of the guidelines to ensure that our very skilled people employed in the defence area are encouraged to continue to work in Australia and make the most of the innovation action plan initiatives. the Defence 2000: our future Defence Force white paper, which was presented to the parliament by my close friend the honourable John Moore, the former member for Ryan-the electorate next to mine-who was my colleague for a number of years. I think the white paper will stand as testimony to John Moore’s great abilities as an administrator of important issues and important portfolios during his time in parliament and to his understanding of key aspirations in our community. The white paper was prepared by a consultation team that went into the community to seek their aspirations and record them accurately. And what a consultation team it was, comprising the honourable Andrew Peacock AC as chair and another friend, former colleague and in fact employer, Dr David MacGibbon. He is a former Queensland senator of long standing and a tremendous advocate of the need for proper defence facilities in Australia. I am sure that David MacGibbon feels very pleased about being associated with a report that pulls all of these vital elements together and illustrates clearly a future direction for defence. A former Labor senator, Stephen Loosley, was also on that team. Community consultation is very important in these sorts of processes. One of the things that came out of that process-it has been very obvious to me and, prior to the 1996 election and since becoming the member for Moreton, I have advocated that this suggestion become a reality-was the proposal to give cadets some of the standing and purpose that they deserve in the defence vote. One of the key tasks that John Moore undertook when he became defence minister-aided especially well by his parliamentary secretary, Eric Abetz, who has now been appointed Special Minister of State-was to have cadets drawn out and specifically allocated funds as a line item in the Defence Force budget so that the Defence Force could give cadets not just what was left over but specific resources.",133,Representatives Main Committee
333,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (10.40 A.m.),"I am very pleased to associate myself with24166 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 The white paper points out that 25,000 cadets in 417 units are established in communities throughout Australia. Page 73 of the report quite rightly points to a tangible link between the ADF and the Australian community at large. The cadet system, in reality, is very patchy. In my electorate the cadets rely heavily upon the good deeds of and donations from YerongaDutton Park RSL or Sunnybank RSL-$100 here or $300 there-to help them meet costs. The 12th division cadet unit, which operates across the southern suburbs of Brisbane, is split into three separate groups. If it were at full strength, it would have 150 cadets plus staff. At present there are 120 cadets plus nine staff. There are three separate units in three separate areas and they come together only on weekends. One of those units is located at Nyanda State High School in my electorate, and it is coming under pressure from one man opposite the school who complains about the noise that the cadets make over a couple of hours each week as they meet and practice marching, parading and other such things. Mr Deputy Speaker, like most members in this place, you will appreciate how vital the cadets are as a signal to young people. As the report says, ADF cadets have been a valued and strongly supported commodity within the Australian community. I am very pleased to be part of a government that realises the importance of cadets by allocating $30 million by 2002 specifically for cadet purposes and providing them with a direct capital injection. That is certainly very necessary. The 1999 ADF census showed that 22 per cent of full-time ADF personnel and 25 per cent of reservists were once cadets. The cadet system is worth supporting when one considers the amount of money that is spent on advertising to get people to join the armed forces. Cadets constitute roughly one in four of our Defence Force personnel and are a worthwhile investment from a recruitment point of view-not to mention the personal discipline and responsibility that inspires young people to join the cadets. I think of 1st Flight, which meets at Macgregor State High School but has been shuffled from one room to another. Its armoury is being moved here to there; its meeting places have been moved from here to there. I am left feeling very disenchanted with the approach of the Queensland government, and particularly its education department officials, who basically see cadets as a warmongering facility instead of a great operation for young people. The old leftie style approach to the cadets which seems to pervade the Queensland government is something which I think would be condemned by everybody. The cadets part of the white paper is, to my mind, a fulfilment of a policy that I was very proud to espouse prior to my election to this place in 1996. I am frustrated that it took a white paper and a defence minister having to assert his complete control over a department to bring about this kind of development and to beat back the very defensive attitude to change that the Department of Defence had. One of the other matters I want to raise in connection with the Department of Defence and matters contained within this report is the disposal of defence department properties. I believe fully that there needs to be a change to the Defence Act to force defence department officials to consult far more widely than they currently do when they are disposing of properties. Essentially, what happens now is that the Department of Defence is obliged to consult with the community only when something with a heritage value listing is involved. In my electorate, when the long established, heritage listed property of the old 1st Military Hospital base at Yeronga was disposed of a few years ago, Defence went into overdrive as far as consultation was concerned and a fine process of public consultation brought about a pretty good result on the site. But when you contrast that with what is happening with the disposal of the former Annerley Army Reserve depot, in Dudley Street East, you are left scratching your head in wonder. Defence is not consulting widely. Rather, it is doing all it can to avail itself of the sale of the property and is disputing claims of any heritage value associated with the site. When I first raised this issue with my local community, I believed the consultation process that had been undertaken at Yeronga would have occurred with the sale of the Annerley site, Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24167 but it has not. I am left very disappointed by what has occurred. But the Defence bureaucracy is simply administering the act-an act which desperately needs a change. I pay tribute to the members of the Supporters Protecting Annerley’s Culture and Environment, SPACE, a group which grew out of concern that the disposal of this site in Dudley Street East was the last straw. The suburb of Annerley has had a noble history. It is quite inner-city, in Brisbane, but it has been under huge pressure over the past decade by a city council in Brisbane which has set about intensifying the density of housing in the area, essentially loading more and more people into less and less space. People are fed up with clogged streets and with other facilities being under pressure from having too many people in too small a space. This group said, ‘We do not want high density housing on this army site. We want to keep it. We want to save it.’ That is a view that I support wholeheartedly, as I have said on the public record on many occasions, including just the other week before a Senate hearing in Brisbane on this matter. But when the Lord Mayor of Brisbane appeared before that committee he basically let down the local community. Prior to the Brisbane City Council election last year the council had been working very hard to continue to intensify the housing density approach on the town plan on this particular site thus leaving Defence no other alternative when they sold the site but to seek its sale to some housing development proposal. I felt the Lord Mayor had a great opportunity at the most recent Senate hearings to put the case for what the local community wants. The local community would like to see the site preserved as a defence establishment while bringing together a number of the strands contained within the white paper for the proper commemoration and remembrance of defence history in Brisbane and also defence future in Brisbane, namely the cadets. This is a matter I intend to talk about with the new parliamentary secretary for defence, our friend and colleague the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, in about 40 minutes. I have an appointment to see him this morning and I want to raise this matter directly with him. I would like to tell the House what SPACE’s proposal is. It brings together a number of groups in our community who are desperately looking for space of their own to do things in. It wants to bring in the Victoria Barracks Historical Society, a group which has had a long association with the Annerley site and believes a great deal in its value as far as cultural and social history is concerned. A constituent of mine, Leo Walsh, has spoken to me about a proposed Queensland military memorial museum and that four other groups would come to a museum on this Annerley site. It is envisaged that the museum would become a tourist and education attraction in combination with re-enactment groups and that there would be a gun park on the site. A number of guns would be located there-I am talking big guns, cannons. The Living History Federation is a group with 19 groups within it. It covers a wide variety of military history. It needs space for training facilities. It receives no government funding. It plays at festivals and medieval tournaments. Any earnings are donated to charity. The old drill hall on the site at Annerley is tailor made to suit the group’s needs. Open days and fairs onsite would also be possible. As I have just told the committee, the 12th Division at full strength would have 150 cadets but currently it has 120 and is operating across three different sites and there are problems associated with each of them. There is a need for unity of those three groups. The Annerley site would allow for the amalgamation of those three groups and for a great sense of purpose to develop from there. This site has a parade ground. It has storage facilities. It has an old drill hall where generations of soldiers have come and gone over the years and until a few years ago called the place their home. This is a site that has a very fond connection with the Department of Defence. The Department of Defence tends to be a very good neighbour indeed, and the local community 24168 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 would much rather see the site continue in that particular vein. So they are heartened by the $30 million commitment from the Howard government to cadets. They are heartened by what is contained within the defence white paper. The community group understands that the Department of Defence does not want to have to take money away from its true purpose in order to maintain old buildings and the community is looking for ways to form some sort of community trust to take over the site from the Department of Defence. Frankly, if this site is costing Defence $20,000 a year to maintain-20,000 negative dollars if you like-a $1 a year rent to the Department of Defence means that the Department of Defence is $20,000 and $1 in front on its current position. In other words, if the local community are prepared to take over this site, maintain it in proper repair, ensure that all of these different groups can come in there and grow it into something that gives some benefit to the local community, then we have got the best result. We have got the local community feeling that the Department of Defence is keeping something of value in their local community. We have also the potential for young people and other generations to come to understand a little bit about our history, to understand that the muster which came from Warwick in the First World War and marched through my electorate into the City of Brisbane to go and fight at Gallipoli and other places camped in the area around this site. This sort of history should be preserved and also passed on to other generations. I believe that, all round, the community proposal is one that should be looked at. I believe that there needs to be flexibility brought into the process of disposing of defence properties, that the Defence Act needs to be changed, that consultation with the community needs to be a reasonable demand met by the Department of Defence and that it should not just simply be established heritage value with a site that triggers such consultation. The regard that the community has for the Department of Defence should not be completely lost by the wholesale disposal of property. This property could turn out to be a windfall to the government. As a responsible member of the government parties, I would be happy to see proper allocation of funds that came from that windfall used to the benefit of the broad community. But it seems to me that there is a growing concern about the loss of our cultural and social history associated with defence facilities that should not be traded off just for a dollar today. We should not turn our backs on those who have passed through the doors of the drill hall at Annerley, those who have marched and paraded on the grounds at Annerley. We should not turn our backs on their memories. We should have regard for them and consider what could be, for today and tomorrow. This defence white paper, to my mind, opens the door to those possibilities. I welcome what Minister Moore did. I welcome this white paper. I commend it to the House. overdue white paper on defence. I support comments made by the opposition leader, the Hon. Kim Beazley, in the House yesterday that this white paper follows closely a pattern established in defence white papers when he himself was Minister for Defence. I make no bones about: defence is a very important industry to the electorate of Paterson. The RAAF base at Williamtown is one of the biggest and most important in Australia and hopefully it will get bigger. It is a vital part of the Hunter’s economy. I believe that Headquarters Australian Theatre should be established there and I urge the government to make an early announcement to that effect. I welcome the news that the early warning aircraft will come to Williamtown but I am critical that this is a watered-down version of a program that promised so much yet will not deliver the full promise. When we consider the Prime Minister’s innovation statement of last week and we look at the proposal of the AWACS, we see that this is a government that says one thing and practises another. In my opinion, the strength of the original AWACS proposal was that Australian",139,Representatives Main Committee
334,Mr Horne (Paterson) (10.55 A.m.),"I rise to welcome the long awaited and certainlyWednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24169 service people and Australian industry would be involved in developing new technology. Australian industry has as a strength that it has always displayed a flair for this sort of thing, an ability to think outside the square and an ability to develop new techniques. The watereddown program that has been announced in this white paper probably means that we will be doing less developmental work in Australia. We will be purchasing aircraft in a fitted out form and it will simply be maintenance work that will be done in Australia. That is a lost opportunity. I would also like to mention the patrol boats that have been identified in this white paper. Once again we can identify the stop-go policies of the Howard government. I would remind members that in the Hunter region over the past five years minehunters have been constructed for the Royal Australian Navy by Australian Defence Industries. Just one year ago on a study tour in Italy, I visited the headquarters, the place where these vessels were designed, the parent company, in La Spezia in Italy, Intermarine. As I toured their plant and looked at what they were doing there, the management of Intermarine strongly supported the opinion that the ADI plant in Newcastle was the best in the world, producing the best product and having the best technically trained staff in the world. I advise members that this was a purpose-built facility with a specially trained staff, and now we find that with the last hull completed and being fitted out this specialist team is being disbanded because of lack of work and that plant is being mothballed. A quick decision on the patrol boats would not only give this high-tech and specialist industry the opportunity to survive but I believe it would also be of economic benefit to the defence forces. Surely an established industry with plant and staff in place could be more competitive than a contractor that has to develop a new site and a new work force. The Hunter has the potential to become a centre of excellence in defence industries. I call on the government to recognise this and reward our community with some positive decisions. Production figures at the British Aerospace plant show that Australian craftsmen are producing a better product with the Hawk lead-in fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force, and they are also doing it quicker. This backs up my earlier comments about Australian ingenuity. I would like to take this opportunity to raise another issue that is really not addressed in this white paper: the effect of Air Force operations on the surrounding community. Already, I have identified a number of areas where RAAF Williamtown is expanding and has the potential to expand. With major investments there, by both the former and the current government, the importance of RAAF Williamtown to both the Hunter economy and the defence forces of Australia is expanding. It is important that the integrity of the future of this base be put beyond doubt. Yet what do we find? We find that there are pockets of opposition to this RAAF base because some areas and a number of people are adversely affected by operations. I am talking about the people who live in Steele Street: over the main Nelson Bay road from the runway of the RAAF base, but only a few hundred metres from the end of the runway. Every day there are hundreds of aircraft movements directly over their roofs. We are talking about families who are trying to rear young children; we are talking about elderly people. I believe it is important that Defence enter into negotiations with those people to acquire those properties because it will indicate that Defence is concerned about maintaining that base and that those properties are not going to get any cheaper. The other thing is the Salt Ash weapons range that was established in the forties. It continues to be in operation and continues to be a bone of contention with a lot of people. A couple of hundred families are affected by the continual noise of the aircraft gunnery operations and the low flying aircraft and the very high-powered aircraft that are accelerating at specific places in their operation-they come in low, fire their weapons and then accelerate as they climb away from the weapons range. If any of you have not been close to a couple of 24170 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 FA18s-and they seem to operate in pairs-with their afterburners on, I can assure you that you need your hands over your ears. It is very important that any families which are adversely affected be given the opportunity to negotiate with Defence. A committee has been established by the Mayor of Port Stephens, Councillor Steve Busteed-and I believe that Councillor Busteed should be complimented on this. The committee is made up of members of the council, members of the Defence Force and members of the community. They sit at regular intervals, look at complaints and then decide on a course of action. I believe it would be wise for Defence to continue expanding the role of that committee so they could go out and identify whether there is a genuine grievance, and they could make a recommendation as to whether or not the acquisition of that particular property should be included in defence activities. I believe that this will remove a genuine objection to RAAF operations in the area, and that it will guarantee that the future of RAAF Williamtown is secure and that this industry, which is vital to our area, is ongoing. As I have indicated, we welcome the white paper. It is long overdue. It does set out the future of defence in Australia. I would also like to point out that one of the greatest things that was done for the defence industry in Australia was in the early days of the Hawke Labor government when a definite decision was made that defence industries be established and expanded in Australia. Defence, as an industry, is one of the high budgetary items. It makes a lot of sense that defence industries should be onshore. I know that the new minister got up in the House yesterday and was critical of the submarines. Personally, I am very proud of the fact, and I am sure that members opposite are also proud of the fact, that Australia is capable of building submarines. There is no guarantee that we could have gone overseas and purchased submarines, brought them back here and found them trouble free. None at all. The point is that we have developed the technology. We have built them; there were problems with them but, because of Australian industry and ingenuity, we have overcome those problems and there is no doubt that the Collins class submarines are now a world-class item. There is also no doubt that the frigates that we are building at Williamtown-and I am pleased to say that many of the components of those frigates were constructed in the Hunter region-are also world-class. There is no doubt that the Lead In Fighter aircraft that is currently being constructed at RAAF Base Williamtown in the electorate of Paterson is world-class and that those craftsmen are doing it better and quicker than anywhere else in the world where that plane is being built. There is no doubt that the minehunters that have been constructed in the Newcastle region over the past five years are also a world-class vessel. The skills of the tradesmen again put a stamp of authority on the fact that our tradesman are very capable and can produce a world-class vessel. These are the strengths that our defence industry must grow on. I believe we should not get into that frame of mind where we, as a nation, feel inferior and that regularly our defence minister has to go overseas with a big chequebook and an open order to purchase defence items. I believe it is vital for our country that we use our own ingenuity, personnel and specific needs to design and build the weaponry that we need for our own defence. I also believe that that opens an opportunity for major exports for us. If we develop a name for quality items of defence, a market for the sorts of things we can produce will develop in the expanding southern Pacific area, and I believe we can produce them very competitively. I welcome the white paper. I sincerely hope that the decisions on a number of things are made quickly, such as Headquarters Australian Theatre to be established at RAAF Base Williamtown, and that Australian industry is given the opportunity to get on with the construction of the patrol boats identified in this paper as quickly as possible because, while various ministers can stand up and boast about unemployment, I can assure them that in one of the greatest industrial areas in Australia-that is, the Hunter-unemployment is still Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24171 unacceptably high. The shame of it is that, at the same time, we are seeing the decline and the winding back of the minehunter industry. People are being laid off and a very important and successful team of people are being disbanded simply because the decision to allow this industry to continue to flourish has not been made. If the money is there, if the determination is there, this government needs to make the decisions quickly so that we can get on with the job. I hope that is what the white paper says. I hope that is what the government does. (Time expired) 2000: Our Future Defence Force, outlines Australia’s need to invest in a capable and deployable Defence Force that has the resources to effectively protect our nation in air, sea and land combat. By increasing spending to the defence forces, we create the opportunity to upgrade our land, air and naval forces to keep pace with evolving technologies and capabilities. We also possess the opportunity to foster the skills of our defence personnel; they are our national asset. The Defence Force is very important to my electorate of Riverina and, in particular, to Wagga Wagga, as we play host to the Kapooka Army Recruit Training Centre and RAAF Base Forest Hill, both of which are centres of training excellence. The Army Recruit Training Centre, known within the Army as the ‘Home of the Soldier’, is located at Blamey Barracks, Kapooka, and is under the command of Colonel Mike Crane. The barracks were named after one of Australia’s most distinguished soldiers and the only Australian ever to hold the rank of field marshal, Sir Thomas Blamey. Blamey was born in Wagga Wagga on 24 January 1884 and commenced his military career there when he was appointed second in command of the school cadet unit at Newton Public School, which is now called South Wagga Public School, where he was a teacher. The land was originally acquired in 1942 to establish an army engineer training camp. In 1947, the camp was handed over to the Department of Immigration and used as a migrant centre until November 1951, when 1RTB, the 1st Recruit Training Battalion, was raised. The barracks were initially created to cater for the reintroduction of national service and Australia’s involvement with the Vietnam War. During national service, four intakes were received each year at 1RTB, as well as continuing intakes of Regular Army recruits. Since the abolition of national service in 1972, 1RTB has been the sole recruit training battalion in the Australian Army. In 1985, it became responsible for the training of female recruits, whose training previously was conducted at Georges Heights in Sydney. In 1993, 1RTB took on the additional responsibility for training all Ready Reserve recruits and for the conduct of the occasional two-week General Reserve recruit course. In 1997, recruit training underwent a dramatic change resulting in the implementation of the current 45-day common induction training, which sees full-time and part-time recruits undertaking training together and, consequently, graduating with the same military skills, qualities and knowledge. On1 December 1998, 1RTB changed to an individual training centre and its name was changed to the Army Recruit Training Centre. Kapooka is home to the soldiers chapel of the Australian Army. This chapel belongs to all soldiers-past, present and future. For this reason, it has been located at Wagga Wagga, Kapooka-‘Home of the Soldier’. The chapel consists of three separate sections-the Catholic chapel, the Anglican chapel and the Protestant denomination. The design of the chapel is based on a white dove in flight. The white dove generally symbolises peace and for Christians it also represents the presence of the Holy Spirit. The right wing of the dove is the Catholic section of the chapel, the left wing is the Anglican section and the body and the tail are the Protestant denomination sections of the chapel. The neck and head of the dove face the valley.",142,Representatives Main Committee
335,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (11.10 A.m.),"The government’s defence white paper, Defence24172 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 The chapel was opened on 1 October 1993 and it cost $1.8 million to build, of which $1.2 million was obtained from Defence Force members through public appeals and donations. This cost accounted for materials and fittings only, as it was built by Army engineers, mainly from 21 Construction Squadron. The glass doors of the chapel have been reserved for the embossing of the insignia of the various corps of the Army. In front of the soldiers chapel is the memorial wall. This wall is designed to carry bronze plaques for units, corps and associations of the Army in memory of soldiers who have served in the armed forces, and especially those who have made the supreme sacrifice. At the entrance to the chapel you will see the upturned rifle. This symbolises a soldier who has fallen in battle, either wounded or dead, and who needs help. It is embedded into a piece of rock that was brought back from Gallipoli after the 75th anniversary of events there. Other features distinguishing the chapel are: the angular ceilings representing the draped canvas of tentage used by soldiers in the field; the wooden cross made of dark Australian wood and light New Zealand wood representing the ANZACs; the wooden altar made of timber taken from planks used on the Bailey bridges, being a double symbol representing both the engineers and the altar bridging God and us; and the large stained-glass windows made by two resident padres who, to save costs, did a window making course and then trained 40 volunteers from Wagga Wagga over 12 months. After more than 5,000 hours of work, they constructed the windows for about $30,000 instead of around $250,000. The Army Recruit Training Centre has been served by a full-time military band since 1952. The Australian Army Band Kapooka, led by Major Patrick Pickett, has a presence in the region that adds significantly to the entertainment, educational and cultural life of the Riverina and surrounding districts. In addition to their military and ceremonial roles, the band members formed several highly skilled ensembles, including a concert band, a big band, a Dixie band, a brass choir, woodwind and brass quintets, and vocal ensembles. Countless charities have benefited substantially from the band’s concert programs, both directly and indirectly, with tens of thousands of dollars being raised with their assistance. Over 100 engagements are performed annually for the civilian population, ensuring the survival of valuable charity programs that service our communities. In off-duty hours, several members of the band and their families volunteer their time and services to assisting the development of regional musical and social organisations. By promoting local talent and through participation in the work experience program, a large variety of artists are offered the opportunity to gain valuable experience and the exposure necessary for success in the entertainment industry. On the day that I was sworn in as the member for Riverina, I was overwhelmed when, on entering the Members Hall on the way into the Senate, I was greeted with a fanfare from the Australian Army Band Kapooka. I cannot explain the pride that I felt that day on seeing my very own band. It was also a proud day for me when the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs chose the Australian Army Band Kapooka to travel to Borneo with him. The band serves as a fine example of the many contributions that the defence forces make to the electorate of Riverina. RAAF Base Wagga Wagga has been a training base since 1940 and is currently under the leadership of Wing Commander Ron Hodges and Wing Commander Rob Scrivener. The two main training units at RAAF Wagga Wagga are the RAAF School of Technical Training and the RAAF School of Management and Training Technology. The RAAF School of Technical Training provides basic training for cadets. It takes on an average of 435 students and is substantially supported by civilian instructors of TAFE New South Wales. Having the training contract for RAAF Base Forest Hill largely underpins the Riverina TAFE’s activities right across the electorates of Riverina, Hume and Farrer. The School of Management and Training Technology provides train-the-trainer courses and is responsible for teams of management and training consultants located RAAF-wide. These are both part of a larger organisation called Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24173 Ground Training Wing, the headquarters for which was formed at RAAF Wagga Wagga in January 1999. The airmen leadership flight unit maintains an average of 62 students and is responsible for providing promotional courses designed to produce airmen and airwomen with leadership and management skills. The RAAF base meets the government’s aspirations by providing employment opportunities to civilians as well as defence personnel through employing local contractors. The defence forces in Wagga Wagga are an essential and integrated part of the communityso much so that the RAAF Base Wagga Wagga was granted freedom of the city of Wagga Wagga in 1961, while Kapooka was granted the honour in 1962. Both the RAAF base and Kapooka have a major impact on the economy of my electorate. As they are both located in Wagga Wagga, this is where the majority of the benefits are felt. I am proud of the substantial contribution the armed forces in the Riverina have made to the security of Australia in the past and of their added responsibilities that will spread out into the future. A project of interest has been initiated by Jack Mullins and Lee Wright and students of Wagga Wagga High School. These people have devoted many thousands of hours compiling a CD-ROM of the memories and history of our returned soldiers and their families. This project is vital in documenting the past before it is lost through our veterans passing away. This CDROM is a fabulous walking, talking history. It has brought together the old and the young to ensure that as a people Australians have never and should never take their freedom for granted. This government believes that Australia’s armed forces play a vital and pivotal role in our overall strategic and foreign policy. It is incumbent on us to ensure that we have forces to protect us. I am proud to have a major part of this strategic strength housed in Wagga Wagga in the Riverina electorate and I look forward to the increasing role that our bases will play into the future. I commend the government’s initiative in this defence white paper. I commend the government’s initiative in this significant defence expenditure and I look forward to the Riverina being able to inject into Australia the very strong assets that it has in the past and that it will continue to inject in the future through our defence forces. the white paper, particularly with you in the chair because we all know of your great interest in defence matters. I understand you chair a coalition backbench committee, so it is an added pleasure to make a contribution. I had better be on my toes in what I say. There is nothing worse than listening to whining opposition members that want to take a point to make a small point. I certainly will try to avoid splitting hairs as I do not have too many. I think there are some good things in this white paper. I do not know that I can be as enthusiastic as Professor Dibb has been in welcoming the white paper. Firstly, let me make the point that the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade brought down a very significant report into the Army. One of the things we were waiting for was the white paper so that we could see what the strategic guidance in the white paper would be. That was not to be, so we had to pick our own strategic guidance. In that report we indicated that Australia, in a significant departure particularly clarifying the role of the Army, had to be prepared to be involved in a brigade level operation as well as one battalion level operation. Of course there is nothing in the white paper that acknowledges that contribution by the committee. But, whilst this was a sensible decision by the government, a decision I strongly endorse and support, I think there ought to be a little bit of credit go to the committee for being the first to put it in the public record. A lot of my remarks about the white paper are going to be oriented towards Army. I actually think that of the three services this is the area in need of greatest reform.",145,Representatives Main Committee
336,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.22 A.m.),"Madam Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on24174 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 I have noted some of the contributions by coalition members, so I suppose I should lead off with some of the nasties. There are two significant black holes in this white paper. I do not think there is any member of parliament that has not welcomed the additional money being spent on defence. I say that unreservedly. However, we also need to put it in perspective: at the end of 10 years, we are actually going to be no better off than we were at the beginning. So although there is significant expenditure over the 10 years, if it is adhered to by successive governments, we still will not solve all the problems. What are the two black holes to which I refer? Firstly, there is a nasty one involving Army. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, supplementation is provided to Defence for our troops in East Timor-as there should be; there is no argument about that. I understand that the Secretary to the Department of Defence, on a radio program, indicated that 50 per cent of that supplementation has gone to force generation in Australia. In round figures, $500 millionmore precisely, probably about $470-odd million-has gone to force generation. Why is this a black hole? What is unclear, now that the white paper is out and the six battalions are a matter of policy, is when the force generation expenditure will need to be met by Army. Will the current situation continue? That is, once troops are finally out of East Timor, the supplementation will finish and Army will have to pick up that force generation cost from whenever that point may be; hopefully, it will be very quickly. Or is it already the case that, because the white paper is out, and it is government policy, they are meeting that particular cost of about $500 million in round figures? What is the second black hole? It is clear in the white paper that there are quite a number of initiatives that the government proposes to take on the personnel front. Again, I do not think this is an issue of partisanship or political bickering. But what is disturbing is that there is a two per cent differential. In other words, what is proposed in the white paper is two per cent below the increase in average personnel costs over the last 10 years. So here we have a government that is outlining a number of initiatives that it wishes to take, with the support of the parliament as a whole, but in the white paper it proposes to provide two per cent less money than the historical 10-year average. I wish it were otherwise, but I cannot see how the government is going to be able to meet this ambitious target in the white paper. So those are the two black holes. Let me turn to Army. We know that the reserves are going to be rerolled and retasked. Firstly, we know that, through exercise Tandem Thrust, the 11th Brigade in Townsville has been rerolled, and the extra training, with no additional investment, is going to be tested in Tandem Thrust. I hope I am not divulging highly confidential Defence Subcommittee business; but, in fact, we discussed this matter last night. Secondly, we know that there was a reserve conference in Canberra late last year but we do not know what came of it. I think the government is buying a huge argument with its reserves. We know from the report From phantom to force that there is a huge hollow in the reserves as well as in the regulars. There is inadequate provision of equipment. If we wanted to fully equip the reserves today, the Treasurer would have to write a cheque for a lazy $4 billion. In the From phantom to force report we said that we needed four brigade-type units with an ability to cascade within two years to an additional eight units, making a total of 12. When we bring down the follow-up to that report, we might be tempted to blow out the three-year period and reduce the number of brigades that we suggest should be cascaded. This means-and I am indebted to Major General Warren Glenny for organising a meeting with the Defence Reserves Association in January this year-that we are going to cut reserve numbers significantly. But the point is that the reserve that we will be left with is a real reserve. We are cutting through a lot of the political crap-if I may put it that crudely. The Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24175 reserves will be fully equipped-not half equipped with antique equipment-fully trained and deployed in formed units. The government has demonstrated the utility of the reserves through what I call slot theory: using reservists to slot into regular positions. By and large, they have done very well; I am an admirer of the reservists. However, the reservists have a passion-which is, I think, understandable-to be deployed in formed units. Neither the former Minister for Defence nor his junior signed up to deploying reserves in formed units and, unless that is done, I think the government will buy into a huge political argument. The library research section has demonstrated that, if we are looking at block obsolescence and the opportunities to move around that over the next 20 years, we have a window of opportunity of about five to six years to reform our Army and see whether they are capable of doing the things that we want them to do. If we do not take up this opportunity now and over the next several years, we will be postponing reform of the Army until the end of 2020. I think it is dishonest for a government not to be open, particularly on defence matters. What is the reserves’ new role? In Townsville we were told, ‘Well, they’re going to be second-class citizens. They’re not going to be able to do all the things that a regular soldier will be required to do-in fact, we won’t train them to the level of a regular.’ We should debate this point because there are some pros and cons. However, if that is the case-and I appeal to my coalition colleagues opposite-the government is reversing policy for the first time. There has been a lot of movement-and we can be critical of both sides-towards saying that there should be one Army. This is the first time that we will say officially that reservists are second-class citizens and that, in this protection role, they will not be able to fulfil all the requirements that we would expect of regular Army personnel. It is a big call: you are heading down the track of being tested in Tandem Thrust and, when the reserves find out, I think there will be a bit of a revolt. I want to say just a couple more things. The days of talking about a technological edge for our ADF are rapidly dwindling. I have said that a technological edge is like a boxer’s glove: it is not the glamour of the glove that counts, but the punch that you pack. What we should be aiming at with our services is not to consider them individually. If there is an edge that we require in the future for our defence forces, it is a capability edge. It is the way in which our three services manoeuvre and operate together. A lot has been done in terms of joint operations, as I would happily acknowledge, but we have a long way to go before we have our three services operating the way we would want, giving us a significant capability punch in our region. To be a little bit political, for which I apologise: I noticed that a couple of the coalition contributions, in particular the one by my friend the member for Indi, referred to the lethal force that the submarines are going to provide. It is good to see that the coalition, instead of demonising the submarines, is now starting to recognise their capability. After all, in exercises one of our unmodified submarines took out an American aircraft carrier. You can just imagine how the Americans love 5,000 to 6,000 people being taken out by a ‘dud sub’. These are far from dud subs. I agree with the honourable member for Indi that they are going to give us lethal force and force projection. There is a lot more that I would have liked to contribute in this debate. I thank the Leader of the House for allowing at least some of the backbench members who have an interest in defence to make a contribution on this important white paper.

To be able to provide an efficient and well-resourced defence force is one of the",147,Representatives Main Committee
337,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (11.37 A.m.),"I am very pleased to be able to associate myself24176 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 basic principles of a strong, civilised country such as Australia. It is not inexpensive. It costs a huge amount of money. BeforeI go into the details of what the government is planning for defence, it is important to remember that none of this would have been possible if this coalition government had not taken the very difficult steps to address the financial position that this country was in when we took government in 1996. It is very easy for people to forget the position that this country was in, with an $11 billion deficit that the Labor Party said did not exist before the 1996 election. Labor Party members certainly want the Australian community to forget that sort of thing but, if we had not addressed that deficit and put our economy in shape, it would not have been possible to have money available-as we have now-to put into our defence forces. That is one of the major initiatives that this coalition government has undertaken and one of the greatest initiatives for our defence forces that this country has seen for many decades. One of the key planks of the white paper is an increase in defence funding of an average of three per cent per annum in real terms over the coming decade, with an immediate increase of $500 million in 2001-02 and $1,000 million in the following year. These are quite mindboggling amounts of money. In all, the defence spending over the next decade is expected to increase by a total of $23.5 billion in real terms-a very significant amount of funding. In fact, it is the biggest increase in funding for defence in over 20 years. The key points of the white paper include the enhancement of land force readiness and sustainability. Firepower logistics and mobility will be improved. The number of battalions held at high readiness will be increased from four to six. There will be two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters and an additional squadron of troop lift helicopters will be purchased. The reserves will play a far more important and challenging role in the direct support of our deployed forces and, given the likelihood of deployment by the ADF, the reserves will become an increasingly important element of force sustainment and a source of additional specialist skills. We will also be maintaining Australia’s air combat capability as the best in the region. We will acquire four AEW&C aircraft, with the option of three more later in the decade. The FA18 upgrade program will continue, and the government has made provision for the acquisition of up to 100 new aircraft to replace the Hornets and possibly the F111s. We will have an enhancement of Australia’s strike capability with the improvements to the F111 electronic warfare self-protection systems. The strengthening of the maritime forces will be very welcome. All six of the now famous Collins class submarines will be brought to a higher level of capability and a new class of at least three air warfare destroyers will replace the FFGs. It is also important that we will maintain our commitment as a government to the knowledge edge-the recruiting and retention of skilled personnel-and to retaining Australia’s alliance architecture with the US as a key strategic asset. One of the important parts of the white paper which I want to speak about in more detail today is the expansion of the cadet units and the cadet scheme, because I believe it is a great initiative and a great thing for the young people of our country. It is something which I think has great support throughout this country. Currently, 25,000 young people are members of 417 units. Certainly, the government wants to create more opportunities for young people to be involved in the cadet units. I was a member of the Army cadets in high school and it certainly did me no harm. I had no career ambitions to go into the armed forces, but what the cadet units taught me was certainly very useful in later life. Teaching people self-discipline, pride in themselves, how to understand a chain of command and how to work within that chain of command are very important matters, no matter what career you go into in later life. Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24177 Cadet units are not just for people who want to have a career in the armed forces. In many areas, such as in my electorate of Robertson, the cadets are the public face of the Defence Force, because we do not have a defence base situated on the Central Coast of New South Wales. At special ceremonies such as those that occur on ANZAC Day, Remembrance Day and at other events on the Central Coast, the armed forces are often represented by our cadet units. On the Central Coast, we have three cadet units-all fine units. We have the TS Hawkesbury, the naval cadet unit, whose commanding officer is Pat Marsh. We have 11 Flight Gosford, the air training corps, whose commanding officer is Neal Rogers. We also have 25 RCU Erina Army cadets, whose commanding officer is Craig Wood. So we manage to cover all the branches of the armed forces. I would like to commend all the cadet units on the Central Coast. They do a magnificent job. The government is looking to put more resources into the cadet units. I know that from time to time they have had difficulties with resources. The publicity at the moment is helping to promote cadets and a lot more young people are looking at cadet units as providing a way of obtaining some skills and an enjoyable time. For many young people, it also gives them an opportunity to have a look at going into the armed forces as a career. As I said earlier, cadets represent 23 per cent of Australians wearing the military uniform. So in people’s eyes they are the visible and public presence of the ADF. Approximately 30 per cent of young people who have been in the cadets for more than two years go on to join the ADF. That is a very high figure. They provide nine per cent of the entrants to the permanent ADF, who remain there for comparatively long periods. The figures show that cadet units are an important training ground and a key area from which the Defence Force can source young people who are already experienced in the basic ideas of what a defence force is about-the chain of command, for instance-and what they are looking for in life. Many of those I have spoken to have said, ‘I really didn’t know whether I wanted a career in the Defence Force; the cadets were almost a form of work experience’. Cadet units allow young people to put their toes in the water and see what the Defence Force and the cadets are about. Many young people have said that they love the idea of that lifestyle and, as I have said, nine per cent of entrants to the Defence Force come from the cadets. There are clear indications that the cadets significantly benefit the community. It is not just a matter of training young people to become members of the Defence Force. Cadets enjoy friendship and derive a sense of pride in themselves-which, unfortunately, is lacking in some young people-a sense of discipline, a sense of achievement and an understanding of the role of command and how to achieve things in life through a process. I think that is very important. As young people, we all have dreams and aspirations. However, in all walks of life-even as a member of parliament-trying to achieve our goals can be very frustrating and we must understand the process through which that can be done. It is the same in the Defence Force and in the cadets: you must understand the chain of command and how you can go forward in life and achieve your goals. That is another significant area. Turning to the white paper, it is great that a substantial amount of money has been spent on and will continue to be injected into our defence forces over the next few years. It is a significant step forward. That news has been very well received by the Australian community. The actions of the ADF in East Timor lifted the morale of Australians and gave them a greater pride in their country. Last year was a wonderful year for this country, with the Olympics and our pride in the achievements of the Defence Force. We went to East Timor not as the region’s policeman but to assist an emerging democratic nation and to do what was right. When I talk to veterans groups many of the older veterans say to me, ‘Australia has changed and I’m not sure about our young people anymore.’ There is often discussion about putting people into the military. Attitudes have changed a lot because of the media: we can see on the television in our lounge rooms, night after night, an Australian soldier in uniform 24178 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 carrying a young East Timorese child, for example, and Australian soldiers working with the people of that region within their community. That is what Australia is all about. That is what these older veterans remember but they have not seen for many years. It shows that today’s generation of young Australians has lost none of the spirit or the larrikinism that Australians are famous for. Even though we have moved on-we are a modern country and a multicultural society-we have not lost the essence of being Australian and believing in and doing what is right. The Defence Force action in East Timor brought that home to Australians, particularly many older Australians who had started to lose faith and to feel that this country was not going forward. It reinforced to them and to all Australians that this is one of the greatest countries on earth. It is a country to which many people from all over the world want to come. That is why we have difficulties with people coming across by boat and claiming refugee status, and many other people trying to come to this country: they know that this is one of the best countries in the world. We have one of the best living standards. In this year of the Centenary of Federation we have a lot to celebrate, in that this country was formed in peace and is one of the few countries in the world to have had a democracy for 100 years without interruption or bloodshed. It reinforces why we have to spend this very significant amount on ensuring that we have a defence force that is capable of not only defending this country if it needs to do so but also playing a role in the Pacific region to ensure that we are a strong and vital force in our community. The world has become a lot smaller and we cannot live in isolation. We cannot just put up barriers around Australia, whether they be physical barriers of defence forces or whether they be tariff barriers. We cannot do that anymore. The world is much more a global world. We have to have an interest in our region. We have to play a leading role in our region, in the defence of our country and also in what is happening in neighbouring countries. It is important that the government now has given the Defence Force the resources it needs, giving it the impetus that the country needs to continue to have a strong and viable defence force. As I said in the earlier part of my speech, none of this would have been possible if the coalition government had not taken this country and its economy and got it back into shape. We would not have the money to spend on defence forces, we would not have the standard of living that is the envy of the world so that we have to defend it, if we had not taken the hard decisions to address the $11 billion deficit, to have changed the direction of this country, to take it forward, to give us a great future. Many people forget that, and we have to remind them of the anger they had when they threw out the Labor government. (Time expired) Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (11.52 a.m.)-I welcome the opportunity today to speak to the motion to take note of the Defence 2000 paper and the accompanying ministerial statement. The Defence 2000 paper offers an analysis of our strategic environment, deals with the size and shape of our Defence Force and addresses equipment and capability issues. I intend to make some comments today about each of these matters. I start by addressing issues of force morale, recruitment and retention. It often seems to me that there is a schism in our national psyche when dealing with defence issues. On the one hand, we venerate our defence forces. Our chests swell with pride when we think of the contributions that our defence forces have made, most recently in East Timor and Bougainville. We even define what it is to be an Australian through the prism of the ANZAC legend at Gallipoli. On the other hand, we struggle to treat our Defence Force personnel properly and nurture them in the way they deserve. My electorate of Lalor is home to two Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24179 Defence Force bases, RAAF Laverton and RAAF Williams at Point Cook. It is also home to a sizeable retired defence community. As a result, my office constantly deals with problems faced by our serving personnel, particularly in relation to the treatment of family matters, the lack of understanding of the impact on families of changes in defence postings and the inadequacy of defence housing. My office also deals with large numbers of veterans who struggle for fair treatment, notwithstanding the fact that they have faithfully served their country. The fact that Australia often does not value its Defence Force personnel in these very practical matters is one of the matters, it seems to me, that is militating against Australia reaching its Defence Force recruitment targets. People in our community understand that message. As we know, the Howard government was happy to slash the number of full-time Defence Force positions by approximately 8,000 as part of its cynical so-called defence reform program. This Defence 2000 white paper marks an inelegant backdown from that position, as the numbers in our defence forces are to be expanded to 54,000. We should note that, like a number of Howard government backdowns, this backdown only delivers a proportion of what was taken away. So having lost 8,000 personnel, 4,000 will be put back. Anyone watching the television over the summer period during the tennis, or any of those other big screen events that we have looked at during the recess, would have been well aware of the Defence Force recruitment campaigns, as they were bombarded at almost every turn, it seemed to me, by Defence Force advertising. But, as our Defence Force is finding, getting recruits and retaining personnel is about more than glossy advertising. In picking and planning a career, people are smart enough to look beyond the packaging and analyse what is in the box. In the week in which every member of our entire Defence Force was stood down in order to be addressed on issues of bastardisation and bullying, we need to face the fact that what is in the box is not enough to attract new recruits and retain personnel. I urge this government and our Defence Force management to make a concerted effort to address the question of conditions and the question of culture within our defence forces. Until we do so, all we are doing is undermining the community imagery of our Defence Force and undermining its ability to recruit and retain. I think some of those questions are very important when we consider issues of morale within our Defence Force. On the question of morale, I would like to turn specifically to an issue of morale in our Air Force. It seems to me that the new Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, has a perfect opportunity to send a clear message to our RAAF that it is valued, that its history is valued, and to bolster morale within the RAAF by announcing at the upcoming Avalon International Airshow that the government intends to save Point Cook. As I said earlier, the RAAF Williams base at Point Cook is in my electorate and is marked for disposition by the Commonwealth. Currently there is no plan or strategy to make sure that the key heritage issues at Point Cook are looked after. In the coming week, the Avalon International Airshow 2001 will be held. Its theme is ‘Celebrating a Nation and its Airforce’ and the publicity for the show tells us that, in 2001, Australia is celebrating the Centenary of Federation, as we all know, and the 80th anniversary of Australia’s Air Force. The Avalon International Airshow is dedicated to commemorating both these events and will be the aviation centrepiece of Australia’s celebrations. But it seems to me a sad irony that, as Australia prepares for this major event, the future of the birthplace of Australia’s Air Force, the Point Cook air base, remains under a very dark cloud. As I have said, the Howard government has determined that Point Cook is to be disposed of by the Commonwealth and it has no real strategy for preserving this historic site. How historic is it? The answer is: you could not get anything more historic than the Point Cook air base. The Point Cook air base is the oldest operational airfield in the world and it still has 24180 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 many of its original features, including hangars and buildings. It was established in 1913 as the Central Flying School and the airstrip has been in continuous usage ever since. Point Cook is the birthplace of the Australian Flying Corp and the Royal Australian Air Force. It was the departure point for the first north-south and the first east-west crossings of this continent by air and the first aerial circumnavigation of the continent. Recognising its historic nature, Point Cook is home to both the RAAF museum and the RAAF chapel. Whilst there are questions, obviously, about the need for the RAAF to retain direct involvement at Point Cook, it seems to me that the Commonwealth, in addressing the disposition questions, needs to ensure that this very historic place is not spoiled and that RAAF morale is not caused to suffer as a result. Having been involved in the campaign to preserve Point Cook’s heritage for more than two years, and having talked to serving RAAF personnel, whilst they observe the strictures of not campaigning publicly on what could be viewed as political questions, I have never in my life met an Air Force officer or serving personnel who did not have an emotional view about Point Cook, who did not want to see it preserved, its heritage truly valued and the RAAF museum and the RAAF chapel remain there. Showing that we care enough about the Air Force and its history to do something good for Point Cook would be a real boost for RAAF morale. There stands ready to take over the management of the Point Cook air base a community based company called Point Cook Operations Ltd. That is a not-for-profit company which is in a position to say to the Commonwealth that it would take over the recurrent costs of the air base-at least alleviating that burden on the Commonwealth. It has a vision for the site which includes preserving all of the heritage of the air base and expanding, over time, the RAAF museum. I take this opportunity to say to the new Minister for Defence, Peter Reith, that there is a real opportunity in the coming week for him to make his mark in that portfolio and to do the right thing for Australia by deciding to preserve Point Cook. The Avalon International Airshow 2001 is the perfect time and the perfect place for the minister to make this announcement, and I would urge him to do so. I will now turn from the morale issues-of which Point Cook is one, and the recruitment and retention matters I spoke about earlier are also aspects of the morale issue-to the strategic analysis proffered in the Defence 2000 paper. As the futurist, Peter Ellyard has said, ‘As the world is globalising, it is also tribalising-with individuals seeking security amongst race, cultural and language groups in part as a reaction to the insecurity that they feel as a result of globalisation.’ We are witnessing this phenomenon in our own region, and it has created what is referred to in defence parlance as the ‘arc of instability’. Even a cursory look by anybody in Australia at today’s newspapers would reinforce the concern that we have about stability in our region. Our near neighbours, most particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, face real stability issues with governance matters and, of course, there is Indonesia’s case with the integrity of the Indonesian state and various secessionist movements. In that situation, where we do face what is referred to as the ‘arc of instability’, it is welcome that this Defence 2000 paper marks a return to recognising the primacy of defending Australia and, in doing so, defending the approaches to Australia, whether they be by sea or by air. Hopefully this brings to an end the dangerous drift there has been under this government to a defence perspective where Australia was cast as the deputy sheriff to the USA-the USA presumably playing the role of the world’s policeman and Australia volunteering for the role of deputy sheriff. I think we are all well aware that the drift into that defence doctrine caused great alarm in our region and that it did damage to regional relationships. However, even though this Defence 2000 paper moves back to a perspective of the primacy of defending Australia, I remain concerned that this government has an emotional attachment to the concept of playing the deputy sheriff role and that there are members of this Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24181 government who continue to be attracted to having such a forward defence role. As members of this place may recall, the former defence minister Ian McLachlan used to openly muse about Australia being involved in operations on the Korean Peninsula or in defence of Taiwan. The Howard government is facing a real test on its attitude to these questions as the new Bush administration in the United States moves towards implementation of the national missile defence plan or, as it is more commonly referred to, the Son of Star Wars plan. Clearly, such a proposal is viewed with very deep concern in our region, particularly by China, which views it as a breach of existing ballistic missile agreements and fears that the so-called NMD could be used in a future conflict over Taiwan. Australia needs to avoid creating difficulties in our relationship with China as a result of being seen to slavishly follow the American view on this question. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, on last night’s 7.30 Report, said: We’re an ally of the United States. And we obviously want to see a strong United States. We don’t want to see the position of the United States in the world progressively weakened by the proliferation of missile technology into other parts of the world. Of course, I do not think anybody would suggest that anyone would endorse a position where the United States is progressively weakened by the proliferation of missile technology. But we need to note that the Son of Star Wars technology is not about the United States keeping up with other countries in terms of having a nuclear arsenal; it is a reaction where they seek to develop a device to prevent incoming missiles landing in the United States and, as a result, gain global supremacy in the nuclear arms race. So it is not about keeping pace; it is about winning the end game. In terms of a strategy of winning the end game, Australia needs to be very clear that it is not in our strategic interests to be disturbing our regional relationships, particularly our relationship with China, by slavishly following the United States of America down this path. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also said last night during the 7.30 Report that ‘if there were no missiles there would be no need for a missile defence system.’ I am sure we would all say amen to that. We would urge the government to pursue-in relation to this question-in a concerted way continuing pressure for disarmament on a worldwide basis so that hopefully we get to a stage where at least there are fewer missiles, even if we cannot reach the stage where there are no missiles. The strategic analysis and doctrine put forward in the Defence 2000 paper-that there be a move back to the primacy of defending Australia-is very welcome, but I remain concerned that, given some of the earlier utterances of this government, there could continue to be a drift on this question. It is a drift we cannot afford when there are propositions like that of the NMD being injected into the global debate on defence by the incoming Bush administration. government’s white paper on defence policy, and on the implications for Australia and especially my Gilmore electorate. As colleagues will know, many of my constituents work at or provide services to HMAS Albatross, just south of Nowra, and HMAS Creswell situated in the Jervis Bay territory. While the Shoalhaven area in particular in my electorate has been more than happy to embrace the benefits and advantages of a defence establishment, the mood in the past has not been so welcoming in many other parts of Australia. I applaud the Prime Minister and our former defence minister in their determination to hear and be guided by the people of our great nation. For the first time, a federal government has gone to the Australian people to ask if, in fact, they want a defence force and, if so, what kind of a defence force they are willing to pay for. Now it will be the Australian people who will once again own the Australian Defence Force and not the government.",149,Representatives Main Committee
338,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.07 P.m.),"I am delighted to speak in the debate on the24182 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 During the information stage, the people were told of the difficult circumstances the Australian Defence Force finds itself in. The kinds of decisions that had to be made will bring financial and strategic costs, not just to this generation but to our children’s generation as well. Overwhelmingly, the people of Australia endorsed their Defence Force. In fact, in our area, about 200 people attended the community consultation in order to participate and air their concerns. I thank my constituents for that, and I thank all of our veterans, the RSLs and the chairs of local associations and committees who attended on behalf of their respective members. They told us of their pride in a force that is strong, flexible and innovative enough to provide protection to the nation, while also playing peacekeeping roles in the neighbouring areas. The Australian people have told us that they want a defence force that they can be proud of, and that they are prepared to pay good money to see our servicemen and women well equipped, well trained, well paid and well managed. The defence white paper, entitled Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force, represents, as the Prime Minister said in the tabling of this report: ... the most comprehensive reappraisal of Australian defence capability for decades. It announces major increases over a long time scale in defence funding, and it complements the government’s strategic view of the circumstances in which Australia is now placed in our region and beyond. Not only is this good news for Australia but it is great news for Gilmore. An extra $23.5 billion in real terms over 10 years means a great future for HMAS Albatross and its defence personnel. Already this government has spent, in my electorate of Gilmore, $126 million on extensions to the base, with the final stage now under construction. The Navy is a major beneficiary, with increased spending, new equipment and increased personnel. A major upgrade of the Seahawk helicopters based in Nowra will commence in 2003. This means a boost for our local defence industries, which will be tendering for projects that are now confirmed and guaranteed. Cadets’ training will now be fully accredited and recognised by new spending of $30 million, with a separate command structure funded to ensure it is properly managed. Already the member for Bradfield, the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, has assigned himself to visiting our cadets at Ulladulla later this month. We need him to see that we already have several large and very active cadet groups in Gilmore, some with waiting lists containing as many names as the groups currently undergoing training. Fulltime personnel will be increased overall from 51,000 to 54,000. I will certainly be recommending that HMAS Albatross in Nowra be considered as the location for headquarters of the Australian theatre. As the placement of forces is rationalised and industry seeks to establish hubs of specific expertise, it is entirely possible that our local bases will grow and that our industry partners will grow alongside them. More personnel also mean more training facilities, and HMAS Creswell is well placed to expand its role in this field. Similarly, there are opportunities for more partnerships with local university and TAFE campuses, to better manage training resources and the sharing of research-and what better opportunities than at our Nowra campus of the University of Wollongong and our West Nowra TAFE campus, both funded by this federal government to the tune of $12 million. We in Gilmore look forward to the impact of the decisions of the white paper. We see ourselves particularly well placed with Main Road 92, the Shoalhaven Highway, recently being announced by this government, in the process of connecting our naval bases directly with Canberra and providing good transport links to associated industry partners. Similarly, Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24183 our community has worked very hard to attract the right mix of industry partners, education and telecommunications infrastructure to ensure that we can offer attractive packages to business, unrivalled by other centres. Across Australia everyone now understands that it was necessary to properly align our aims, our capability and our spending. It simply does not make sense to say, ‘We want to be able to help our neighbours,’ if we do not have the transport or training, not only to get there but to be useful as well; or to say, ‘We can’t help because we can’t afford the cost.’ We have to be realistic about what can be achieved in the short and longer term. What this government is all about is good long-term and financially viable policy, not ad hoc policy on the run that is simply aimed at buying votes or announced because it is popular. We must take account of the associated upgrading and maintenance costs, so that we do not get into another situation where all our equipment needs replacing at the same time. No matter what strategy and equipment you have, the most important asset of any defence force is its personnel. Our service men and women have been very patient and have worked long and hard in often very trying circumstances that at times have lowered general morale. The defence white paper has recognised this and has been prepared to address it. We the community understand full well that it costs a lot of money to select, train and equip each person in the ADF. It also presents a large social cost to that person and to his or her family and friends. It would be futile to throw all of this away through neglecting our service people to the degree that they give up and leave the force. We need to foster partnerships that we can form with others who regularly headhunt defence personnel for the private sector. I see this as an opportunity rather than a battle. Wellmanaged career paths with flexible crossover opportunities and good recognition of skills will assist in the re-establishing of the Australian Defence Force as one of the places to be. It will obviously take careful planning and time to achieve our objectives. However, through the community and service consultation processes I believe that now, for the first time in a long time, we will all be paddling in the same direction. We can achieve much more together-and we will need to achieve much more if Australia is to become more self-reliant. Recent events have shown the reluctance of allies to become involved at an early stage. Australians have become aware that we might have to take some local initiatives alone and that assistance from others might come later. We obviously need to ensure that our trade and foreign affairs policies are in logical sequence with our defence policies. We need to work hard on our relationships with other nations to foster goodwill amongst our neighbours and allies. Although many of us saw Australia as a very small player in the global arena, I think people forgot our responsibilities as a major player in the Pacific and South-East Asian contexts. Events in East Timor, Bougainville, the Solomons and Fiji soon changed our perceptions, and Australians now want a force that can support this nation’s various roles in our region of the world. In all my years in Australia. I have been aware of the proud traditions of our defence forces, but I never realised just how good our service men and women are. As chair of the coalition committee on defence and veterans’ affairs, I attended part of the Crocodile 99 exercises in and around Townsville, experiencing our service people and their work at first-hand. It was a real eye-opener. EveryoneI met at the exercises was entirely focused. Employers would give their eyeteeth for that kind of concentration and dedication. As I have detailed in the House, the United States forces brought absolutely everything with them to these exercises-not just one of each, but hundreds or thousands of whatever. There was certainly plenty of defence equipment, and all of it was the latest technology. 24184 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 However, with fewer resources, our service personnel work harder and smarter and have a more positive outlook than many others I have met. It is said regularly that our greatest asset in the defence of Australia is our personnel, and this is very true. One of our greatest strengths by far is communications. There is envy at the level and amount of equipment and resources available to the United States forces. Yet our troops took almost particular delight in using their initiative, inventiveness, innovation and sheer cunning to ensure that they got much more out of their supposed lesser equipment. There was a fierce loyalty to each other, to Australia and to our safety as occupants of this great country. Never have I met such a friendly, courteous, committed and disciplined force. While we continue our political pointscoring, they are embarrassed. They have a job to do and we should be standing alongside them. Our troops have a responsibility to do the best for our country and we need to encourage them and applaud their magnificent efforts in adverse circumstances. Last year I travelled to Western Australia with other members of the coalition defence and veterans’ affairs committee to visit defence facilities and associated industry partners. I was absolutely bowled over by the high morale of the ADF personnel stationed with HMAS Waller, a Collins class submarine. They spoke with pride about their vessel and appreciated the chance to get their points across, emphasising the submarine’s advantages and benefits. In the media I have heard and seen only negative things, none of which were obvious during our inspection. Yes, there are hitches, but everyone was very positive. Our service personnel work hard and remain very focused and positive while under enormous strain. They need our backing, and this government is going to provide that support-not just with lip service until the next election but throughout the coming decadewith increased levels of equipment, training and career prospects, regardless of the political flavour of governments to come. There has been a cycle in defence spending. We have seen white papers prepared by experts at great expense only to have them overturned by the next financial crisis. We, as a government, have now filled Labor’s $13 billion black hole and repaid $50 billion of Labor’s $80 billion in overseas debts. This federal government has restored some sense to the economy in spite of the doomsday prophets. Now we are positioning Australia’s defence spending on a sound economic footing so that our service men and women can believe that they, too, will have a secure future for decades to come. There will be no more fast talking, vote buying or boom-and-bust cycles, but sound, steady management of resources to ensure that our future Defence Force will be one that Australians can be proud of and proud to join. Defence 2000 white paper as I have been very keen on most defence matters. It is opportune for me to be speaking today as I have just recently visited a couple of defence bases in southeast Queensland: during the summer recess I was fortunate to visit, with my colleague the shadow minister for defence, Stephen Martin, the Amberley RAAF Base and RAR1 at Oakey. This visit has reinforced my personal commitment to good defence policy. As many of my colleagues have remarked in this debate, the Australian Labor Party has continued to support the government when defence policy has been good. The defence white paper presented to parliament in November 2000 has been a reassuring return to structured defence policy that reflects Australia’s capabilities to defend itself. It is also gradual recognition by this government of our regional position and commitments. This defence white paper is a broad document that, used correctly, will rectify the government’s denial of our role in Asia and bring our alliance with the United States back into perspective. With the white paper in hand, the government has a number of challenges ahead of it. In the context of our role in international affairs, the government must develop a foreign affairs policy that repairs the ‘deputy dawg’ image that the Howard doctrine implied. The government must also use this document as a guide to reassure those in the ADF of a long-",155,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.20 P.m.),"I am pleased to be speaking in this debate on theWednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24185 term understanding of defence needs and commitment. Australia needs to be ready for any defence call-out, whether it be a peacekeeping role offshore, emergency relief assistance domestically or overseas, or a realistic national security strategy. Personnel are the ADF’s greatest asset, and the redevelopment of career recruits and reservists is a good step towards rectifying the low morale and job insecurity the ADF currently faces. Over 12 months ago it became evident to this House that there were serious problems in the Australian Defence Force recruitment and retention, particularly in that of reservists. As with so many defence matters under this government, Labor’s concerns fell on deaf ears. Two separate amendment bills proposed by Labor to rectify employment and entitlement anomalies for reservists were allowed to lapse in the Senate last year. The proposed amendments to the Defence (Re-establishment) Act and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill were not fanciful attempts from this side of the House to whinge about government policy. These amendments were developed to remedy immediate problems the Australian Defence Force was facing in the replacement and relief of INTERFET troops in East Timor. Labor’s amendments were motivated by the overwhelming evidence that the ADF could not guarantee personnel for Australia’s commitment to East Timor. The proposal that reserve forces be called out to support the rotation of East Timor forces was also under threat because the ADF could not provide sufficient guarantees of reserve personnel. There was significant speculation at the time of how ready Australia was in times of national security threats. It was evident that a shortfall in reserve recruiting targets in 199899 had directly impacted Australia’s readiness for conflict. Reserve recruitment targets were overwhelmingly down. We saw, for the first time, the RAAF down 44 per cent on targets, the RAN down 80 per cent and the Army down 49 per cent. These are extraordinary figures, which are a direct reflection of this government’s policies and short-sightedness about the ADF. Since 1996, the government has abolished the Ready Reserve Scheme, which was widely acknowledged as producing committed soldiers trained to a very high standard. It has removed leave for Defence Force reservists as an allowable matter under the Workplace Relations Act. It has failed to meet reserve recruitment targets. It also introduced a six-week common induction training program which failed. From 1996 to 1999 the government slowly but surely reduced the ADF reserve force to a bare skeleton. With no guarantee of job security for reserves during and/or after service, policies this government has implemented have literally prevented any potential defence reserve recruit from working full-time. The defence white paper is the first step in actually rectifying these problems, but I am loath to commend a government that is merely undoing its own bad work in the first instance. Over 12 months ago this government had an opportunity to prove a commitment to the Australian defence reserve and reservists, and it failed miserably. What was the government’s reaction to calls, not only from the opposition, but also from the Australian Defence Reserves Association and other interested parties to sort out this immediate problem? Its reaction was just complete inaction; there was no action. Two amendment bills proposed by Labor were allowed to squander in the Senate only to be practically reinvented, rebadged and retitled, if you like, by this government a year later. As in so many areas, the coalition is suffering from policy inertia. Despite its resistance, it has been forced to accept the defence strategy that Labor has upheld since being in government. Denial just does not work at all times. The government’s about-face on BAS, for example, has proven that sticking your head in the sand and hoping that everyone will just get used to what you are doing just does not fool the average Australian. The government’s response to a defence force in crisis was not granted any better understanding either. Twelve months after everyone was demanding remedial changes to defence reserves, the government sauntered 24186 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 into the House late last year with the Defence Legislation Amendment (Enhancement of the Reserves and Modernisation) Bill 2000 and the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Bill 2000. A commitment of $20 million was made in the 2000 budget to defence reserves. Unfortunately, there is no indication of any solid investment in the reserve scheme beyond this financial year. Understandably the implementation of these amendments may determine the long-term strategy of the Department of Defence. I believe there is genuine cause to question the legitimacy of the government’s dedication to the budgetary needs of the reserves and of the ADF as a whole. One only needs to consider the government’s preference for fiscal policy over defence strategy to reinforce this notion. While it takes 12 months for the reserve program to be overhauled and nine months for the defence white paper to actually be released, it takes only a few months for the allowances and benefits of regular defence personnel to actually be rescinded. My colleague from the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, can attest to the underhanded way this government has adjusted entitlements such as recreation leave, free travel, remote locality, leave travel and the removal of travel on posting. Despite the protestations at the most senior levels of defence forces, the government has done nothing to redress these decisions and these issues. There are defence personnel who have returned from active duty in East Timor, as an example, to be told that they are not entitled to defence housing loans. It is like the coalition’s version of mutual obligation, with the unemployed being expected to do reverse double backflips to prove they are looking for work. But it just never seems to be enough. This government will give soldiers the fanfare heroes welcome after serving active duty. It will even make one of them Australian of the Year, but do not expect any long-term security for services rendered. When it comes to putting money where the platitudes have been exhausted, the coalition are the masters of splitting bureaucratic hairs. In my visits to many defence bases, I have had the opportunity to talk to many of our fine personnel right across the country. The message that is coming through loud and clear is that, defence that will be out of control. That crisis is a crisis of losing our best people, the people that we have invested in, the people that we have trained and the ones that have the skills and the knowledge base. We will lose those people and we are currently losing them now. What is happening, as in many industries but this should not happen in the ADF, is that those people who are highly skilled and highly valued are snapped up by private industry. They might finish on a Friday afternoon, maybe at Amberley at 501 hangar, but they will be back there the following Monday with a different uniform, just a different set of clothes. They are doing the same job, but the reason they have left the Defence Force is because they were not being looked after. They are not being looked after properly and so they are taking options to go somewhere else. If members had a close look at the evidence, I think all members would ask: when did this real exodus start happening? It started happening in the last few years. There was a time when there was a bit of fat in the ADF that needed to be trimmed. I think everybody would agree that that took place, but the pendulum has now swung too far. If you talk to anyone on any of our bases across Australia or anyone associated with the Defence Force, they will tell you that it has gone way too far. We need to turn that around quickly because, if we do not, we are going to lose control of our best asset-people. We were lucky in East Timor that we could manage with the resources that we had at the time. Had it gone further, had something else flared up, we would not have had the resources, Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24187 we would not have had the personnel on the ground, we would not have had those essential people. The reason is that government policy has failed. The Defence Force have not been able to recruit and they have not been able to retain people. They are losing people at a very fast rate. The government needs to seriously look at the recommendations of this white paper and implement them as quickly as possible. I would particularly like to point out defence industry. I think defence industry is one of the keys, not only to jobs in rural areas but also to defence itself. There is a good example of it in my area in the Ipswich region, and that is through RAAF Base Amberley. There is also the airborne early warning and control system that the government have been postulating over for some time. This is a system that basically was given the go-ahead and the tick many years ago. When the government had the opportunity to actually say, ‘Let’s go for it now,’ they did not. They waited and they kept waiting. The result of that wait is that, instead of having seven of the Boeing 737 Orions built in Australia, we are going to have those aircraft manufactured and assembled in Seattle in the US. So we lose the work here. Let us talk about regional jobs and about what all of this means. What should a white paper mean? What should this mean for defence? It should mean jobs-that is the first thing. Of course, it should also mean strategic defence, and it does, but if it does not mean jobs in those rural areas then the rest of it is not going to fall into place either. We had an opportunity to build seven of those aircraft. The government has signed off and said, ‘We’ll take seven.’ We are only going to take four up-front, but the cost is the same. Because of poor process in decision making, the government has lost a region like Ipswich the opportunity to have something like half a billion dollars invested in the assembly of these aircraft. I support many of the things in the white paper, and I actually think the white paper is quite good. The reason I think it is good is that it includes many of the ideas that Labor has. The government has actually gone out there and sought some community consultation, albeit not always in the right areas. What we have now is a paper that actually has some good ideas in it, but I want to see the government take those ideas up, particularly in defence industry, because I think that is a key for us in the future and a key for defence. Another area I wanted to briefly talk about is what we are actually providing our defence personnel. As I said earlier, these people are highly skilled, highly trained and highly valued, and we should be doing everything we can to ensure that we actually retain them. Seeing what we have seen in the last few years, particularly with the reservists, I think the government needs to look at much broader policy than just defence policy. It needs to look at its workplace relations policy and look at how it is actually treating those people. These people are not ordinary citizens in terms of their work because they have a special task. Therefore, there should be special conditions. The government had a closed mind and the blinkers were on. In particular, the minister for workplace relations at the time could not see past the fact that you need to look at the working conditions of these people. Maybe their conditions need to be looked at separately or maybe they should be given extra benefits compared to what some others might be enjoying. But that was not the case. What the government did was just take away conditions carte blanche: ‘We’ll just take it all off and we’ll go from there.’ There were only 20 allowable matters. What we have ended up with is people in the Defence Force saying, ‘I’ve had enough. I can get more money somewhere else. I can get the same work’-because in the end they are doing the same work-‘but I can do it under better conditions.’ So we have people actually leaving the Defence Force. If the government is serious about doing something for defence, doing something for the country and doing something for defence personnel, then it ought to read this Defence 2000 white paper very carefully and have a look at its own policy ideas and 24188 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 implement, particularly in those areas in defence industry, reforms that can help defence personnel stay in the Defence Force. and support the discussion on the defence white paper. I think this is an outstanding document. It is another example of the Howard government getting on, doing things and achieving things and showing real leadership for Australia. It is to be commended. It is something that most thinking Australians certainly support. Having said that, I must admit I was somewhat disappointed to listen to the member for Oxley, who seemed to be somewhat confused in what he was saying about the defence white paper. On the one hand he seemed to want to support it, but on the other hand he was then trying to find holes that do not really exist and to create straw men to knock over. I think if he wanted to make a really good contribution to this debate, he ought to be not only wholeheartedly supporting this instead of having a half-hearted approach but also taking up the points on the importance of the very high degree of professionalism that we see amongst our Australian Defence Force personnel. They are people whom all Australians should rightfully feel proud of, and to listen to him talking one would think that is not the case. His comments were obviously fairly confused. He said that he was loath to commend what he somehow had to agree with, and then he talked about undoing some bad work. The point is that the one thing that the Howard government has done, despite the economic difficulties that it faced when it came into power following the irresponsible budget deficits of the previous government, is to maintain defence spending. In other words, despite inheriting the Beazley black hole, the $10 billion black hole, the one area that the Howard government was adamant about was that it would not cut back on defence spending. The member for Oxley talked about the need to spend more money, but if he had looked at the white paper he would have found that one of the immediate consequences of it is that the government is going to increase defence spending by $500 million. I would like to pick up on another point that I think ought not to go unmentioned. The member for Oxley was trying to make some point about the lack of future for reserves, but if he had looked at page 81 of Defence 2000 he would have found a comment in paragraph 823 that states: The key to our sustainment capability in future will come from our Reserve forces. I would not have thought that it could be any clearer that the future of the reserves is assured. The paragraph continues: In line with the new emphasis on a small, high-readiness army ready for deployment, the role of our Reserve forces will undergo a major transition. If you go over to the next page, you will see the statement: Reserve service will therefore be a more serious commitment than it has been in the past, but also a more rewarding one. You could not be any clearer that the future role of the reserves not only is assured but, I would have thought, is going to become a far more important one. I do find that rather hard to understand, and I think maybe the member for Oxley had not really done his homework. If we quickly go through some of the background to the white paper, following the last election the Howard government made a commitment to develop and release a white paper. It has certainly delivered on that, as it has delivered on many other very good programs. This white paper was delivered just before Christmas. Clearly, without any question, it is the most significant statement on defence policy for more than 25 years.",158,Representatives Main Committee
340,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (12.35 P.m.),"I am very proud to be able to join in this debateWednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24189 That comment on the defence white paper can be reinforced-it is not just the government saying it-if we look at some of the public comment. For example, Alan Dupont, a well known, well-recognised expert, stated in the Australian: The White Paper is a clear and outstanding work. This is the best white paper on defence in the past 25 years. It provides a clear and strategic road map for the deployment of the Australian Defence Force ... Those are pretty strong words. It is not often that we would hear people say ‘the best in the last 25 years’. That shows just how important and significant it is. We may look also to the comments of the Australian Financial Review: What is more significant is that the strategic planning outlook and the financial planning outlook in the new White Paper perhaps have more prospect of measuring up than has been the case in the past. I guess that is a backhanded way of saying that various white papers were produced in the days of the Labor government but often they were not acted upon. These are examples of a government that gets on with the job. The Howard government deserves to be commended for that. It is also important to look at some of the ways that the government has approached this matter and the importance of the consultation process. A draft paper having been produced, there was then widespread community consultation. Clearly, from that the white paper was refined and developed, and the outcomes very much reflected a taking account of what the public was saying. More specifically, the white paper addresses a number of issues such as Australia’s strategic environment, our national defence and strategic interests, and our important strategic relationships. It also outlines the key roles that the Australian Defence Force must focus on in the future, it provides a comprehensive plan for the future capability development of the Australian Defence Force and it increases the number of full-time Defence Force members to 54,000. These are all clear commitments which are all about delivering on what is recognised as the best white paper in 25 years. An increase in defence funding is provided-an average three per cent per annum in real terms over the coming decade, with an immediate increase of $500 million in the coming financial year and $1,000 million in the following financial year. Defence spending over the decade is expected to increase by a total of $23½ billion in real terms-$23,500 million-so it is the most specific long-term defence funding commitment given by any Australian government in the past 25 years. The white paper indicates that there are no further efficiency savings to be achieved in defence and that the government is strongly committed to improving defence and to ensuring that the money is expended wisely. One of the key differences between this white paper and its predecessors is the fact that the federal government’s long-term funding commitment is specifically tied to a defence capability plan. That is very significant. While previous defence papers have addressed some very important points, the commitment to funding has not always been there or it has tended to fall off. It is a fair criticism of the previous government that, when it needed a bit of money for something else, defence was always an easy chop. Another important point is that the capability plan will give greater predictability in acquisition, planning and contracting. Not only will this mean a more certain basis for business but, equally importantly, it will allow industry, which is often described as the fourth arm of the services, to plan with some predictability for the future. That will lead to greater efficiencies and savings, and not only will Australian taxpayers get better value for their 24190 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 money but they will see the development of some very important strategic industries in Australia. I do not think anyone should underestimate the importance of that. I could talk about a number of other areas. One, specifically, is enhancement of the land forces’ readiness and also their sustainability. Firepower, logistics and mobility will be improved, the number of battalions held at high readiness will be increased from four to six, and two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters and an additional squadron of trooplifter helicopters will be purchased. The reserves will play a more important and challenging role. The importance of maintaining our air combat capability as the best in the region is underlined. For example, we are going to get four AWACS aircraft, with the option of three more, and the FA18s are to be upgraded. The government has made provision for the acquisition of up to 100 new aircraft to replace the Hornets and possibly the F111s. In the meantime, strike capability will be improved by way of the F111s’ electronic warfare self-protection system. In the maritime forces, all six Collins class submarines are to be brought up to a higher level of capability and a new class of at least three air warfare destroyers will replace our ageing FFG destroyers. Obviously, the maintenance of our commitment to the knowledge edge, and the recruiting and retention of skilled personnel, are very much at the forefront of these matters. Clearly, this is a very significant white paper. In the short time that is available to me, I would like to touch on a couple of related issues. I am very proud to have the opportunity and the privilege to chair the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Last year, we released a report on the Army which was titled From phantom to force: towards a more efficient and effective army. This report was very well received. It has created a lot of discussion. It talks about ways and means of improving the effectiveness and readiness of our Army. It addresses some of the current shortcomings in the Army. For example, some of our units are down to 50 per cent of staff at the moment. We talk about facing up to the reality of what we should be doing about the future of the Army. The report was designed very much to dovetail into this defence white paper. The committee is holding some follow-up hearings on the report and will be producing a further report on the basis of those community consultations. The joint committee is not only a committee of both houses of parliament; it also obviously comprises both government and opposition members. I commend all members of that committee because we do work together very much in the interests of Australia and partisan politics do not enter into our deliberations. If you look at the whole debate that has taken place on the defence white paper, it is clear that it has a lot of support from most opposition members. This committee reinforces that support. I think it is important that we continue to work in that way because it shows Australian Defence Force personnel that we have confidence in the very important job that they undertake in maintaining the defence of Australia, and that all other Australians have knowledge of the role that they perform. I welcome the opportunities that arise from this commitment to industry, because it is not just the traditional areas of defence force industry that can benefit from this white paper. There will be all sorts of opportunities for regions to develop niche players in supporting some of the major defence suppliers. Obviously, the major ones will continue to operate in areas in which they are already located. I think the opportunities for regions-obviously, for example, in my electorate of Wannon-are to be welcomed and I am certainly keen to support those. Another area of the defence white paper that I think is very important is the commitment to provide a $30 million boost for cadets. The fact that we will now be increasing spending on cadets to $30 million a year is very welcome. In my area there are two cadet units. The first, Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24191 School Monivae, at Monivae College at Hamilton, has all its students, male and female, involved in the cadets. There is no doubt that all the students are very supportive of that and believe they get a lot of value from it. We also have TS Henty at Portland, which has for many years been operating as a separate unit and has done Portland very proud. I hope that more schools and others will take up this opportunity to introduce new cadet units, and I am keen to support that. In conclusion, the white paper is a major development by the Howard government. It is something of which all members of the government are very proud. I think it is very encouraging to see that most members of the opposition strongly support it. I believe that the future of Australia depends on our having a strong Defence Force. I believe that, having regard to the commitment that this government has made, we can be confident that this will continue to be the case in the future. expression of support to the excellent initiative contained in the defence white paper. We would all agree that that the prime responsibility of the government of any country is national security: the protection of its citizens. In recent years, perhaps even in the last couple of decades, there has been no perceived direct threat to Australia’s security. As a result, recent governments placed a relatively low priority on defence spending, and we have seen a substantial and ongoing decline in defence spending in this country. The figures clearly show a decline, particularly over the years of Labor government. Defence spending declined steadily from 9.4 per cent of government spending in 1981 to 7.8 per cent of government spending in 1996. In those years of Labor administration there were a number of quite obvious effects of this steady erosion of the relative importance of defence spending. One obvious effect was the relative decline in our defence capability, with a reduced number of full-time personnel, increasingly aged equipment and a reduction in our technical superiority over the emerging powers in our region. A second, equally alarming effect was the decline in morale of our defence personnel with the ancillary problems associated with this decline. I know there were numerous attempts to increase efficiency: the restructure of our defence spending, the application of commercial market testing programs and so on. While some of these were of benefit, what they largely did was disguise or delay the need for a substantially increased financial commitment to our defence forces, and it is that increased financial commitment that we see in the initiatives outlined in this white paper. It is important to note that the Howard government had already acted to halt the decline in defence spending that had been occurring during the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. You will remember that in the 1996 budget, in the context of a legacy of massive debt and deficit, when there had to be widespread budget cuts, the Howard government quite wisely acted to quarantine defence spending from those cuts. So, from 1996 over the next three years, we saw an increase in defence spending as a percentage of total government spending from 7.8 per cent-that several-decade low-to 8.6 per cent. But this white paper goes dramatically further. It takes a very substantial step not by just halting that long-term decline but by reversing it dramatically with a large injection of funds over the next decade. Four relevant points need to be made in that context. First of all, the white paper reflects the increased commitment to spending on defence and the awareness of the growing instability in the South-East Asia-Pacific region. The events in East Timor, Indonesia generally, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji and so on are specific examples of that growing instability for which Australia needs to be prepared. Australia’s very proactive and extremely successful effort in East Timor was indicative of the need for us to be able to respond quickly and effectively to crises within our region.",162,Representatives Main Committee
341,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (12.50 P.m.),"I appreciate this opportunity to add my24192 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 February 2001 Secondly, the white paper reflects widespread community support for the enhancement and rebuilding of our defence capability. The widespread community consultation process that took place last year in the lead-up to this white paper involved 28 meetings attended by over 2,000 people and some 1,150 submissions from interested groups within our community overwhelmingly in support of the enhancement and rebuilding of our defence capacity. Thirdly, it reflects the strong commitment of the Howard government to rebuilding our capability and rebuilding the morale within the Australian defence forces. Fourthly, I might add a point made by earlier speakers: that this increased commitment to defence spending reflects our economic capacity to do that, a capacity which, sadly, had been depleted in the years of Labor mismanagement. Labor could not afford an increase in defence spending because they had so badly mismanaged the financial affairs of this country. The Howard government has rebuilt our economic capacity and is therefore able to rebuild our defence forces through a greater monetary contribution. This is a very welcome turnaround in commitments to our defence forces. It involves the most detailed and specific long-term funding program for defence that we have seen from an Australian government in the last 25 years. Importantly, it does not mean just throwing more money at defence. It certainly involves a lot more money-I will come to that point in a moment-but the program is based on a clear enunciation of Australia’s defence priorities, in terms of both defending Australia and taking a leadership role in maintaining stability within our region. It involves greater accountability, and therefore greater effectiveness, in the use of defence funds-and ultimately taxpayers’ funds. The new approach will focus on output based funding-that is, funding aimed at clearly prioritised targets and identified needs. We have already heard about the substantial funding commitments. We will see in the next budget an increase of $500 million in the 2001-02 financial year, a funding increase of $1,000 million the year after and funding increases of three per cent in real terms every year over the next decade. That will mean a total increase in defence spending of $23.5 billion throughout the next decade. That funding will increase the current level of $12.2 billion a year in real terms in today’s dollars to $16 billion by the end of this decade. That is the greatest commitment we have seen for decades by an Australian government. The main features of the white paper include increasing full-time Australian Defence Force personnel to 54,000; increasing spending on RAAF capacity, including two squadrons of armed reconnaissance helicopters, up to 100 new replacement strike aircraft, four airborne early warning aircraft and improved F111 electronic warfare systems; strengthening maintenance forces, including at least three new air warfare destroyers for our marine forces; upgrading all six Collins class submarines; increasing the Army’s capacity from four to six full-time battalions with enhanced readiness, firepower and mobility; and increasing the number of reserves-an important element in contemporary military operations-and spending $30 million to strengthen and expand the Australian Service Cadet Scheme. That is of benefit to my local region: we have an Army cadet unit at Katoomba and an Air Force cadet unit at Richmond. It is a substantial and tangible recognition of the importance of encouraging young people who are interested in defence issues. The white paper has some very important implications for our local area, including RAAF base Richmond. As well as the general increase in support for our defence forces, RAAF and airlift group-which is pivotal to our air force-there are some specific programs targeted at our local area. The airlift group based at Richmond plays a pivotal role in our defence forces. The No. 36 Squadron has 12 of the C130 H Hercules aircraft, the No. 37 Squadron has 12 new J-model Hercules, and the No. 33 Squadron has five 707s used for airlift refuelling. In addition, the base serves as a vital depot for deeper level maintenance of Hercules and our PC3 Orions. Wednesday, 7 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24193 At the centre of these roles are the 1,750 uniformed personnel stationed at RAAF Richmond in addition to several hundred civilians in support roles. The men and women of RAAF Richmond, like all our Australian Defence Force personnel, do us proud. They form a committed, professional team without which our technical hardware would be impotent. A couple of hundred local RAAF personnel were involved in the extremely successful operations in East Timor. The increased defence spending that is part of this white paper will provide a much needed morale boost for our personnel. It will specifically involve the upgrading and refurbishment of our 12 C130 H-model Hercules based at Richmond, which is estimated to occur by about 2008. This will increase the capacity of the airlift group as well as boost local employment and the morale of our local defence personnel. It is opportune for me to stress again the extremely important role that RAAF Base Richmond plays in our local community. The Hawkesbury community are immensely proud of our local RAAF personnel-our RAAF men and women-and the local community are very appreciative of the pivotal role that RAAF Base Richmond plays in our local economyinjecting some $100 million a year into our local economy. We are all very proud of RAAF Base Richmond and we are committed to seeing its security and future strengthened in coming years. I know that time is getting away, but this defence white paper is an exciting, strategic and extremely valuable policy initiative by the Howard government. It provides a much needed and substantial boost to our defence forces, a much needed turnaround of the decline in defence spending that has been occurring over two decades and a boost both in physical capacity and in rebuilding the morale of our defence personnel. We can be justifiably very proud of our ADF personnel. They continue to add immense value to the physical and technical capacity which has allowed Australia for years to punch well above its weight in the local region. The increased government commitment outlined in this white paper will greatly build on their capacity to continue to play such a pivotal role in the defence of Australia and the security of the South-East Asia-Pacific region. Like so many in my community, I warmly welcome the government’s initiative. I warmly welcome what it means to the security of Australia, what it means to helping us play a pivotal role in maintaining regional stability and what it means for my own local area. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.02 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: National Insurance Scheme: Employee Entitlements (Question No. 1734) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: To ask the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business-Has he or his Department received a report on the feasibility in each State and Territory of a national insurance scheme to protect employee entitlements in cases of business insolvency; if so, (a) who compiled the report, (b) what was the cost, (c) to whom has the report been provided and (d) will the report be tabled or made public; if so, when; if not, why not. The Government has considered a report on the possible use of insurance for the protection of employee entitlements on employer insolvency, which considered options and issues including the feasibility of a compulsory insurance scheme. (a) The report was prepared by an interdepartmental committee comprising the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The committee consulted with the insurance industry for the purpose of preparing the report. (b) This was undertaken as part of the normal business of the Departments concerned and costs have not been separately identified. (c) The report was prepared for and provided to the Government. (d) I announced on 27 April 2000 that the Government had accepted the findings of the interdepartmental committee, that an insurance scheme is not a viable option. I publicly announced the reasons at that time. Aviation: Aircraft Emergency in Botany Bay (Question No. 1787) 14 August 2000: (1) Where are the locations of access points to Botany Bay in the event of an aircraft emergency in the Bay. (2) What are the evacuation points for vessels to unload injured passengers who may be rescued from the water and how far are those access points from the St George Hospital. (3) Has the Government considered the need for additional access points. (4) Has his attention been drawn to Rockdale City Councils proposed repairs and modifications to the Brighton Jetty which would make the structure wider than normal to enable a vehicle such as an ambulance to drive down the jetty and then turn around at the end and to allow boats to come alongside in various weather conditions. (5) Is the jetty ideally located as an emergency access point to the Bay; if so, will his Department investigate the proposal with a view to the Commonwealth providing financial assistance for the project. (1) to (5) Marine emergencies in the Botany Bay/Port Hacking area are dealt with under the NSW State Emergency and Rescue Management Act. I understand that the locations of all access/evacuation points, types, sizes, length of wharf face and depth of water at low water are contained in the Botany Bay/Port Hacking Marine Emergency Plan developed by the Botany Bay/Port Hacking Marine Emergency Management Committee. The Committee is chaired by the NSW Police Service and the honourable member may wish to raise these issues with the State Government.",165,Representatives Main Committee

344,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Multicultural Arts: Funding (Question No. 1802) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: (1) What major developments have taken place in the field of multicultural arts since the election of the Howard Government in 1996. (2) What resources has the Government provided specifically targeted for multicultural arts since its election in 1996. (3) What action has he taken to ensure that the Australia Council and other funding bodies give equal access to artists from non English speaking backgrounds. (4) What direct funding is being made to ethnic community organisations through his Department to maintain the diversity of cultural traditions within a multicultural Australia. (1) The Australia Council, the Commonwealth Government’s arts funding and advisory body, values the diversity of the community and aims to ensure that this diversity is reflected and expressed in all areas of arts practice. Cultural diversity was a key theme in the Council’s first corporate plan, 1996-1999. Relevant activity during this period included publication of ‘The World is your Audience’, a collection of best practice case studies of arts organisations responding to our multicultural makeup, and preparation of a detailed response to the Commonwealth’s discussion paper, ‘Multiculturalism: the Way Forward’. This year the Council has adopted a new Arts for a Multicultural Australia (AMA) Plan, which aims to involve artists from diverse backgrounds and all areas of arts practice. The Plan’s objectives are to: achieve high quality and well profiled multicultural artistic content; achieve inclusive attitudinal change within the arts sector itself; achieve sustainable infrastructure for the multicultural arts sector; and produce effective change in Council’s ability to implement the AMA policy. The Council has allocated $1.5 million over five years to achieve these outcomes. This funding will not be used to establish grants program restricted to applicants with a non-English speaking background, but will ensure that such applicants can compete equitably in the Council’s standard grants programs: measures include a leadership development program for curators and programmers from a non-English speaking background. This in turn will stimulate cultural interactions which will be of benefit to the arts sector generally. (2) It is important to note that applications to the Australia Council for grants dealing with multicultural Australia or with multicultural arts are not limited to any one specific budget or funding category. Every program of the Council is open to arts organisations and/or Australian artists of all backgrounds, no matter what the artist’s creative vision. In addition to grant programs, the Australia Council has invested in a range of strategic initiatives promoting the engagement between cultural diversity and the arts. These range from an innovative cross-cultural training package for arts agencies to Multicultural Arts Marketing Ambassadors in Victoria to new conferences and publications. The Playing Australia, Contemporary Music Touring, Festivals Australia and Visions of Australia programs administered by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts welcome applications from a wide range of cultural organisations including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community groups and ethnic cultural societies. While no specific percentage of funds is targeted for multicultural arts, the programs encourage activities which develop opportunities for people from non-English speaking backgrounds, women, people with disabilities and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",168,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
345,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Cultural diversity is one of the factors I take into consideration in making appointments to the Australia Council and other funding bodies. The Australia Council annually reviews its accessibility to people from non-English speaking backgrounds. The Council’s Access and Equity reports outline not only outcomes but the work done to promote equal access. This includes: Promotion of translating and interpreting services with its annual “Support For the Arts Handbook”; Regular advertising in ethnic media; Provision of cross-cultural training for Council staff; Continuing monitoring by the Australia Council Multicultural Advisory Committee (ACMAC); Ongoing dialogue with the field.

Australian Taxation Office: Advice (Question No. 2074) Mr Rudd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Is he aware that ATO customers are having to wait for up to 90 minutes on the telephone before reaching ATO staff in order to obtain advice on PAYG and other tax policy changes. (2) What is the average time delay for ATO customers between a customer initiating a telephone call to the ATO and calls being answered by ATO staff. (1) and (2) For the week ended 20 October 2000, the average speed of answer for calls to ATO Call Centres was 3 minutes 13 seconds and the average for the month of October was 2 minutes 21 seconds.

International Labour Organisation: Occupational Health and Safety Conventions (Question No. 2084) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 30 October 2000: Is he able to say what is the current position of the Federal Government and each State and Territory Government in relation to ILO Occupational Health and Safety Conventions (a) C139 Occupational Cancer, 1974, (b) C148 Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration), 1977, (c) C155 Occupational Safety and Health, 1981, (d) C162 Asbestos, 1986, (e) C167 Safety and Health in Construction, 1988, (f) C170 Chemicals, 1990, (h) C174 Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents, 1993; and (i) C176 Safety and Health in Mines, 1995. Australia has not ratified any of these Conventions. Australia’s treaty-making policy, adopted in 1996, requires compliance to be established prior to ratification of a treaty. This principle reflects usual practice in relation to ILO Conventions, in that they are considered for ratification by Australia only when law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions is in compliance with the provisions of the Convention and when all State and Territory governments that have an interest in the Convention have formally agreed to ratification. The Commonwealth, States and Territories demonstrate varying degrees of compliance with each of the Conventions listed in the question. Compliance by all jurisdictions would have to be established, and formal agreement to ratification obtained prior to any consideration by the Commonwealth Government of ratification.

Export credits are earned based on the level of Australian value added in export sales of automotive vehicles, components, tools and tooling, and design and development services. The standard criteria for the approval of export credits are that: goods are eligible, manufactured in Australia, have been exported prior to 31 December 2000 (the closing date of the scheme) and monies have been received. Export credits may be used to offset Customs Duty on eligible automotive imports. (3) Refer to the answer to question 2 above.

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission: Made in Australia Label (Question No. 2181) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 27 November 2000: (1) What was the oULJLQDO LQWHQW RI 'LYLVLRQ $$ &RXQWU\ RI 2ULJLQ 5HSUHVHQWDWLRQV RI 3DUW 9 RI WKH Trade Practices Act, in force since 13 August 1998 (2) Why is it that if a qualified claim such as ‘Made in Australia from imported goods’ is made then the Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner does not require the producer of the good to meet the substantial transformation or 50% safe harbour test. (3) Does the ACCC’s treatment of qualified claims effectively allow products made anywhere in the world, but packed, bottled or assembled in Australia, to be labelled as “Made in Australia”; if not, (a) on what basis is this treatment justified and (b) how is it consistent with the original intent of the legislation. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The 1998 amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974, as contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Act 1998, came after a period of significant uncertainty as to the application of s52 and s53eb of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to country of origin claims. The judiciary, in a series of decisions, had resisted establishing general compliance guidelines for country of origin labelling, preferring, as is their right, to consider each matter on its own merits. Firms found assured compliance with the Trade Practices Act 1974 difficult, as there were no guidelines as to how country of origin labels were to be interpreted. Such guidance was only obtainable through court decisions on specific goods and specific claims. As a consequence, many firms were reluctant to provide country of origin information on their goods, denying themselves an important marketing tool and not providing information which a number of consumers were seeking. In addition uncertainty was preventing industry-led initiatives to re-launch the ‘Australian Made’ logo (the well known green triangle with a gold kangaroo). The 1998 amendments sought to provide some certainty on this issue, by establishing ‘safe harbour’ defences which, if met, protected firms from prosecution under s52 and s53eb of the Trade Practices Act 1974. In effect, the amendments provided a minimum legal certainty, which, if met, avoided the risk of adverse judicial interpretation of country of origin representations. (2) As noted above, the offence provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 which most directly impact on country of origin labelling are s52 (misleading and deceptive conduct) and s53eb (false and misleading representations). In assessing whether a firm should seek to avail itself of the ‘safe harbour’ defences offered by Division 1AA, consideration needs to be given as to whether the representation is potentially misleading and deceptive. Qualified claims, such as “made in Australia from imported materials” provide more information than an unqualified ‘made in Australia” claim. In some circumstances, this additional qualification is sufficient to ensure that the representation is not misleading and hence unlikely to breach either s52 or s53eb. In other circumstances, such as where little or no substantial economic activity has been undertaken on the good in Australia (ie. where the good has simply been packaged in this country) the representation is still likely to be misleading, in respect to that part of the representation that purports that the good is “made in Australia”. In the latter circumstances, the firm making the representation would not meet the requirements of the Division 1AA ‘safe harbour’ defences, and would remain at risk of legal action under s52 or s53eb. (3) The ACCC’s treatment of qualified claims does not allow goods that are simply packaged, bottled or assembled in Australia to be labelled with an unqualified “Made in Australia” label. As noted above, qualified claims are subject to all the requirements of s52 and s53eb, without recourse to the ‘safe harbour’ defences of Division 1AA. It is unlikely that a court would find that a good that is",179,Total 722 987
358,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the followingonly packaged, bottled or assembled in Australia from imported components could satisfy a ‘made in Australia from imported components’ representation with respect to s52 or s53eb. The ACCC’s treatment of qualified claims is entirely consistent with the original intent of the 1998 amendments. In determining whether the provisions of Division 1AA are applicable, consideration first has to be given as to whether the representation potentially breaches either s52 or s53eb. Qualifying a country of origin claim can reduce the risk of potential breach. If, however, the qualification does not remove the risk of a representation being misleading or deceptive, and the goods do not meet the requirements of the ‘safe harbour’ defence established in Division 1AA, then the firm making the representation remains at risk under s52 or s53eb. Defence: ANZAC Rifle Range, Malabar (Question No. 2193) Mr Brereton asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 29 November 2000: (1) Has the Commonwealth land including the ANZAC Rifle Range at Malabar been listed by the National Trust as a most important natural and cultural site on the Sydney Coast. (2) Will the Government honour its September 1998 commitment and dedicate the site for passive recreation following the relocation of the ANZAC Rifle Range to Holsworthy. (3) Will the Government ensure Malabar Headland remains open space and is available to the public for recreation. (4) Will the Government institute a plan of management for the site; if so, when; if not, why not. (5) Will the Government remediate damage to the site’s wetlands caused by the Commonwealth’s contract bulldozers during drainage work for a new leachate pond in October 2000. (6) Will the Government ensure that any future work on the site does not damage endangered plant communities and the site’s fragile wetlands. (7) What additional steps, other than signposting, will the Government take to prevent damage to parts of the site as a result of trail bike riding. (8) What are the Commonwealth’s plans for addressing site contamination including leachate. (9) Will the Commonwealth release scientific data on core samples taken from the site. (10) Will the Commonwealth agree to regular public consultations between government and local community representatives, The Friends of Malabar Headland and ensure that the future of the site is considered in an open and transparent manner. (1) The National Trust of Australia has advised that it has not classified the Commonwealth land including ANZAC Rifle Range at Malabar. The site is included in the National Trust Industrial Archaeology sites index list. (2) The then Minister for Sport and Tourism and I issued a press release on 19 September 1998 that announced a $9m Federation Fund grant for the construction of new rifle range facilities at Holsworthy and “the provision of public open space at Malabar”. The press release also announced that future ownership of the Malabar site was subject to negotiations with the State Government. The Commonwealth has not altered this position and is undertaking discussions with the State Government. (3) The Commonwealth is currently discussing the future of the Malabar site with the State government. (4) The Commonwealth is currently undertaking environmental and heritage studies in order to develop a plan of management for the site. (5) There are no listed wetlands on this site. The “wetlands” referred to in the question are man-made pollution control ponds and stormwater collection ponds. The recent works undertaken by the Commonwealth were to upgrade the current capacity of the leachate collection system and enhance environmental management of the site.",180,Total 722 987
359,Mr Fahey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) The Commonwealth will continue to ensure that works undertaken on the site do not significantly impact on the environment. (7) The Commonwealth has implemented several measures to protect the site from trail bike riding in addition to signposting. These include daily patrols and the installation of gates across site access points. (8) The Commonwealth has undertaken works that have significantly improved the leachate collection and stormwater management of the site. In addition to these works, the Commonwealth is preparing a Remediation Action Plan for the remainder of the site. (9) No core samples have been taken from the site. (10) Opportunities for stakeholder and community input in the future use of the site will be provided through the appropriate planning regime. Rural Financial Counselling Service: Funding (Question No. 2206) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 4 December 2000: (1) Will the Commonwealth’s funding for the Rural Financial Counselling Service under the Rural Communities Program end at 30 June 2001. (2) Has his Department undertaken an assessment of the Rural Counselling Service as part of its review of the Rural Communities Program; if so, (a) what were the findings and recommendations of that review and (b) how does the Government intend to respond to them. (3) In light of his Department’s review will Commonwealth funding for the Rural Counselling Service continue past 30 June 2001; if so, in what form will the service continue; if not, why not. (4) Since its inception 15 years ago, has the Rural Financial Counselling Service provided a valuable range of educational and advisory services to farmers and rural businesses, particularly in times of economic crisis like the floods that currently afflict farmers and businesses in the electoral division of Gwydir; if not, why not. (5) Is the uncertainty surrounding future funding arrangements for the Rural Counselling Service creating great anxiety in rural communities throughout Australia, and can he outline what steps the Government will be taking to ensure this important service to rural and regional Australia remains intact. (1) No. On 21 December 2000 I announced the continuation of funding for current services to 30 June 2002. (2) Yes. The Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) has completed a review of the entire Rural Communities Program (RCP) to examine its effectiveness. The review was published on 21 December 2000 and makes a number of recommendations on how the delivery of the Rural Financial Counselling Service can be enhanced. Over January and February 2001, all stakeholders will be encouraged to participate in a public consultation process on the future shape of the RCP. I have asked for submissions from interested parties to be provided by 20 February 2001. The Government will consider the recommendations of the review after the submissions have been received. (3) The Government will extend funding for current services to 30 June 2002. (4) Yes. (5) See answers to questions 1 and 2. Illegal Immigration: Assessment (Question No. 2210) Mr Danby asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 December 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to remarks made by the Inspector-General of Security, Mr Bill Blick, on the 7.30 Report on 29 November 2000.",181,Total 722 987
360,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Was a refugee at a detention centre incarcerated for 2 years on the basis of an assessment passed to Australian security from a Middle East country with a dubious human rights record. (3) Was Mr Blick’s assessment correct that this was in violation of the internal guidelines laid down in his Department for making assessments about the security risks of refugees. (4) Are there any other assessments of refugees that have been reviewed on the basis of abrogation of internal guidelines laid down by his Department after taking advice from security agencies in countries with dubious human rights records. (1) Yes (2) It is not appropriate for me to comment on immigration matters. Questions about protective visa applicants and individuals in immigration detention should be referred to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. (3) I agree that the security assessment procedures in that case were inadequate, however changes to ASIO procedures have been made to ensure that the situation is not repeated. The Inspector General stated in his Annual Report that ASIO’s review of the original assessment was rigorous and critical, and he is satisfied with the manner in which ASIO has dealt with this issue. (4) No. Australian Taxation Office: KPMG (Question No. 2211) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 December 2000: (1) Is it a fact that a KPMG partner has on 8 separate occasions succeeded in having tax officers removed from audits or reviews of his corporate clients. (2) Is it also a fact, as claimed by a senior taxation office (ATO) Executive, that this partner has been successfully playing ATO staff off against each other and misrepresenting the position of ATO staff involved in tax audits of the partners clients. (3) If so, what action will he take to ensure that KPMG clients are not able to escape paying their fair share of tax as a result of bullying and intimidation. (4) Did the ATO remove senior tax auditor Mr Bob Fitton from an audit of Daihatsu Australia, after KPMG protested about remarks Mr Fitton made following Daihatsu’s announcement that it would cease distributing vehicles in Australia. (5) Was it appropriate for the ATO to apologise to Daihatsu and to remove Mr Fitton from the case. honourable member’s question: I have responded previously to a number of questions concerning allegations of a KPMG partner asking for ATO officers to be removed from audits, and in the course of my answers I have stated the grounds upon which the ATO might consider removing an officer from an audit.

365,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Of the total amount transferred, the Child Support Agency has collected $4.186 billion from a liability of $4.82 billion (86.85%) leaving 13.15% unpaid. (2) There is a gross debt amount of $635 million that has accrued over the 12 years of the Scheme’s operation. An amount of $83 million has been written off as irrecoverable, leaving a net debt of $552 million. (3) The rate of collection of child support through CSA is steadily increasing. In 1988-91 the collection rate through CSA was only 65%, leaving 35% unpaid. Collections increased to 75% by 1994, 85% by 1999 and is now 86.85%. (4) CSA uses a number of administrative measures to collect outstanding child support. These include intercepting tax refunds, collection from third parties holding money on behalf of a parent and making deductions from a parent's salary to settle arrears. The CSA may also take recovery action through the courts if it is believed that the parent has sufficient funds or assets to satisfy any judgement made. The CSA’s approach to enforcement activity is to encourage voluntary compliance but where this fails the CSA has dedicated resources in each region to focus on collecting child support where the parent has the capacity to pay but does not do so. (5) CSA funding arrangements and requirements are constantly monitored to ensure adequate resources are available for all aspects of the assessment, collection and enforcement of child support liabilities.",184,Total 722 987
