259,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 6 p.m.,Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22667 Thursday, 9 November 2000 ----Nursing Homes: Kenilworth Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.40 a.m.)-I would like to talk about a very serious matter taking place in my electorate with respect to the Kenilworth Nursing Home. Unfortunately, reports dating back to June 1999 have outlined serious risk to the health of residents of this nursing home. Following on from the events at Riverside, such concerns should have been dealt with much more quickly than has been the case. I have seen the most recent audit report from the agency which has been looking into the care of residents at Kenilworth. Unfortunately, there are problems in a whole range of areas, including clinical care, medication management, pain management, hydration and nutrition, and skin care, particularly stopping bedsores. Too many of the residents have been restrained, both chemically and physically. One resident was seen to have been kept in a bed for two days while the audit team was there, with the bars pulled up on the side of the bed. The fire and emergency services are not adequate. I mention one particular case that is of great concern that shows dramatically what is going on in this nursing home. A resident who fell out of bed was documented as having pain for six days prior to being transferred to hospital for treatment for a broken leg. Analgesia is recorded as having been given three times within the six days, while this resident was kept in the nursing home without being sent to a hospital, which is what should have happened. This government has had report after report about this nursing home, and people are still living in this nursing home with their health at risk. It is not good enough. An administrator or a nursing adviser should have been placed in this nursing home a long time ago. The government should act now, put in an administrator and get this place cleaned up so that, at least for the residents that remain, there can be a much higher standard of nursing home care. What has happened to the residents of this nursing home is an absolute disgrace. It has occurred because of the inaction of this government; it should get in there and clean up what is a very serious problem relating to the standard of health care being given to the residents of Kenilworth Nursing Home. Petrol Prices rhetoric, lack of policy and sheer hypocrisy of the opposition in the current fuel debate. Three days ago, we saw one of the most hollow efforts of the opposition in an attempt to move the so-called petrol amendment. This was nothing more than a stunt, a leech-like act, trying to suck some blood from the recent National Party central council meeting at Kingaroy. It was not motivated by any great concern for country people; it was merely an attempt to embarrass National Party members in their electorates. The headline in the Crean-Ferguson press release of 7 November was: ‘Paul Neville betrays Hinkler voters on petrol’. No doubt this was the standard press release, with the names changing from electorate to electorate. People in Australia will not be fooled. They will remember that off-farm excise rose from 6c to 34c a litre during Labor’s 13 years in office. They will remember that Labor added 9.5c a litre in non-indexed excise increases and that excise increased by an average of 5.2 per cent a year over their 13 years in office.

If you take a line on excise based on the 13 years that Labor was in office and take it to where it would be now had they remained in office, we would be paying over 50c a litre in excise, which is simply outrageous.

Defence Estate: Maribyrnong valley in Melbourne has undergone significant rejuvenation where its environmental values and recreational opportunities are broadly recognised. This has got particular focus at the moment because of the intent of the Department of Defence to dispose of some 14 hectares of land that they have occupied for many decades in the Afton Street, Essendon, area. Consultants’ reports have been prepared in relation to that disposal. The consultants’ reports, amongst other things, point out that this particular part of land has two regionally significant remnant grassland areas and two Aboriginal archaeological sites, along with a number of other features of some considerable importance in that part of Melbourne. The defence department’s consultants’ report says: It is considered that through a sensitive and comprehensive design process it is possible to develop housing on a small portion of the site (approximately 15-20%) without detrimentally impacting on the conservation values of the river environs and the views into and out of the site. That particular proposition and desire of the defence department to generate some residential development on this site is totally rejected by the local community. It really has many significant problems to it. I will briefly make two points from amongst the number of arguments that are relevant. Firstly, to gain access to the particular portion of the site that the defence department seems to wish to develop for residential purposes, a road will need to be constructed through an area that, as recently as January 1999, has been identified as badly contaminated. The topography of the area means that that road construction would have some difficulties with it and would certainly disturb badly contaminated areas. The evidence for that is a report prepared for Melbourne Water by a company called Enetech Pty Ltd. That proposition is not on, either for present or prospective local residents.",109,Representatives Main Committee

For example, the report says: Under legislation, the optimum value of the land must be realised. That is the rationale for some residential development. A check with DOFA has established that disposal of property at full market value is a policy position only and is not required by legislation. The consultants also talk about the inability to gift the land to the local council or other interest groups. Elsewhere in their report, that is precisely what they propose for the 85 per cent of the land that is not proposed for residential purposes. So the local community is in its rights to call for the enhancement of the recreational and environmental value(Time expired) Aboriginals: Projects Aboriginal advancement. Too many projects are being set up to fail-so well meaning, but so misguided. An abundance of funds has been created by a majority of opinion motivated by an assumed guilt and the belief that through the allocation of money will come absolution. In the mid-90s, an operating citrus orchard in Wiluna in Western Australia, known as Desert Gold, was handed over to Aboriginal interests. With 20,000 prime trees, all necessary infrastructure, eight accommodation units and both grid power and emergency generators, the \HDU LVQRZLQUXLQVDEDQGRQHG I ask: who gains in such an exercise? Is it mainstream bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, infrastructure providers? It is certainly not the Aboriginal people. They are left humiliated and further accused of waste. They continue to be dependent. The welfare mentality is not helping. Highlighting this in yesterday’s Australian, Tracker Tilmouth, the former Director of the Central Land Council, says that the Northern Territory Labor Party treats its Aboriginal electorate like ‘pet niggers’ and will pay dearly for it at the polls. He says that Labor’s two Aboriginal politicians, John Ah Kit and Maurice Rioli, had been ineffective because Labor’s party machine ensured they remained ineffective. He goes on to say: For the past 20 years, we’ve all voted Labor-to our detriment. They just expect us to vote Labor. It’s a plantation mentality. Education, and the teaching of the importance of education, is the future for Aboriginal people. Education is the long-term answer. This will only be achieved through the mainstream population first understanding the facts. Communities have a collective responsibility to recognise the value of education. It is not the sole responsibility of educators to turn schools into a circus to attract children to attend. Parents must encourage their children to take advantage of all facilities, high quality and expensive facilities, both primary and secondary, to equip them for the future. Of the funded projects that fail, too often the cause is through lack of management skills or maladministration. Too often, control is given to the most influential, not to the most capable. Aboriginal leaders should have more faith in the democratic process. There is too great an imperative to get control now, fearful that the money bubble may burst. Aboriginal leaders need to appreciate that good government is here to stay and that money will continue to be allocated for meaningful projects and, with good administration and good management, those projects will be productive for Aboriginal people into the future.

Back in their electorates they are screaming blue murder over petrol prices, but here in Canberra they are doing something very different. In other words, they are here supporting the Prime Minister’s stubbornness on this issue and his refusal to give relief to the motorists who so well deserve it. I want to begin the main part of my contribution today by quoting from the webpage of the Sydney based Wine Society. It reads: The Wine Society grew out of a visionary idea and a spirit of friendship. The idea was that if a group of wine lovers got together, they could find and buy excellent wines more easily and affordably than any individual could. That is quite an admirable thing to do. The Wine Society was started in 1946 by a Sydney neurosurgeon, Dr Gilbert Phillips. Until now, the society has sold its wines only to its 55,000odd members. But that is about to change. The Wine Society is now embarking on what could be described as a commercial operation, selling fine wines to any comer, and it is using an ecommerce strategy. The question I want to pose today is this: should the Sydney based Wine Society be receiving Regional Assistance Program money to establish a wine centre in The Rocks in Sydney? The question has to be asked whether this investment will create jobs in high regions of unemployment. Will some $300,000 of Commonwealth money, designated to assist the regions, go to a wine centre in The Rocks in Sydney? I must say that Minister Jackie Kelly has already answered those questions. The Wine Society went to Minister Kelly for money under the Regional Tourism Development Program, but she decided that she was having difficulty finding any merit in the project in terms of assistance to the regions. The New South Wales Department of State and Regional Development came to the same conclusion. Whilst it is a worthy project and a project I would be happy to support in any way that I could, both Minister Kelly and the department found it very difficult to see how this project was going to assist unemployed people in the region. The last question that has to be posed is: on what basis did Minister Reith, under the Regional Assistance Program, determine that building a wine centre in The Rocks in Sydney was going to help unemployed people in regions such as my own region in the Hunter, where wine tourism is very important? I am calling upon Minister Reith today to table the application from the wine centre and disclose the basis on which he made his decision.

I am addressing the chamber today, as I was not able to conclude my speech on the last occasion I spoke in relation to this issue. As I have stated earlier in this place, the legislation sought to introduce a 12-month moratorium on the further expansion of the interactive gambling industry. The bill was not designed to rein in innovation but to protect at-risk gamblers, and therefore their friends and families, while the government broadly examined the feasibility, implications and future of the industry. The defeat of the bill was a crushing blow to families around Australia, to many of those affected by the gambling addiction of loved ones. Labor ignored the opportunity to do the right thing. Instead, responsible policy formulation was replaced by opposition for opposition’s sake. As I said previously, vulnerable individuals in our society could have been protected by a 12-month moratorium on the expansion of interactive gambling services.",111,Representatives Main Committee
271,Mrs Draper (Makin) (9.55 A.m.),"It is with grave concern that I again rise to speakThursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22671 According to the South Australian government, in 1999-2000 net revenue from pokies for the Enfield, Tea Tree Gully and Golden Grove areas was almost $32 million. These areas, located in my electorate of Makin, contain many families who suffer directly from the gambling habits of family members. The jump in accessibility to gambling offered by the Internet could lead to an increase in gambling addiction and debt in my electorate and in general across Australian society. Australians love a flutter-there is nothing wrong with that-but the setting where two lovable larrikins indulge in a back street game of two-up is far removed from the prospect of a teenager, armed with a credit card, playing poker online. The negative social implications resulting from excessive gambling plague many Australians, with one in 10 Australians affected in some way by problem gambling. According to the Productivity Commission’s final report into Australia’s gambling industries in 1999, Australians are the world’s biggest per capita gamblers, losing an average of $760 per adult. Losses now figure in excess of $11 billion, double the amount at the start of the 1990s. Australia has 290,000 problem gamblers each losing $12,000 annually and impacting on the lives of five others. The report highlighted the fact that the levels of problem gambling are linked to the accessibility and type of gambling products. Unfortunately, the opposition has made it much easier now, ensuring greater gambling access for problem gamblers. Labor has fundamentally disregarded community welfare and concern on this issue. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to commend my South Australian colleagues the Hon. Nick Zenephon MLC and the Hon. Angus Redford MLC for their comments in their dissenting statement from the conclusions of the report of the select committee on Internet and interactive home gambling and gambling by other means of telecommunication in South Australia. the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 November, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.58 a.m.)-The Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2000 seeks to introduce amendments to resolve problems that have occurred with the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service. It is intended to clarify the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Service. There has been, as members would be aware, some concern regarding the effectiveness of the conferral of administrative review jurisdiction in proceedings transferred between the two courts. This bill will give the Federal Court the power to hear applications that are referred to it by the Federal Magistrates Service under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It will also hopefully clarify the power of the Federal Magistrates Service to hear matrimonial causes transferred to it by the Family Court. In order to clarify issues of effectiveness of judgments in areas of concern highlighted by the Solicitor-General, the bill provides that judgments made without jurisdiction by the Federal Magistrates Service in such matters will have the effect of a valid decision, although I am aware that the shadow Attorney-General has raised some concern about whether or not parliament can validate those decisions in this process.",112,Representatives Main Committee
272,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,22672 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 As members will be aware, the legislation for a federal magistracy was in the House late last year and it received royal assent on 23 December. In January, the Attorney-General announced that a magistrate would be appointed in Launceston, in my electorate. Northern Tasmania-as everyone would undoubtedly be aware-has been without a permanent judge since the retirement of Justice Butler in 1996. The replacement of this judge was promised by the then Liberal member holding my seat. This promise was never fulfilled. Waiting lists in Tasmania are currently running at an unacceptably high rate, with over 100 cases in the north of the state waiting for some kind of judicial assistance. That is 100 families waiting to have their incredibly difficult and personal matters resolved so that they may get on with their lives. The Attorney-General, instead of addressing the delay by replacing our judge or following the recommendations of the Family Law Council, decided to set up this additional layer of jurisdiction, an additional layer that already needs reform in order to operate successfully. Interviews for the Launceston magistracy position took place at the beginning of the year, with the position due to start on 1 July. On1 July, a number of appointments were made, but none in Launceston. On 24 July, two other announcements were made for magistrate appointments, bringing the total appointments to 12 out of the promised 16. Again, the Launceston position was not among them. In his press release, the Attorney-General did indicate that the decision on the remaining positions would be made in the near future. It is now November and our magistrate is still not operating. Newspaper reports refer to the decision having been made, but the Attorney-General has still not announced who it is and when they will start work. Other magistrates services in other states have been exercising full jurisdiction since 3 July. It is not that I believe that the federal magistracy will actually be the salve to our family law court ills in Tasmania. I believe that the resource allocation will be inadequate but, frankly, we are so desperate for judicial assistance in Tasmania that even a magistrate with a part-time family law capacity is better than nothing. But we should expect to get something out of this process. After all, the federal government has expended $27 million to avoid replacing the vacant Family Court judge positions in Australia. The Family Court’s budgets have been slashed by some $15.4 million over four years because the Attorney-General believes their workload will be diminished by that amount. That remains to be seen. Indications that I have had are that this funding removal will make the family law court job just that much harder. Caroline Counsel of the Law Institute of Victoria was reported in the Age saying: The introduction of the federal Magistrate’s Court had badly dented family law court funding and the federal government did not understand what it cost to maintain a court charged with the very serious task of involving itself in the most intimate aspects of private life. The cuts to the Family Court have meant a loss of some 80 jobs. A journalist for the Hobart Mercury actually went to the trouble of doing a calculation based on the transfer of money from the family law court budget to the magistracy compared with that by the Federal Court, and organised a specific time allocation that the magistrate would have to deal with family law cases. The Attorney-General, however, is much more vague and has used terms such as ‘expected’ and ‘significant’ in terms of resource allocation. Either way, the creation of an additional layer of bureaucracy by making the Magistrates Court a completely separate court has created problems, not only in the judicial area but also in the practical area. There are still issues of premises, access to libraries, and staff. We fully expect that, as the court gets into full swing, other administrative issues will emerge. On the judicial level, reports in the Financial Review of June this year said that the Chief Federal Magistrate, Diana Bryant, had Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22673 already signalled that more magistrates would be needed to deal with the court’s anticipated workload. Access to judicial solutions has not been the only problem that the magistracy has faced. I understand that the federal magistracy will not have the same access to counselling services. Chief Federal Magistrate, Diana Bryant, in the aforementioned interview, also mentioned that she was dealing with the vexed problem of alternative dispute resolution and how to offer it effectively within the budget. WhilstI had understood that the magistracy would have counselling services, it appears that underresourcing might be putting at risk that valuable service. We cannot undervalue the work by Family Court counsellors, who spend time with families in crisis and who can provide appropriate reports to the court. They have proved successful in diminishing the number of cases that still require judicial resolution. This bill is about facilitating the operation of the federal magistracy. We will obviously support it. However, I am still to be convinced that the government has made appropriate decisions in managing the family law provision issue. An additional level of bureaucracy which leaves both systems underfunded cannot be the most effective resolution. In my electorate of Bass, the failure to appoint a magistrate as even a part-time measure is having a disastrous impact on families. We support this bill to assist in trying to make this system workable, but I continue to condemn the government for its ongoing disregard for the needs of Tasmanian families in crisis. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (10.04 a.m.)-On the face of it, the Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2000 is a non-controversial bill, and the opposition is supporting its passage through the parliament. Its controversy, if you can call it that, lies in the context of what is happening at a broader level with the Family Court and Family Court services in regional Australia, particularly in my electorate of Capricornia. The bill clears up a number of oversights in the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Service in relation to applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service in matrimonial causes under the Family Law Act 1975. The context this bill falls into is the relationship between the federal magistracy and the Family Court. According to the Attorney-General, the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service was designed to ease the burden of the Family Court’s workload. I think most members in this place would not argue with the fact that that workload is substantial and growing all the time and that ways need to be found to assist families in settling their disputes. The setting up of the Federal Magistrates Service involved a cut of $15.4 million from the Family Court’s budget. That cut was justified by the fact that the money was to be allocated to the federal magistracy, which would have the effect of assisting the Family Court to divest itself of some of its workload. In Rockhampton, which is the major centre in my electorate, we have seen plenty of evidence of the cuts to the Family Court budget, but we have not seen much at all in the way of replacement services for what we have lost in the Family Court area. What is happening in the registry in Rockhampton is the first obvious sign of the budget cuts to the Family Court. In Rockhampton the subregistry is attached to the Townsville registry. A few weeks ago, the subregistry office was downgraded from a full-time operation to a two day a week operation. The subregistry is now going to be open for two days a week, but for five days a week when the circuit is sitting in Rockhampton. That is about 26 weeks a year. This has already had the effect of forcing the receptionist/filing clerk, who was employed there for some years, out of that job. When you are told that your job is going to go from five days a week full time to two days a week for part of the year and five days a week for other 22674 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 parts of the year-which is still subject to negotiation over circuits and sitting dates-it is not much of an option for a highly experienced professional person. Stacey Vea Vea, who has held that job-she is very highly regarded for her competence and her compassion in always looking to assist clients coming to the Family Court registry-has been snapped up by a local firm of lawyers. They saw her skills as being too valuable to be wasted, and she certainly felt that way too. She saw the job as not being a very attractive option. At the moment, someone else is filling the role on a casual basis, and I am assured by the Family Court registry in Townsville that there will be endeavours to fill that position full time. But, given the fact that it is a fairly strange sort of job these days, it seems unlikely. We are losing not only the person doing the documentation and filing work, but all the other services the registry has traditionally offered in Rockhampton. The registry provides a lot of information to people who are experiencing family breakdown, assistance in filling out documents and in assessing the right documents people require for the situation they find themselves in. Stacey Vea Vea, who has a lot of experience and a professional manner, has assisted a lot of people with those questions and problems. I am really worried that we are losing that service, and there is not much to replace it in Rockhampton. Like most regional centres, we are not spoiled for choice in these sorts of things. Often people come in from places such as Gladstone in the electorate of the member who sits opposite, Emerald and a variety of outlying areas. They come into the registry but the door is closed, because who knows what two days of the week it is going to be open? They see the closed door, and wonder about their options in Rockhampton. Maybe they could go to Legal Aid, but it is obviously stretched as well for resources and staff, or they could go to the community legal centre. But I still think they find themselves in a fairly distressing situation after seeing that closed door at the Family Court registry, when in the past they could have gone in, had some myths dispelled and had some guidance from a professional officer of the Family Court as to the right direction in which to go. Those people would be a lot closer to getting some matters resolved and feeling more positive about being in control of the process. For those people, a lot of them self-represented litigants, seeing a closed door at the court will have a fairly negative impact on their view of just how likely it will be that they will find anything positive in the Family Court process. The other issue is that this is supposed to be some kind of budgetary measure. I do not really see that much is going to be saved. You are still going to need to pay rent on the premisesyou cannot pay rent for two days a week for half the year and five days a week for the rest of the year. You are saving a tiny amount on salary, but I think the figures just do not add up when you consider the loss in terms of the service that was being provided to the community. I am fairly unconvinced that we are ever going to see this service again in Rockhampton. The Townsville registry said, ‘Well, we’ll be getting work from Rockhampton; people will be calling us from Rockhampton,’ but there is no way of keeping statistics on that. So, when work is picked up from Rockhampton that could otherwise have been done by the Rockhampton subregistry and the Rockhampton filing clerk, there is no way of actually knowing the level of that demand. Now that we have seen the foot in the door of the downgrading of the Rockhampton subregistry, regardless of how much extra work is being generated in the Townsville or Brisbane registries, it is very difficult to see how we are ever going to demonstrate the demand in a statistical way in order to get the service back. There is some light on the horizon. According to the lawyers in Rockhampton, the federal magistracy, in particular the Federal Magistrate, who appears to be taking on the responsibility for the Rockhampton circuit, is being extremely cooperative. There is talk of Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22675 whether there can be resources used from the Federal Magistrate’s budget to support the registry in Rockhampton. That is very positive, and the lawyers in Rockhampton are certainly grateful that the Federal Magistrate is taking a fairly pragmatic view on that. But it still sounds pretty ridiculous when, in effect, money is taken from the Family Court budget to set up a Federal Magistrates Service, and now the Federal Magistrate is talking about trying to look at ways of putting money back into what is effectively the Family Court structure. The government can dress this up as much as it likes by pretending that it is offering some new, better service to Rockhampton in the form of a Federal Magistrate-there are definitely benefits, and the local practitioners are looking on it as positively as possible-but, as much as it is dressed up, it is effectively a downgrading of the services that we have enjoyed in Rockhampton in the Family Court area. It basically flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s promise to us earlier this year that there would be no cuts to services in regional Australia. Another point about the Family Court services in Rockhampton relates to counselling. Again, it is a tale of the demise of the services in our Family Court registry office. We started out with two full-time Family Court counsellors. I remember that when I first started working in family law in Rockhampton we had two excellent Family Court counsellors. They had a very high rate of settling family law disputes, and other family law practitioners have told me that they certainly found it to be the case as well. The Family Court counsellors were very well regarded professionally by the legal fraternity in Rockhampton, and that level of cooperation between the legal fraternity and the Family Court counsellors did produce a very high rate of settlement, which was something to be very proud of. Over the last couple of years it has slowly dwindled away: some Family Court counsellors left, some took leave-and these people were not replaced. We currently have a private psychologist who is contracted by the Family Court to do two days per week of court-ordered counselling. There are now definite moves towards contracting that counselling work out totally to community organisations. I met with representatives of some of the prospective counselling organisations a few weeks ago to find out their views on the work that they were being asked to do and what their needs would be if they were going to pick up this work. The feeling from those counselling organisations was a positive one, but there were very big qualifications. All of the counsellors stressed that they would need a very high level of training and support from the Family Court structure. The Family Court structure in Queensland is basically in Brisbane or Townsville, so I am not sure that the level of support needed is really going to be there for community counsellors in Rockhampton. I was really struck by the situation when one of the previous Family Court counsellors in Rockhampton-who is now a private psychologist-talked about when he started in the Family Court as a counsellor in the 1980s. He had two months of full-time training when he started in that position. I cannot see that the Family Court is going to come to those community based organisations and say, ‘Great, we’re going to pay for you to undertake two months of full-time training before we throw you in at the deep end to conduct this counselling for the Family Court.’ If that happens, that is fine, but I think it is very unlikely. Another woman at the meeting is a barrister in Rockhampton, but she is a former social worker. She talked of her experience as a social worker when Family Court counselling positions came up. Traditionally, it was only the most experienced social workers who would even consider applying for those jobs, because of the level of difficulty involved and the level of experience required in handling the really fraught and distressing personal situations that people were being confronted with. My real concern is that the optimism shown by the community based counsellors at this meeting seemed to be based on a fairly hopeful and 22676 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 flimsy premise that there was going to be a very high level of training and support from the Family Court. My real fear is that this is not a genuine attempt by the Family Court to explore new and better ways of dealing with family breakdown. It is really just a flick pass: it is the Family Court trying to cut corners-to cut money out of the counselling services and save money. I feel for the community based counselling services in that scenario, and I also feel for the families who rely on counselling to try and resolve their situations in the most amicable and practical ways possible. Obviously, Family Court counselling is very different from the relationship counselling which the community organisations are currently engaged in: you cannot disconnect it from the legal process that is going on. The counsellor is not just concentrating on the relationship of those people in a vacuum; it is totally connected to the legal process going on, and the outcome of the counselling session has to be fed back into the legal process-either in terms of resolving the dispute between the two partners or in terms of reporting back to the court for ongoing legal determinations. SoI think it is a quantum leap between the sort of relationship counselling that organisations like Relationships Australia and Anglicare are currently engaged in and the role that they would be expected to perform for the Family Court if they take on the court’s kind of counselling work. A very high and comprehensive level of training will be required for those counsellors to take on that role. The other aspect of counselling is the relationship between the Federal Magistrates Service and counselling. It appears that there is no specific provision at this stage for the federal magistracy to include a counselling service. Before we in Central Queensland completely put our faith in the Federal Magistrates Service as the answer to Family Court matters and dealing with Family Court cases, I would really want to know how counselling will be incorporated into the Federal Magistrates Service. Is there going to be a fee for service from those community based counselling organisations? If so, where is that money coming from out of the Federal Magistrates Service budget? This issue is one that came up when I met with lawyers recently. They feel that the current lack of clarity on that issue puts them in a quandary. They are quite attracted by the idea of being able to have a very regular service from the Federal Magistrate, to get family law matters dealt with quickly and expeditiously. But they do not want then to deprive their clients of the prospect of having counselling as well, as part of finding an outcome or a settlement to their issues. The lawyers in Rockhampton that I spoke to are really proud of the level of settlement, without having to go through the full court process, that is achieved. They have a very cooperative relationship amongst the legal practitioners in Rockhampton and have traditionally had a very cooperative relationship with the Family Court counsellors and, currently, the psychologist who is doing the Family Court counselling on a contract basis. I was certainly very pleased and proud of the lawyers’ attitude when Robert McClelland and I had a meeting with them a couple of weeks ago. Their concern was all about their clients, about the families that they saw coming to them, needing help to settle their differences. It is certainly not about increasing the level of Family Court services in Rockhampton just so that we can ramp up litigation in the town; it is really about making sure that there are appropriate, affordable and accessible services for the families that are needing the help. The lawyers have expressed their concerns to me and have vowed to join with me in fighting to keep this issue alive, to make sure that our registry is not downgraded and to ensure that counselling services are available to families, whether it is through the community based organisations or through the Family Court-as long as the Family Court does not see counselling as just another way to slash and burn and save pennies. Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22677 If it is a genuine attempt to find new ways of settling family disputes, community based organisations may be able to play a role in that. But if it is, as I suspect, just a cost cutting measure, a flick pass of the Family Court’s responsibilities, you will certainly be hearing a lot more about it from me and from the legal fraternity and community of Rockhampton. This is just another cut to our services and we have seen it too many times not to recognise the thin edge of the wedge. We do not want to see the other end of the wedge. We are going to keep fighting for our counselling services and for our registry services. Amendments) Bill 2000 clarifies the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Service with respect to applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Decisions) Review Act 1977 and the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service in matrimonial causes under the Family Law Act 1975. More specifically, it clarifies that the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to hear applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Decisions) Review Act that are transferred to it by the Federal Magistrates Service, and the Federal Magistrates Service in turn has jurisdiction to hear such applications as are transferred by the Federal Court. The bill also clarifies that the Federal Magistrates Service has jurisdiction to hear matrimonial causes transferred to it by the Family Court. The amendments regarding this jurisdiction were made by the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999 and the Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999. The courts and the Law Council of Australia were consulted during the drafting of these bills. The bills were publicly available for over six months before they were passed by parliament and were the subject of scrutiny by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which received over 20 submissions. No issue was raised with the government about the effectiveness of the conferral of this particular jurisdiction. However, recently, and prior to the introduction of this bill, it came to light that there might have been some issues about the effectiveness. The government was advised that there was some slight uncertainty about the effectiveness of the conferral of the administrative review jurisdiction in proceedings which were transferred between the courts. The advice the government received was that although the conferral of the matrimonial causes jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Service in transferred proceedings is more likely than not to be effective, this is not entirely certain. Hence, the amendments in the bill before the Committee are being made purely to clarify these areas of jurisdiction for the avoidance of doubt in the future. However, the government does not wish there to be uncertainty about the effectiveness of judgments made in cases that the Federal Magistrates Service has already heard in these areas of its jurisdiction. Whilst no applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act have been transferred by the Federal Magistrates Service to the Federal Court, such applications have been transferred from the Federal Court to the Federal Magistrates Service, and matrimonial causes proceedings have been transferred from the Family Court to the Federal Magistrates Service. So, in order to avoid any doubt about the effectiveness of judgments made in these cases, the bill provides that any such judgments made without jurisdiction by the Federal Magistrates Service will have the effect of a valid decision. This approach has been adopted in the past to deal with possibly ineffective judgments, and the approach has been approved by the High Court. Additionally, under the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Federal Magistrates Service can only award damages of up to a monetary limit of $200,000, or such other amount as is prescribed, in respect of proceedings instituted in the court. Whilst the intention was that this limitation apply to all trade practices proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Service, there was some doubt as to whether it applies to proceedings transferred to the Federal Magistrates",113,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (10.23 A.m.),"The Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous22678 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 Service by the Federal Court. The opportunity has therefore been taken in this bill to make an amendment to clarify this. The other members who have contributed to this debate, notably the members for Barton, Bass and Capricornia, have taken the opportunity accorded by this bill to raise a range of issues unrelated specifically to what are fairly mechanical provisions in the bill in relation to the transfer of jurisdiction. They have taken the opportunity to raise other matters concerning the Family Court more generally, and the Federal Magistrates Service. Whilst the precise matters in the bill are merely seeking to ensure clarification by way of their nature, it is true that the Federal Magistrates Service and the Family Court remain matters of great importance to the government and members on the government side of the House. I believe that the Federal Magistrates Service is something which we can be very proud of having initiated in this country and, contrary to some of the advice which has been proffered by members of the opposition, the Federal Magistrates Service is delivering real results into the Australian community. In just its first few months of operation the service has become an increasingly important part of the Australian justice system. To date, in the family law area alone, over 7,000 applications have been filed with the service, and in the non-family law area, over 500 applications have been filed. In addition, several hundred applications have been transferred from the Family Court and Federal Court to the service. This is in the context of a long process of review of the way in which the Family Court is operated in Australia. The honourable member for Banks, the honourable the Attorney General and I were members of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. We all know there has been a review of the way in which the Family Court has operated. There was a joint select committee of the parliament that looked into that, and there has been an ongoing process. One would expect this as a natural course, given that the Family Court of Australia was established back in 1975. Twenty-five years have passed and, therefore, one does need this ongoing review of that court, of the justice system generally, and of the way in which it delivers to the people of Australia. One can recall that the purpose behind the Family Court at the time was to achieve a number of things. One was, as part of the implementation of a new system of family law replacing the old Matrimonial Causes Act 1959, to make access to the courts better and simpler in an area which contains and has surrounding it sometimes great personal and emotional trauma for the parties concerned, not the least of which are the children, with some 150,000 involved indirectly through their parents in Family Court proceedings each year. As well as bringing about better access, it was also to remove some of the undesirable aspects of the old matrimonial causes system and to simplify the process. What was propounded and what was proffered to the people of Australia back in 1974-75 was that this would be a simple system, that it would have a grassroots aspect to it, so there would be easy access to justice. As a process of the reviews which have gone on-and I compliment the Attorney-General for having brought forward this Magistrates Court legislation for the federal system-I believe what we are doing in Australia is returning to some great extent to what was actually held out, to what the promise was, back in 1974-75: that there would be some immediate access to justice that would have some community involvement so far as this matter was concerned. Therefore, the objections, some of which have been raised by the members for Barton, Bass and Capricornia, to various aspects of this ought to be taken in the context of the historical background of what was being attempted, particularly in the Family Court, in 197475, the process of review that has gone on, and the commitment of the government to try and achieve access to justice in this area in a way which perhaps has been clouded by subsequent events and experience over the last 25 years. Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22679 I note that the Attorney is here and I am sure that he will have comments to make in relation to those speeches by the honourable members opposite that I have referred to. Rather than both of us address the same issue, it might be to the advantage of the House if the Attorney addresses those matters rather than I do. I just wanted to put it in that broad context-which I would have been able to do for the next 10 minutes if need be, but, given that the Attorney is here, that brief outline of the historical basis of the legislation will suffice. On that note, I am happy to indicate my support for the bill before the House and urge all honourable members to do likewise. member for Menzies for his very useful comments. I thank all those who have spoken on the Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2000. For a bill that is noncontroversial it seems to have generated a lot of debate about matters that are not directly relevant, but, in any event, I thank the members for Barton, Bass, Capricornia and Menzies. The bill deals with some specific areas of jurisdiction of the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Service. It will clarify that the Federal Court has jurisdiction with respect to applications under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 that are transferred from the Federal Magistrates Service. It will clarify that the Federal Magistrates Service has jurisdiction with respect to applications under the judicial review act that are transferred from the Federal Court and also with respect to matrimonial causes under the Family Law Act 1975 that are transferred from the Family Court. In addition, the bill will clarify that a limitation applies to the amount of damages that the Federal Magistrates Service can award in trade practices matters transferred from the Federal Court. The members for Barton, Bass and Capricornia have taken the opportunity to raise a range of issues, unrelated to the bill, concerning the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service. BeforeI address those concerns, I would like to say that, while this bill is merely clarificatory in nature, issues concerning the Federal Magistrates Service are very important to the government. That service is an initiative of which I believe we can be justifiably proud, and I welcome the support of the member for Menzies in that regard. Contrary to the rhetoric offered by the opposition, the Federal Magistrates Service is delivering real results to the community. In just a few months of operation, the service is becoming an increasingly important part of the Australian judicial system. To date, in the family law area, over 7,000 applications have been filed with the service. In the non-family law area, over 500 applications have been filed. In addition, several hundred applications have been transferred from the Family Court and the Federal Court to the service. Contrary to the dire predictions of the opposition, the service is helping Australian families resolve their family break-ups quickly and cheaply. It is giving those in the community who are discriminated against a cost-efficient and time-effective means of challenging those who discriminate against them. Importantly, it has introduced an element of flexibility and variety for the resolution of disputes under Commonwealth law into the Australian judicial system. While the member for Barton claims the service has been a waste of money, I am sure that those who have been through its doors would disagree. The member for Barton suggested that part of the government’s motivation in establishing the service was to deflect public attention from the Family Court. I can assure him this is completely untrue. The government established the Federal Magistrates Service because it is the most efficient way of handling the increasing volume of less complex matters in the Federal Court and the Family Court. Quite simply, there was a need in the community and the Federal Magistrates Service addresses that need. I do not consider providing additional judicial resources to deal with such cases to be a waste of funds, as suggested by the member for Barton.",119,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.33 a.m.)-in reply-I thank the22680 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 The member for Barton questioned why the government did not appoint magistrates to the Family and Federal courts rather than establishing the Federal Magistrates Service. As was indicated in the extensive parliamentary debate on the bills to establish the service, the government did consider the possibility of appointing magistrates within the existing courts. There were, in fact, two levels of judges within the Family Court when it was first created. The distinction was quickly lost and the judges are now at the same level. Going back to two levels of judges within the existing court would, in any case, have seriously limited the scope for cultural change and innovation. The Federal Magistrates Service is developing a new culture, with an emphasis on userfriendly, streamlined procedures. The service is operating in a manner which is as informal as possible while consistent with the discharge of judicial functions. This could not have been achieved by appointing magistrates to the existing federal courts. Indeed, my discussions with members of the profession since the service began operating have further reinforced the importance of this cultural change. The service is making a difference because it is seen as offering an alternative, not merely a lesser level of existing court services. The member for Barton also queried why the government did not give state magistrates more jurisdiction instead of establishing a new court, suggesting that the government had failed to consider this option. The government considered and rejected the alternative of expanding the family law jurisdiction of state magistrates. The government believed that giving additional jurisdiction to existing state magistrates would be a more expensive option than establishing the Federal Magistrates Service. Complex agreements would have been needed with each state and territory, and additional costs would have been involved in training state magistrates, who would not necessarily have been appointed on the basis of their experience with federal law, and it would not have resulted in a different kind of court service being offered to family law litigants. The member for Barton mentioned that he thought that practical difficulties would arise between the Federal Magistrates Service, the Federal Court and the Family Court with respect to liaison regarding files and the sharing of premises, libraries and staff. The Federal Magistrates Service was open for business in most locations on 3 July 2000, as planned. Magistrates have been sitting since July in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Newcastle, Parramatta, Townsville and Sydney, and on circuit to several regional locations. The service and the Family and Federal Courts have worked closely and cooperatively to ensure that the service was up and running quickly. The member for Barton referred to an interview in the Financial Review with the Chief Federal Magistrate in which he mentioned that there were some teething problems in integrating the service with the systems of the Federal and Family Courts. I point out that that interview was conducted in June this year, before the service was operational. Several months have passed since then. Administrative arrangements have been successfully negotiated with the Federal and Family Courts. These include arrangements about sharing of accommodation, courtrooms and libraries. I understand that these arrangements are working smoothly and that any teething problems have been resolved. Indeed, I have been impressed by the spirit of cooperation and coordination which has been evident in the way in which the different courts are working together to ensure that litigants are given the smoothest possible access to the different services that the courts offer. The member for Barton mentioned that cuts have been made to the Family Court’s budget and that this may result in some staff losses. The reduction in the Family Court’s resources reflects funds transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service, as well as savings from the abolition of wholesale sales tax. It was always intended that some resources would be moved Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22681 from both the Family Court and the Federal Court to the Federal Magistrates Service, as the service will be doing work that would otherwise be undertaken by the existing courts. The amount transferred from the Family Court includes some resources associated with registrars appointed by the Family Court as an interim measure pending establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service. While some of the funding for those positions has been transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service, the Family Court has also decided to retain some registrar positions. The Family Court is an independent agency responsible for its own administration. No direction has been given, or could be given, on how to achieve efficiencies. The member for Barton also indicated that he thought there might be problems with potential cuts by the Family Court to regional circuits and queried whether the Federal Magistrates Service would have the resources to fill any gaps in regional circuits which might result. I am advised that the Family Court has recently conducted a review of its existing circuits. As a consequence of the review, I am advised that changes to circuit arrangements have been made in some areas, taking into account factors such as waiting times at the particular locality, the waiting time between circuits, and the nearest Family Court registry. The Federal Magistrates Service is already providing circuits to some regional areas. The Family Court and the service are working closely together to consider the best way of providing circuits to regional areas. For example, the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Service have already coordinated their circuit arrangements in regional Victoria to ensure that an adequate balance of circuits continues to be provided. With regard to counselling services, the Family Court has advised that it is examining the potential for providing services in partnership with community organisations and it is consulting with the community on options for the future delivery of those services. This move is being made in recognition by the Family Court that providing a pre-filing counselling service is not its core business. It is moving to community partnerships for such services. The court has advised that it will maintain services wherever possible, particularly in rural and regional areas, but it is exploring how best they can be delivered. The government provides funding to community organisations for counselling and mediation services in family law matters. The government will continue to work with the Family Court and community organisations to develop a comprehensive approach to the provision of those services. There are many community organisations that have been providing family and child counselling under government funded programs for a number of years. The claim made by the member for Barton that they may lack sufficient expertise to properly carry out such counselling is quite insulting to them and I reject it. The government has more confidence in the skills of specialist counselling services than the opposition seems to have. In the government’s view, these are organisations whose counselling staff are both dedicated and qualified to assist families in breakdown. The member for Barton’s comments about them do them a grave disservice. I agree with the member for Barton on one point: it is vital that as many litigants as possible be diverted from the judicial system to resolving their own disputes, particularly in family law. This will continue to be a centrepiece of the government’s aim in family law dispute resolution policy, and we will continue to make use of specialists outside the adversarial court system to assist in that process. The member for Barton stated that he was concerned that the Federal Magistrates Service does not have sufficient resources to provide primary dispute resolution services such as counselling. The claim made by the member for Barton that the service is not offering counselling is totally untrue. In fact, the service is using the primary dispute resolution services of the Family Court. This includes services for counselling and for conciliation. 22682 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 Additionally, in excess of $1 million over three years has been allocated to the service for primary dispute resolution services provided by community bodies. These arrangements are in addition to funding to be provided to legal aid commissions and directly to community organisations. My department has also been holding discussions with the Federal Magistrates Service about their priorities for the primary dispute resolution-that is, PDR-funding. Further discussions will be held to advance the development of the service and to ensure that it has the resources available to provide PDR services as and when required. The members for Barton and Capricornia expressed concern about possible cuts to family law services in Rockhampton in particular. As I have said, the Family Court of Australia is an independent agency responsible for its own administration. It is therefore a matter for the Chief Justice to decide how court services are best delivered in regional centres like Rockhampton. I understand that the Federal Magistrates Service has already started conducting circuits to Rockhampton, which would be listed to fit in with the timing of Family Court circuits. With respect to counselling services, I am also advised that the Family Court is not proposing to withdraw from its responsibilities for counselling services in this area, but is consulting with the community on options for the future delivery of counselling services in Rockhampton. This includes the possibility of providing services in partnership with community organisations. There is no proposal to scale back the level of counselling services available in Rockhampton. The members for Barton and Capricornia mentioned that the Family Court’s registry in Rockhampton had recently been reduced to being open for two days a week when there were no circuits being conducted. I understand that this change was made because there was not sufficient filing or other work to occupy a full-time staff member. I have no doubt that the Family Court will ensure that suitable arrangements are made for the filing of documents and the provision of other services to suit the convenience of practitioners and members of the public in the region. The member for Bass raised the issue of the sufficiency of family law services in Tasmania. I understand that the resident Family Court judge in Tasmania was unavailable earlier this year but the Family Court had made other arrangements to ensure that matters could still be heard. This included the Chief Justice and other judges sitting in Tasmania. The court also used videoconferencing equipment for some processes such as directions hearings. The resident judge is now back on duty and I understand that he has been hearing cases. The Federal Magistrates Service will help reduce backlogs in the courts and help ease the workload of the Family Court because it will be able to deal with many matters currently heard by the Family Court. Since the Federal Magistrates Service has been operational, the Family Court and the service have been liaising closely to ensure that Tasmania has received sufficient coverage of family law services. The Federal Magistrates Service is providing services in Tasmania both on circuit and through video and audio conferencing. In fact, I understand that the Chief Federal Magistrate herself has conducted hearings in Launceston and Hobart and will be sitting in Launceston again later this month. I expect to announce the appointment of the federal magistrate to be located in Launceston in the very near future. I mention again that the amendments contained in the bill are being made purely to clarify the areas of jurisdiction dealt with in the bill for the avoidance of any doubt. The government’s advice is that existing judgments of the Federal Magistrates Service in these areas of jurisdiction should be treated as valid and that it is more likely than not that the jurisdiction is already validly conferred. However, the government does not wish there to be any uncertainty about the effectiveness of judgments made in cases that the Federal Thursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22683 Magistrates Service has already heard in these areas of jurisdiction. To avoid this, the bill provides that any such judgments made without jurisdiction by the Federal Magistrates Service will have the effect of a valid judgment. Having supported the establishment of the service in the parliament, the opposition appears to be having second thoughts. The government does not share the opposition’s misplaced misgivings about the efficacy of the Federal Magistrates Service. Quite the contrary; the government is extremely pleased with the performance of the service in its first few months of operation. I believe the community is well pleased. I believe the community will be looking to the government to expand the Federal Magistrates Service in the future. Again, I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the bill and I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Motion (by Mr Ronaldson) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Carers Allowance: Eligibility Mrs Jacqueline Davies of Picnic Point, concerning the Commonwealth carer payment. Mrs Davies cares for her husband Warren Davies, aged 62 years, who has non-functioning polycystic kidneys with end stage renal failure. The nature of the care is that Mrs Davies must prepare her husband for peritoneal dialysis four times daily. Each time he showers, she must be on hand to disinfect his catheter site. Mrs Davies monitors and administers his medication and prepares the specialised meals appropriate for a person without functioning kidneys. Mr Davies lacks manual dexterity and cannot carry out these functions. Mr Davies has been a recipient of the disability support pension for over two years, and Mrs Davies has received a carer payment for a similar period. In July this year, Mrs Davies’s entitlement to the carer payment was subjected to a standard review conducted by Centrelink. On 28 July, Centrelink cancelled Mrs Davies’s carer payment, and an authorised review officer affirmed this decision on 18 August. The law concerning carer payment was changed by the Howard government in July 1999 and now requires that the adult carer receiver be assessed and rated using the adult disability assessment tool. The basis of the cancellation of Mrs Davies’s carer payment was Centrelink’s assessment that, when applying the adult disability assessment tool, Mr Davies did not score the required 25 points. On 25 August 2000, Mrs Davies lodged an application with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to have Centrelink’s decision to cancel her carer payment reversed. The tribunal found that the care required for Mr Davies did in fact score above 25 points, using the adult disability assessment tool, but that the score obtained from the treating health professional questionnaire was only 4.50. This second eligibility test, filled out by Mr Davies’s treating doctor, was assessed at below the required score of at least 10. The problem with this second assessment was that the questionnaire provided to the treating doctor was too restrictive. In a letter dated 26 July 2000, Mr Davies’s treating doctor stated that both the dialysis treatment and the preparation of Mr Davies’s high protein, low",121,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.50 A.m.),"I rise to speak on behalf of one of my constituents,22684 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 phosphate diet were very time consuming but that, ‘There is absolutely no provision on the health professional assessment form to include any of these crucial details.’ We have here the perfect example of red tape making a legitimate carer’s life more difficult than it need be. The new assessment tool introduced by the Howard government in July 1999 does not allow the treating doctor to fully explain the needs of the patient. In effect, the change in eligibility of Mrs Davies to receive a carer payment was not based on any change in the care required by her husband or her ability to provide that care but rather on the change of Centrelink form. This is a scandal. This compassionate, conservative government has allowed a scandal to develop by changing the form. What it is about is denying people their legitimate benefits. This is what the Social Security Appeals Tribunal found. Paragraph 16 states: There is no disagreement about the nature and extent of care required by Mr Davies and provided by his wife. The evidence of the health professionals and Mrs Davies makes it clear that Mr Davies’ life and well-being depend on his wife providing the care that she does and that there are no services in the community which could do so. The tribunal goes on to say at paragraph 25: The tribunal accepts on the basis of the totality of the evidence that Mrs Davies personally provides constant care on a daily basis for her husband Warren. Under this government and Centrelink and the way they have constructed the new forms, she does not get the carer pension. Why? Because a health professional could not put all the facts forward. This is a scandal that has to be remedied. What annoys me is that Centrelink at the moment seem to be doing everything in their power to take people off benefits. So instead of having compassion, they are using red tape to disqualify people from benefits they should get in due course. They are changing the forms to restrict the health care professionals from providing proper, full material to decision makers in an excuse for uniformity. The argument is that articulate people are getting benefits. So if we get a tick in the box, we will get fewer benefits. It has to be fixed. It is a scandal.

(Time expired) Ballarat Electorate: University of Ballarat Ballarat Electorate: Governor of Victoria Export Awards 2001 have just been released and there is some fantastic news for the University of Ballarat. In five years the University of Ballarat has moved from 37th place in the ARC grants, as measured by dollars per academic staff member, to 16th. With SPIRT grants, the University of Ballarat now ranks number one in grants per hundred staff and second in terms of dollars per staff member. The majority of the grants for the university are for research in and for regional communities, and the progress of the university, quite frankly, has been nothing short of absolutely sensational and spectacular. The University of Ballarat now ranks above La Trobe, RMIT and VUT and ahead of all other regionally based universities. This is a tribute to the dedication of the staff at the University of Ballarat and reflects on the acceptance of the university community and the wider community of the role that the University of Ballarat plays in a very extended region. The university community has taken up the challenge. They have accepted the responsibility for regional communities and, conversely, the people of the wider Ballarat region are also looking at the university as a very significant regional development leader.",125,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Ronaldson (Ballarat) (10.55 A.m.),"The ARC results rankings benchmarked forThursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22685 This is fantastic news. It reinforces the fact that you do not have to live in Melbourne or Sydney or the other capital cities to get a great education. It also means that regional communities are taking up the challenge of looking after themselves, of supporting their own communities, and of driving regional development in regional centres-and we are doing it very well. My congratulations to everyone at the University of Ballarat. More good news-and the good news just keeps on rolling: earlier this week in the 2000 Governor of Victoria Export Awards, two Ballarat based organisations-the only two regionally based organisations in Victoria-received awards at the Governor of Victoria Export Awards. Gekko Systems, a new and innovative company in my electorate, won the minerals award and Sovereign Hill won an honourable mention. I am sure some honourable members might say that they have not been to Sovereign Hill-I think the member for Port Adelaide, who is in the chamber, has actually been to Sovereign Hill because he and I have talked about this before, and he has quite rightly spoken very highly of Sovereign Hill and other areas that surround it. Mr Sawford interjectingTaylor from Sovereign Hill was there and, quite justifiably, she was very excited; and Elizabeth Lewis-Gray, the executive director of Gekko, accepted the award for Gekko. The Ballarat Courier said of Gekko: The company specialises in the design, development and distribution of mineral processing equipment and systems with a particular focus on gravity separation. members that our unemployment rate has dropped from some 16 per cent or 17 per cent under the Labor Party down to about eight per cent. I say that is still too high-we have still got a lot of work to do-but it is most certainly a significant improvement. We want to get to a position in Ballarat where everyone who wants a job is able to access one. Sovereign Hill has been a leader in export. It is an export industry. As for Gekko Systems, I have been to the Gekko plant and it is absolutely fascinating to see new Australian technology taken to the world. The machines, both large and small, are operated in some of the most remote parts of the world where they are being used very effectively-another example of great Australian industries driving exports for the future of this country. place at a macro level, it must be aware of the implications at the micro level-at the local level. No aspect of public policy demonstrates this better than health policy. Take, for example, the snapshot of the Northern Hospital in my electorate in the suburb of Epping. There were 9,893 patients treated at the emergency department of the Northern Hospital in the June 2000 quarter; 175 patients had to wait longer than 12 hours in the emergency department for a bed-this was up from 96 in the June 1999 quarter. The emergency department went on to bypass four times in that quarter, which is down from six in the quarter before. There were 864 people on the waiting list for urgent and semi-urgent surgery, up from 769 in the previous quarter; 334 of the semi-urgent cases have been on the waiting list longer than 90 dayslonger than the ideal time. At the Austin repat hospital, which also services the local area, there were 325 cases of semi-urgent classified patients having been on the waiting list longer than 90 days. Regrettably, these statistics are the legacy of the Commonwealth government’s health policy, coupled with seven years of damage to Victoria’s health system by the Kennett government’s bed cuts, staff reductions and massive underspending on health. It takes time to",126,Representatives Main Committee

280,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (11.00 A.m.),"When the federal government puts policies into22686 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 turn around this neglect. Following the biggest boost to health expenditure in Victoria in a decade, the Bracks government put an additional $60 million into the public hospital budget this year to open up beds and tackle excessive waiting times. Generally, there has been some improvement in emergency department performance overall, as has been indicated by the June quarter statistics, but the problem is still there. The additional problem that Victoria faces is that it is not getting its fair share of nursing home beds from the Commonwealth. This is responsible for enormous strains on the public health system. For instance, the waiting list for institutional aged care places has increased from in the order of 31 days to 55 days. There is a shortage of something like 1,500 Commonwealth nursing home and hostel beds in Victoria. This leads to older patients inappropriately waiting in hospital wards, sometimes for up to two months. This phenomenon of bed blockage is contributing to the way in which the waiting lists are continuing to increase and to the inappropriate use of the acute care beds. The statistics for the Northern Hospital demonstrate quite clearly the abject failure of the private health insurance rebate but, more importantly, the other piece of Commonwealth policy that we need to look at, as I have said, is the shortfall in the number of hostel and nursing home beds. In the north-east region of Melbourne-the municipalities of Banyule, Nillumbik, Whittlesea and Darebin-the government's own target indicates that there should be 3,115 beds. At the moment, there are only 2,710-that is a shortfall of 405 beds for institutional aged care. Until we see Victoria getting its proper share of the moneys for aged care, and until we see the Commonwealth government realising that the policies that it has put in place have had no real effect on the performance of public hospitals, there will be no improvement. As I said, the private health insurance rebate has failed. Despite the fact that the percentage of Victorians with private health insurance rose from 31.1 per cent to 40 per cent from the March to June quarters, the number of public patient numbers rose by 3.6 per cent in the same period. Therefore, it is clear that the rebate is doing nothing to ease the pressure on hospitals like the Northern Hospital and the Austin repat. Until we have an understanding from the Commonwealth government that it should be entering into partnerships with state governments like the Victorian government who wish to see an increase and an improvement in the performance of its public hospital system, these figures will not turn around. Australian Labor Party: Queensland House of Representatives, the member for Rankin lamentably tried to execute a ham-fisted, general scattergun attack on the Liberal Party in Queensland. I will not give credence to any of his comments; needless to say, I think he has been badly misinformed and his information is based on the wrong premise. The member for Rankin and others in the Australian Labor Party, as they start to panic about the reality of the Shepherdson inquiry and associated allegations, need to understand that there is a series of very clear differences between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. The Liberal Party in Queensland has no requirement for membership to participate in any ballot to be on the electoral roll in the area in which that ballot is taking place. In the case of the Liberal Party in Queensland, members choose their own level of involvement in activities. They are not factionally controlled, and they are not told, as individual members, what they should do. The Liberal Party believes very strongly in the role of the individual, while the Labor Party believes in the concept of the collective and enforces it in every possible way. Also, the Australian Labor Party is trying to judge the Liberal Party by its own standards.",127,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.05 A.m.),"Last night, in the adjournment debate in theThursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22687 The Labor Party in Queensland is also heavily embarrassed by the fact that it used those from minority ethnic groups as a form of ethnic branch stacking, which is something that simply does not happen in the Liberal Party in Queensland. In fact, by the ALP’s own standards, it is attempting to condemn the Queensland Liberal Party’s ability to attract a wide range of people from a broad cross-section of the local community. The Liberal Party in Queensland has had success in endorsing a number of people from ethnic backgrounds into seats that can be won. At the next state election David Lin, a candidate in Stretton, will defeat the Socialist Left candidate Stephen Robertson; and Steven Huang, who is also from Taiwan and is the candidate in Mount Gravatt, will beat the Socialist Left candidate Judy Spence. It is worth knowing that the Australian Labor Party leave themselves wide open with the simple observation of their panic as the Shepherdson inquiry continues. The member for Rankin has also left himself open to some of the clear questions that he needs to answer. The allegation is very clear that, during the Mundingburra by-election, which is the focus of the Shepherdson inquiry, the member for Rankin worked on that campaign as a staff member for then Premier Goss-at taxpayers’ expense, I suspect. He also had a close working relationship with-and may even have stayed with; it would be interesting to see if that is true-Andy Keogh, who has confessed to electoral fraud and has been given a 10-year suspended sentence for that. Questions have also been raised about whether or not the member for Rankin may then have been witness to some of the things in the allegations currently being tested by the Shepherdson inquiry. Certainly, he was there when it all happened. The member for Rankin, in his ham-fisted attack last night, has left himself wide open to answer those questions. When you add those to the other questions that Queensland Labor representatives in this place have to answer, you can again see why panic has set in in Labor Party ranks. The member for Griffith has people within his ranks and his constituency who have been enrolled in a dodgy fashion. I certainly hope that the member for Griffith has not been a beneficiary of his faction’s activities in this regard-people enrolled by Lee Birmingham and Warwick Powell in the areas in and around the electorate of Griffith and, in some cases, within my own electorate. The member for Lilley, who gave a personal explanation in very carefully crafted words yesterday to try and evade the fact that he was the assistant state secretary and the campaign director of the Labor Party over the various yearsthe Shepherdson inquiry is dealing and about which other allegations are being made now, and that means that the member for Lilley is obviously very cognisant of his own concerns in this regard. yesterday when the member for Lilley refuted that outrageous allegation, is it proper that, in this Main Committee, that untruth be stated again? that the member for Lilley refuted the allegation, but that does not stop other members, if they believe the truth to be different, from continuing in that way. Shepherdson inquiry involve the time in which he was the state secretary.

287,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.10 A.m.),"I rise today to place on record my concern22688 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 from the 2001 National Rugby League competition. I believe this tragic decision is a loss not just for South Sydney but for Rugby League, for the community and indeed for the legal system. There are no winners from last Friday’s decision. It is about time that those who control Rugby League actually listen to public opinion and act in the interests of the game. South Sydney lost last Friday in the Federal Court, and I declare an interest as a member of the South Sydney Rugby League Board. However, this Sunday we will be taking this issue to the court of public opinion-the streets of Sydney. We will be gathering at Redfern Oval at noon to march to the Sydney Town Hall for a rally at 1 p.m. I expect that the figure of 40,000-the number of people who marched last October-at least will be matched on Sunday. The court decision appears to suggest that perceived corporate interests can override community and moral concerns. This is one decision which cannot go unchallenged. The issue is about much more than sport. It goes to the very heart of the alienation which people are feeling about our society. It is indeed about whether the dollar can override all human and social relationships. It is against the history, spirit and tradition of Rugby League. No organisation can survive without its soul, and South Sydney is indeed, as the world’s most successful Rugby League team, the soul of National Rugby League. Rugby League certainly cannot survive if it is alienated from its supporters. The current Rugby League World Cup, in which countries such as Russia, Lebanon and the Cook Islands, et cetera, have teams in spite of having no Rugby League competition and no Rugby League players, is a farce. The fact is that a number of Rugby League players in Australia were rung up and asked which country they would play for-shopping around-even though they had no link at all to those nations. The lack of interest in the World Cup shows the farcical nature of the National Rugby League leadership and how out of touch they are with the fans. Last Friday was unique in that a Federal Court decision was televised live nationally on two channels. But, at the same time, no-one cares about the result of a game such as Australia versus Russia-110 to four-either at the game or at home watching it on TV. It shows where the whole thing went wrong in Super League in 1995-this view that Rugby League was a world game and that Andrew Ettinghausen, we were told, would be as well known internationally as Michael Jordan. It was never possible. Rugby League is a game played in Sydney, Brisbane, the coastal and country areas of those two states, Auckland and parts of England, but nowhere else. That does not mean it is not important. That does not mean that it does not play a vital role in the lives of those people who I am proud to march with on Sunday and who I was proud to stand with last Friday at South Sydney Rugby League Club-people who had their hearts broken by this callous decision. The courts should not be making the decision, of course. The NRL can put South Sydney in the competition tomorrow. The Auckland Warriors fell over because they could not even pay their players from last year. They have renamed the team ‘New Zealand Warriors’ in order to get out of their financial obligations. At the same time, a team like Souths is told that there is no place for them in the competition. The leadership of the NRL is out of touch. The head of the NRL, David Moffatt, could not even be bothered coming to the court to hear the decision, showing contempt for those people-those battling Australians-who have gone out and fought for South Sydney to remain in the competition. As the song goes, ‘South Sydney marches on,’ and they will be marching on Sunday. (Time expired) Forde Electorate: Local Community Centres residents and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, to officially open the Kalbar Rural Transaction Centre in my electorate. I",129,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mrs Elson (Forde) (11.15 A.m.),"It was my great pleasure last Friday to join with localThursday, 9 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22689 want to take this opportunity today to thank and congratulate the Kalbar community on their initiative and support in establishing the centre. The centre brings vital services, including Medicare Easyclaim, Electricity Credit Union banking, QGAP, tourist information, Internet access and business and secretarial skills, under one roof for the benefit of all the residents in the small rural township of Kalbar. The Kalbar Regional Organisation for Promotion is the driving force behind the new centre, which was approved in the second round of application grants under the Howard government’s Rural Transaction Centre initiative. I also add how very proud I am to be part of a government that is actively supporting and helping to finance such worthwhile local initiatives. The whole rural transaction centre concept is about helping local communities to help themselves. It is a very practical approach that has been tremendously successful. Unlike the previous Labor government, we do not believe that we ought to be prescriptive and tell local communities what we think is best for them. Our attitude has been that we want to help facilitate local programs run by people who care about their community and who know what will work best for them. It is an approach reflected in just about everything the Howard government does, and it means that more money goes directly to where it is needed most-local communities-rather than to peak bodies in capital cities. It was great to see so many local residents turn out last Friday for the opening. I am sure that the services provided at the Kalbar RTC will provide an ongoing boost to the local community and their local economy. My thanks again to all the hard-working members of the Kalbar Regional Organisation for Promotion, or KROP, as it is well-known around the area. I would like to single out Tom Watson, Wilson Neindorf, Elsa Frith and Aulbry Heck for their hard work and also thank all the other local residents involved in making the transaction centre a reality. Of course, the rural transaction centres are part of the social bonus that resulted from the 16 per cent sale of Telstra. They reflect our strong commitment to returning services to regional areas and securing a better deal for regional Australians. Our commitment stands in stark contrast to Labor’s record on rural services, which saw 277 post offices close in its last six years in office. Our commitment to regional Australia is also wonderfully reflected in other local initiatives that I am very proud to support. The weekend before last, the rural town of Boonah in my electorate was host to delegates from all around the nation and overseas at the second annual sitting of the Boonah Economic Development Institute. The institute was established last year as a think-tank for rural revitalisation-it is, in essence, a ‘living laboratory’ for rural economic development. Each year the institute runs a series of intensive workshops, offering practical advice to improve the skills of rural representatives from throughout Australia and overseas. The workshops are run by international-standard facilitators, and the institute itself is an Australian first. Once again, the Howard government is proud to provide financial backing for the institute. Earlier this year the Treasurer visited the small town of Boonah and announced the funding under our Regional Assistance Program. The institute itself is just one of many projects spearheaded by the Boonah Shire community that the Howard government has been very proud to back. I want to thank and congratulate everyone at the institute on another successful sitting, especially Wendy Creighton and Rick Stanfield, who continue to work tirelessly for this community. The great thing about the institute, of course, is that it has the potential to really assist communities throughout Australia to instil the same dynamic, self-help approach that Boonah Shire has adopted and that has proven so very successful over the past few years. 22690 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 November 2000 It is innovative and exciting and has already proven highly successful-just the sort of practical, local project that our government wants to encourage and assist. Once again I thank the dedicated community leaders and the many workers involved in both of these successful projects, and it is my great pleasure to be able to continue to work with them for the betterment of our local area. I would also like to add my thanks to Judith Troeth, who took the time to come to the institute. Main Committee adjourned at 11.20 a.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Business Number (Question No. 1741) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) What checks have been put in place to ensure that only those with a genuine entitlement to, and requirement for, an Australian Business Number (ABN) have been issued with one. (2) How many cases have there been of organisations being issued with more than one ABN when they only applied for one ABN. honourable member’s question: (1) There have been a number of strategies put in place to ensure that only those with a genuine entitlement to an ABN are issued with one. (a) The ABN application form requires an applicant for an ABN to declare that they are carrying on an enterprise and to certify that the information given in their application is accurate and complete. An applicant is warned that penalties apply for giving false or misleading information, so there is a preliminary deterrent in place. (b) There have been a number of entities identified where the ATO has been provided with insufficient information to determine conclusively that the entity is carrying on an enterprise but where the applicant declares that they are doing so. While the ATO will usually register these entities on the basis of the declaration, such entities may expect contact from the ATO after registration to establish that they are entitled to an ABN. The contact may be in the form of a self-assessment checklist or a field visit. (c) As part of the ABN register maintenance process, activity reported by entities will be monitored. This will detect new cases which have registered but have failed to show business activity, which will prompt a follow-up. It will also detect where existing entities have ceased business but have not notified the Registrar, which would also be followed up. (2) A very small number of duplicate ABN registrations have arisen, mainly as a result of duplicate applications. Regional Forest Agreement: Tasmania (Question No. 1895) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 31 August 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1224 (Hansard, 9 May 2000, page 15325) has the Minister written to the Tasmanian Government unilaterally proposing changes to the agreed funding provisions of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA); if so, did any process of review and consultation with key stakeholders precede this letter. (2) What reduction in funding has the Minister proposed for funding to Tasmania for (a) the program to protect conservation values on private land in support of the CAR reserve system, (b) the implementation of new intensive forest management initiatives, (c) the implementation of employment and industry development measures, (d) road infrastructure, (e) tourism infrastructure and (f) new reserve management. (3) What has been the response of the Tasmanian Government to the Minister’s reported proposal.",130,Representatives Main Committee
289,Mr Costello,"The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the(1) No. I wrote to the Tasmanian Government suggesting a joint review of priorities within the agreed funding provisions of the RFA. I expressed Commonwealth concerns regarding the efficiency of direct Tasmanian Government competition with the private sector in purchasing farmland for plantation establishment. The terms of the Tasmanian RFA provide for the Parties to work cooperatively to address any matters raised relating to the interpretation or implementation of the Agreement. (2) No reduction (a) to (f). (3) While my letter was written with the intent to achieve more productive industry and employment outcomes for Tasmania from Commonwealth funding, the Tasmanian Government has chosen to politicise the issue by making press statements suggesting that the Commonwealth has called for $35 million to be diverted from new intensive forest management initiatives and that this would put in jeopardy 360 jobs. These assertions are not correct. Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing: Scientific Agencies (Question No. 1952) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 7 September 2000: (1) Is he aware of plans of the Office Of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing (OASITO) to replace IT infrastructure and services at CSIRO, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO), Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) and the Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM) with a single IT contract. (2) Will request for tenders be announced; if so (a) when (b) what are the terms and conditions of the tender and (c) will the successful tenderer have access to the CSIRO’s client’s information and (ii) be required to have scientifically qualified staff who will work closely with the scientific staff at the CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS, AGSO, AAD and BOM. (3) Will the successful tenderer be required to supply staff on site to all scientific agencies and sites; if not, which sites in which agencies will not have permanent on-site IT staff. (4) What formal assessment or study has been completed, either by the Government or another organisation to ensure that outsourcing the IT infrastructure and services will be more productive and beneficial to the development of science in Australia. (5) Due to the size, complexity, viability and importance of such a contract to the development of Australian Science, would local IT business be best suited to the terms of the contract. (6) Can he guarantee there will be no job losses at the CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS, AGSO, AAD and BOM as a result of outsourcing IT infrastructure and services (1) Yes, the agencies in “Group 9” (CSIRO, ANSTO, AGSO, AAD & BOM) are preparing to outsource IT infrastructure in accordance with the whole of government IT Infrastructure Initiative. (2)(a) Release dates for Request for tender documentation will be determined by OASITO in consultation with Group9 agencies. (b) The terms and conditions of tender are currently being developed. (c) (i) Any access provided to data held by client agencies will be under strict contractual arrangements protected by commercial confidentiality provisions. Contractors are also required to comply with the Privacy Act. (ii) Group9 agencies will assess the technical merits of the solutions tendered to evaluate the ability of the tenderers to deliver IT services to the scientific staff in the relevant agencies. (3) Tenderers would design solutions to provide IT services to meet the service specifications set out by Group9 agencies. These solutions can be expected to utilise onsite IT staff where necessary.",133,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
290,Mr Tuckey,The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:,134,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
291,Mr Fahey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Assessment of tenders submitted by commercial organisations will provide the analysis necessary to determine the benefits to the Group9 agencies of obtaining IT infrastructure services from an external provider. (5) The tender process to be conducted will be an open tender process. In any event, substantial involvement of Australian industry is expected. Indeed, the Industry Development framework for the IT Outsourcing program is designed to grow the Australian IT & T industry and seeks substantial involvement of small to medium enterprises in contracts let under the Initiative. (6) Experience from previous outsourcing transactions shows that most former employees of organisations outsourcing IT infrastructure are offered employment by the successful contractor. Aged Persons Savings Bonus: Returned Cheques (Question No. 1965) Ms Hall asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Have savings bonus cheques been returned to him by disgruntled pensioners; if so, what will he do with those cheques. (2) What will he do, or has he done, with cheques and money orders made out to him and sent by pensioners insulted by receiving cheques for minuscule sums. I am advised by my department as follows: (1) and (2) Some aged pensioners have returned their Aged Persons Savings Bonus (APSB) to the Government. Under an arrangement between the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and the Department of Family and Community Services (FACS), Savings Bonus returns, including cheques, money orders and returned Savings Bonus cheques sent to the Prime Minister are transferred to FACS to be processed in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Aged Persons Savings Bonus: Australian Appeals Tribunal (Question No. 1969) Mr Kerr asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Is there an independent tribunal to deal with appeals lodged by claimants to unfavourable decisions relating to the Government’s Bonus for Older Australians; if not, why not. (2) Are receipt of all appeals acknowledged in writing by the Australian Taxation Office; if not, why not. (3) Do the qualification guidelines for the Bonus for Older Australians preclude claimants from receipt of the bonus because they have suffered a financial loss in previous years; if so, why. (1) Claimants can seek a review under Part IVc of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 which covers objections and allows for an appeal to be made to the Taxation Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). (2) The AAT acknowledges in writing all appeals received and notifies the ATO. (3) Losses carried forward from a previous year do not preclude a claimant from receipt of a bonus. However, if those losses are capital losses from a previous year that are being applied to a capital gain in 1998-1999 or 1999-2000, the taxpayer’s adjusted savings and investment income will be reduced by the amount of the capital loss, which may affect the amount of bonus that person is eligible for.
