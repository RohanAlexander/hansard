William Davies, and that, by the endorsement on the writ, it was certified that Victor Dennis Kearney had been elected. OATH. received from His Excellency the Governor General a commission authorizing me during any absence of the Speaker, to administer to members of the House the oath or affirmation of allegiance. I now lay the commission on the table. -MEMBER SWORN. and subscribed the oath of allegiance as member for the Division of Cunningham, New South Wales. some questions to, I think, the Minister for Primary Industry, as the successor to the Minister for Trade, as the Minister in charge of the Australian Whaling Commission. Tbe questions arise from a statement in the newspapers made, I think, by tbe Minister for Trade, and announcing the contract, or arrangement, for tbe sale of the assets of the commission. The industry, I point out, was established by a previous government, and is owned by the people, and is situated at Carnarvon in Western Australia. My questions are as follows:Is the newspaper announcement correct? Will the responsible Minister give the full facts as to the various offers that have been made in connection with that R -[53 ] transaction? Will the Minister or the Government agree to, or participate in, Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament? Will the whole matter be inquired into by the said committee, or a similar committee, before any legislation is introduced into this House involving the sale of assets of the people, contrary to the very recent decision of the people of Western Australia, in effect, repudiating tihe Government's action? Leader of the Opposition. AlthoughI was in the House, I did not realize that he was addressing the question to me, If he wishes to acquaint me of facts as I attempt to reply, I shall be glad to try to oblige him. The position is that the Government made it quite clear almost four years ago that, in its judgment, and in accordance with its policies, there was no longer any purpose in the Commonwealth's continuing to own, as a producing owner, the Australian Whaling Commission's assets in Western Australia. It approved of the original concept of the whaling station as a demonstration unit and in that regard the station, as I have stated, has been highly successful. It has been so successful that nothing remains but to operate it as an ordinary producing unit, and no argument can be advanced to justify the Commonwealth continuing to operate the station which would not apply equally to its operation of a factory or a wheat farm. Continued operation of the station by the I desire to address Government would be completely in accord with the socialist doctrine of the Leader of the Opposition, but it would be diametrically opposed to every antisocialist doctrine for which this Government stands. The successful formation of this whaling station has contributed greatly to the establishment in Australia of an immense whaling industry tliat is earning an annual export income of almost £2,000,000, and is providing a great amount of employment, mainly through private enterprise. The Government proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of the whaling station in another very valuable manner which I shall explain to the House later to-day, unless the right honourable gentleman chooses to deny me the opportunity to do so.",6,Setup

I ask the Minister whether he is in a position to make a statement to the House in relation to the projected proceedings at the conference. which is called the British and Malayan Working Party on Defence, is starting in Kuala Lumpur. Representatives at that conference will seek to work out, in the coming weeks or possibly months, the terms of an agreement or treaty between Great Britain and Malaya in relation to the conditions under which the troops of the United Kingdom and other British Commonwealth countries will remain in the Federation of Malaya after Malaya obtains independence, in August, 1957, or, possibly, towards the end of that year. civilian occupation than he will as a I have noted that it has been stated that this working party will discuss whether the Federation of Malaya will adhere to the Seato pact.

Defence tell the House whether it is a fact that, when national service trainees are injured or become sick during the course of their training, and are subsequently prevented from continuing their normal civilian occupations as a result of that injury or sickness, on many occasions at least four months elapse, and frequently a much longer time elapses, before they receive any form of compensation? If this is a fact, can the right honourable gentleman tell the House who or what is responsible for the considerable delays that occur, and whether he considers that it is justifiable to expect a national service trainee to be prevented, by virtue of his national service training, from continuing his normal* civilian occupation for a period of months without receiving any payment whatsoever, particularly when he would frequently receive more remuneration in that national service trainee? decisions on these matters.

In addition to the work of Ionics Incorporated, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, I know nothing of plus the Department of National Development, has been participating in a cooperative investigational enterprise in Holland, where they have been reviewing all the various means of producing fresh water from salt water or brackish water.

I may mention in [iassing that the delegation to Norfolk Island will take part in the celebration of ihe centenary of that Territory, the first Australian territory to celebrate its i-onfenary. gravity of the situation in the Middle East, can the Minister for Externa! Affairs inform the House of the activitieof bhs Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Hammarskjoeld, in his present attempts to alleviate ArabIsraeli tension ? Is the Minister optimistic, as to the outcome of this United Nations intervention? 11 ammarskjoeld, tbe Secretary-General of thc United Nations, has been for the last week in the Middle East attempting to reduce the tension as between tbe two principal protagonists, Israel and Egypt. He has already visited and spent some little time in Cairo, Tel Aviv and Beirut in the Lebanon. On the reports that we have had, both the Egyptian and the Israeli governments have undertaken, as .[ understand it, to observe the conditions of the Israel-Egypt Armistice Agreement of a few years ago. If that is observed meticulously it will mean the end of the present fighting; at least it will mean the end of the considerable tension that has overcome that part of the Middle East-the Levant coast and particularly the Gaza area-in the last month or two, the most severe tension to which the area has been subjected for a very considerable time. I should say, although the situation does not by any means enable one to make a final statenient, that the position is relatively hopeful that the fighting will come to an end and that tbe tension, particularly the border tension, especially in the Gaza aroa. will be very muoh reduced. At the same time, the Security Council of the United Nations must keep continuous watch on this area and on what is happening in it. As honourable members know, Australia is represented on the Security Council, and our representative there has been instructed to maintain a close watch on the situation in this area. I am very hopeful about the result of Mr Hammarskjoeld's visit to that area, which, in the circumstances, bas been attended witli all the success that could have been hoped for. Trade a supplementary question on the Australian Whaling Commission to which I referred earlier. Is it a faet that the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, pronounced the successful tenderer for the purchase of the Australian Whaling Commission's station, was given an opportunity to make an offer or to revise it after an offer had been obtained from the State Government of Western Australia? Will the Minister produce all the valuations obtained by the GovernMr Dag ment in respect of the various offers, so that tliey may be available during the debate on this subject? MrM c EWEN It is not a fact that tbe Nor' West whaling company was given an opportunity to make an offer or to revise it or to submit a further offer after that of the Western Australian Government had been received. Several minor points of detail were discussed with that company, one of which would be of interest to the rigbt honourable Leader of the Opposition. It was that an assurance was sought that there would be continuity of employment for employees of the commission who had established themselves at the station. As to the actual price offered by the Nor' West whaling company, no revision whatever was made and no opportunity was given to make a revision. The Western Australian Government had the opportunity of access to Commonwealth departmental officers, an opportunity of which it did avail itself. The Western Australian Government did, however, make a firm offer. I think the proper time for nie to reveal particulars of offers will be when the appropriate legislation",14,Flood Relief

20,Dr. Evatt,"I ask the Minister foris before the HouseI had hoped that it would be this afternoon. It will be shown that the offer of the ""Western Australian Government was substantially lower than the tender which was accepted. The Australian Government had the assets of the commission valued by its own valuers, and asked the institute of valuers to nominate a valuer to make a check valuation. As a result a government valuation and an outside check valuation were made. I , personally, know of no reason why details of these matters should not be made available to the House, and unless there is some reason to prevent that from being done, tliey will be produced. the right honourable Minister for External Affairs, in his capacity as bead of the Commonwealtli Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, whether there are two types of rabbits in Brazil-the native rabbit, which has never bred like rabbits as Australians know them, and the European rabbit, introduced 300 years ago, and of the same species as the Australian rabbit. Is it a fact that the native Brazilian rabbit catches cold, known as myxomatosis, which to it is harmless, but which is fatal to the European rabbit and periodically over a period of 300 years has prevented the European rabbit population from' reaching plague proportions? Is it a fact also that myxomatosis has maintained its effectiveness in Brazil because the native rabbits, through catching cold, continually develop new and stronger strains of the virus? If these are facts, would the Minister consider importing some Brazilian rabbits to an offshore island to assist the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in its efforts to maintain the effectiveness of myxomatosis in Australia? situation is precisely as outlined by the honourable member. According to my information there is only one type of indigenous rabbit in Brazil, but it is not of the European or English or Australian species. It is similar to the American type, and is more properly classified as :i hare than as a rabbit. As I understand, the only rabbits of the European type or the Australian type in Brazil are those used in medical and other research establishments for scientific purposes. It is true that myxomatosis exists in Brazilian rabbits, but it is not a killing disease. It merely causes the rabbits some degree of discomfort. Owing to insects passing the disease from indigenous rabbits to rabbits used for scientific research purposes iri medical and other establishments, myxomatosis became rife among European rabbits in Rio de Janeiro and similar places in Brazil. It was from that source that we got the original strain of myxomatosis which was tried in Australia before the war and which has been used with such success ever since. I am not aware that a more virulent strain of myxomatosis has developed among indigenous Brazilian rabbits. In fact, my recollection is that that has not been the case. It is true, as I have said in answer to other questions in the House lately, that the efficiency or the killing effectiveness of myxomatosis in Australia has tended to decline during the last twelve months or so. But .the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has been working quite hard, trying to restore the effectiveness of the disease, either by some mutation of the existing virus or by other means. On the basis of what I have said, I do not believe that there is any merit in the proposal to introduce the Brazilian rabbit into Australia or into islands off the Australian coast. * COAL. suggested to a deputation of coal-miners which waited upon him in Canberra recently, that a further conference could be held to find a solution of the problems facing the coal-mining industry. Can the right honourable gentleman indicate to the House when and where that conference will take place? some direct knowledge of the arrangements for the conference to which the honourable gentleman has referred, I shall answer his question.

65,Mr Peters,"I do not intend to bebeeu a single member of tbe Lang party, a single member of the Country-Progressive party, and a single member of tbe Mutton-Blackburn party at the same time as there was a single member of that party in the Victorian Parliament. These people did not, of course, get these privileges. Therefore, the granting of party privileges to one-man parties is a new departure. The questions that arise are these: Will every single member of a politioal organization that gets into this Parliament be treated as a party leader? If one Communist, one member of the Henry George party or the Eisher Labour party, or one independent comes into this Parliament under his party name, will he get these privileges? When the present single member of a political party is joined by his recently elected colleague, will the second member be accorded the facilities of deputy leadership? If two members of that particular party como into this House, will they get the privileges of leadership and deputy leadership? Would similar treatment be accorded to representatives of the other parties I have mentioned ? The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in reply to a question that I asked hira recently as to whether this recognition was to be regarded as a precedent, said that each case would be judged on its merits. That, of course, means that it will not be a question of principle, but a question of expediency that determines recognition. What constitutes merit in relation to a political party? To me, a political party has merit only insofar as it assists either the opposition or the government of the day. In the present case party recognition and the provision of party facilities are being turned into instruments of political bribery. It is in reality dishonouring the government that provides the facilities, and dishonouring equally the recipient of those facilities. It is because I believe in the parliamentary institution, and in fundamental honesty that I have raised this matter to-day. It is also because I believe that not only on this side of the House bnt among members of all parties, there are people who believe in tbe democratic parliamentary institution and do not want that institution brought into disrepute. There are too many members of the community to-day, both on the right and on the left, who seek to bring the parliamentary institution and all connected with it into contempt in order that they may ultimately bring about its destruction. That method of destruction has occurred in other countries of the world; I do not want it to occur here. Therefore, I will take action iu opposition to anything that would give such people outside this Parliament a legitimate argument that might bring our democratic institution into ridicule and contempt. referring to the Anti-Communist Labour party? able member for North Sydney( Mr Jack) asks in his childish ""way whether I am referring to the Anti-Communist Labour party. I want to discuss this matter from the point of view of principle, and without introducing the name of any political party. I say to honourable members opposite that if , to-day, it is an Anti-'Communist Labour party member, to-morrow it may be a Communist, or some other person, to whom objection could be raised. I do not believe that facilities such as I have mentioned should be provided at the whim or pleasure of a, government, neither do I believe that they should be taken away at the whim of the'Government. If facilities or gifts are bestowed at the whim of a person or government upon a particular recipient, inevitably the recipient's behaviour is, to a degree, motivated by the knowledge that those privileges can be as easily withdrawn. That, of course, is the objection I have to the particular action that is being taken at the present time. My objection is upon the grounds of principle. To give the privileges of leadership to a nerson who has no followers and who leads no one is an utter absurdity. It is contrary to all the traditions of the parliamentary institution in the British Commonwealth, contrary to the traditions of this Parliament, and contrary to the traditions of every Australian State parliament.

Minister) [3.43] I hope that the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) will not object if I try to bring this case down to the real point that he has in mind. This is not an airy and abstract question. The honourable member is, in fact, talking about the answer that I gave to a question he asked in relation to the Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party in another place. It is just as well that we should discuss this problem not as a mere abstraction, because I venture to say that if it were a mere abstraction, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, could hardly have ruled that it was an urgent matter for consideration under this procedure. Therefore, it is designed, no doubt, to be a practical problem. I should point out that there is one principle that has been strictly adhered to. Whether any person sitting in either House of the Parliament is to be regarded as the leader of a party is a matter for the Presiding Officer -in this place, Mr Speaker, and in another place, the President. I well remember that when the Anti-Communist Labour party members sat in the corner in this House in the last Parliament and their leader and deputy leader announced themselves the question naturally arose -it was very much canvassed in the lobbies-whethe r that party ought to be recognized by Mr Speaker. I am sure that the honourable member for Scullin will recall that a great number of members of his own party took exception to that group being recognized, but Mr concerned, administratively, the position Speaker said, ""Yes, I recognize this party"". Although each of the seven members of the Anti-Communist Labour party in this House lost his seat at the last election, n common with a few ; members of the Labour -party, it could hardly be said that they had sat in Parliament representing nobody but themselves. They secured a massive number of votes in four States at the last general election, and in the. case of the State of Yictoria, secured a' vote of over 17 per cent., and a Senate quota and a seat in the Senate. So, we are not discussing who cannot be blamed for this action some entirely imaginary body; we are discussing a party of substantial numbers, although at the moment its representation in the Parliament is extremely small. In fact, at the moment, the party has one representative in the Senate, and after next June it will have two. have mentioned are rather small numbers, but I do not think that honourable members opposite should be too attached to the gospel of numbers. The real principle is, has the presiding oflicer recognized them; and in the case of the senator involved in this matter, the President has acknowledged him as the Leader of the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist). He so appears on the record of the Senate Hansard where the officers of the Senate are printed, and honourable members will see shown there-""Leade r of the Anti-Communist Labour partySenator George Eonald Cole ""-and he has, therefore, in the other place, which is the master of its own privileges, and, if I may say so, not to be told by us what it should do any more than we are to be told by it what we are to do in this place-bee n accorded the status of the leader of a party. If the Senate, being the master of its own procedure, had decided that that was a wrong thing for the Presiding Officer to do, then it could very readily have taken the necessary steps by resolution to overrule his decision. However, it has never done so. In the other place the senator is the leader of the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist). So far as we are is perfectly simple. I do not substitute my judgment for that of the Presiding Officer of the Senate. I say, ""Very well, there is a practice, and honourable members opposite should not complain too much about it. There is a practice under which leaders of parties and deputy leaders, in certain circumstances, have privileges and benefits far greater now than they were some years ago"".

Now, that seems to me, if this matter is to be discussed in terms of principle, to dispose of the matter, because I hope that the day will not come when any Administration, which happens to be led in this House, will presume to substitute for the judgment of the President of the Senate, and of the Senate itself, its own opinion as to whether what he did, or the Senate did, was right or wrong. If we want a matter of parliamentary principle, there it is, and we adhere to it. There is only one other thing that I believe I ought to say. It is all very well to say that if one person sits in a House of the Parliament he cannot 1 discussion is based on an argument about another House of the Parliament; do not let us forget that. Indeed, that is the whole fount and origin of this discussion. What does it matter if there is only one representative of a party in the Parliament? I can remember a time-befor e I was a member of this Parliament, I am happy to say-whe n there was a different system of voting for the Senate. In those days the Australian Labour party, which had many representatives in this House, had only one member in the Senate, the late Senator Albert Gardiner. bers in this House. Gardiner had colleagues in this House. If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) takes his stand on that point, what an absurdity we come to! The honourable member is indicating that Senator Cole could quite legitimately be treated as the leader of a party in the Senate when there were seven representatives of his party in this place, but because those seven members lost their seats the whole character of Senator Cole's position has changed. I have never heard anything more remarkable. A man would be a leader one day, then cease to be a leader when his colleagues lost their seats in this place, and then when six or seven were re-elected to this House he would once more become a leader. It is a cheerful thing to recall that Senator Gardiner-wh o knew his way aroundwhen he was the sole representative of his party in the Senate, was not merely one Labour senator, but also was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In fact, I can remember reading of his conducting a. few magnificent all-night stonewalls by the simple expedient of moving motions and amendments, relating to bills, and making a powerful speech on each motion, knowing that it would lapse for want of a seconder because there was not a seconder to be got. By that process, given ingenuity and powerful physical endurance, he managed to keep debates going for many hours. And Senator Gardiner will probably go down in history as the most effective Opposition leader that the Senate has ever known. I do not know how far this passion for numbers goes, but I am sure that it will be a great comfort to the honourable member who submitted the motion to know-whethe r it will be a comfort to me or not, only history will reveal-that after the 30th June there will be two members of the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist) in the Senate. I do not know whether he would think that two would constitute a party, or whether we should wait until there are three. the deputy leader of that party have in the Senate? dealt with when it arises. vernment have done if Jim Healy had been elected to the Senate? exactly as I am doing now. That question could not be more apropos. I would have waited to see whether the Presiding Officer recognized him as the leader of a party, and if he had, then willy nilly we would have provided him with an assistant secretary and with a motor vehicle to transport him from the airport to his home and back again. After all, what has the honourable member to complain about, because I will betthat when Labour was in office it provided more facilities and travelling expenses for Jim Healy than this Government can ever hope to do.",24,Iiihi

My colleague, the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters), treated it as an abstract question-one member in the whole of the Parliament; two Houses, one member-and said in no case could such a member be treated, not by the President of the Senate, but by the Government, as the leader of a party. What Mr Speaker or the President does cannot be binding on the Government in that respect, l n the business of the House or of the Senate, what the Presiding Officers do might be of some value in respect of a person claiming to be the leader of a party, but the view that I shall put w ill meet the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on his own ground. This matter relates to a senator who is the sole member in either House of a party that he represents. Out of a. total of 184 members and senators, only one person representing his particular party is elected to the Parliament. at the last general election. not elected at the last general election, but his status is that of one representative of his party. The point made by the honourable member who interjected that the senator in question was not recently elected is important, but it does not affect the principle. One person out of 184 members and senators of the Parliament is treated by the Government as being entitled to the privileges attaching to the leadership of a. party. Whom does he lead? We are dealing with a parliamentary system and not something independent of the Parliament. All that ean be done by tbe Government in relation to members of the Parliament is to recognize decisions of the party i u appointing a leader and whether they are entitled to be regarded as parliamentary parties. Senator Cole is the deputy leader; Senator. Cole, if we wish to go further and because such officers are provided by the parties, is the whip and other officer-? of his party. That is sufficient to show rhe absurdity of the Government's TJOMmunist party, which polled about 120,000 Hon. It is absurd because this is nnt the No. 1 votes in New South Wales, largely first time that this matter has been raised. It has been dealt with by many parliaments, and it is not new. The honourable member for Scullin gave several examples. The case of a former member of the Senate, Senator Gardiner, is different. When Senator Gardiner led the Australian Labour party in the Senate, the party had a number of representatives in the House of Representatives and, fro m tlie point of view of parliamentary government, it would have been impossible for the government of the day to f a i l to recognize h i m if the government was to be f a i r and honest to all parties. That opinion would be upheld by the majority of honourable members whatever their party affiliations might be. It is the height of absurdity, however, to abandon the practice that has been recognized by all parliaments which have had to face a similar situation. Mr Justice Nicholas referred to special allowances for leaders of political parties in his report dealing with allowances foT honourable members, and he recommended ten as the minimum number that ought to be recognized as a party. That would e be a f a i r number, liaving regard to the large number of members in the Parliament, for the Government and the Parliament to recognize when providing facilities for leaders of parties. I believe that in Canada the number is greater, depending, to an extent, upon the larger number of members in the House of Commons. mentioned for the purpose of additional allowances. Exactly! If the Governnient is going fo recognize the decision of Mr Speaker or the President of the Senate as final, it has no need to deny the member concerned an allowance.

He, also, was assisted largely by his position on the ballot-paper. I should like the Prime Minister to follow my argument, if he would, because what he is doing as the leader of the Government affects the whole parliamentary system. I am not referring to tlie system of democracy and decisions affecting it under the method of election, bin to the manner in which tbe Parliament is to be conducted. How is leadership to be recognized by the Government? No answer has been given to the honourable member for Scullin. The party to which Senator Cole belongs is bitterly opposed to the Australian Labour party. It was recognized by Mr Speaker( Mr Archie Cameron) in the previous Parliament. He recognized a party of seven members in this House. With Senator Cole, the membership of the party in the Parliament was eight. There was a caso fer recognition of Senator Cole then. Thfi party's numbers were fewer than those suggested for a party in the Nicholas report, but the party had parliamentary representation in both Houses corresponding broadly to the situation when Senator Gardiner was recognized as the leader of the Australian Labour party in the Senate. The Labour party then had a substantial number in this House. Now, the Government has abandoned the principles that govern the recognition of parties by governments in other parts of the world. The position in Canada was referred to in the Nicholas report. The Prime Minister has stated that the position, as it applies to Senator Cole, was determined simply because the President of the Senate, the presiding officer in that chamber, recognized a senator as the leader of a party. The Opposition's move in this case is directed, not at the recognithat there is no genuineness in the Gotion of the senator by the presiding officer, but at the action of the Government in providing facilities for the senator concerned as the leader of a party. Those facilities are determined by custom and, to some extent, by statute, and by recommendations in reports such as the Nicholas report. The matter is one of numbers. It is wrong for the Government to recognize Senator Cole as it has done. The Prime Minister has asked whether the Government's action was correct when there were seven members in this chamber, whereas now there is none. Yes, its action was justified then by the comparatively large number of members of the party concerned who were then in this House. All of them have lost their seats by the verdict of the electors. The Government cannot say that the party still exists, as a parliamentary party, because it had seven members in this chamber in the previous Parliament. Does it exist in the House of Representatives ? No! No parliamentary party exists as such unless there is substantial representation for it in one House or the other, and it is the parliamentary situation that should be considered. The real position is that the Prime Minister has shut his eyes to the parliamentary situation. He has not taken into account the fact that the particular group under discussion was defeated in the electorate, so far as it could be defeated, at the last general election for the House of Representatives. be defeated. Cole did not stand at the last election, and now he is everything in the party. that Senator Cole would have been re-elected. Senator Cole is the leader, deputy leader, whip, and everything else. unanimous party. Minister regards that as very desirable. Leaders of all parties do. I appreciate the wit and the application of the right honourable gentleman's remark, especially so far as the Prime Minister himself is concerned. His remark indicates clearly vernment's recognition of the party to which Senator Cole belongs. The attitude of the Prime Minister is dictated by political expediency. The Government has said, in effect, "" A f t e r the 30th June, things might be difficult in the Senate. We had better not discontinue this allowance"". That is what happened, and the Prime Minister himself would not deny it if it were put to him privately. From a",26,Iiihi

89,Dr. Evatt,"I know that the Primeparliamentary point of view this is a shocking anrl scandalous thing, and the honourable member for Scullin was completely justified in raising the matter. Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [4.2] I have listened with much interest honourable gentleman in this House, he to the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) and tbe Leader of thc Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I should like to have my mind clear as to just where those two honourable members are going in their argument. The Leader of tbe Opposition said that this was a matter of status, and that Senator Cole should not be recognized as the leader of a party. Then the right honourable gentleman said that even if Senator Cole were recognized as the leader of a party, the Prime Minisby the honourable member for Scullin. ter ( Mr Menzies) should not give him the facilities associated with that office. referring to something that happened in Let us examine that point of view because it is important that we should do so. The Prime Minister has already pointed out that the authority to determine party leadership, or whether a party exists in fact, resides in the House concerned. In this instance, it resides in the Senate, and may be exercised by the senators themselves. They have decided-becaus e no objection has been taken and all their records show that they are in agreementthat there is a party, and that it is led by Senator Cole. That being so, what would the honourable member for Scullin or the Leader of the Opposition have us do? Would they have us challenge the procedure of the Senate? That would be a new departure, and the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Scullin would object strongly if the Senate dared to criticize procedure in the House of Eepresentatives. Indeed, honourable members generally would object most vociferously if that were done. The Senate has the same privilege in that connection. It should conduct its own affairs. If the Senate has decided to recognize a senator as the leader of a party, that is the Senate's responsibility and not curs. In his concluding remarks, tbe Leader of the Opposition imported into this debate something that I hoped he would not import into it. He said that this matter was scandalous, and that the attitude of the Prime Minister had been dictated by political expediency. He says that if it were not for the fact that we seek to gain something, we would never do this. I venture to state that if this honourable senator had not been a member of a group that opposed the right would not be setting out ruthlessly now to destroy him. With all the ruthlessness of jungle warfare, the right honourable gentleman seeks him out to destroy him, purely for sectarian reasons, because he knows that unofficially the honourable senator is supported in this chamber by a great number of the honourable members who sit behind him. He knows that those honourable members take a very poor view of the matter that has been submitted Let me give an illustration by the days that are long since gone, because this sort of thing is not unknown, as the Prime Minister made clear, when speaking of Senator Albert Gardiner. situation. able member says it is an entirely different situation. Senator Gardiner was the only representative in the Senate chamber of a political party. recognized by the Senate, under its procedure, as the leader of a party in the Senate. The Senate has no obligation whatever to the House of Eepresentatives, but it certainly has an obligation to its own procedures. At that time, Senator Gardiner was the sole representative in the Senate of a political party. He was recognized by the Senate as the leader of a party, and was treated as such. 1 mention, by way of passing reference, that Senator Gardiner's secretary at that time became the secretary of the late Mr Curtin and of the late Mr Chifley. He was later appointed by the present Leader of.the Opposition to the position of conciliation commissioner, an office which he now holds. In that instance, we see a recognition of. that senator, as the leader of a party, through the appointment of a. secretary to him. Tbat",27,Iiihi

94,Sir Eric Haeeison,"He wassecretary has since been translated to the hierarchy by the hand of the Leader of the Opposition. Yet the right honourable gentleman accuses the Government of seeking to gain a political advantage by making facilities available to a recognized leader of a party in the Senate. He imports political considerations into this question, though he himself stands condemned in that respect. Mr Deputy Speaker, so f a r as I can see, the position is perfectly clear. If I happened to be a senator, I certainly would take objection to the House of Representatives daring to challenge the procedure of the Senatei n this matter. Tbe Senate is a separate chamber and, as such, has a right to determine its own procedures. It has used those processes. If the Senate were to criticize our procedures, we would object. This is not a question connected with the separation of the two Houses; it is merely one of establishing the inalienable right of each chamber to decide its own procedures. This subject is put forward for purely political purposes. Because the honourable senator opposed the Leader of the Opposition, be must be destroyed. The Opposition is now setting out, with all the machinery w it h in its grasp, to prevent him from maintaining even a semblance of the party that dared to oppose the Leader of the Opposition. In tbe Opposition's view, all reference to this party must be erased from the political books of this House aud of the Senate. That is what has prompted the honourable member for Scullin to raise this matter. Again and again, I have seen him in this place join issue, in the most bitter fashion, with members of the group who were formerly in this chamber. That is only what I would have expected of him . 1 expect him to extend that bitter feud to the man who now represents that party in the Senate and who represents a great number of people outside this Parliament as well as a great number of honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber. I repeat that be has introduced this matter for purely political purposes. Certainly, if I happened to be a senator, T should take strong exception to this House daring to criticize, and interfere with, tbe Senate's procedures, and, indeed, attempting, by this move, to destroy them. I think it is time that we brought this matter back inio the proper perspective. If ever a question has been answered in a careless manner, this one has been; and I want to deny immediately any assertion that thei'e is an attempt to take a set at any particular individual in this Parliament. I make that denial also on behalf of the honourable member for Scullin (M.r. Peters) and the Leader of the Oppositiou (Dr. E v a t t ) . The Vice-President of tbe Executive Council( SirE r i c Harrison), as is usual with him, is rude enough now to conduct a conversation at the table. That is entirely out of order, and is typical of the way in which the Opposition is being treated daily in this House. One is entitled to expect the Vice-President of the Executive Council to have better maimers. One is entitled to expect him to treat other bonorable members as courteously as he is treated by them. W ill tbe honourable gentleman return to the subject. dent of the Executive Council is not courteous, and I am amazed that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, permit the conversation to go on at the table. member cannot have much to say. the Governmenit has raised a peculiar argument here to-day. The Government now suggests that because the President of the Senate favours the recognition of the meinber of a one-man party as its leader, this House must accept that decision. I should like to know whether the Australian taxpayers are called upon to defray the cost of the offices pertaining to this one-man party. If the provision of some extra privileges to the leader of the one-man party, such as a motor car, a room here and a room somewhere else, and a. secretary and typist, are to be a call upon the Treasury or the taxpayers of Australia, I appeal to the Government on behalf of those taxpayers to be move considerate, particularly in a period like this. In making this statement, I emphasize that I am not concerned about tbe individual at the moment; T am referring now to the principle. I appeal to tlio",28,Iiihi

99,Mr Chambers,"I want to say thatGovernment to be more considerate, especially when, daily in this House, we hear appeals from the Government to reduce expenditure. What argument has been put forward by the Government to justify its attitude in this matter? I ask members of the Australian Country party whether they would have agreed that Mr Charles Eussell, if he had been elected to this Parliament at the last election, should be made the leader of, and given all the privileges pertaining to the office of the leader of, a one-man political party. Australian Country party members are as silent as the grave. They are as silent as they were when I asked the Government, during my speech on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Eeply, whether the Government would have recognized a Communist had he been elected to this Parliament at the last election. I remind them that a Communist could have been elected. I said then, and I say now, that I hope the Government would not have done so, but it seems that any individual who breaks away from a political party, even from the Liberal party, would be recognized as the leader of a party in tbe Senate. Under our system of election, with that form of procedure, a situation could arise in which there would be half a dozen one-man parties in this Parliament. Such a position is Gilbertian, it is a mockery to the parliamentary life of this country. I did think that when the Prime Minister replied to the matter put forward by the honourable member for Scullin, he would have taken the view that a real Prime Minister would take, and would have admitted that the situation was unsatisfactory and must be remedied. It is the responsibility of the Parlianow existing, has a government, Labour ment to lay down clear and definite rules about what shall comprise a political party so as to justify the costs that are associated with the leadership and the deputy leadership of parties. To allow any person, who is tbe only representative of a party, in. tbe Parliament to cost the taxpayers thousands of pounds over and above his salary is wrong in principle and is making a farce of the Parliament. I do not care whether the Anti-Communist Labour party, tbe Liberal party, the Australian Country party or the Australian Labour party is involved, I do not believe in the principle, and it is on the principle that I take my stand on the floor of the House this afternoon. The Leader of the House has referred to the case of Senator Gardiner as being analogous. His case is not analogous. At that time, the Labour party, which had many members in this chamber, constituted the official Opposition. 1 remember when there were very few Liberal party and Australian Country party senators, but they were recognized because many members of those parties sat iu this chamber. In conclusion, I appeal to the Government to approach the matter seriously. The deputy leader of the Government, or whatever his rank is-ther e are so many ministerial changes that I cannot follow tbem-ha s stated that the Opposition is making capital out of this situation. It is doing nothing of the sort. I emphatically deny that charge. I would adopt the same stand in relation to any other person who was similarly treated. I ask the Leader of the House to take the same serious view of the matter and I urge tbe Government to adopt a proper standard in determining what shall constitute a party. Canadian practice. what practice it is, but 1 ask the Government to follow the practice that under no conditions, in this House or in another place, will it accord leadership privileges to a person who is the only representative of his party. On other occasions over the years, we have had the spectacle of one person representing a party, but never before, in circumstances such as those or Liberal, given to such persons the benefits that are associated with the leadership of a party. the Opposition persuade the senators to say something about it? bility of tbe taxpayers and of the Treasury. That being so, how can the Prime Minister or the leader of the House say that parliamentary procedure is not involved?",29,Iiihi

103,Mr Ohambees,"It is the responsiTreasury and tbe taxpayers are responsible for footing the bill to maintain a system that is wrong in principle. I hope it will be rectified in the very near future. I believe that the matter that is now before the House should be approached clearly, calmly, and without heat, but unfortunately I have the feeling-and I am sure every other honourable member on this side agrees with me-that Opposition members are trying to get some cheap political advantage from it. At the same time, they are trying to hide the divisions in their own ranks, both in this Parliament and in New South Wales. It is quite clear that honourable members opposite do not really understand the subject that the House is debating. They do not understand what the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) is trying to show. The honourable member stated that he wns not concerned about the financial side, yet the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) completely swept aside tbe arguments of the honourable member for Scullin, and suggested that tbe financial aspect was tbe most important. The honourable member for Scullin asked what the Qovernment proposed to do in the future if this kind of thing happened again, and the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) replied that each case would be treated on its merits. I agree, that it would not be right for the sole, member of a breakaway party to obtain the privileges that are accorded the leader of a party. I might break away and form a progressive Liberal party, or my friend, the honourable member for HiginbothanL ( Mr Timson), and I might form some other party, but neither of us could honestly expect to obtain the privileges that are extended to a party leader. The case in question is completely different. We are now considering the survival of a political party that was represented in both Houses. It is true that the party disappeared from this House, but it still exists in the other House. Not only does it still exist in the Senate, but it is a growthing did happen, that one surviving meming party in that place. After the 30th June next, another representative of the party will take his seat in the Senate. be doubled. ( Sir Arthur Eadden) has suggested,' its strength will be doubled. As I have stated, it is a growing party, and it is likely to grow still more, if we can believe the comments of Mr E. H . Cox in the Melbourne Herald of the 29th December, 1955. I think it is worthwhile reading the following short passage from those comments:Tlie arithmetic of the Federal election shows that it is just an accident, not likely to he repeated, that the Anti-Communist Labour party has only two members in the Senate. If, as seems likely, it can strengthen its organization in other States to the level reached in Victoria, it can generally be certain of electing in each State one of the five Senators to be returned to Canberra at each future Senate election. It is particularly likely to do so when the tide of political favourflowsback to Labour. The fact that this is a growing party has already been recognized in the Senate, because senators-elect were invited by the President of the Senate to be present at the opening of the Parliament a couple of months ago. Whether we approve of this party or not, it has big support in Australia. Fu Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia it polled nearly 250,000 votes. Certainly it has not been eliminated and I honestly believe that its members are entitled to party recognition until it completely disappears from the parliamentary scene. I can quite imagine that, if members of the Australian Labour party allow their factional fights to continue-the y are trying to hide them, but it is obvious that they still exist-ver y soon we may look across the aisle and see only one member of that party in this chamber. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) thinks he might be that member, but I am more inclined to think it would be the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). As is suggested to me by one of my colleagues, it might even be the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). I am certain that, if such a ber of the Labour party would expect to have these privileges made available to him.",30,Iiihi

108,Mr Lawrence,"As the TreasurerSinceI have been a member of this Parliament it has been quite obvious that this Government is doing its best to reduce the expense entailed in providing members' privileges. I remember that when I was first elected I used to travel by train, from the country town in Victoria in wbich I lived, to Melbourne to try to catch an aircraft which would get me to Canberra before the Parliament assembled. The train was late by an average time of 79 minutes each day, and I asked the Chief Property Officer in Melbourne to arrange for a car to meet me on any occasion'on which I telephoned from Ballarat to say that the train would be late. A car was provided for me on one occasion only, after which I was told that I would have to make other arrangements, ancl that no car would be made available for me. 1 remember also an occasion when I flew to Melbourne. On arrival at the airport at Essendon a car was in attendance for the use of the wife and secretary of a Minister. Another car was there for the use of two typists or secretaries from a Commonwealth department. Another car was there for one of the members of the Opposition who is entitled to the use of a car, and that meniber invited three Opposition members to accompany him into Melbourne in that car. I , the only member of a Government party who travelled on that aircraft, had the airline bus to myself-and perhaps I should be thankful that at least [ was able to be alone. The matter of .members' privileges is not under discussion. Mr LA ""WBENCE -This is, I believe, a subject which needs the strict attention of all parties, in order to ensure that these privileges-are not abused. Although the present strength of one that the AntiCommunist Labour party enjoys in the Senate, or of two if one takes into consideration the senator-elect, may make the privileges extended to the leader of that party seem excessive, I believe that the steps taken by the President of the Senate are justified. I deplore the actions of members of the Opposition who have tried to make cheap political capital out of this matter, in which attempt I believe they have utterly and completely failed.

111,Motion (By Sir Eeic Harbison) Put,"leave-agree d toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an to depreciation at normal rates. It is aut to amend the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1935, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time. Treasurer [4.35] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The principal purpose of the bill now before the House is to extend for a period of three years the 20 per cent, special depreciation allowances to primary producers. Tbis extension was announced by tbe Prime Minister in the course of his recent review of the Australian economy. The special depreciation allowance applies to the cost of plant, machinery and equipment, other than passenger motor vehicles, used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of agricultural or pastoral pursuits, and to certain structural improvements situated on land used for those purposes. In effect, one-fifth of the cost of these assets is deducted from income of the year in which the plant is installed or the improvement is constructed, and one-fifth is deducted in each of the next succeeding four years. This special deduction applies to plant installed and improvements constructed in the period commencing on the lst July, 1951, and ending on the 30th June, 1956. In the case of improvements, however, the deduction is allowable if construction has been commenced in the specified period and is completed by tbe 30th June, 1957. By this bill, it is proposed to continue the special deduction for plant installed and improvements constructed during the period commencing on the lst July, 1956, and ending on the 30th June, 1959. The deduction will also be allowed, if improvements are commenced in that period and completed by the 30th June, I960. When the special allowance was introduced five years ago, £2,000 was specified as the maximum amount on which 20 per cent, depreciation was allowable on housing for each employee, tenant or share-farmer. Expenditure on housing in excess of £2,000 was subject proposed by this bill to raise the maximum from £2,000 to £2,750 and that the new maximum will apply where the erection of housing is commenced after the 30th June, 1956, subject, of course, to the completion date, the 30th June, 1960, which I have already mentioned. Another important provision of the bill relates to uranium-mining. In 1952, an exemption was provided for income derived from the working of a mining property in Australia, Papua or New Guinea for the purpose of obtaining uranium-bearing ore. That exemption, as originally provided, was to operate until 1960. Last year, the exemption was expanded to include income from the treatment of the ore for the purpose of recovering concentrates, if the treatment was carried out by the company or syndicate or individual who mined the ore. In recent months, it has become evident that some three or more years must elapse before treatment plant will be in effective operation in this country. At the very earliest, treatment plant for the recovery of uranium concentrates is not expected to develop into a profit-making undertaking before 1959. In these circumstances, it will be readily recognized that the period of exemption will need to be extended, if it is to be of real value in encouraging investment of capital in the industry. It is accordingly proposed by clause 2 of the bill that the exemption shall be extended for a period of five years, that is, until the end of the income year 1964-65. It is necessary to mention only one other provision of this bill-claus e 4. This is in the nature of a drafting provision, and it is complementary to the resolution and bill relating to company rates of income tax. adjourned.",32,Pairs

In pursuance of subsection (1.) of section one hundred and twenty-five of tlic Assessment Act, to pay income tax and social services contribution, the rate of income tax and social services contribution is Eight shillings. By this resolution, it is proposed to declare the rates at which income tax will be payable by companies for the next financial year, 1956-57, that is, tax payable on income of the current income year, 1955-56. The new rates will be ls. higher all round than the present rates. This increase was announced by the Prime Minister in the course of his recent review of the Australian economy. It will be noted that the resolution is intended to apply to the taxable income of companies only and does not affect in any way the rates at which personal income tax will be payable. The declara tion of rates on taxable incomes currently being derived by companies will place company directorates in a position to know precisely their income tax commitments when preparing their financial statements after the close of the present income year, 1955-56. The additional revenue from the increase in the company rates is estimated at £27,800,000 in the financial year 1956-57, and at £30,000,000 in a complete assessment year. So far as companies are concerned, the provisions of the resolution follow broadly the pattern of resolutions annually adopted for the imposition of rates of income tax. It is accordingly unnecessary for me to embark on a detailed explanation of those provisions. The Prime Minister has explained adequately the views of the Government on the increased income tax which companies are being required to pay in the next financial year and there is no occasion for those views to be restated by me. It will suffice if I submit the formal resolution for the consideration of honourable members of this House. Progress reported. WITH STATES) BILL 1956. leave-agree d toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an to be done. act relating to arrangements with the States in connection with statistics. Bill presented, and read a first time. Treasurer) [4.44] -h y leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to seek parliamentary approval of the making of arrangements with individual States for, and the setting up of, integrated statistical services. As honourable members will know, the Constitution Act of 1901 includes "" Census and Statistics "" among the functions of the Commonwealth. During the time that has elapsed since federation attempts have been made from time to time to regularize the collection of statistical data, and this bill represents the present culmination of these endeavours. With the foundation of the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics in 1906 a regular body of Australian statistics began to emerge. However, the necessary development of statistical investigation has been impeded by the absence of effective means of ensuring uniformity of State data required to produce Australian totals and by the difficulty of arranging that six States should collect additional facts on a common basis. The economic problems that arose after World WarI . drew attention to deficiencies in the Australian statistical data. With a view to overcoming these weaknesses the then Prime Minister proposed to a Premiers conference that State statistical offices be transferred to the Commonwealth. Tasmania alone agreed to this proposal. During and since World War II . , a considerable volume of new statistical information has been issued and much of it very promptly. Such items as> national income, balance of payments, employment, migration, building, retail sales, banking, hire purchase, company capital raisings and monthly factory output have become increasingly important. Furthermoire, improvements in the speed of compilation and detail of most of the pre-existing statistics have been accomplished despite the basic weaknesses in the statistical system. But much remains Improvements have been achieved in part by establishing Commonwealth statistical offices in some of the State capitals. This was done in the knowledge that ultimately steps would have to be taken to consolidate the statistical system by means of formal agreements with the States. This is tlie more necessary now because the statistical coverage in several States has been deteriorating and there looms ahead the possibility of breakdown in some statistical fields, particularly those of primary and secondary production. The stage has been reached where further improvisations cannot cure the situation. The emergence of this problem was foreseen during the war, and in .1949 discussions were initiated with the Premiers of the several States by the late Prime Minister, the Right Honourable J. B. Chifley, with the object of integrating the statistical services of the Commonwealth and the States by agreement. These negotiations have been continued by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and myself by correspondence. The present",34,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution
116,Motion (By Sir Abthub Fadden),h y,36,Second Reading
117,Sir Arthur Fadden (Mcpherson,"position is as follows.:-In Tasmania, the amalgamated office is functioning satisfactorily as a Commonwealth office which also serves State statistical needs. The Government recently accepted a draft agreement under which it is envisaged that the statistical offices of the Commonwealth and State will he amalgamated if this enabling legislation is passed. The Prime Minister has submitted tbe terms of a similar agreement for consideration by the Premiers of New South Wales and South Australia in the course of negotiations with those States, and each has accepted the terms in substance subject to negotiations on matters of detail. In each case, an undertaking was given to these States by the Commonwealth to introduce legislation to authorize agreements of the type to be made concerning -statistical administration. The bill proposed honours that undertaking. It is permissive in nature and will enable the Commonwealth to enter into an agreement with a State to effect an amalgamation of Commonwealth and State statistical offices and services. States other than New Soubh Wales aud South Australia? Sir AETH UE FADDEN -Yes, any State can enter into the agreement. The objective of the agreements is that in each State accepting them there would be an, integrated statistical service operated by' ments between Commonwealth and State Commonwealth statistical officers under the immediate direction of a statistician in the State who would hold office under both the Commonwealth and -Stats governments. By this means Commonwealth and State will both be adequately served with statistics. No State would be required to surrender its existing powers in the field of statistics. It would agree to exercise them in a special way through the integrated service. As is the case at present in Tasmania, it would always have available an officer to function as State statistician, its Statistics Act would South Australia and Western Australia continue in force for use if necessary, it could appoint a group of statistical research officers to work for it on any special project under the statistician. In the unlikely event of any of the arrangements or services proving unsatisfactory, procedures are provided for rectifying the position. On the Commonwealth side, it is evident that an adequate Australian of ""Western Australia statistical service is urgently necessary and we believe it can come into being best by agreement with the States. The bill proposed contains, in addition to the clauses authorizing agreements with the States for, and tbe setting up of, an integrated statistical service throughout the Commonwealth, the usual machinery clauses defining the rights of officers transferred under any agreement entered into. In any State which accepts an agreement any statistical employee of that State will have the right to decide for himself whether he will transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service or remain a State employee. The procedure would be for the Commonwealth Public Service Board to offer each such State employee a specified statistical position in the Commonwealth Service in the State in which the agreement is made. This follows the precedents established in connection with previous transfers of taxation officers and other groups of officers to the Commonwealth Public Service. Provision is also made whereby it may be arranged witb one State that the Government Statistician of that State may be appointed as Commonwealth Statistician and that this officer may by agreement continue as Government Statistician of the State with appropriate arrangeas to his remuneration. This would make it possible to implement a proposal recently submitted by the Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales in respect of the services of the present Acting Commonwealth Statistician, and thus ensure the closest co-ordination between Commonwealth and States during the transition period in which the integrated statistical service is being established. The staff proposed to be transferred from the States of New South Wales, is estimated to be about 176 persons. The total of annual salaries of the officers so transferred is estimated to be £175,000 and tbe expenditure on contingencies will amount to about £30,000.",36,Second Reading
118,Mr Calwell,"Would that apply toAsI bave said, tbe bill authorizes tbe mating of agreements between tbe Commonwealth whereby the organization of the statistical services of Australia may be integrated and improved. Statisticians carry a big responsibility to produce the increasing body of statistics upon which we rely in the formulation of governmental policies and business policies alike. If ever Australia needed good and prompt statistics, and more of them, it needs them now. If the present opportunity for agreement w i th the States is lost it may not be possible to create another for a long time to come.

This sales tax bill is one of the awful bills in this awful supplementary budget which this Government is imposing on the Australian people. The Labour party will oppose the bill. AVe will divide the House on it. We will seek to separate the sheep from the goats in the Government's ranks. We do not expect to find any sheep, but we do expect to see a few sheepish faces as Government supporters vote in support of this most reactionary measure. We of the Australian Labour party believe that the Government is intellectually sterile. It has not one positive idea for the solution of the problems that it has itself created. Unless something happens very soon to rid it of the idea that it can tax Australia back into prosperity, inflation will cause very grave damage throughout the community. The leaders of the present Government parties used to say, when they were in Opposition, that the sales tax and all forms of indirect taxation should be reduced. The present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his policy speech for the 1949 general elections, delivered at Canterbury, Victoria, statedWe will review the incidence of indirect taxes (which are a huge though sometimes unrecognized item in Australia) upon basic wage and cost of living items and housing costs. I shall proceed to show very effectively. The leader of the party to which the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Brand) belongs-the present Treasurer (SiiArthur Fadden)-speakin g at Boonah, Queensland, on the following night, paraphrased what the leader of the senior partner in the political combination that at present forms the Government had to say.

The present Treasurer, speaking in this House on the 20th October, 1948, during the debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill consequent upon the budget brought down in that year, saidThe bill should be withdrawn and re-drafted engaged. The only wars with which the ou a sensible basis having regard to our economic requirements and the indispensible need for an improvement of the home life and health of thc community. He actually moved an amendment to the second reading in those very terms, l n 194S-49, the Ohifley Government collected in sales tax £39,029,276. In the following iinancial year, £42,424,580 was collected. The general rate, from the lst J uly, 1949, to the 7th September, 1949, was only 10 per cent., and the third schedule rate was 25 per cent. The Chifley Government levied only two rates. From' the 8th September, 1949, to the 30th June, 1950, the general rate was only 8?{ per cent., and the third schedule rate was 25 per cent. The Chifley Government actually reduced the general rate to the lowest it had been since the beginning of the war. In 1939-40, the general rate was 8$ per cent,, at which level it remained until, in 1940-41, it was increased to 10 per cent, under the necessities of war-time finance. In 1941-42, the third schedule rate was raised to 25 per cent. Throughout the war, the Labour Government never levied more than 25 per cent, under the third schedule, and the general rate was never more than 10 per cent, Labour did take income tax as high as 18s. 6d. in the £1 on taxable incomes of more than £5,000, because it believed that the incidence of the sales tax and all other forms of indirect taxation was heavy and their effect on the consuming public very great. It felt that it was much fairer and much more honest to finance the war by high taxation and to keep the sales tax rates low. However, when the present Government took office, it reversed the whole procedure. Not only is the sales tax higher to-day than it was in 1949, but also it is the highest it has been during four of the six years for which this Government has held office. In 1950-51, this Government increased the maximum rate of the sales tax to 33^ per cent, and added a fourth schedule. In 1951-52, it added two more schedules. The Labour Government managed during the war with two schedules, but the present Government wanted six when there was no war, except a war in Korea in which Australia had two battalions of troops Government was really concerned at that time were the wars in the Cabinet room. This Government increased the classifications of the sales tax to six in 1951-554, and made the tax more complex and more expensive to collect. In that financial year, not only did it impose higher sales taxes than Labour-had levied during the war, by continuing the maximum rate of 33^ pei cent, of the previous year, but 1 it introduced in addition a fifth schedule, at the rate of 50 per cent., and a sixth schedule at the rate of 66§ per cent. That is the record of the present Government parties, the leaders of which, in their policy speeches for the 1949 general elections, protested that the sales tax and all other forms of indirect taxation were too high, said they must be reduced, and promised to reduce them. Let me translate the effect of these imposts on the Australian people in the form of tax collections. In 1948-49, as I have stated, the Labour Government took £39,029,276 from tbe public by this form of taxation. In 1949-50, £42,424,580 was taken. In 1950-51, the present Government took £57,170,473. In the next financial year-the year of the horror budget-it took approximately £95,000,000. Then there was a slight easing off, when it was getting ready for the Senate elections of 1953. It reduced the rates and collected about £S9,000,000 in 1952-53. In 1953-54, the collections soared again to some £95,000,000. In 1954-55, they totalled approximately £100,000,000.' Tbe estimate for 1955-56, as stated in the budget brought down last August, is £106,000,000. The Prime Minister has told us that the increased rates now to be levied will return to the",39,Abthub Fadden

Therefore, the sales tax w ill yield no less than £136,000,000 in 1956-57. The present Prime Minister and ' the present Treasurer stated, when they were in Opposition, that £39,000,000 a year wa3 too much. They have demonstrated their sincerity by adding nearly £100,000,000 and bringing the sales tax revenue up to £136,000,000. It is no wonder the Government is in disrepute. I wish now to mention one point particularly to illustrate my argument. The Government has maintained a sales tax over the years of 12$ per cent, on ordinary soap, shaving soap, shaving sticks, creams and powders, which were taxed at 16$ per cent, under the last budget but have been increased to 25 per cent, under the new schedule. Of course, cosmetics and such things as baby powder are also taxed at the higher rate. The reason the Government gives for taxing baby powders at that high rate is that mothers sometimes use the baby powders as cosmetics. If a government cannot carry on without imposing a sales tax of 12^ per cent, on ordinary soap there is something the matter with that government. A t least the imposition of this sales tax on soap has left the Government in very bad odour. Tbe Chifley Government was continually pressed for money during the war years, and yet it never raised sales tax beyond what it thought was a reasonable sum. It borrowed all it could and in order to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure it used the huge total of £344,000,000 treasury-bills. This Government says it has to increase sales tax because it does not believe in using treasury-bills. Tbere is nothing particularly wrong in using treasury-bills. In fact, on occasions, it is a very beneficial method of raising finance, provided always that the Government can see money forth coming, either in surplus taxation or in the fulfilment of its loan programme, to enable it to discharge those bills. This Government is raising too much by way of sales tax and the surplus money of which it forms a part is being raised, not for the purpose of defeating inflation, but of contributing to that total of £57,000,000 with which it hopes to finance the deficit mitments under decisions of the Australian Loan Councilf o r the purpose of carrying on State public works. The case against this Government on the question of this sales tax legislation, as, indeed, in respect of every other taxation measure it brings down under this supplementary budget, is a particularly deadly one. Sales tax was once described by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( SirE r ic Harrison), when he was in Opposition, as a vicious form of taxation. He now shows his love for this vicious type of taxation by helping to increase the burden so heavily upon the Australian people. One of the authors of this previous budget was Professor Arndt. He and Professor Swan sent the document, which forms in part the basis of the Government's plans, to the other six economists for their approval. It provided for increased sales tax, increased excise duties and the rest. Professor Arndt, writin g in the A p r i l issue of a publication called Voice, used these wordsBy omitting any increase in personal income tax the Government made a major departure from the recommendations of the eight university economists. This drastically shifts the burden of the levies away from the well-to-do towards the lower income groups. gentleman's friend, Professor Arndt. of the Government. The economists bave done well out of this Government. They used to be called bureaucrats when the Labour Government employed them, but since this Government has taken over they have all been promoted and two of them have been knighted. Professor Arndt, who apparently is in line for a title, saidThe Government must be on the lookout in the coming months to be ready to put its policy gears in reverse. It must be ready with measures to stimulate spending should there be evidence of a serious danger of general unemployment. What is more likely to cause unemployment than the levy of sales tax to the point where it becomes regressive? The Treasurer himself admitted that in hia 1954 speech.",40,Abthub Fadden

The Treasurer, when he made his second-reading speech on the bill dealing with sales tax exemptions and classifications, wherein the Government bad decided to reduce the tax on certain items from 16$ per cent, to 12£ per cent., used these words.1 co-cream, confectionery, musical instruare taxed at only 10 per cent. Presumments and toys arid associated goods are at present subject to tax at tbe maximum rate of 10s per cent.

Though, in some senses, they may be regarded as less to levy the motor industry to the extent essential commodities, they occupy a very of 30 per cent, on non-commercial vehicles, definite place in the economy, some using large he saidquantities of primary products and all providing much work in a variety of industries.

That is what be said in 1954. In the bill before us he has taken all those items from the 12-J per cent, category and put them back into the 16$ per cent, category. He is not now concerned whether the tax becomes too regressive in its effect. If it does become regressive, then there will be considerable unemployment, and members of the Australian Country party, who allegedly are concerned about primary industry, should be careful about supporting a measure of this sort. Is it not a grave reflection on the capacity of this Government to raise money when it has to tax goods at the rate of 16$ pcr cent., or, in effect, levy a special tax of f l in every £6 on money spent on items such as ice-cream, confectionery, musical instruments, toys and associated goods? Those things are not luxuries. The Prime Minister, the other night, said that luxuries were the only things he was going to tax. meat pies. give the House a list of all the other things that this Government is still taxing, many of which the Labour party did not tax. The Prime Minister during the course of his speech the other night said that some goods were being maintained in the 10 per cent, category. We protest that none of these goods should be in the 10 per cent, category. Household goods and appliances, furniture aud crockery should bear no tax at all. How are young people going to set up homes if household goods are to continue to be taxed ? Tb? Prime Minister says, in effect, that the people are very lucky because these goods ably, if they had been unlucky they would have had to pay 12-J per cent, or even 30 per cent. When he announced that he was going I woidd not have it thought that wu are in a person not friendly to the industry; but for the benefit of honourable members opposite who never seem to read anything about sales tax, or about anything else, I should like to remind them that wben we were a government we taxed motor cars at the rate of S-Jper cent., not 30 per cent. This Government in its 1950 budget increased the rate to 10 per cent.; in its 1951-52 budget to 20 per cent.; and from 1952 up to date it has been 20 per cent. Then the rate was reduced to 16$ per products and primary cent.; now it is being increased to 30 per cent. increased as well. another matter. I cannot discuss that subject in this debate, but it is incidental to the capacity of a man, who bas to buy and operate a car, to pay the increased sales tax and be slugged an extra 3d. a gallon on tbe petrol he uses. This Government even went so far as to put a levy of 66$ per cent, on such luxuries as party decorations and put a tax on novelties.

As a matter of fact, if one wishes to buy a small replica of a decoraburden of taxes in all directions. We tion that has been awarded, he has not to pay any sales tax at all, but if he happens to wish to buy a medallion to present to a school or a prize for school sports, he has to pay a tax because those items are luxuries. Apparently the little bit of ironmongery which represents a decoration that is bestowed, a knighthood or whatever it may be, is not a luxury; presumably, that is an important item of apparel. The things which we used to try to remove altogether from the realm of taxation have now come back under tlie surveillance of the Government and been made subject to tax. I should like to give the House some idea of how sales tax has operated since it was first introduced many years ago. It started at about 5 per cent, or less and remained at that rate until the war came, and only under the pressure of war was it increased. It was always understood that when the war ended, sales tax, like income tax, would be reduced and that ultimately it would be abolished. The policy of the Australian Labour party provides for the abolition of all such forms of taxation. I am indebted to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) for handing me a statement of the statistical history of sales tax. It shows that in 1930-31, when the tax was first applied, the percentage it bore to total collections the printed signs which are displayed was 6.9 per cent., ancl I correct myself by saying that tbe rate of tax was then only 2£ per cent. The next year sales tax collections were 15.6 per cent, of total tax collections, and the rate of tax was only 6 per cent. Over the succeeding years, the rate of tax dropped from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., rising again to 5 per cent, in 1938-39, 6 per cent, in 1939-40, and then increasing to 8$ per cent., the rate which I mentioned as having been imposed in the early stages of the war. If this Government really wanted to increase in the cost of living. help the people, it would relieve them of the burden of indirect taxes as much as it possibly could. If it must raise the money that, it says it requires, the money should be got in the form of ticians and others. income tax. The Australian Labour party is not a high-tax party, and as a government after the war we reduced the reduced the rates of company tax and income tax, so that instead of a man paying 18s. 6d. in the f l on all taxable income of £5,000 and over, he paid only 13s. i d . in the £1 on all taxable income of £10,000 and over. But this Government, now that it is in difficulties', thinks that hitting the great mass of the people who do not realize how they are being taxed, is a good and safe method of raising its revenue, but this course is increasing the cost of living, contributing to the inflationary spiral, and doing harm to the economy. I suggest to the Government that there are some of the items which should be exempted altogether from sales tax. Foi' instance, the Government should reduce the sales tax on motor vehicles used for church purposes. Any clergyman who uses hi® car for church purposes, either on Sunday or when be is visiting members of his congregation between services, siiould be able to obtain a vehicle without paying sales tax. Motor vehicles used for church purposes are exempt from the tax if they are fitted with a platform on the back which can be used as a pulpit, but otherwise the purchaser of a motor vehicle has to bear a sales tax burden. In spite of repeated protests by myself and others, the Government still taxes outside churches, advertizing the name of the clergyman who is to preach on tbe following Sunday, or displaying exhortations from the Scriptures. I u the Government's opinion these are luxury items and their use ought to be discontinued, or if not, tax must be paid.

Perhaps the Government reckons that it can do this now, and then, as the next election comes due, relieve the burden a little and advertize itself once again, as it did in 1953-54, as a tax-reduction government. I regard all that has happened over the years, in bhe manipulations of the budget, and in the general political dishonesty which has been exhibited, as something which does harm to the standing and prestige of parliamentarians and certainly does dusters a institutions. I shall not take up much more time, but let me mention a few more items which are now subject to the 16$ per cent, sales tax levied by this Government. They are fancy goods of all sorts, artificial flowers, fountain pens and propelling pencils, cameras and photographic equipment and material, photographs, travelling bags, suitcases, handbags and other types of bags and travel goods, baskets and gramophone records. The extraordinary thing about the Government is that it imposes a l i m it on the size of baskets that one can buy without paying sales tax. If one buys a lunch basket which is twelve inches long, his purchase is exempt fro m tax. The purchaser of such a bag 13 inches long has to pay sales tax. The person with a good appetite pays sales tax, but a person who can l i m it his appetite to conform to the contents of a 12-in. lunch bag does not have to pay tax.

That was what the present Treasurer had to say when he was in opposition in 1948; but he is now levying sales tax on ice cream at such a rate that of every eight ice creams consumed, the Treasury, in effect, gets one. There is another gem from the right honourable gentleman's speech on that occasion in 1948. It readsTooth paste, washing soap, soap powders, and dish cloths are essential aids to cleanliness and to the maintenance of healthy grave disservice to democratic living standards, yet they are all subject tn sales tax at the rate of 2s. in the £1.

As I said at the beginning of my speech, when the House divides on this measure, we shall separate the sheep from the goats in the Government's ranks, but we shall not find a single sheep. I repeat something else that I said at the commencement of my speech, as follows:-We shall see a few honourable members with sheepish looks on the Government side, but I do not include even the honourable member for Mallee in that category. been my privilege, or otherwise, during party the last six years to follow, on many occasions, the bonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in debates on measures of this type, and I suggest to honourable members, particularly to new not been evident in this place over the members, that on eacb occasion the honorlast few years.

A few days ago, I noticed in a retail shop in Brisbane, dinner sets priced from £111 to £115. Yet the honourable member has implied to-day that expenditure on such items should not be subject to sales tax. I stand in my place and I say that I do not agree with him in any circumstances. If people can afford to make purchases of goods of that kind which, I say deliberately, are in the luxury class, then they can make a contribution, through indirect tax, to the revenues of the country. The honourable member also said that under Labour, motor cars carried sales tax at the rate of only Si per cent. But what were the circumstances in relation to motor cars between 1945, at the end of the war, and 1949, when the Labour Government left office? Most people were still using the cars they had used during the war-car s that were worn out. ""We know perfectly well that after the war finished, a considerable time elapsed before the motor car industry was able to increase its production in order to meet the requirements of people who were* using the cars that had been worn out in the war period. Therefore, I suggest that it is ridiculous to compare the situation in relation to motor cars existing at that time with that existing to-day. Motor vehicle statistics are illuminating. A few years ago, approximately 4,000 new motor vehicles were registered each month, compared with approximately 13,000 a month now. That indicates the improvement that has taken place in the number of motor cars available. I should like to remind the House aud the publie that. since this Government has been in office, it has done what both the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) said, when sitting in opposition, that the parties which now form the Government would do if elected to office. It has reviewed the incidence of indirect taxation. I remind honourable members particularly that when inflation placed heavy demands on the Australian economy in 1951, this Government did not hesitate to increase sales tax for the purpose of drawing off surplus money, with a view to stabilizing tbe economy. ""When stability was reached, we reduced sales tax, but now that an unsatisfactory inflationary situation is again developing, the Government has no hesitation, once more, in increasing sales tax. Apart from these general comments, and the general statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne in relation to sales tax, let us examine what is involved in the measure now before the House. In the main, the bill gives legislative effect to the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister in his statement on the Australian economy and referred to also by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech. Briefly, they are as follows :Private motor cars, including station wagons and estate cars, are to be taxed at the new rate of 30 per cent, instead of the old rate of 16$ per cent. Commercial vehicles, motor cycles, motor scooters and auto-cycles, and all accessories and parts for all vehicles, excluding tyres and tubes, are to be taxed at the new rate of 16$ per cent, instead of the old rate of 12£ per ceut. Tyres and tubes for all vehicles -whethe r used for commercial or private purposes-wil l continue to be taxed at the rate of 12f per cent. The rate of tax on all other goods in the 16$ per cent, classification, except motor vehicles, on which the rate has risen to 30 per cent., will rise to 25 per cent. Except for commercial vehicles, motor scooters and the like, no increase of tax is proposed in relation to goods in the 12$ per cent, category or in categories bearing tax at less than 12£ per cent. Apart from motor vehicles and accessories, the only commodities on which sales tax has been increased are those generally regarded as being in the luxury group. Of course, the lionorable member for Melbourne referred only to the luxury group, but I go further and say that, with the exceptions I have mentioned, the commodities which will bear increased sales tax are luxury items, goods of a less essential character, and items which are only purchased occasionally. I consider that the two last-mentioned qualifications have an important bearing on our consideration of the relevant parts of the sales tax legislation that are affected by the measure now before us. I think every honourable member will agree with me that tliere are included in this particular category some items which are more essential than others. Expressed in another way, certain types of goods within the classification are more of the nature of luxury items than others. Of course, from the point of view of sales taxation, it, is quite impossible for anybody to classify goods in a manner satisfactory to every individual. For instance, if a person's watch wears out, it is essential for him to buy another watch. Here, a distinction must be made between watches that are worn by average people and expensive watches, such as diamond studded wristlet watches whicli may cost as much as 500 guineas. It is a difficult matter to establish a basis of discrimination in this connection. A similar positiou exists in relation to clocks. Fountain pens are purchased only occasionally. How often does the average individual purchase a fountain pen, and what additional amounts of sales tax will he pay? As far as the individual is concerned, I suggest that, he will pay only a very small additional amount indeed. Similar comment could be made in relation to safety razors, travelling bags and handbags. These items are only occasionally purchased by people, because they last for many years. As the bonorable member for Melbourne has said, for many people a wireless set is an essential item. On the other hand, I point out that, in the case of people who want a wireless set in the kitchen and another in the bedroom in addition to the one in the lounge room, the purchase of Avireless sets comes within the range of luxury buying. Therefore, witbin tbese categories, it is impossible to distinguish between essential and luxury buying in a way that would be completely satisfactory to everybody. I point out that there is a real problem in relation to the number of categories of goods for sales taxation purposes. Repeatedly in this House during the last few years, I have stressed tliat the fewer the number of categories the better. associated with business undertakings which have had to operate under the sales tax legislation, T know that, if there are numerous sales tax categories, it is a very expensive matter to keep track of the goods in the various percentage grades, and those which are exempt from sales tax, in order to determine at the end of each month the amount of sales tax payable. Inevitably, there are inequalities in relation to different types of goods, and therefore it is more satisfactory, overall, to have as few categories as possible. I wish now to make some comment on the new rates. I mentioned earlier that motor cycles and motor scooters will be taxed at the same rate as. commercial vehicles. To be very candid with the Treasurer and the Government, I cannot understand why a motor cycle which is not used for business purposes-the vast majority of motor cycles arid motor scooters are not used for business purposes-shoul d be in a different category from private motor cars. AlthoughI regard many motor cyclists as a menace on the roads from the point of view of the accident potential, I point out that generally speaking only one person derives a real benefit from a motor cycle. During week-ends, of course, perhaps two people might obtain a benefit from a motor cycle. On the other hand, a motor car confers a benefit on every member of a family. At week-ends, motor cars containing as many as seven people can be seen proceeding to the seaside. I do not quite understand why there should be discrimination against the private car owner in favour of the motor cyclists, and I should be very pleased if the Treasurer would explain the reason to me. I suggest that herein lies one of the faults of the legislation before us. It would appear, and I think it is right to say, that many honourable members were shocked by the very steep increases in the rates of sales tax on private motor cars. Most people do not understand why this was done by the Government, but I believe that it was done not only to stop people from purchasing motor cars to the same degree as previously, but also to take some action against the increased use of hire purchase. Every honourable member knows that the Commonwealth has no authority in relation As one who has been either to hire-purchase deposits or the interest charged under hire-purchase agreements. That authority resides in the States, and the States have consistently refused to exercise it. When the Commonwealth suggested fhat the State governments should hand authority to deal with hire purchase over to the Commonwealth, the Premier of Queensland went straight back to his State and reduced the deposit required in respect of goods sold under hire purchase agreements. action on the part of a Labour Premier is a clear indication that the Labour party does not want any control to be exercised over hire purchase, irrespective of whether hire purchase is a substantial factor in the inflation of our economy. There is virtue in this measure, if it means that the average private owner of a motor car will use his present vehicle for an extra year or two. ""Most of us will agree that most private cars can bc used for an extra year or two before they need to be traded in for new vehicles; and if there is a postponement of a certain amount of spending in the community for the next year or so, that will bo an important contribution towards overcoming inflation. Silting suspended from 5.57 lo S p.m. suspended, I was speaking of the measure before the House in relation to the Government's economic plans, as they were outlined by the Prime Minister in his economic statement, and also by the Treasurer, who introduced this bill a few days ago. The honourable member for Melbourne, who is deputy Leader of the Opposition, preceded me in thisi debate, and he gave the impression that all items in the various schedules of sales tax were affected by this legislation. I have pointed out, and I repeat, that it applies only to goods in the highest schedule of tax-'that is, the 16$ per cent, scheduleand to the motor cars which are under the 12i per cent, schedule. I hope that T have been able to show clearly that the honourable member for Melbourne was off the beam wben he spoke on this matter. I also directed the attention of the. House to at least one anomaly that I see in this legislation. Private motor cars are to be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent., but motor scooters and motor cycles are to be taxed at the rate of only 16$ per cent. This seemed to me to be an anomaly, because a private motor car, in general terms and particularly for week-end motoring, serves the whole family. A motor cycle or a motor scooter, on the other hand, generally serves only one person, or at the most, two. stage, tbe traffic hazards related to the riding of motor cycles and motor scooters to which the honourable member for Corangamite bas referred, and emphasize the anomaly that has been created by this legislation. I believe, also, that those who use motor cycles generally can afford to pay the additional tax, because most of them are unmarried ancl receive an adult wage although they have not the family responsibilities of many adults. I believe, also, that the rate of tax on private motor cars [represents rather a steep increase. Most persons were surprised by the increase of the impost. As I have said, the new rate of taxes has been made necessary by tbe hire purchase problem. The responsibility for control of hire purchase lies with the State governments, but they have never attempted to tackle the problem, either in relation to the deposit on goods that are to be bought by hire purchase, or in relation to the interest charges on hire purchase agreements. In the case of Queensland, after the Australian Government had asked to be given control of hire purchase the Premier of Queensland, Mr Gair, returned to Brisbane and, immediately, the deposit required under Queensland legislation for goods bought under hire purchase was reduced. It has become necessary for tliis Government to use any measures it can adopt to meet this problem. Since motor car business represents between 60 per cent, and 75 per cent, of hire-purchase transactions, it seems that some sort of control must be imposed on it during this inflationary period. The Government believes that the higher cost of motor cars will have that result. In most cases, a private motor car will last for an additional year or two and, in many cases, there is no necessity for the owners to sell a car as soon as they do. Therefore, they can postpone the effect upon themselves, personally, of the increase of tax. In that way, they will be",45,Abthub Fadden

153,Mr Mackinnon,"A t great risk, too.",48,Abthub Fadden
154,Surely Such Mr Hulme,"I overlook, at thismaking a contribution to tbe figbt against inflation for wbich this legislation is intended. I make the further comment that I do not quite understand how £30,000,000 more in revenue will be derived from the imposition of this tax in a full year. It must come about in one or, perhaps, two ways. In the first place, it might come about through the essential purchase of new trucks for commercial use, or through the purchase of motor cars for private purposes because of the age of the vehicles that the owners possess. Some persons will purchase new motor cars for private purposes, irrespective of the price. We know that there are people who want to trade in their cars every twelve months, whether they have completed a useful life or not. In such a circumstance, the Government is justified in asking the persons concerned to make a contribution to revenue, but I cannot understand how an additional amount of £30,000,000 is to be raised from this additional impost. As the honourable member for Melbourne has said, it is estimated that revenue from sales tax will rise from £100,000,000 to about £130,000,000, representing an increase of one-third in relation to these particular items. I wish the Treasurer had explained just how that amount of £30,000,000 was calculated because, witb the discouragement of the purchase of new motor vehicles, I would not expect the substantial increase of revenue that the right honourable gentleman has mentioned. In 1951, when inflation was severe, the ment found it necessary to bring before Government adopted the principle, as it is doing now, that some spending power should be drawn off from the community. Some believe that we shall not be drawing off spending power to any great extent with this legislation. In fact, we might be making some inroads into the people's savings, but I do not believe that all of the additional amount to be paid in sales tax will come out of savings. Some of it, at least, will come out of current earnings. If current earnings are used to pay sales tax, I suggest that there will be fewer purchases of commodities other than those upon which sales tax has been increased. If that happens, surely the Government's purpose will he achieved, and there will be a reduction of consumer spending by the community. Some might ask how we can prove that that will be the result. In 1951, we could not prove that that result would be achieved, but, in fact, it was achieved by measures which were not dissimilar from the legislation now under consideration. I believe that this measure will have the effect of drawing off some consumer spending and, to that extent, it will assist, quite considerably, the Government's attempt to check inflation. I support the measure that is before the House. I know that nobody is happy about imposing additional taxation. Nevertheless, Australians have a broad outlook, and I believe that they see the justification and the necessity for what the Government is trying to do, not in its own interests, but in thc interests of the people as a whole, because if inflation races away, as it did in 1951, every person in the community will suffer. I am certain that, unpalatable though it may have been in the first instance, the public have come to see the sense offchemeasure which is now beforetlie House, and will accept it as an honest attempt by the Government to do the things which are in their interests. is visible evidence of the complete inconsistency of the Government's philosophy before and after assuming office. Wben Government members were in opposition, they consistently attacked the principle, and the operation of the sales tax. On every occasion when the Labour Governthe House a bill for the alteration of the then-existing schedules, honourable members who now form the Government waxed very sarcastic at the incidence of the tax, and said on numerous occasions that once a Liberal government graced the treasury bench, this tax would be reduced considerably. Facts, however, have completely belied that most interesting assertion made by present Government members when they were in opposition. For the last fiscal year of the Labour Government's term, the year 1949-50, £42,000,000 was collected in sales tax. That represented 8.4 per cent, of total tax collections. By 1954-55, that amount of £42,000,000 had risen to £100,000,000. and in addition to that, the percentage",48,Abthub Fadden
155,Mr Bird (Batman) [8.11],"This billthat sales tax bore to total tax collections increased. Whereas in 1949-50 sales tax represented 8.4 per cent, of total tax collections, in 1954-55 it represented 10.7 per cent, of them. After the present schedules have heen in operation for a full year, sales tax collections will amount to £13'6,000,000, and if the rates in other avenues of taxation remain as they are, the sales tax collections will represent 10.8 per cent, of total tax collections. When we consider the actual amounts collected, and the percentage that sales tax bears to total tax collections, and when we remember the very airy promises made by its members when they were sitting in the shades of opposition, this Government stands condemned. When Labour went out of office in 1949, the general rate of sales tax was SiV per cent. In 1951, this Government increased the rate to 12$ per cent., and it has stayed at that level ever since. It will ing £18,000,000 in sales tax. When the be readily seen from this that the average consumer is paying 50 per cent, more in sales tax for general articles than be did when Labour was in office. Many valid and legitimate arguments could be advanced as to why sales tax should not be levied on a wide range of articles, but suffice it to say that in Labour's view sales tax contravenes every sound principle of taxation. I will admit that, in certain circumstances, it can be justified and condoned. For example, the circumstances that justified its introduction in 1030 are not parallel with those obtaining to-day. Sales tax was first introduced into thc Commonwealth fiscal policy in 1930 wbich, as every honourable member knows, was a depression year. Not only was it introduced in Australia but it became an almost universal policy because of the peculiar circumstances existing in that tragic year. Governments all over the world found that the usual streams of taxation were drying up, and they were forced to tap other channels of taxation to acquire revenue to carry on ordinary state services. The revenue from income tax, as everybody knows, became lower and lower because of unemployment, and the government was forced to look round for another method of raising some ready cash. It was for that reason that in 1930 the Australian Government, and indeed, governments all over the world irrespective of their political complexions, introduced sales tax as a temporary measure to provide desperately needed revenue. Unfortunately, like many other temporary measures, with the passing of the years sales tax has changed from a. temporary to a permanent revenue source. It has proved very difficult to eradicate as its full effects have often passed unnoticed by the taxpayer, because it is an indirect tax. There was a great deal of justification for the imposition of sales tax during the depression years. The Labour Government introduced it, and the United Australia, party Government carried it on. There was very little diminution of the rate of tax when the United Australia party Government was in office from 1931 to 1941. As a matter of fact, when Labour went out of office, it was collectUnited Australia party Government went out of office in 1941, it was collecting £19,000,000 in this way. So there was very little difference between the amounts collected by either Liberal or Labour governments at that time. It is safe to say that at that particular period no valid objection could be levelled at the government of the day in respect of the imposition of sales tax. The rate of unemployment became so high and wage standards were so low, that revenue from income tax fell to an unprecedentedly low level, and the Government had to resort to other means of obtaining money to carry on the necessary services. The Government found that it had to establish some stable source of revenue, and introduced the system of sales tax. But whilst sales tax could be justified in the peculiar circumstances operating in tbose very distressing years, entirely different circumstances obtain to-day. For instance, nobody could suggest that income levels are low to-day, as they were in 1930. Incomes in the top brackets are now at an all-time record high. From 1940, when large amounts of money had to be found for the purposes of war, the rates of sales tax were increased. No objection could be offered to that, because money had to be found for the purpose of carrying on hostilities. In 1940, the general rate was increased to 10 per cent., and, later, during the war period, it rose to 12$ per cent. After the war, the Chifley Government, recognizing the jnequity of the tax, reduced the general fate to 8$ per cent, before it went out £>{. office. It was the Chifley Government's how unfair it was in its application, parJiolicy to reduce the incidence of sales .tax progressively, because of its unfair incidence, particularly in the lower income groups. This Government, despite its insistence, when it was in opposition, that it would reduce the tax, actually increased it in the year 1950-51. Whilst the maximum rate, which was 66$ per cent, in 1951, has been reduced, the general rate is still 12$ per cent, to-day as against is clamouring for an increase of real per cent, when the Chifley Governinent was in oflice. Labour's basic objection to the sales tax is that it does not comply with the principles of equitable taxation. It is a. tax on the purchase of goods, ancl as such, simply ignores the taxpayers' ability to pay. It runs counter to the principle of ability to pay and imposes the heaviest burden on those least able to bear it. As a matter of fact, sales tax is a kind of gross income tax that falls upon tbe paypv in inverse proportion to income. For instance, the less a man earns the greater is the proportion of his income that is taken in sales tax. It has been reliably computed that the average person spends something like half his income on goods on which indirect taxes, including sales tax, are levied, while the wealthy man spends on such goods as little as 5 per cent, of his income. Becausei t is impossible to assess the economic position of those making purchases, we find that every purchaser pays the same rate of tax irrespective of whether his income is £20,000 a year or a mere pension of £20S a year. Because the rate is the same for all buyers, it ignores the principle of levying taxation in accordance with ability to pay. In the past, sales tax was accepted with no marked hostility, because it was an indirect form of taxation. It was concealed, and because the rate was low, no one noticed the increases that were levied. It is safe to say that until 1951 consumers, generally speaking, were ignorant of the sales tax impost, because up to that time the inexorable collection of comparatively small amounts of tax from millions of purchasers more or less amounted to painless extraction. In 1951 the picture was completely altered, because the incidence of the horror budget brought home to people just how savage sales tax could be and ticularly to the lower income groups. It is reliably estimated that approximately 80 per cent, of sales tax is extracted from the ordinary wage and salary earners, who are struggling to maintain a meagre standard of living in a period of high prices. Sales tax makes those prices even higher. The average person in the community purchasing power. If the Government had done the right thing for these people -and it claims to represent all sections of tbe community-it would have reduced sales tax, not increased it. That would have been a boon to the ordinary people, who are now being placed under a very severe and unfair handicap. I have no doubt that if the Australian Labour party had been in office, it would have reduced sales tax. The resultant increase of pinch asing power would not have been inflationary, because, under existing conditions, it would have been spent on essential consumer goods. Shopkeepers in tbe division of Batman bave told me that, because of the incidence of sales tax, goods are starting to stockpile on the shelves of the ordinary shops. We have been told by Government spokesmen that one of the purposes of this bill is to discourage the purchase of luxury and semiluxury goods. A perusal of the schedules indicates that many of the items on which sales tax has been increased are by no means in the luxury classification. It is safe to say that, because essential consumer goods are being subjected to increased sales tax, some unemployment must occur. Fewer workers will be engaged in essential industries, because those industries, too, have felt tie impact of the present economic policy. Tbe idea behind the 1951 budget was the transfer of workers from luxury industries to essential industries, but to-day, because increased financial accommodation is not available, those industries are forced to restrict their activities. Government supporters have stated that the Government must have increased revenue for tlie purpose of carrying on certain vital community services. If it must have increased revenue, it could impose other forms of taxation. I suggest that any tax should be judged by its impact upon our economic well-being and its effect upon the stability of the economy. In the light of that test, sales tax fails dismally. Personal taxation of high incomes and wealth on a wide scale seems to furnish the best available instrument for achieving this end without greatly damaging the productivity of the economic system. When we examine any form of taxation, be it sales tax, income tax or excess profits taxatiou. tax, I suggest that, in order to obtain an assessment of its effect upon the community, it should be considered from three points of view. The first question that we should ask, and which tbe Labour party places in the forefront of any examination of taxation proposals, is: In what way does it apportion the burden among persons on different incomes? I should say that even supporters of the Qovernment could not refute tbe argument that the imposition of sales tax throws on the backs of the poor a burden that is out of all proportion to their ability to pay. The Labour party suggests that the acceptance of the idea that people should be taxed according to their ability to pay rather than in proportion to their inability to resist is a tremendous social achievement that must be safeguarded at all costs. The recognition of that principle, as a result of Labour's advocacy over many years, has been slow and painful. As the imposition of sales tax cuts across this much-prized principle, it must be indicted by all Labour spokesmen. The secnnd question that we should ask about any past form of taxation is: What is its efficiency as measured by costs of administration in relation to revenue produced? Tbe imposition of sales tax, the incidence of which ranges from 10 per cent, to 30 per cent., compels firms to employ people to do nothing more productive than the accounting that is involved in submitting returns to the Taxation Branch. This is a veritable nightmare to the small businessman who has to do the. work himself. It is necessary also to have an army of public servants to supervise the administration of the sales tax legislaregarding road transport. These facts tion to ensure that the correct rates are charged and collected. Thirdly, I think it is reasonable to ask in regard to any proposed form of taxation: What is its effect upon the productivity of the economic system ? Past experience, particularly immediately after 1951, has shown that increases of sales tax have been followed by a decline of production of not only so-called luxury goods but also essential consumer goods, because those goods have been taxed out of the reach of the average purchaser. I suggest that sales tax, as a form of taxation, does not measure up to those three tests, and that therefore it must be cast aside by all protagonists of reasonable and fair forms of I submit that the increases envisaged by the bill accentuate the insidious effect of sales tax on the community at large. If taxes are to be increased, why cannot they be increased equitably? I refer now in particular to the unfair discrimination against the motor vehicle manufacturing industry that is revealed in the bill. The motor industry is essential to our community. Industry is expanding in all directions. Factories are being built in the outer suburbs of Melbourne wherever and whenever land can be acquired. Industrialization is proceeding apace. Whether or not Government supporters like motor transport, the fact is that expanding industry, irrespective of the costs involved-and the new imposts will certainly add to production costs and accelerate the inflationary spiral-mus t have motor transport. Tbe motor vehicle manufacturing industry plays a very important part in Australia's development. We are proud of the expansion of this industry, because Australia is one country that motor transport has helped to develop. Because of the long distances that must be traversed, in very many respects motor transport is more convenient, and, in some cases, cheaper than rail or other similar means of transport. There is one commercial motor vehicle to every fourteen, persons in Australia, which proportion is higher than in any other country. That fact indicates the extent to which commercial enterprises in Australia depend upon motor transport. I should like to give the House some figures have been told before, but there is no harm in telling them again, if Government members w ill listen to them, because they show the very important part that road transport plays in the economic life of our community. Road transport accounts for 63 per cent, of all passenger miles travelled; it accounts for 26 per cent, of freight ton-miles traversed, and it accounts for 76 per cent of all freights carried by land in Australia. Notwithstanding those facts, the Government has decided, for some reason or other, to impose unfair penalties upon an industry that is doing so much for the development of the country. NowI deal with thc matter of private tegral part in our way of life. I suggest motor vehicles, on wbich sales tax has that there are many luxuries whose disbeen increased from 16$ per cent, to appearance from Australia entirely would 30 per cent.

159,Mr Davis (Deakin) [8.38],"I am involved and the attitude of the GovernI t was, no doubt, convenient for the honourable member for Melbourne lo ignore that passage. Whatever else the honourable gentleman may not be, he is certainly not inexperienced in debate, and I have no doubt that it was equally convenient for him to confine his approach to this matter that we are discussing, whioh is of some importance, purely to the question of the raising of revenue. On another occasion, when Mr Speaker (the Honourable A. G. Cameron) was in the chair, I ventured to speculate upon the possibilities inherent in a situation in which the honourable member for Melbourne was Treasurer, and Mr Government to-day is a disturbing one. Speaker ruled me out of order. Therefore, I shall not proceed further with that matter now, other than to say that in my opinion no greater disaster could befall this country. As I say, the honourable member referred to revenue and suggested that we should collect revenue here, there and in other places. He referred to the figure that i optimistics ally called a surplus infchebudget. The honourable member knows, and indeed he said, that the purpose of this so-called surplus is to finance State works. I ask you, sir, in the absence of the honourable member for Melbourne, who is no doubt conferring with 'bis leader: Does the honourable member, who speaks, I believe,for the Australian Labour party, favour the financing of State works or does he not ? That is the situation that faces him on this issue. Either .State works are financed as we propose to finance them or they are not financed at all. The honourable gentleman knows that perfectly well. He was merely playing with words, when he spoke as he did this afternoon, and he presented only one side of the case. I think it will be agreed by any one who applies himself to this problem that we cannot treat the measure that we are discussing; in isolation. The honourable member for Batman, whose contributions Kb the debates of this House usually are thoughtful and admired by some, was guilty of doing that. He took tbe bill that we are discussing and looked at it in isolation, but if we consider it realisticable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), ally we must do so in relation to all the measures which the Prime Minister announced the Government has taken and proposes to take to meet the situation that confronts Australia. We have to view these proposals against the background of the permanent change which has taken place in living standards, and also against the background of the principles of taxation to which the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) referred. I want to make it perfectly clear that, I think that, in principle, sales tax is a tax which should never have been levied and which should have been removed long ago. I believe it to be essentially an inflationary tax. However, tbe situation which confronts the Australian It has been said that the estimated receipts from sales tax for the current year are £106,000,000, and for the next financial year they probably will be £136,000,000. The question of reducing the incidence of sales tax is a very real problem for any government, and so too is the question of where to obtain the finances necessary to carry on the business of the country if that were done. In my opinion, it is entirely fallacious to reason, as the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Batman did, by saying that in .1932 sales tax was such-and-such a percentage of revenue, whereas to-day it is a substantially greater percentage. That approach, unfortunately, is too commonly made by members of the Opposition. It is an approach based upon the thinking of the depression days. Indeed, if I remember correctly, the honourable member for Batman referred at some length to the fact that sales tax commenced at the rate of 2$ per cent, in 1930 or 1932. As I see this problem, we should not endeavour to consider sales tax purely as a revenueproducer. In that respect, I disagree fundamentally with most honourable members opposite who have spoken, and 1 have no doubt that I shall also disagree in this respect with those who have yet. to speak. If I understand them correctly, they look upon sales tax purely as a revenue tax. Their alternative is to reduce sales tax and increase direct taxation. I am pleased to see that my friend the honorwho has been resting from his parliamentary labours of late, is now back in Parliament. I hope he has come back refreshed and that Ave shall find him entertaining in the debate. I have read with great interest what the honourable gentleman has been writing while the House has been otherwise occupied. But let us have a look at. this question of direct taxation, if we admit, first, the necessity to increase revenue by some means or other. We must increase revenue in order to meet the obligations of the Government. If we admit that that is necessary, let us then pass to the illuminating remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne. He said that the Labour party was not a high taxation party, and that after the war the Labour government reduced income tax, which was then 18s. 6d. in the £1 on incomes of more than £5,000 a year, to 13s. 4d. in the £1. When he said that, the honourable gentleman beamed happily because, according to him, that was indicative of a low taxation party. In fact, no political party to-day is a low tax party. Do not let us play with words. If we accept the obligation to govern, then we must also accept the obligation to raise revenue to finance government. Further direct taxation unquestionably vvould retard industry generally. Indeed, it might bear so heavily on some industries that either they would go out of production or their productivity would decline. It would bear so heavily on the additional income gained from working overtime, which is general enough in the community to-day, that overtime would decrease as it decreased under the so called low taxation Labour party. Every one here knows that I speak only common sense when I say that those would be the inevitable consequences. In this peculiar economy of ours, whether we like it or not, many people expect the Government to be responsible for everything and to direct everything. That is not my political philosophy, but it is one which I and others are at the moment forced to accept. If bonorable members believe that that is so, the raising of direct taxation would probably adversely affect those industries regarded as essential, and benefit those which, irrespective of our political views, are regarded as less essential. High taxation at the present time would tend to promote again the ""milk bar "" economy of which so many honourable members complained in the past. 1 wish to refer to some important factors in the present situation, and direct the attention of the House to statistics contained in a White Paper on the national income and expenditure. . In the year 1953-54, the value of Australia's wool export was £410.000,000. i : \ 1954-55 it dropped to £353,000,000. That was a decrease of £57,000,000 in the value of the main export on which our national economy is based. In tbe same period investments in motor vehicles, including both motor cars and motor trucks, rose from £210,000,000 to £256,000,000au increase in that item alone of £46,000,000. Investments in capital equipment, which is a vital factor in industry and, consequently, in the national welfare, rose from £260,000,000 to £2S2,000,000, an increase of only £22,000,000; but sales of tobacco, cigarettes and beer rose from £304,000,000 to £328,000,000, an increase of £24,000,000 in a year. Against tbose figures, the sum spent on education in Australia in 1953-54 was £65,000,000, and in thc following year it rose to £72,000,000. Honourable member? on both sides of the House, particularly members of tbe Opposition, have spoken with a great deal of logic on the need for private building. In 1953-54, the amount spent -on private building was £175,000,000 and in 1954-55 it rose by £20,000,000 to £195,000,000. Expenditure by public authorities on roads, sewerage, water and electricity supplies increased from £397,000,000 in 1953-54 to £412,000,000 in 1954-55. a rise of £15.000,000: If further illustration bc needed, it is readily obtainable from this White Paper, whicli honourable members can accept as a reliable document. These figures reveal a lack of balance in spending in the community. If fche theory is accepted that governments arc responsible for the control of expenditure of this kind, those figures clearly demonstrate the reason for action by tbe Government. It is a farcical and a disturbing position that during a year when the value of Australia's basic export-wool drops by £57,000,000, spending on these other commodities increases. In tlm aggregate, something like £79,000.000 more was spent on motor vehicles, tobar-m. beer and cigarettes in 3954-55 than in 1953-54, but in that same year the amount spent on education and private building increased by only £27,000,000. Tbe need for public amenities increases every year because, of tbe increase of population. I have previously expressed the view that the rate of immigration is too rapid for Australia. But, in spite of the added need for public amenities, spending by public authorities increased in the year under review by only £15,000,000. Surely, the need for the Government to do something about these matters is most apparent. I direct the attention of the House to what I consider to be the most important feature of this legislation, and of similar bills foreshadowed by the Government. This bill has two purposes, the first of which is the raising of revenue. The second, which is far more important, is the diversion of capital equipment, materials and man-power to essential industries. I remind honourable members that when the amount spent on motor vehicles, beer, tobacco and cigarettes increases by £70,000,000 in one year, that increase is expressed in a demand for capital materials; and if the demand, as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) so rightly pointed out, is reduced in consequence of the measures now being brought down by the Government, in all probability these essentials, the capital equipment, man-power and materials, will be diverted to more necessary industries. The truth of the situation is that the public want more motor cars and amenities and luxuries. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) talked about low taxation under the Labour Government, but he completely ignored the fact that in those days, although sales tax was 8 i per cent., it was impossible to buy motor cars, refrigerators or vacuum cleaners or to live in the state of luxury that the honourable member suggested existed. Although the honourable member's description of conditions at that time may be theoretically correct, the fact is that the amenities were not available. But, as a result of the policy of the Menzies Government, and the development and expansion of industry that has taken place during the past six years, the stage has been reached when both Parliament and the people have to ask whether we can afford to increase the number of motor vehicles on the road or to spend as much as is being spent on cigarettes, beer and gambling. Should we not curtail expenditure on these items in order that there may be more houses and amenities such as public authorities provide? The blunt truth is that we cannot have both, and however unpalatable the position may be in the shortterm political sense, in the long run few people will dispute that, if a choice has to be made because of the limitations imposed on Australia by its geographical position and its population, it is better to support a policy calculated in the long run to produce houses and amenities that are urgently necessary, and even such additional benefits as refrigerators and vacuum cleaners, about which the honourable member for Melbourne talked, but which, in fact, were not available when the Labour government of which he was a meniber was in office. I believe that all people who accept soino responsibility for thc good government of this country will come down on the side of measures which aro unpopular at equipment, man-power and the moment but which, in the long run, will prove, their worth to the community. [9.0] -It was rather interesting to listen to the dissertation by the bonorable member for Deakin( Mr Davis). He spoke of an increase of £70,000,000, or some other large sum in the expenditure on beer, cigarettes, tobacco and motor cars. Then he spoke about the necessity to choose between those things and other things. If it is wrong for us to spend so much each year on beer, cigarettes, tobacco a'nd motor cars, why has the Government increased the taxes on them to such an extent that, at the present rate of consumption, expenditure will rise by another £30,000,000? In those circumstances, I cannot see how the people will be able to get the other things to which the honourable member referred. The measure that we are considering now illustrates very clearly the difference between the philosophy of the Australian Labour party and the philosophy, or the dogma, of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. The Labour party, throughout its history, has",54,Abthub Fadden
160,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"believed that taxation should be a means of equalizing the distribution of the wealth of the country among the people of the country. For my part, throughout my association with the Labour party in a State parliament and in this .Parliament, I have always endeavoured to ensure that taxation shall be levied in such a way that it will bear most heavily upon those who are best able to bear the burden. I believe that a system of taxation should be a means of levelling out the distribution of the nation's wealth among the people. ""When I look at the measure before us, I wonder what is in the minds of honourable members opposite, who are supporting it so blindly. In 1947-48, when a Labour government was in office, the members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, then in opposition, took advantage of every opportunity to lash the Labour government' for, as they alleged, hiding from the people the full amount of taxation that the people had to pay. They said then that they did not believe in indirect taxation. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr ago, I was trying to think of a simple Calwell) read to us this afternoon extracts from speeches made in 1948 by the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) in connection with the sales tax. In the course of those speeches, the right honourable gentleman said that a tax of that description was wrong. Let us look back to see what has happened in this country in the field of taxation during the last quarter of a century. It was only a quarter of a century ago that this Parliament brought into being the system of sales tax that we have to-day. This afternoon, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr per cent. The jeweller had to pay out £6, Turnbull) asked, ""Who brought in the sales tax?"" Then, answering the question himself, he said, "" The Labour party, the Scullin G-overnment"". Honourable members who are familiar with the events of 1931 know why the Labour party brought in a very mild form of sales tax at that time. The Commonwealth Bank was under the control of the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Scullin Government was faced with a hostile Senate. When Labour tried to put through the Parliament financial measures to meet the needs of that time, those measures were turned down by the Senate, and also by the Commonwealth Bank Board. So Mr Scullin, the then Prime Minister, was forced to find other ways to raise the revenue required to meet the needs of the oountry. One of the mefthods that he adopted was the imposition of a sales tax. That tax was imposed, not because we liked it, not because we believed in a tax of that type, but because, owing to lack of numbers in another place, we could not pass other taxation measures through the Parliament. Before the present Government came into office in 1949, members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in this Parliament attacked the principle of the sales tax. They said that it was wrong. We on this side of the House say to-night that it is absolutely wrong to force up prices by increasing the sales tax. I have been amazed to bear honourable members opposite rise to support this measure and talk about the Government's efforts to check inflation. By the methods it is adopting, the Government is increasing inflation. A little while example that I could give to show the effect of an increase of the sales tax. I decided to select an item from the list of articles on .which the rate of the sales tax will be increased from 16$ per cent, to 25 per cent. I looked down the list and I saw that it included serviette rings, book-ends, jardinieres, vases and watches. A watch is something that everybody buys at some time or another, so I shall take it a? an illustration. Let us assume that a retail jeweller purchased a watch from an importer for £6 when the rate of the sales tax was 16$ plus £1 in sales tax, or £7 altogether. His profit would be based on that figure. I shall assume that his margin of profit was 33$ per cent., which I think is much below the actual margin on which a jeweller would work. On that basis, the jeweller wonld add £2 6s. 8d. to the price, so the cost to the customer would be £9 6s. 8d. What is tbe position now that the sales tax has been increased? The original cost of the watch is still £6. but, as the sales tax has been increased from 16$ per cent, to 25 per cent., tb? jeweller has to pay tlie importer £6 plus £1 10s. The cost of the watch to the jeweller plus the sales tax is £7 10s. Then he adds his margin of 33$ per cent., or £2 10s., which makes the cost of the watch to the customer £10. Reference has been made to keeping accounts and books and sending in returns to the department so that the tax can be collected. A retail jeweller had to keep exactly the same books and had to follow exactly the same procedure when tihe tax was 16$ per cent, as he did when it went up to 25 per cent., but, because the Government has said that it wants an extra 30s. in sales tax on a watch, the jeweller gets another 3s. 4d. for handling the watch. I was talking to a couple of businessmen in an hotel here the other day. 1 referred to the sales tax and to the way in which profit margins were based on the cost of an article to the retailer plus the sales tax. They said, "" It is generally mately £100. If honourable members work recognized that your margin must be based on the cost of the article to you. The sales tax is included in that cost"". Suppose the sales tax on something priced at £6-it does not matter whether it is a watch, a jardiniere, or any of the scores of things in the list that the Minister has given us-is to be increased by 10s. The purchaser will pay, in addition to the extra 10s. sales tax, another 3s. 4d. to make up the retailer's margin of 33$ per cent, of the cost to him, including the sales tax. If , as in many instances, the retailer's margin is 50 per cent., the purthe retailer or how much the sales tax chaser will pay a total of 15s. extra, instead of only the 10s. by which the sales tax has been increased. The increase will, be correspondingly greater for every multiple of £6 represented by the cost of an. article. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) mentioned a dinner set selling for £100, or approximately sixteen times £6. If the increase of the retailer's margin on an article selling at £6 were 6s., mention a statement that was made about the increase on the dinner set selling at £100 would be about £5. The retailer contends that he is entitled to the additional amount, because he has put up the money in the first place; yet he does notliing more in the way of handling the article sold, he has no more rent to pay, his overhead charges are no greater, and he has no additional forms to complete for the Government. But, on something selling for £100, he will reap an extra £5 of profit. In spite of this, we are told that the Government's measures will check mflation and direct money into the right channels. Let us consider again what the sales tax, or hidden tax, does to the people. 1 agree with what was said by the present Treasurer, and the present honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), in 1948, when they were in opposition. They ?nnibasted the sales tax as a hidden tax. ""What will be the effect of the increased sales tax on motor car prices? We say that motor cars already are too dear. Figures published iu the newspapers in Melbourne and elsewhere show that the increase of the sales tax rate from 16| per cent, to 30 per cent, will raise the price of a Holden motor car by approxiit out, they will find that 30 per cent, of tbe basic price comes to about £225. Do motor car buyers realize that every purchase puts £225 into the Government's coffers by way of the sales tax? They realize that there is some sales tax, but they do not know how much it is. Before the increases were imposed, an intending purchaser would be told, for example, that the price of a Holden special sedan was approximately £1,050, and of a standard sedan approximately £1,000, including sales tax. He wouid not know what margin of profit was being made by was. Before the sales tax rates were increased, the sales tax on a Holden sedan was approximately £125. It will now be approximately £225'. Can any one wonder why Opposition members claim that most of the measures adopted by the Government are rebounding against those least able to pay the increased prices? To illustrate my argument, I wish to interest rates. We were .recently told by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia how overdraft interest rates were to be maintained at an average of 5$ per cent. He stated that primary producers and exporters of manufactured goods would be charged about 5 per cent., and that business people who wanted overdrafts would be charged 6 per cent. Who will pay the extra charge for those who have to pay 6 per cent.? If the Myer Emporium Limited, or any other firm, has to pay 6 per cent, instead of 5 per cent, interest on its overdraft, it will not pay the additional charge out of its profits. It will merely increase its prices in order to make enough additional profit to pay the extra 1 per cent, interest on its overdraft. This means that the increased charge will be passed on to the consumer all along the line. This is exactly what happens with the sales tax. The Treasurer has made a statement in connection with motor cars and the petrol tax. I cannot deal with the petrol tax at this juncture, except so far as the Treasurer's statement concerns it. He said that 70 per cent, of the petrol consumed in. Australia is used by business people who can pass on the additional petrol tax. To whom will tbey pass it on? If the charge for the cartage of i load of goods from a wharf, or elsewhere, to a business house is increased from 10s. to 12s., who will pay the additional 2s.? We know that, initially, it will be paid by the storekeeper, but, in the long run, it will be paid by the consumer, as is every increased charge. We have to remember that the increase of the sales tax is only one of the measures designed to give effect to the economic propositions advanced by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). The honourable member for Deakin has just told us that we cannot isolate the sales tax from the economic situation. He stated that somo people were trying to isolate it. In his view, the sales tax cannot be isolated from the problem of the raising of funds for local-governing bodies and for government services. The sales tax increases all are part and parcel of the measures to be taken to meet the Government's financial needs. The honourable member for Deakin stated also that we must not look at the sales tax increases merely as revenue-producing proposals. The Prime Minister bas said that the sales tax and other taxes have been increased in order to prevent a cash deficit and, if we have to accept these increases in the light of that statement, their purpose is definitely revenue-producing and not merely to prevent people from buying goods. I wish to mention again the effect of the increased sales tax on the purchasers of motor cars. A day or two after the Government's proposals were announced, I received a letter from a man in South Australia, my home State. He was not merely being critical of the Government. He wrote that he was lucky that he had bought a new car a month or two before, and pointed out that a number of men who worked with him were waiting for the delivery, at almost any time, of new cars that they had ordered, and in anticipation of which they had sold their old cars. He stated that they now found that they had not sufficient money to buy the new vehicles and had had to cancel their orders. Others, however, have not found it necessary to cancel their orders for new motor cars. Let us suppose that a person who intended buying a new Holden motor car at the old price of approximately £1,000 had £700 in hand and intended to obtain the other £300 under a hire-purchase transaction, to be repaid, perhaps, over two or two and a half years at a flat rate of interest of S per cent. Instead of obtaining £300 under the hire-purchase transaction, he will now have to obtain £400. He will have to pay off a little more, but he will go ahead with his purchase. Is that sort of thing going to limit hire-purchase transactions ? We have been told of the great amount of hire-purchase business involved in the purchase of motor cars, and we can see that, even if the increase of the rates of sales tax to 30 per cent, will deter a few people from purchasing new vehicles, most intending purchasers will go ahead with the purchase, and the increased prices will merely swell the volume of hire-purchase business. I realize the difficulties and the complexities of this question. If we are told immediately that it is revenue and that the Government intends to get it where it can be obtained most easily, I would quite understand that; but when we are told that this is part and parcel of an economic proposition brought down by economists, I sometimes wonder whether an interjection made to-day about long-haired economists does not have some bearing on the matter. I read an article a few days ago in a non-Labour newspaper, which criticized the Government for acting upon the opinions of economists who always seem to be wanting to cure u depression. Tbe leading article in that newspaper said that the economists were always looking for some way to stop a depression seeming to forget that they could do something about prosperity. Economists do not think about prosperity. Their main theme, as with some doctors, is how to deal with people wben they are sick. They do not worry about them when they are well. Some of the economists are of the same way of thinking; they think only of a sick economy and do not look at prosperity in the way they should. I am afraid that if we are to go on in this manner and say we are just going to borrow in this way, we sball come to grief. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), in opening the debate to-day, said that the Labour party would oppose this measure. I shall oppose it most heartily because I believe it is wrong. tax, but when the Government brings in a As I stated earlier, the philosophy of the Labour party on taxation is that it should be levied on those who are best able to bear it. To apply, this method is not levying taxation where it can best be borne. I am not concerned only with the increase in respect of the items in the schedule. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) said that the honourable member for Melbourne had referred to a number of goods affected by sales tax which are not included in this bill. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke about other items, but I do not think he said that they were affected by any increase in this bill. He referred to some items that attracted 12$ per cent., and he mentioned soap as being one of the things on which there should be no charge. He gave us quite a homily on the subject of soap and cleanliness. I do not desire to go into that; but apart altogether from the increases that are being made now, we on this side of the House are very concerned about the tremendous impost of sales tax. The honourable member for Melbourne this afternoon stated that when the Labour Government went out of office in 1949 the total amount of revenue received by way of sales tax was £39,000,000 a year. The revenue this year, excluding these increases, was estimated at £106,000,000 and, on the Treasurer's figures tbese increases will bring an additional £30,000,000. We have to remember that these increased taxes were imposed some weeks ago, and are in force at the present time. We are now only validating them. The amount of sales tax that will be collected will be in the vicinity of £139,000,000 for the year. When the Labour party imposed sales tax, the revenue therefrom was just over £30,000,000, and it was condemned bitterly by honourable members opposite. Yet, we find the Treasurer, who joined in the condemnation, bringing this bill before the House, and we find honourable members on the Government side supporting it. I do not blame them for that, because they belong to the Government party and they have to stick to it. The only thing I say to them is that it seems to me that at times some people can approach things in a hypocritical manner. When in opposition, they say they do not believe in sales bill like this they accept it. On top of that, they tell members on this side of the House that we are caucus-ridden and have to do what our par.ty decides. true. this party do not have to. act of grace, even though they may not have to. I have been in this Parliament for some few years now and I was previously in the South Australian Parliament for many years and on each occasion when a showdown occurred when the Labour party moved an amendment and members of the Government party admitted that there was something in it, they voted against it after their Minister stated that he would not accept the amendment. I remember a dear old independent in the South Australian Parliament years ago who got up after the Labour party bad moved an amendment and said, "" I think it is a good amendment, I shall support it, but if it means the defeat of the Government I shall vote against it "" . Of course, he was an independent; and we have the same kind of people on the Government side to-day. I am not blaming them, but when they accuse honourable members on this side of",57,Abthub Fadden

When it went out, sales tax, on a percentage basis, was about one-third of what it is to-day. The Labour party was able to get along all right with that amount of sales tax. The honourable member speaks about the job this Government has done; but the Labour party did not have to come along in a time like the present, the most prosperous this country has ever experienced, and impose taxes like this upon the community. The method of the Government in imposing sales tax such as this is in keeping with the other methods it has adopted from time to time. It is in accordtain prosperity and to restrain the inflaance with its political philosophy, and I do not expect anything different from it. I do not accuse honourable members opposite of being dishonourable. I think they are trying to carry out what they think is a right policy; but I do say to them that a policy such as this, which takes from the person at the bottom, or which takes from one section unfairly, is not in the best interests of the people of Australia. I hope that this sales tax imposition delivered on behalf of his Government, it will not last for very long. Thousands of was made quite clear that taxation electors in my district are employed in measures would have to be taken and the motor industry.

It is that within the next fifteen months the was reported that 150 men were put off amount of £253,000,000 has to be found by one firm in Adelaide a fortnight ago, and I read in the press that two or three other firms also were affected. A spokesman for those firms was reported as saying, "" You cannot blame the sales tax for this because we have periods of fluctuations"". It is a remarkable coincidence, however, that immediately the increased sales tax came into force the services of those men were dispensed with. I say to the Government and to those persons supporting it that their philosophy is a wrong philosophy and that in the end they will have to come back to the course which Labour proposes. Sales Tax ""(Exemptions and Classifications) Bill which is at present before the House is one of a series of measures which have been brought forward by the Government for the purpose of maintaining the prosperity of this country. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) indicated in the budget last year that the boom through which the country is at present progressing was showing certain signs that probably before very long steps Avould have to be taken in order to maintion which was obviously increasing. That warning which was then given by the Treasurer was subsequently repeated by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in Jus September statement on the economic situation. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech, made it quite clear that the Government would be prepared to take any steps, including taxation measures, which were necessary in orderto maintain the existing prosperity.

167,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [9.30],"Theby tbe Government for loan redemption. Tbat is over and above tbe ordinary loan funds which we expect to come to us from the loan market. So, within the next year, or fifteen months, we need to obtain far more than £253,000,000 from loans nr some other source. In addition, an amount of £61,000,000 has to be found by the Government in order to provide for State public works. It will be seen front the statement that I have made that, liaving regard to the present state of thc of those goods which are now subjected to loan market, which is well known, it is unite impossible to expect that these huge amounts should come from loans. It may very well be that the fact that these amounts have to be found will encourage the Government to take steps which will improve the loan market. Tbat matter has been debated at some length in the course of this sessional period, and I do not propose to traverse it again. Apart from that, the alternative to taxation as a. means of obtaining these moneys is the issue of a tremendous flow of treasury bills, and no course could be more violently inflationary than that. 'Therefore, in these circumstances the Governnient has to resort to taxation. In a period of expansion, development, and prosperity, it is quite evident that Statepublic works must be continued. Consequently, the Government has undertaken that State public works shall be provided for and that the money for them shall bc found. At the same time, the Goverumeilt has ilecided to decrease, its own expenditure on public works by £10,000,000 and, as was pointed out in a recent speech by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr amount of £581,000,000 upon motor Olarey), it also cancelled £19,000,000 worth of imports of government materials. Wlien it is said in an idle way by so many people that the Government is not endeavouring to reduce its own expenditure, they seem to overlook the fact that there alone is £29,000,000 which the Governinent will uot expend this year. The (iovernment has definitely cut down its own expenditure to that extent, but at the same time it has said to the States, You have vitally necessary public works which must be carried out and we will see that you have the money for that purpose"". I would say that no member of this House, and certainly no member who has any sense of responsibility at all, would feel bhat it was wrong so to decide By this measure, which provides for increased sales tax ou certain items, the Government will be cutting down on imports in the first place, and in that way there will be an improvement in the balance of payments, which has gone against us very greatly of recent months and must be prevented from going any further against us. By restricting imports a heavier tax, imports will be lessened and it will be possible to restore the balance of payments at least to a reasonable level. In addition, there has been an excessive amount of capital expenditure, principally through hire purchase, anel because of that the economic position in the community has become somewhat grossly inflated. That is, quite a serious position, because unless the inflation is curbed tbe boom through which we have been passing could easily lead to quite a depression, and certainly a regression, and we do not want that. The Government is determined, by measures such as this, to see that that position does not occur. The highest tax rate is imposed on less essential goods. Eor example, it applies to motor cars. Let us see what the position has. been with regard to motor cars. During the financial year 1954-55, imports conneoted with the motor industry were valued at £152,000,000, representing IS per cent, of this country's gross imports. During that year, the country spent the huge vehicles, motor vehicle parts, and petrol, and no fewer than about 230,000 new motor vehicles were registered, of which 160,000 were motor cars. That shows the enormous expansion that has taken place in the motor car industry and that expansion has, to a great extent, been brought about by the tremendous increase in hire-purchase dealings, which bave now got quite out of hand. They are, in fact affecting the economic position of the community and the Government therefore says that they must be curbed. The Government's measure dots not suppress hire-purchase transactions. It has been said that hire purchase is thr friend of the poor man. T'he Government will not take that friend away from the poor man. We will still have hire purchase with us, but its extent will be restrained. What has the Opposition to say with regard to these measures ? Quite a number of specious statements have been made by Opposition members in the course of debates in this House, one of them being rhat motor cars are simply necessaries, that one cannot regard them as anything else, and therefore that sales tax on them should not be increased even though they are throwing the economic structure of tbe community out of balance. Let us nave a close look at the past attiThat is a triumph of the Menzies Governtude of honourable gentlemen opposite, who now talk about motor cars being necessaries, and compare it with their present professions in that respect. What view did they take when they sat in this House under the leadership of Mr Chifley, as Prime Minister? They did not then regard motor cars as necessaries. Mi. 1 Chifley ancl his Government, many of thc members and supporters of which sit in this chamber now, were determined that motor cars should bc used as little as possible. They refused to provide petrol in the quantities required by motor car owners. In fact, when Mr Chifley was urged to provide the necessary petrol, he said tliat it could not be obtained. When he was told that it could be obtained, because it was easily available, he definitely denied that fact, and his Government supported him in that denial. That very refusal to provide people with the petrol that they required was one of the causes of the defeat of the Chifley Governnient. When the Menzies Government caniu into office, one of its first measures was to see that the people got the petrol they needed, and they have been able to get it ever since in order to run the cars which members of the Labour party now say are so necessary. But Labour party members, now say that cars aire necessaries, and not luxuries, only because it suits them at the moment to say so. Wheni t did not suit them to regard motor oars as necessaries, they refused to provide the petrol to run them. The change that has occurred in the six years since the Chifley Labour Government went out of office is interesting. That government took the view that the use of motor cars was to be (restricted as much as possible. Obviously, it wisbed motor cars to be regarded as luxuries, which could be used only by people who were able to afford luxuries. In the six years of the Menzies Administration, motor cars, according to honourable gentlemen opposite have become, no longer luxuries, but necessaries. In other words, the result of the Menzies Government's prosperity administration is that the living standards of the people have risen tremendously, and are now as high as living standards anywhere else in the world. ment, a fact which, apparently, members of the Labour party who are now arguing so vehemently about the necessity of cars, do not realize. I pass to another argument advanced by the Labour party, which is that the need for increased taxes would not havo arisen if we had price-fixing. What occurred when we bad prices control? We had shortages of goods, we had black markets, we bad double prices-the ordinary price at which goods could not be obtained because they were not thero to be purchased at the correct price, and the black market price for which it was possible to buy goods. In effect, we might almost be said to have had two currencies in operation during that period-the ordinary £1 which could nofc find goods for sale, and the black market £1 which could buy goods at astronomical prices. People endured intense hardship during the period of prices control because of the great shortages of goods available for purchase at the correct prices. Honourable members opposite say that sales tax was not heavy under tbe Chifley Labour Government. Quite apart from the difference between the present value of the £1 and its value then, the fact remains that goods were simply not available for purchase during the term of the Chifley Government to anything like the extent to which they are now available. Nowadays, when we have prosperity, there are goods to buy, and we do not have thc hardships that existed under the Chifley Government's price-fixing policy. If we were to return to price fixation which, as everybody knows, the Commonwealth has no power to impose, and which, in any event, this Government would not impose if it had the power, we would find happening the same things as happened before. Those things have not happened under this Government's administration only because we have not had in operation the same system of price fixation as was used by the Labour Government. What else does the Opposition have to say with regard to this measure ? Honourable members opposite say, in effect, "" If we were in office, we would introduce excess profits taxation instead of increases of indirect taxes"". We have heard tonight what I can describe only as moans on the part of honourable members opposite about what is going to happen to the motor car industry as a result of the increase of sales tax on motor cars, and the increase of the petrol tax. What would happen to the motor car industry as a result of the introduction of excess profits taxation, a principle which the Opposition claims to support ? The motor car industry would be the industry that would be most heavily hit by excess profits taxation, because it bas been making tremendous profits. Time and time again in this House honourable members opposite have reviled the industry because of its allegedly excessive profits. The result on the motor car industry of the introduction of excess profits taxation would be that men would be driven out of employment, because the industry would no longer be able to expand. The effect of the industry's ability to make substantial profits is to give it an opportunity to plough those profits back into the business, to expand the business greatly, and to provide magnificent avenues for employment. That is what the motor car companies have been doing. Instead of the industry being crushed, as it would be under excess profits taxes, the only result of the Government's present measures will be to slow down slightly the purchase of motor cars. As many motor cars will be bought as before, but over a slightly longer period. Nobody, or practically nobody, will be thrown out of employment, and things will go on quite happily. Indeed, during the course of the debates in the present session, one member of the Opposition indicated that, because of the Government's proposed measures, primary producers and workers will have to ensure that they receive much larger incomes. No doubt, the honourable member did not realize the obvious implication of that statement which is that if the people he mentioned want to keep their incomes up, they will ensure that we get greater production. That is the only way in which they will be able to increase their incomes. I say that if greater production is brought about by the Government's measures, then those measures are indeed anti-inflationary in effect. But, supposing the motor car industry will be somewhat affected by this measure, we shall certainly not have anything in the nature of gross unemployment as a result, because profits from the production and sale of motor cars have been so high that the industry can easily absorb the extra tax from its profits, if it chooses to do so. If the alternatives were going out of business, and absorbing the tax in profits, we can be sure that the motor car industry would carry on by absorbing the tax. But, as I have pointed out, that state of affairs is hardly likely to eventuate. In 1954 this Government reduced sales tax on household furniture and equipment, and also exempted from that tax various articles that were of importance in, and of great use to, industry, and in the construction of machinery. TJnder the present measure, that exemption remains, and sales tax is not to be increased on household goods, or on many useful articles. Sales tax is imposed only on less essential articles. A great deal has been said to-night about the iniquity of sales taxation. We have the theorists who say that they do not believe in indirect taxation. There are two forms of taxation, as is well known,-direc t and indirect-and , say .what the theorists will, the fact remains that both forms are still utilized. There is this to be said in favour of indirect taxation-that it means that every person in the community will bear at least some measure of the responsibility for the carrying on of the business of the government of the country. Consequently, indirect taxation must be regarded as definitely a democratic form of taxation. Air. CLYDE CAMEKON -Rubbish! about sales tax? Tbe honourable memis steeped in the injustice, because Labour ber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) created the tax and fostered it. has interjected something about sales tax being rubbish. Other members of his party have interjected to the effect -On e might be a bit doubtful, after that it is an unjust tax. What does the listening to various members of the platform of the Labour party say about Government, what this measure is init? It says that sales tax should be tended to achieve. Some of them claim abolished as soon as possible. Notice fchat its purpose is to raise revenue. the words "" as soon as possible""-no t Others say that its purpose is to reduce to-day, always to-morrow. What is the imports. One honourable member opposite history of sales tax ? The history of sales has said that it will abate inflation. Others tax in this country is that it was introhave said that it will regulate hire-purduced by a Labour government. The chase activity. Yet another supporter honourable member for Port Adelaide of the Government has suggested that it ( Mr Thompson) may try to explain it will divert resources from apparently away as much as he likes, but when a socially undesirable purposes to socially political party has a black mark against more desirable purposes. I doubt whether it. it, takes a lot or rubbing out, and he the bill could achieve all of those things certainly was not a good enough eraser. at once. Indeed, there is a real doubt If sales tax is an unjust tax, why did the whether it will achieve any of them at Labour Government keep it going for so all. Looked at simply, in the words of the many years?

I sugin the motor industry generally. gest that this is a very shallow interpretation of economic reality, and yet it seems to be the assumption underlying this situated the factories of General Motorsmeasure. It has been said by several honourable Proprietary Limited. During the last members that the Government already twelve months, so far as the Rootes group derives about £100,000,000 a year from and Standard Cars Proprietary Limited sales tas. Witb this additional impost, are concerned, I know that the Prime the revenue from sales tax, in round Minister( Mr Menzies) himself has figures, will be £130,000,000 a year. The officiated at functions when their plants estimated revenue from sales tax of have been extended, and has patted those £100,000,000 for the year ending in June industries on the back and has praised nextI believe that reliable estimate-include s something like Australian industry. Surely, the Prime £35,000,000 from tax on motor vehicles, Minister is not going to suggest that the motor vehicle parts, and ancillary items measure now proposed will encourage connected with the motor industry. Tn those industries. I doubt whether he other words, at present about 35 per cent, intends to say that, but I submit that of sales tax revenue is derived from taxathere is a very good case to show that component in the prices of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts. There might be Again, if the categories of items on result of the increase of sales tax on motot vehicles, whether commercial vehicles on will collect an additional will carry 30 per cent, instead of 16$ per I represent an electorate in which are Holden's Limited, the Rootes group of motor manufacturers and Standard Cars it was a them for what they have done to develop there will be a retardation of those industries, and that the same sort of thing will happen to them after June, 1956, as happened to them during the past period of import restrictions. When imports were last restricted, the motor industries could not get from overseas the components they use to build motor vehicles, and, in consequence, employees were put off work. More than 1,000 people were out of work in that area at that time for periods up to three months. Fortunately, in accordance with the stop-start policy of this Government, import restrictions were abated to some degree, aud the industry has continued to expand. Now, apparently, the Government considers that import restrictions cannot be tried again, and, looking around for revenue, it has decided that the motor trade can "" take it "" without much interference with its activities. It is not often realized how closely the motor industry is integrated with the Australian economy. Some people talk about over-full employment, and suggest that a few thousand people can be put out of work because, after all, if they are out, too much money was being expended on of work in one direction to-day they can find employment in another direction to-morrow. Such an outlook ignores the reality of the situation, which is that people out of work to-day may be out of work transitionally for months, l n the motor industry the workers are very specialized, and their skills cannot be applied in any other direction. A man cannot be taken out of an assembly lineat Standard Cars Proprietary Limited and put to work on a new high school at Dandenong, because his capacity is not of tbe kind that can be transferred in that way. Consequently, when we begin to retard activity in the motor industry we begin to retard it in all directions, and cannot isolate it at a particular point. The Commonwealth Statistician publishes very comprehensive figures on the employment of bothcapital and labour in what he calls the motor vehicles and cycles industry. The last year for which his statistics are available is the year ended June, 1954, and, as the Prime Minister indicated, since 1954 there has been a considerable expansion of . the motor car industry. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske), who preceded me in this debate, quoted figures published in the Treasury Information Bulletin, an official publication of this Government, in January, 1956. That publication showed, on page 10, a summing-up of the position to the end of December, 1955. The biggest expansion of capital expenditure was expected by firms in the engineering and vehicle groups. The Government has encouraged tbose interested in those industries to put additional capital into the motor industry, and if the figures in that document are examined, it will be found that about £40,000,000 has been put into land, buildings and plant for the motor industry in Australia during the last three years. That is a very significant figure, which indicates the encouragement which was given to the industry to make Australia more self-contained in motor vehicles and less reliant on imports. It is hard to know, at present, how this particular measure will reduce imports. If it will not reduce activity in the motor industry generally, obviously it cannot reduce the imported components of motor cars. I suggest that if the Government felt that motor cars in Australia, one thing it could have done was entirely to prohibit the import of motor cars entirely made outside Australia-car s like Jaguars and Humber Snipes and other vehicles of that description which could hardly be regarded as making up the simple pleasures of the working man. There would have been no harm in restricting the importation of such vehicles, and if that were done, we should at least have a saving of imports, and there would have been no direct impact on employment in the motor industry in Australia. number of such vehicles enter Australia. ship would be done if their importation were prohibited. The bonorable member for Balaclava claimed that in some way or other indirect taxation was democratic taxation. I submit that this kind of impost envisaged by the Government is the very reverse of democracy. There is nothing democratic about a measure that allows the honourable member for Corangamite, for example, to buy a car",66,Abthub Fadden

If a i l to see any democracy about a tax of that kind. In the name of democracy I also do not see that any great hardship would be done by eliminating the importation of vehicles that ean be regarded as of the luxury type. The thesis that I am trying to develop is that in our opinion the assumption of tbe Government that this tax will make no difference whatever to the motor car industry is based on false grounds. The lionorable member for Balaclava suggested that the tax might slightly slow down activity in the motor industry, and that there may be a certain amount of unemployment in that industry. I suggest that the honourable member is not very well acquainted with the ramnifications of the motor industry in Australia. The figures show that the construction and assembly of motor vehicles in Australia is confined to what may be called the American group of Holden's, Ford's and Chrysler's, and the British group. Those groups at the end of June, 1954 employed 1.5,335 people. If an analysis is made of those workers it w ill be seen that almost the entire work force of the motor industry is made up of males over the age of 21 years. That suggests that for the most part the workers are skilled workers, and would tend to be married men. It is easy enough to say that there might be a small amount of unemployment in the motor industry for a while; but even if there were as many people out of work in the electorate of Melbourne Ports after this action of the Government as there were previously when import restrictions were applied, I certainly could not regard it ""as a matter that could be taken lightly . The workers whose employment is threatened are, for the most part, family men. Perhaps they are buying homes and have families of two or three children. They are contributing to the welfare of the community, and believe they have found employment in a reasonably secure industry. In addition to the 15,000 people engaged in construction and assembly, there are 21,000 more engaged in motor body building, and if there is a decline in the number of tmits, obviously there must be a decline also in the demand for bodies and component parts. Sixty thousand persons are engaged in ancillary departments making motor accessories, and in the construction of motor cycles and cycles generally. This is a highly integrated industry, but the Government evidently fails to recognize its part in the Australian economy. The Government seems to think that it does not matter if it cuts public works by 10 per cent, or, in the words of the economists, "" dampens down "" activities. The Government seems to believe that such action w ill not have effects in other directions. That fine publication, National Development, in the issue of March, 1955, contains an article on tbe Australian labour industry from which I quote the following:The importance of the industry in the Australian economy is also illustrated by its impressively large usage of raw materials. It is estimated that it uses about 85,000 tons of steel sheet, bar and strip each year, or 27 per cent, of the total Australian consumption of these materials, and about 30,000 tons of rubber, or 35 per cent, of the total Australian consumption. In addition, it consumes annually about 1,500,000 gallons of paint and paint products, 30,000,000 square feet of leather and leatherette and 4,250,000 square feet of safety glass. Its consumption of these and other materials will rise still further as development in the industry continues. I submit that the Government in this case, as in its measures generally, is taking a short-sighted view. The Government looked around to see where it could raise money, and expediency dictated its policy of increasing taxes on motor cars, petrol, beer, cigarettes and tobacco. The Government has reached its present position because of its failure to see ahead when the last budget was introduced, and because of its failure to tell the people of Australia before the election of the 10th December last what was the real situation in Australia. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) has suggested that Australia is facing a problem in the conversion of war loans amounting in the next financial year to £253,000,000. Again, that is only a problem because this Government has made it one. Loans totalling another £600,000,000 w ill f a l l due in the next four or five years, so the problem is not one for this Government only. than the person who had ordered one The only way in which the loans falling before him. That sort of process is far due next year differ from most other from being democratic, to use again the loans is that a higher proportion of these words of the honourable member for loans is held by individual investors, Balaclava. including small men who invested £100, £500 or £1,000 during the war period out that because the price of a new oar is of a patriotic impulse. Because this Goincreased as a result of sales tax, the vernment has destroyed confidence in the price of a used car should automatically loan market, it is fearful that not enough rise somewhere in the region of £130. bond-holders will convert their holdings. The cost of a second-hand model will rise There would be no difficulty at all if the because the new model is dearer; yet a people had confidence in the loan market. transaction involving a second-hand Lack of confidence is the creation of this model is not subject to sales tax. The Government, and that is only another one increase, therefore, becomes an unearned of many problems that the Government capital increment in the hand of the has made for itself by its own mismanageused car dealer. Is that a democratic ment. At budget times, and on the occasion of the submission of supplementary budgets, Government's proposals may provide a we are faced with expedients of the sort solution of a kind, but it is a solution now under discussion. The Government at the expense of the unfortunate person claims, on the one hand, that there is too in the community who wants a motor much prosperity and that it must be car, but who cannot afford the higher dampened down; yet it assumes, when price. estimating its revenue, that prosperity will continue at the present level. The so many motor cars are being bought in very phrases used by the Prime Minister Australia can be found in the fact that ( Mr Menzies) proved that. He said, an ordinary Australian who, some years almost in so many words, that assuming a ago under a Labour government yearned continuance of the present level of conto purchase a home, and felt that hc sumption, we should get so much from had a reasonable opportunity to do so, taxes. He used the same presumption in now believes that he has no chancs connection with the measure that is before because of the high interest rates and the House, and so also have the Treasurer prices. With a motor car, he can at least ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and his advisors. take his family out of the unsavoury They have shown that they believe there dwelling that he is forced to rent. He will be a continuance of the demand for can take them in a motor car into the motor cars and components in Australia hills or to the beaches at the week-end, in the future, even though the price of a and give them a certain amount of motor car will be increased by £130. I pleasure. Apparently, even that is to be suggest that at least we can be sceptical torn from him under the policy of this on that point. I take up the theme of the honourable member for Balaclava that, if the present vehicle through a hire-purchase arrangelevel of prosperity continues, we can ment, he will have to borrow another £100 envisage a most undemocratic move to from the hire-purchase agency, as the bring into existence rationing by tbe honourable member for Port Adelaide purse. Until recently a prospective buyer ( Mr Thomson) has said, and will pay might have to wait twelve months to get about £30 or £40 more in interest on the the Holden motor car he wanted. There transaction. The Government is doing was a waiting list. Now, a number of nothing to abate that evil; neither is it persons who cannot afford the additional doing anything to check the practice, to £130 will drop off the list. That will which the honourable member for Port mean that the person who is fortunate Adelaide referred, of including sales tax enough to have the additional £130 will in the price that the retailer charges for be able to purchase a motor car sooner goods upon which tax was supposed to It also seems to me to be undemocratic method of sharing out the unbounded prosperity that exists in Australia? TheI believe that one of the reasons why Government. Because the buyer has to get tha have been paid at the wholesale level. When this matter was investigated by the Public Accounts Committee some time ago, attention was drawn to the practice that was developing in tbe community. When the practice of charging sales tax was discussed with the Commissioner, be was informed that some wholesaleretail firms adopted the practice of chargdemned. ing sales-tax on the retail price instead of on the wholesale price. The possibility of this course being followed was discussed in 1930. The Commissioner has said that there is little that can be done to prevent the practice, because the purchaser seldom knows that he is being overcharged. I suggest that there can be no valid reason why provision should not be made in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act or other legislation for the sales tax on articles such as motor cars and other things, the value of which exceeds £10. to be shown on the price tag. It may be suggested by some persons that this requirement would mean disclosing trade secrets, that it would be an indication of the profit margin enjoyed by the vendor, but I doubt whether anything is lost by compelling private enterprise to reveal for public information what the mark-ups are. If private enterprise is something that can be justified, it of goods by road from thc Slate of New South ought to be prepared to defend itself against malpractices such as those to which I have referred. I submit for the consideration of the Government the suggestion that on articles of a value exceedAsI promised the honourable member I ing £10, or £100, whatever figure may be decided upon, the amount of sales tax involved, if any, should be indicated, so that the purchaser may know just how much sales tax he is paying. I suggested, when I began my speech, that it seemed that Government supporters were not quite clear as to what was intended in this measure. Is it merely a revenue-raising proposal ? I submit that it is. If it is, then it will not have the effects that the Government imolies it will have. On the contrary, it will cause dislocation and possibly unemployment in the motor industry generally. So far as I can see, it does not do anything to lower the level of imports. It certainly does nothing to abate inflation. Bather does it aggravate and exaggerate the effects of inflation. It will not lessen the evils of hire purchase, but will put the small man even more forcibly into the hands of those people who charge extortionate interest for the services they render, because of the extremity of the person who is compelled to use them. I submit that, on those grounds, this measure ought to be conadjourned.

As this matter bears so directly on the transport Wales to the Australian Capital Territory, and thus is reflected in the cost of materials and the prices of commodities here, will the Prime Minister take the earliest opportunity to make some announcement on the matter? have discussed this matter with my colleague, the Attorney-General. The question of applying the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution to the Australian Capital Territory is not a new concept and has been under consideration on previous occasions. It has been rejected in the past because the making of such a provision, while it would confer upon the Territory the benefit of section 92, would also import into the laws of the Territory the difficulties of the section. As the honourable member is no doubt aware these difficulties are serious and probably have not yet been completely solved either in a constitutional or a legal sense.
