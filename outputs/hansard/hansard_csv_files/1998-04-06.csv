That is not what the committee recomintroduced legislation to deal with problems mended and it is not the opposition's position. of unconscionable conduct. I recall quite well the former minister for small business, ChrisI think it is most unfortunate that the Schacht, announcing those changes and government has not moved to implement a introducing that legislation, as someone who uniform retail tenancy code and to establish had received a lot of representations from a tribunal which would be able to give effect small businesses, from retail tenants, and who to that.

And that is what tenants who have suffered in the process and they did: they referred it off to the Reid many people have gone out of business, have committee.

We would like to let Mr Peter Reith know that the laws that he has at what I have seen as a lack of action on introduced are not good enough to take the great their part in relation to this issue, but it is pressures, stresses and losses that all of this has interesting to note that just recently they have caused. instituted proceedings in the Federal Court in She raises the issue of compensation and Perth concerning a particular shopping censecurity of tenure legislation. treso concerned about it that they have put tures from people who are concerned at the member for Cunningham is correct.
