16,Mr Glynn (Angas) [2.37],"There isthem. I cited from the report of the Huddart Parker case something said in argument as to whether the questions administered under the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 did not amount to an 'interference with the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. The High Court there decided that it was not a usurpation of the judicial power in any sense, but there was a dictum of Mr Justice O'Connor somewhat relevant to the point raised in the letter to which I have referred. He pointed out, as one of the reasons why it was not an interference . with judicial power that the questions preceded action, that they really amounted to a departmental inquiry prior to .action. America, if I am not mistaken, the putting of these questions is part of the judicial proceedings under the Sherman Act of 1890; the questions are asked after the proceedings have been begun. I should like to draw the attention of the Attorney General to the fact that, in some of the clauses of the Bill, we may be doing more than giving ordinary judicial remedies; that we may be, as in the clause dealing with contempt, trenching on the power of the Judiciary. By section 71 of the Constitution the judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Federal Supreme Court, or in such other Court as Parliament may create and invest with Federal jurisdiction, subject, of course, to the prerogative of the Crown in cases of appeal either as a right or by permission. At the end of the judiciary part of the Constitution there is a provision that all indictable offences shall be tried by a jury; and if we look at proposed section 6c we see that the offence of contempt is an indictable offence punishable, I believe, with three months' imprisonment. If the President is a Judge of a Supreme Court 'or a District Court of a State, or a Judge of the High Court, he is given the power to impose the penalty right off, instead of the case going for trial in the ordinary way; the President has the power of judicially determining the matter and sentencing the offender. If that be so, it may be held that this section is in violation of section 80 of the Constitution, which is that providing that the trial of indictable offences, which may exist at common law, as well as by declaration in the Act, must be before a jury. We have already argued the matter sufficiently, and I shall not further elaborate it ; but I think it my duty, having previously thrown some doubt on the clause, and in view of the press correspondence, to draw the Attorney General's attention to it. honourable member for Angas has called attention to a constitutional aspect of the question which has extremely serious implications. I shall not attempt at this stage to enforce that point, or to add anything further. It must be perfectly plain to every honourable member, without referring to legal practice or legal doctrine, that, if any tribunal, charged with what may be ordinarily termed services incidental to governmental funcIn tions, is called upon to exercise over those who give evidence before them a judicial authority including the infliction of judicial penalties, this marks not only a very serious departure from the theory and principle of the Constitution, but a departure which no experience that we have justifies, and I venture to say that no experience will justify. In all those cases in which conduct, action or refraining from action, implies a breach of the obligations of the person committing it in relation to some body properly authorized to make full inquiries, it is in the highest degree desirable that such extreme powers should be exercised by an independent ' authority. A cold-blooded inquiry into all the circumstances, contingencies, and relations of those actions, with the final determination of the precise penalty proper to be imposed, ought to rest with persons other than those associated with the inquiry, who, the more they are penetrated with its importance and its interest, become so much more liable to lose that judicial balance which it has been the pride of the British nation to maintain under exasperating and trying circumstances. That is the plain and practical risk before us. Men of judicial training and temper, in their endeavour to perform a high public obligation imposed upon them, may come into conflict with persons who, whether from ignorance, prejudice, or, it may be, a determination to resist, set themselves athwart the progress of the Commission to delay and defeat it. Taking all such circumstances into account, and admitting that it is perfectly proper that a tribunal appointed by the Government should have power to send offenders elsewhere to be dealt with, as is the ordinary custom and almost universal practice, it is highly undesirable that those hot from,",15,Third Reading

This is, the honourable member said, an experiment; and I have no objection to experiments so long as we safeguard the liberties and privileges of the individuals of the community. But this Bill applies the same harsh treatment and severe penalties to an individual member of the community that j t applies to a corporation or a trust. There is no distinction.

It applies only to the rogue. honest man need not have feared the Star Chamber. The Government are setting up another Star Chamber here. The honourable member's remark might as well apply to a Star Chamber as to this Bill, for this Bill will authorize the creation of a veritable Star Chamber if it finds its way to the statute-book. The Attorney-General says that Royal Commissions in England frequently have powers such as are contained in the Bill, but I should like him to point them out.

I know that is the mainspring of it, and the reason for its introduction. If honourable members opposite have made up their minds that the Bill must hit the small man as well as the big man, all right; but they will allow me to point out the severity and harshness of the effect of a Bill like this upon the man who is not a trust but an ordinary citizen of the community. Under this Bill a man must divulge all the secrets of his business. There must be no secrets that the Royal Commission may not investigate, whether they have to do with the business concerned or not, and I am not forgetting that provision which relates to the relevancy of evidence. The trouble I seein connection with a BiU like this is that a man has, first of all, to make a public exhibition of the whole of his business secrets and transactions, and afterwards he may apply for any redress that the Bill may give him. He must first' divulge the whole of his business to the Commission before he can even set about getting any protection from the law, and it is no comfort to him, after he has told the Commission all the secrets of his business, the profits he is making, tain a remedy for any injury that has been nishing of a couple of parallels. He points ing that that was a very severe measure also. The reply is that that Bill never passed'.

Any quantity of litigation will be begotten by its very structure. As the honourable member for Angas pointed out yesterday, it is imperfect in its drafting, as all diction. Bills are. I am not saying that this is singular, but there are many ways in which the legal coach and four will be driven through it, as it has been driven through Acts many a time before. driven through ours. Many were going to be driven through the Land Tax Act, but very few got through. owing to the help which my honourable friend got from this side in shaping its provisions. He has received a good deal of help in connection with this measure, and there may be fewer loopholes in it as a consequence, but there will still remain loop holes, and I do not think the legal fraternity will find any difficulty in making trouble regarding the Bill. It is true, as the Attorney-General has said, that provision is made in the Australian Industries Preservation Act for similar penalties; but, in that case, the penalties are to be imposed by a Judge sitting in a Court of law, where a witness is protected and surrounded by safeguards. It is not so in this case. Bill, if a man commits contempt, he may be sent to gaol at once without the presence of a solicitor to safeguard his interests in any way. happen in a Court of law. law a witness has the privilege of being represented by a solicitor. a Royal Commission. no right to be represented unless by leaveof the Commission. appeal. to gaol without right of appeal of any kind..

I hold that, under this Bill, a man is liable to be indicted for an offence, owing to the baiting of a partisan Commissioner. Moreover, Royal Commissions are no longer to be criticised in any way. knows that that is an exaggeration. the honourable member give any other meaning to the provision that it shall be an offence, in writing or speech, to use words that are false and defamatory of a Royal Commission? What constitutes defamation of Royal Commissions ? A mere statement that a Commission was composed of partisans would be defamatory; yet, every one knows that some of our Commissions are composed of partisans. In making that statement, I am defaming some of our Commissions, and if I uttered it outside after this Bill had become law, I should run a risk of being sent to gaol. I wish to point to one or two of our recently-appointed Commissions. There is presiding over one of them an honourable member who, in this House, has moved that all the means of distribution ought to be nationalized. That man enters upon such an inquiry as that upon which he is now engaged with a bias, unconscious though it may be. I am not accusing him of anything but that which all of us, in our poor human nature, are heirs to-unconsciou s bias. going as near the line as he can go. nearer the line than I have a right to go.

Speaker, I shall have to pass on to another matter, but I am beginning to wonder whether, apart from the consideration of dry legalities, it is worthwhile discussing any matter here. The whole point of this Bill, it seems to me, relates to the kind of tribunal in which it vests these huge inquisitorial powers. If I may not refer to that matter, I fail to see how I can usefully discuss the Bill. Witnesses will bedragged before Royal Commissions without protection. They will not even receive payment until they actually put in an appearance, and they will be subject to all these harsh penalties in.respect of anything: they may do to affront a Commission or tolead to a false impression being createdI repeat that there is all tbe difference the honourable member did not think he wastediously repeating himself. tected against these insulting observations..

Would .anything be more calculated to destroy public confidence in a Commission than to publish a fact of that kind ? Anything -tending to bring a Commission into disrepute would naturally be interpreted by -the Commissioners as defamatory. How-ever, it is useless to pursue the matter further, because the Bill is sure to pass. There are some curious distinctions between the legal status of a Judge and of this tribunal. Proceedings of any kind for the commitment of a person for an indictable offence -may be commenced by any one; these proceedings will arise out of an inquiry where .the witness is not protected in any way. .Any person, who may have no connection with the inquiry, may set in motion proceedings for the commitment of the witness for an indictable offence. But only the Attorney-General, and some others named, -may take proceedings in regard to matters -of summary jurisdiction'. The final appeal is to be dealt with by a single Justice of the High Court, sitting without a jury. It -seems to me that we have narrowed the privileges of indicted persons by almost every Act we have passed of recent years, and those who are now helping to push the Bill through so hurriedly will, in years to come, tryto undo this legislation. Freedom is being assaulted at every turn, and that in the interests, not of the larger liberty of the whole, but of a section who believe that in which they are so much interested. They may be honest in their view, as I am in mine, but they are woefully mistaken. My reading of the past, and my knowledge of the great struggles which won the liberties which we possess, convince ine that Our faces are turned in the wrong direction. Instead of trying to grapple with the trusts by processes at law, we are passing legislaThere should be opportunity for tion which will affect the most innocent in the community as much as the most guilty. That we should not do. While making it as difficult as possible to do wrong, we should make it as easy as possible to do right. There should be the fullest and freest interchange of opinion regarding matters affecting public policy and legislation. The proposals now under discussion relate to proceedings taken with a view to the framing of policies, and are not necessarily concerned with the commission of crime, or 1 of any offence properly leading to the deprivation of individual liberty. The offences for which the Bill provides will arise Out of mere processes of inquiry for the purpose of framing policies on which to legislate. To make the penalties even higher than those inflicted by a Court of law, and to deprive witnesses of the safeguards which protect them in Courts of law, is to follow an unnecessarily stringent and harsh course, and to give powers which are not required. What is desired by honourable members can be got by the ordinary processes of law. The Attorney-General does not know that the Royal Commissions Act has broken down, and cannot know that for a day or two, when the Sydney inquiry will have finished . But he will not 1 wait for that. In my opinion, the action he has taken will not shorten legal processes, but will leave our citizens open to all sorts Of dangers. The third reading of a Bill is a stage which has come to be regarded in this, and in other Parliaments, as formal. I deprecate the repetition at this stage of the arguments used during the second-reading debate, especially when, as in this case, the hope",20,Third Reading

But we now have an opportunity to draw attention to features in the proposed legislation of which many honourable members seem to have lost sight, or desire to ignore. The Bill has been discussed upon the supposition that the Sugar Commission was appointed for the purpose of dealing with a combine. tion. One of tlie objects of the Commission was to find out whether the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is or is not a trust or a combine. From a pretty intimate knowledge of the constitution of the company, I do not hesitate to say that it is neither; it is merely an enormous organization, founded upon ordinary business lines, which has grown so large, and has extended its operations so greatly, that many who are not familiar with the evolution of big commercial concerns have jumped to the conclusion that its operations are injurious to the community, and should be inquired into in a spirit of hostility. All the arguments and interjections which have come from the Ministerial side have been based on the assumptionI use the word in its logical sense as meaning a belief in a proposition that has not been proved-that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a trust or a combine. ber must not discuss that. Mr Speaker, that I am perfectly in order in what I am about to say. Let honourable members opposite imagine for a moment that the result of the Commission's inquiry were to show that the company is an ordinary large commercial undertaking; would they be prepared to say that the provisions of the and was about to say that we have no right,, Bill are such as they would apply to an ordinary trading concern? member may be of that opinion. He would make a splendid Turk or Russian. I am speaking of the average man, whose mind is in a fair balance. Would such a man consider the provisions of this measure fairly applicable to an investigation of the operations of an ordinary business firm, such as Buckley and Nunn, or Foy and Gibson? honourable member's statement.; though he must be regarded as somewhat exceptional; as a rata avis. The honourable member for East Sydney guffaws, because he does not understand my argument. pay any attention to the honourable member were it not for his stupid and offensive remarks. I protest against that assumpber must withdraw that statement. the circumstance reminds me of Marryat's story of the naval officer who said of another that he was not ""fit to throw guts to a bear,"" and when asked to recall the phrase, he replied that he did so willingly, because the other admitted that he was fitted to throw guts to a bear. 1 ber must withdraw that remark, too. and apologize.

It may be assumed that the corporations to which the Bill will apply will be perfectly honourable and allowable commercial enterprises, which have grownso large that a small mind cannot compass them, and, therefore, attributes to them all sorts of evil propensities and purposes. The Bill deals with three kinds of offences. There are, first, the offences witb which the Chairman of a Commission has power to deal summarily; they are to be found in clause 6 of the proposed new sections 6A, 6B, and sub-clauses 2 and 3.

There is nothing to provide that the President must be a Supreme Court Judge, and yet, though he be not a Judge, he will be able to exercise the same powers. There is at present, I think, a Royal Commission on the fruit industry, of which an honourable member opposite is President. That gentleman may or may not have a legal knowledge, and may take an arbitrary view of an instance of the sort, and have somebody dragged before the Commission. I do not think that that honourable member would act in such a way, but I can picture a class of men so strong in partisanship and so bitter in their determination to drive the nail home with regard to some particular purpose for which a Commission has been appointed, that they, would, without reason, take drastic action of the sort. We ought not to pass a Bill in an abstract form which is applicable, and in a way dangerous, to the peace and goodwill of the community. The question was raised by the honourable member for Parramatta as to what proposed section 6 (q) involved; and he was quite right in pointing out a view that seems to have been lost sight of. I heard two honourable members on my left say that proposed section 6 (o) provides that a person who, by writing or speech, uses words false and defamatory to a Royal Commission is guilty of an offence. This is not"" an indictable offence; and it might involve the whole question as to whether or not the words used were defamatory of the Commission. Any treatise on libel and slander may cover 1,000 pages, and be full of the keenest argument as to what is or what is not defamatory. been held defamatory to say of a man that he was "" an honest lawyer,"" because the jury read into those words a spirit of irony which suggested that he was a dishonest lawyer. It will be seen, therefore, that these questions run very fine in their distinctions. It is not difficult to liable to go before a Court for something imagine certain words being used of a Commission, and being held by an Attorney-General, especially if he be a partisan Attorney-General, or held by a partisan The President Royal Commission, to be defamatory. The honourable member for Parramatta said that If he is a strong partisan, as it would be held to be defamatory to say of a Commission that it was partisan; and I quite agree that if it be driven into the public mind that a Royal Commission which is doing work in the name of His Majesty the King is partisan, the whole value of its report is destroyed. The public look to the report of a Royal Commission, perhaps without looking at the evidence which supports the report, to say what has been the result of the investigation; and if the fairdealing, honest reputation of the Commission is touched, the very root of its influence with the people is struck at and destroyed. We know that a Royal Commission, like a Judge, is supposed to be blindfold, and to hold the scales fairly, in order that justice may be done; and if it is said that a Royal Commission has a moral twist, and the public believe it, the whole result of the investigation is discredited. honourable member's objections? generally; it is the basis of my appeal to honourable members to see the possible effects of this measure. Somebody may use words accusing a Royal Commission of being partisan, and the Commission may decide upon a prosecution because the words destroy the value of their report. The Attorney-General has not made this an indictable offence, and thus an offender is disentitled to the privilege given by section 80 of the Constitution; and the whole thing may be a matter of argument. We know very well the question of what is a partisan Commission, and whether certain acts upon which he relies for his allegations constitute partisanship, may be a matter of prolonged and tedious argument before a Court. Who would say that a man who uses words of that sort is not entitled to have counsel, if he is too poor to provide It has, for instance, them for himself? And yet in this Bill there is no provision by which he can get counsel. There should be no distinction in this case between ""offence"" and "" in dictable offence."" To speak of an offence as indictable seems to invest it with more seriousness, but wherever a man is that he has done which he ought not to do with regard to a Royal Commission, and to be imprisoned for two years, the word ""indictable"" ought to be used,",23,Third Reading

This is a measure for all time, and it may cut both ways. Honourable members opposite should therefore exercise just the same caube administered or ordered. tion with regard to this Bill, which has been admittedly framed to apply to one particular Commission, as they would if they were investing a Commission with .authority to inquire into matters with which they were themselves intimately concerned. wish to explain why I am voting for this Bill. Members on the other side accuse us on this side of having no idea of what the Bill really means, and of imposing penalties which amount to persecution, instead of penalties fitting the offences actually committed. The Royal Commissions that have been appointed have been for the purpose of eliciting information for the public good, and it certainly appears that up to the present they have not had the powers which it was thought they had. It cas therefore been found necessary, in order to arm them with sufficient power to make their inquiries useful, and to insure the public good, to' introduce this Bill. On that ground alone I feel that in voting for it I am voting for something which is in the public interest, but what has struck me as most remarkable is the strenuous opposition offered to it. If I had felt disposed not to vote for it, the extreme opposition shown to it by honourable members opposite, and their anxiety to tone it down, would have made me wonder greatly whether I was doing right or not. there is something in the Bill which they are trying to defeat, something which they, or those connected with them, are afraid will interfere with some ramification of our anxiety appears to have been shown regarding the clause which imposes a penalty for perjury, but perjury is one of the most I have nothing more to serious crimes that any human being can commit, and in this Bill we make a strong effort to make the punishment so severe I can only say that it that if possible it will prevent perjury happening before a Royal Commission. I do not think there is a citizen in the Commonwealth who will not commend this Parliament for its anxiety to punish those who attempt to commit perjury. Perjury before a Royal Commission is quite as great an offence as perjury before a Court of law, and I do not understand why there has been such a stir about the imposition of severe punishment for it. persons by whom that punishment was to that, so far as inquiries by Royal Commissions are concerned, the commercial life of to-day is very different from that of the past, because there are nowadays so many secrets, so many combinations, and so many things done in commercial life to which those engaged in commerce in the early days would not have stooped. There are so many rebates and secret commissions given, which the public have no means of finding out, that it is necessary to have some power to bring them to light. Inquiries are being made to-day in New Zealand, while in America an inquiry has been going on for three or four years into the Sugar Trust. Honourable members on the opposite side seem to think that this Bill is directed against the Sugar Trust only, but I assure them that I am not giving my vote for it only on that ground. I realize that other Commissions will have to make inquiries, and we cannot be too careful to see that those inquiries are properly made. We should all be anxious to give those Commissions power to make the persons concerned divulge everything which is detrimental to the public good. I hold that if in our commercial life the public are overcharged or fleeced in the matter of rebates or commissions, the offence is quite as bad as that of the criminal who attacks a man in the street. In fact, I do not know that the latter is not the much lesser criminal, because you have It certainly appears to me that a chance of catching him, whereas the other fellow robs the public in such a manner that they have no means of detecting him, unless a Royal Commission elicits the incommercial life.

It would not take me long to get the information, at any rate. thank the honourable member for Angas, and the honourable member for Darling Downs, for the able manner in which they have debated the Bill, because their speeches have been a source of information to me, although I could not altogether agree with their views. I look on them as legal gentlemen, and I would point out that I regard it as a compliment to call a man a legal luminary or a legal gentleman as distinct from a lawyer. I therefore wish those two honourable members to take that as a compliment from me. A great deal of capital has been made out of clause 6 o, but I think it is a very wise provision. A person giving information before a Royal Commission ought to have some protection from scurrilous writers. I do not apply that to pressmen generally, because I have always found the average pressman a gentleman, and have always been able to get on with him. A witness who goes before a Commission, willing to give all the information he can, ought not to be attacked by anybody, and if he is attacked, the Court ought to have power to deal with the matter. It would be better, also, for the offender to be dealt with at the moment than for the case to drag on for months.

One effect of it will be to make persons who go before Royal Commissions understand that they must tell the truth, the whole truth, and 1 nothing but the truth. If we can inculcatethat into them, we shall do good work. I believe that some of those persons who today are perhaps being paid to hide secrets will be driven by the fear of punishment to tell the truth, and that the community at large will benefit by the disclosure of the f HCtS [3.54] -No one will cavil at the concluding words of the honourable member for East Sydney. I think it is the desire of every member of the House, no matter which side he sits on, to see that Royal Commissions appointed to investigate matters of public importance have full power to complete their inquiries.

137,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang>,"-I think they will have great difficulty in persuading men of well-balanced minds to acknowledge the claim. It is our desire that Royal Commissions shall have their work -conducted properly, that they shall be reasonably protected, and that adequate punishment shall be meted out to those who, when appearing before Royal Commissions, give false testimony, or try to flout the reasonable authority with which such Royal Commissions are invested. This Bill, however, proposes to do something more. Our objection to it is that it goes altogether too kind upon an agreement or understanding far-that in the endeavour to bring about that desirable result, the Bill seems to many of us to have been conceived from beginning to end in a spirit of vindictiveness and revenge. able member has no right to make that statement. not say that it was conceived in that spirit, -but that it appeared to some that honourable members opposite were imbued with such feelings in bringing forward and supporting the Bill. The Bill itself seems to suggest something of the kind, and the object of the Opposition has been to try to eliminate from it that suggestion by reducing the preposterous proposals that it contains to more reasonable limits. ties for which it provides constitute our chief ground of objection, for they are altogether out of proportion to the offences to which they relate. Penalties -certainly ought to be sufficient to act as a deterrent, but there is a point beyond which a penalty becomes an injustice and a persecution. That is the view of the Opposition in regard to the penalties imposed by this Bill. We, as a Legislature, have a perfect right to see that penalties imposed by our laws are adequate for the purposes for which they are required, that they will be repressive in their tendency, and that they will not be so light as to encourage the belief that they will prove inadequate. that point will always be identified in the public mind with injustice and persecution. During this debate some honourable members have rather gloried in the Bill because it is emanating from a party which is at present ""on top,"" the obvious inference being that they have some other fellow underneath at their mercy. We should not legislate in that spirit. In dealing with questions affecting the liberties of the subguilty of an offence and punished. We are ject, we ought to know no party. Our sole desire should be to mould our measure strictly on the lines of equity and justice. My own opinion is that this Bill far exceeds the limits of reasonableness and justice. There are some ridiculous discrepancies between the penalties for which it provides. For instance, it is provided that any attempt to induce a person called, or to be called, as a witness before a Royal Commission, to give false testimony, or to withhold true testimony, and any attempt to receive or obtain any profit or benefit of any that any person shall give false testimony, or withhold true testimony, when before a Royal Commission, shall be punishable by imprisonment for five years. Such an offence is made an indictable one, but in the very next clause a much smaller penalty is provided for what seems to me to be an equally culpable offence. It is declared thatAny person who practices any fraud or deceit, or knowingly makes or exhibits any false statement, representation, token, or writing to any person called or to be called as a witness before any Royal Commission with intent to affect the testimony of that person as a witness, shall be guilty of an offence. And the penalty for that offence is two years' imprisonment. I do not recognise such a difference in degree between these The penaltwo types of offences as would justify this marked difference in the penalties. Then, again, provision is made for the punishment of any person using insulting language towards a Royal Commission. Who is to determine what is insulting language ? Any mere word of disparagement may be construed into an insult to a Royal Commission. The personnel of a Commission > may be such as to warrant any terms of disparagement being applied to it. Royal Commissions of that character have been, and may in future be, appointed; but a person who speaks in terms of disapproval regarding such a Commission, or adversely criticises its personnel, may be held, under this Bill, to have used insulting Anything that goes beyond language, and ordered to pay a fine of ^100, or to undergo imprisonment for three months. Such a penalty is monstrous, having regard to the character of the offence to which it relates. Then, again, it is provided that any one who, in writing or in speech, uses words defamatory of a Royal Commission, or is in any manner guilty of contempt of a Royal Commission, shall be all agreed that it is not only improper, but detestable, for any one to falsely speak or",26,Third Reading

139,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"I did-write defamatory words of a Royal Commission, or, indeed, of any body or individual. But the real object of this clause is to prevent reasonable and just criticism of a Royal Commission. Royal Commissions, like all other tribunals, so far as their pose to continue my remarks any further. methods of procedure, their composition, -and their investigations generally are concerned, should be open to the fullest possible scrutiny, both as to their composition, ancl their conduct of inquiries, else tyranny, injustice, oppression, and other evils will -surely develop within them. The fullest light and publicity should be given to all their proceedings. In that way alone can we insure for Royal Commissions, and other tribunals of a like character .are appointed from time to time, the respect to which they, if trustworthy and impartial, are entitled. Why we should hedge round Royal Commissions with all these unnecessary safeguards is to me inexplicable. The Bill itself, at all events, will not commend itself to the judgment of the unbiased public. .claiming that honest and upright people .have nothing to fear from such a measure, -claim altogether too much. People may be honest and straightforward enough, and yet have reason to fear consequences arising from the revengeful spirit that such a measure fosters. The Bill clothes Royal Commissions with many powers to inflict hardship on individuals against whom an animus is directed. For these, as well as for other good reasons, the Opposition feel it to be their duty in the public interest to oppose it. I know that fair and reasonable criticism on the part of Ihe Opposition will fall unheeded upon the ears of the Government and their supporters. They made up their minds probably before they entered the chamber as to the terms of the Bill, and what they should -do with it. Honourable members opposite, -Or some of them, at all events, have admitted more than once that arguments will -not affect any votes. They are not here to listen to argument. They have had their arguments before entering the chamber, And they are here only to see the Bill pushed through. orable members of the honourable gentleman's party have said that it is. able member must confine himself to the -question. sir, that criticism from this side of the House is likely to fall on deaf ears, so far as honourable members opposite are concerned, and for that reason I do not prober is not justified irv the action he has taken. Such observations are becoming too frequent. I ask the honourable member not to continue them. it that a deliberative body like this House decides that a Royal Commission shall be appointed for the distinct and definite purpose of obtaining reliable information for that its use. I wish that there had been an Act of this character in force when I was Chairman of the Commission appointed to make an inquiry into the conduct of certain manufacturers in this and other States. The work of that Commission was defeated because of the stubbornness of one man. AlthoughI had ascertained from the Crown Law Officers that tiie questions Honourable members opposite, in which I wished to ask were within the scope of the Commission, the Commissioners were deliberately flouted by a manufacturer who at first refused to appear before thenij and afterwards, when he came, would not answer our questions. With powers such as those contained in the Bill, we could have obtained information 1 which would have been useful tq the country.

The Commissioners in the case to which I have just referred were unanimously of the opinion that the questions which I wished to ask should be asked j but because of the behaviour of one witness our inquiry came to nothing, and the money spent on it was wasted. No Commission, however appointed, should be in such a position as that.

Our Select Committees are not equipped with legal authority to administer oaths, or to direct prosecutions for refusing to answer questions. to use antiquated machinery which would have the effect of putting offenders "" on the leads,"" as punishment by the Legislative Assembly of Victoria used to be called.

That is the procedure which has been adopted by the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry. But a parliamentary Select Committee has no such authority; and the Attorney-General, in this connection, referred to a matter absolutely irrelevant to the B ill . And in that report it was not recommended that the House should summon a recalcitrant witness to the bar and have him committed for contempt; it was thought that that antiquated procedure should be abandoned, and resort had to the ordinary process of l a w ; in other words, that the witness should be prosecuted in a Police Court.

Sir JOHN QUICK No strong case has been made out for the proposed drastic changes, which really mean the creation of a form of political inquisition unknown to British law since the Star Chamber of the Stuarts. This is practically a revival of that old tribunal, where witnesses were subjected to the political thumb-screw and rack, and liable to all kinds of pains and penalties-a n institution which formed one All they can do is of the serious items in the indictment against the Stuarts. It is strange that in these democratic days of labour majorities we should have a Labour and democratic Ministry proposing to revive those ancient and obsolete methods. The power in a Commission to commit a person for contempt constitutes, in my opinion, the most serious blot on the whole scheme. A power to send a witness to prison for something done in the face of the Commission is undoubtedly a grave invasion of existing practices, and a most dangerous innovation. It makes the Chairman of a Royal Commission practically Judge of his own case. It is true that some of the superior Courts of the States and the High Court of Australia have power to commit for contempt vvhich takes place in the face of the Court; but that is what is called reserve power, and is becoming gradually obsolete as inconsistent with the spirit of the age. As indicated in a quotation read by the honourable member for Angas, the general tendency of modern times is in the direction of abandoning this ancient and savage weapon-thi s practice of permitting a man to be Judge in his own case. Even highly trained, well-balanced Judges must feel that a power to be exercised, it may be, when under a feeling of excitement, is to some extent a disqualification on them as judges of what constitutes contempt of Court; and if it is considered objectionable that Judges should continue to be vested with such power, how much more objectionable must it be to vest it in the hands of, it may be, members of Parliament, or persons inexperienced in the exercise of judicial functions? It is quite possible that serious errors of judgment, and invasions and infractions of the liberty of the subject, may arise, with results most unexpected, even to those who are introducing and supporting this measure.

We know that important changes made in the procedure of this House, and supported by honourable members opposite, were first brought into action and directed against themselves, much to their disgust, surprise, and dismay. Very often the unexpected happens; and it is quite possible that, when this legislation is first brought into force, and the first victims are impaled, there will be such an outcry as to astound even its most prominent and most eloquent supporters at the present time. I deny that these changes are required in the interests of efficiency. opinion, is strong enough to obtain all the evidence required, with ordinary judicious management of the conduct of Royal Commissions. The Sugar Commission got on very well until it reached one particular stage or development; and then there arose a great hue and cry for a reform of the law. The response to that hue and cry is the Bill which has occupied our attention so long. There is no justification for this legislation, and there are very ""strong grounds for believing that some of the provisions will prove to be an invasion of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to invest in a secular or commercial tribunal powers which ""certainly come within the realm of judicial authority. ney-General) used against the Bill this evening fall in general under five heads. I will state these and briefly reply to them. It is said that this Bill is an invasion of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth; that it gives Royal Commissions greater powers over witnesses than does any other law relating to Royal Commissions; that Royal Commissions are given greater powers than is a Judge in his own Court; that witnesses have not the protection they enjoy in Courts of law; and that the powers under this measure can be exercised by partisan Commissions. Taking these in their order, I deny entirely that the Bill is an invasion of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. The criticisms entirely ignore the purport of the Parramatta and others that the Bill gives Bill. This is a Bill clothing Royal Coma Royal Commission greater power over missions, which can be appointed by Exewitnesses than does any other law dealing cutive authority, with certain statutory with Royal Commissions. powers to compel the attendance of witinaccurate. nesses and the reply to questions. The exercise of those powers by such a tribunal is not an invasion of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. In the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorhead, reported in Commonwealth Law Re-ports, 1909, and quoted in Professor Harrison Moore's Commonwealth of Australia, second edition, page 3""The High Court held that the power of inquiry was not of itself judicial power; that preliminary inquiries of this matter, in relation to criminal offences had been held to be nonjudicial, even wben conducted by justices of the peace. . . . In the words of Isaacs, J., the case was one of "" mere investigation, with a view to inform the mind of the Executive whether the law has or has not been observed, The law, in my and if not, whether the nature of the contravention is such as to merit further action."" That case was in relation to the refusal of a person to answer interrogatories put by the Comptroller of Customs; and the application of such powers to Royal Commissions is very much clearer. . An inquiry by Royal Commission' is not in general an inquiry into a matter on which judicial proceedings may subsequently be initiated; it is an inquiry to inform the Executive in regard to matters which may or may not form the basis of future legislation. There is nothing in. this measure that in the slightest degree invades the judicial sphere. The power to arrest on warrant is not necessarily an exercise of the judicial power. Such a power may be exer* cised by this Parliament or by a Court[4-35]--The arguments martial ; and it can hardly be said that either of these is a judicial body. The power to commit for contempt is not necessarily a judicial power; it is not a punitive power, but a protective power. In order that a Royal Commission may conduct its inquiry effectively, it is necessary, in the first place, to secure the attendance of witnesses, and, in the second place, to secure order-to secure that the proceedings shall be conducted as the Commission think fit, and not as the witnesses determine. Power to commit for contempt in the face of the Court is, therefore, incidental to the exercise of the power of the Executive to make inquiry, about which power there is no sort of possible doubt. It is urged by the honourable member for That is quite",30,Third Reading

He was also unaware that the honourable and ""learned member for Bendigo had recommended the introduction into this House of legislation able member must not refer to that matter. even allowed, it seems, to pass an epitaphic remark about it . I come now to the third point, that the Commissioner has greater powers than a Judge. with the facts. than any Judge of a superior Court. has power to commit for contempt in face of the Court. tempt other than in the face of the Court, and every Judge of a superior Court has the power, which is given to the Chairman of the Royal Commission if he is a Judge.

It can be exercised only by a Judge. a partisan Commission. honourable member, if he has any respect at all for the laws of this country-whic h I very much doubt-canno t say that a Judge is partisan.

He may commit for contempt in the face of the Court, that and no more; and I most respectfully protest against any statement that these powers may be exercised by a partisan Commission. I do not deny that human beings are. liable, to be influenced by political, religious, social, or many other kinds of bias, but we must assume that a Judge is, humanly speaking, -free from bias, or as free from it as a human In being can be. The Chairman of a Royal Commission canexercise these' powers only -if he is a Judge. .It;\vpuld be monstrous to suppose that he would not exercise them Commissioner, that, he would when .sitting as a Judge in his own Court. Again, it is said that witnesses haye not that protection which they have in Courts of law. That, again, is not in accordance with the facts. The witnesses have protection under the Act as it stands, in section 7. It is there.laid down that they are to have all the, protection that a witness has in the High Court. That protection remains, and, in addition, they are protected under clause 4A of the Bill, which provides that refusal to answer a question not relevant to the inquiry shall be a complete defence to a prosecution. Under clause 6D they are further protected, in that it is not compulsory for any witness before a Royal Commission to disclose to the Commission any secret process of manufacture. Under clause 6DD That is not in accordance they are further protected to the extent that He has not greater powers any statement or disclosure made by any He witness shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proHe cannot commit for conceedings in any Commonwealth or State Court, or any Court of any territory of the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, not true that a witness before a Royal Commission has not the protection that a witness has before any Court. He has all the protection that a witness has before the High Court, and he has additional protection conferred upon him by this B ill. The rest of the statements made about the measure are really not relevant to it . They are directed more against the projected use of the measure than against the Bill itself.

Any person who "" disturbs "" a Royal Commission may be punished for contempt. A person might disturb a Royal Commission by coughing ! Then, again, any person who interrupts the proceedings of a Royal Commission is to be liable. These are all questions of fact, and the determination of questions of fact ought to be referred to some person who has no particular interest in the ""disturbance"" that has taken place. Any person who uses insulting language or wilfully insults a Royal Commission should be stringently dealt with, but even in that case it is better that the punishment should be meted out by a Court of law, and not by what the Attorney-General properly described as a Court that has not, ordinarily speaking, the judicial power.

The Attorney-General talked about the Bill merely giving Royal Commissions the same powers as a Judge has. Coming from a layman, such a statement would be regarded as absurd, but coming from the Attorney-General it is most regrettably disingenuous. If a Judge were to ask an accused person to submit himself to cross-examination before he had been allowed to state his case, there would be a howl of indignation from one end of the country to the other. Would that be a Mr Kelly. fair action for a Judge to take in any Court? Every one would say, "" Surely the accused has a right to state his case, and not merely to answer catch questions that may be put to him from time to time."" I believe that the common practice is for a Judge to allow the parties to a case before But. him to state their position before subjecting themselves to cross-examination. That is only fair. The trouble in connection with the Royal Commission to which reference has been made has arisen largely because one party to the case desired to submit its case before it submitted itself to cross examination. I desire, however, to leave that matter alone, and to deal only with the future. Now that Royal Commissions are to have these enormous powers, it oj<jht to be laid down that we expect them to conduct their business on reasonable lines, so far as equity and fair treatment all round are concerned.

I do not wish to block the measure, and -shall conclude by expressing regret that honourable members opposite think it advisable to place these plenary powers in the hands of Commissioners, not knowing who in future will be appointed, and without endeavouring to secure the proper conduct of investigations by such bodies. If we were to accept the doleful statements of honourable members opposite, we should pause before voting for the measure, but their arguments, repeated over .and over again, seem'to amount to the position .that Parliament is lunatic, and that Commissions will do what is absurd. ""What are the facts? I .do not think that there will be any difference of opinion in the community as to the advisability of vesting in Royal Commissions the powers given by the B ill . economic conditions, the rich in all countries are growing richer, and the poor in some countries are remaining poor, and in others becoming poorer, but everywhere large corporations are becoming tremendously wealthy.

There are open to us two courses: we may either f o l low the old lines, and pass shadowy legislation, which would receive the support of honourable members opposite, and, while making a great stir, would have no effect, or we may precede legislation by an inquiry into the facts. This inquiry, unless it is to be farcical, must be effective. The question is : Shall the King's Government be supreme in his Dominions over the sea, I think I am or shall the trusts be supreme? It is our duty to see that the King's Government is supreme. We have our duty to the Australian people, and our duty to the King, in There may, of the upholding of constituted authority.

The advisability of vesting in Commissions the powers given by the Bill is not a matter for academic discussion; it is a practical consideration. We must either let the people see that we are trifling with a serious question, or show that we are prepared to deal with it seriously, by insisting on obtaining information which will enable us to legislate in accordance with facts, and not merely on ex parte statements. Probably the High Court, when appealed to, will declare the Bill to be unconstitutional, its object being, apparently, to declare unconstitutional every measure likely to be of benefit to the community. I shall, of course, be disappointed if the Bill is. declared to be unconstitutional.

It has been argued that men may utter gross slanders believing them to be true; but we must get rid of the mon of special pleading, and for the greater strous idea that the distinction between right and wrong can be whittled away, Does not every man know whether his state ments are abusive or slanderous, and whether they are legitimate criticism? not every newspaper writer that knowledge? We are painfully aware that the newspaper press of to-day is not like that of thirty years ago, when newspapers were started by men in advocacy of principles which they held, and for the enlightenment of their fellow countrymen. To-day the press is a mere capitalistic money-making organization, just as a picture show company is, and we no longer have fair criticism. I am not reflecting on the literary men of Australia, who are as honourable and upright a body as we have in our midst. It is those who sit in the editors' chairs, and those who determine the lines on which the newspapers are to be run, who are to blame. If a newspaper deliberately and maliciously attempts to bring into contempt a Royal Commission, the proprietor and the writer of the article should be fined, and if they are sent to gaol the world will be none the worse. Nothing is to be gained by unrestrained licence, and the promulgation of scandal Why should a public man, or a group of public men, who are honestly doing their duty, be held up to ridicule, scorn, and contempt? enough grit to protect Royal Commissions and to give them the powers necessary for the proper performance of their work is not worth its salt, and the country cannot expect to be benefited by its legislation. I do not disguise the fact that strong measures are being proposed, but the times demand them. Here, as in the Mother Land, :t is the Government of the day that is responsible for the appointment of Royal Commissions, and when such bodies are created, a majority of the members hold views in accordance with those of the Government, which is quite right. If , in the future, any Commission uses its powerswrongly, that will injure the Government that appointed it, and will produce reaction. Therefore, every Government will be very careful to select men in whom they can place confidence, and to appoint Commissions' only for the investigation of important subjects. I shall have great pleasure in voting for the third reading. fact that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has had to indulge in a good deal part of his speech got as far away from his subject as he could, is evidence that there is not the strong justification for the Bill that he claimed for it. As a rule, the Has honourable member keeps close to his subject, and he has generally something to say that is worth listening to; but on this occasion he has treated us to a kind of speech that serves when delivered from the public platform, but is not taken seriously in this chamber. He has told us that the poor are being exploited to an increasing degree by capitalistic combines, and wishes it to be understood that the measure is necessary to protect them; and, further, that the opposition to it arises from disinclination to give the protection that is necessary: One would think that Royal Commissions had been brought into existence only within the last year or two, and that they have been quite unable to perform any effective work. As a matter of fact, we have had Royal Commissions in Australia doing very good work in all directions for very many years. It is only recently, and in connection with only one Commission, that any complaint has been made as to the inadequacy of the power vested in such bodies. Honourable members opposite must feel in their hearts that the appointment of that Commission was not so happy in all respects as it ""might have been, and that, A Parliament that has not had the constitution of it been otherwise, the difficulty that is now sought to be provided for by the Bill might never have arisen. I had the honour to occupy a seat on a Commission that did some very strenuous work, covered a very considerable amount of ground, and met with a good deal of opposition; and at no time in the whole history of that Commission were we brought to a dead stop, or anything like it, by reason of our lack of power to deal vvith witnesses more or less recalcitrant The Chairman of that Royal Commission, the honourable member forBendigo, has stated that, so far as his experience went,",36,Third Reading

207,Mr Fowler (Perth) [5.23],"Th e4 there was no difficulty whatever; and, as one who sat on the opposite side in connection with the issue we had to investigate, I have very great pleasure in giving the same testimony. Trade section of that Royal Commission had, undoubtedly, a very arduous task when handling some witnesses; but we were never at a loss to obtain all the information necessary, and we found, as a rule, that where witnesses were shown that the information asked for was reasonable, and that we had power, under the existing law, to compel them to answer, there was no further trouble. The honourable member for Grey spoke of a difficulty that he had as Chairman of the Harvester Commission. It was always a surprise to me that that Commission was constituted, seeing that the Tariff Commission had anticipated practically all the work done by the Harvester Commission. ber is now going beyond the question before us. cidentally, in relation to the point raised by the honourable member for Grey. I do not intend to enter into details, but merely to say that, so far as our work was concerned, in endeavouring to arrive at some conclusion with regard to the cost of harvesters, their distribution, and the profit on witness-box' for a month ? them, we got all the information that was necessary; and the reports issued by both sections of the Tariff Commission are evidence of that fact. I have not yet heard any real justification for this measure. There has been a good deal of special pleading, but it has not yet been shown by the Attorney-General, or any of those sitting behind him, that the powers vested in RoyaJ Commissions up to the present time have been insufficient to meet all cases that have arisen. In the absence of such evidence, I must continue my opposition to the measure, which I regard as utterly out of harmony with the spirit of the age. It is quite uncalled for in regard to the present necessities of any Royal Commissions, which have other methods of asserting their power, so long as they keep within reasonable bounds. 'Finally, I have not the least fear but that the public, in their turn, will indicate, with that spirit of fair play always evinced in these matters, that they are satisfied that we are going tbo far, with legislation of this kind. I have had experience of two Royal Comquire into that matter, and the names of missions, and it exactly tallies with that of the honourable ^member for Grey. I was a member of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the question of Members of the Free sweating; and, surely, in such a matter, we ought to have been able to get all questions answered. As the honourable member for Grey pointed out, a Royal Commission cannot really take any evidence in secrecy, because a report has to be made to the power that creates the Commission. In the case of the Sweating Commission we broke through that rule in order to save certain families from ill-usage. If we could have obtained answers to our questions we should have been saved the trouble and distress of sending those families, one to Sydney, another to Ballarat, and a third to Bendigo, to evade the power of the manufacturers of this city. Of course, in the report of the Commission that fact could not be mentioned ; and here I may say, in loyalty to the press, that whatever good was done by the appointment of that Commission, was due not to the power we had of asking questions, but to the assistance of the newspapers. One does not wonder at the honourable member for Bendigo, with his legal training for so many years, taking his present action. That honourable member, however, spoke of the thumb-screw and the rack; and I ask him what greater rack could there be than to be kept in the ber must not deal with that matter. to the thumb-screw-and-rack argument, mention the worse punishment given to one witness, of being held for one month in the witness-box? If I am breaking the rules of the House, I shall, of course, Mr Speaker, obey your directions, but I think I am in order in pointing out that one experience is nearly as bad as the other. I merely desire to show that, if there had been such power as is proposed by this Bill, this witness need not have been detained so long. Who are those who refuse fo answer questions? They are people who refuse to answer because of certain designs of their own.

The very existence of such a phrase in the Bill is an invitation to cover reams of paper in showing the remarkably fine distinctions that exist in some minds, judicial and otherwise, as to the meaning that should rightly be given to it.

Does he really believe that the imposition of these penalties for the crimes and misdemeanours set out in the Bill will take him one step towards the ob-. ject whicb he has in view-the object which ""honourable members on both sides have announced that they are anxious to assist him' : in reaching? I am satisfied, and I speak : as. one who has had experience on Royal Commissions, that members of such bodies do not desire that the attainment of such an object shall be accompanied by these conditions-condition s which ought not to be engrafted on an Act of Parliament. The Attorney-General did not give any instance of complaint on the part of a Royal Commission against the criticism to which its members had been subjected. Most members of Royal Commissions are public men, and most of them, long before acting on such bodies, were subject to criticism. I do not suggest that they have become hardened, to public criticism, but they have become to some extent qualified to judge of the value of such criticism. They know, also, how it is regarded by the larger section of a discriminating public. outside Parliament acting on Royal Commissions. do not know, however, that members of any Royal Commission have asked that they should have the tremendous immunities which are to be given to all Royal Commissions in the future if this Bill becomes law. The Attorney-General may not be in a position in a year or two to set up Royal Commissions. Others will come after him-other s who, according to his political views, are utterly unfit, not only to appoint Royal Commissions, but to discharge the most unimportant functions give those men the same powers that he asks in respect of Commissions appointed by his own Government. I ask him to pause before he loads a most valuable and admittedly necessary measure with a redundancy that might very well be removed, and without which the Bill would be more acceptable, not only to honourable members generally, but to.those citizens of Australia, who, in the future, may be placed upon Royal Commissions for the purpose of obtaining information which the Government or the Parliament desire to have placed at the disposal of the people. think we must all admit that a great and valuable work has been done by Royal' Commissions appointed to obtain information to guide us in our legislative and administrative work, and I trust that that will always be our experience.

We are creating by this Bili cast-iron machinery to be applied in cast-iron fashion to every Royal Commission, no matter what may be its nature, scope, or function.

259,Mr Fairbairn,"I think we couldthis Bill when there is so much more important business awaiting. My particular objection is to proposed section 6j, which provides that any person who practises fraud or deceit, or knowingly makes or exhibits any false statement, representation, and so forth, shall be guilty of an offence, and may be imprisoned for two years by a police magistrate. law, a person is always presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty, and nothing should be done to imperil that safeguard. In the past the British race have striven very hard for freedom, and we now reap the benefits of that struggle. I have no objection to the punishment of any citizen who commits the offences mentioned here; but I am afraid that, if the clause is not amended, an innocent man may be tried for his liberty. We all value our liberty very much, even honourable members opposite-wha t liberty they have left. If a man is to be tried for an offence involving imprisonment for two years, he ought to be tried, or have the option of being tried, before a jury. We know that the Labour party in New South Wales have been, liberating a number of people who were in gaol for serious offences. there. they should be in gaol, they have an idea that their friends in Parliament will let them out. South Wales are only doing as the other party did. any partiality of this kind being shown by the other party. ber must confine himself to the question. drew me off the track. As I was saying, a man may be brought before a magistrate, and be sentenced to two years' imprisonment without any redress; and I do not' think that this point of view has been seriously considered by the Attorney-General, or otherwise the provisions would not have found a place in the Bill. Magistrates, as a rule, are fair-minded men, but we ought to cling to our olu prerogative of liberty, and see that, for an offence carrying such a punishment, a man is tried by his peers, according to ancient British custom. penalty. who happened to be in a bad humour might inflict the maximum penalty. In the past we have known "" good hanging"" Judges, and we may have a "" good hanging "" magistrate who, for a comparatively trifling offence, will inflict the maximum punishment. We ought not, in my opinion, According to British to be subject to that risk. It is only right that we should adhere to the principle of trial by jury for which our forefathers fought. Of course, we on this side, as a minority, can do nothing but voice our opinion. Clause6 o provides that any person who wilfully insults or disturbs a Royal Commission, or interferes with its proceedings, and so on, shall be guilty of an offence. That is rather too thin-skinned a provision. The other day we had a case in point. In fact, the whole of this measure arises out of that somewhat unseemly squabble able member must not discuss that matter. ing, sir. Let me say that the Bill arose out of a certain case, which is sub judice, and must not be discussed. That is the only case I can recollect where any feeling at all has arisen out of the action of a Royal Commission. I was a member of a Royal Commission which inquired into the making of engines at Ballarat as compared with the Newport workshops, and we had not the slightest trouble in obtaining information. That is my only personal acquaintance with this kind of work, but I have watched it all my life, and I do not recollect a case where there has been any trouble between the witnesses and a Commission. I therefore do not think there is sufficient justification for such a tremendously drastic measure. It is provided that the Chairman of a Royal Commission, or the sole Commissioner, where he is a High Court Judge, or a Judge of the Supreme Court or County Court or District Court of a State, shall be able to deal summarily with certain offences. I do not think that provision is required. If the records of past Royal Commissions are examined, I think it will be found that the people of Australia are very* law abiding, and have always behaved exceedingly well. It is not worthwhile, for the small gain that is likely to be obtained from this measure, to run the risk ot punishing a man by depriving him of his liberty for two years for a comparatively trivial offence, because, after all, there has been only one case that",44,Third Reading

FAIRBAiIRN! -The main point that overshadows every other is that a man may lose his liberty, and that should happen only in the good old British way of trial before a jury of his peers. No single man, whether a Judge of the High Court or any one else, ought to be able to put any other man in gaol. tencing a man for contempt of Court? contempt is very seldom imprisonment. As a rule it is a small fine. afraid that people will have to tell the truth under this Bill. is a necessary deduction from my remarks. So far as I have seen, people tell the truth in the Law Courts. However, I have put the matter as plainly as I could. Honourable members opposite are just as much responsible for the liberties of the people as I am, and I cannot be blamed now if people are subjected to these penalties and to this loss of liberty. I am afraid that some of my honourable friends opposite have lost their liberty, and have to take the views of the Caucus in these matters. little inner ring which sits in the Star Chamber, and regulates the vote, and "" deals it out "" to honourable members opposite. I cannot do more than call attention to the very serious and obvious blots on the B ill ; but I suppose the ""brutal majority "" will override us again, and put us in our places. general way I do not object to increased powers being given to Royal Commissions, but it is impossible to read the extreme penalties imposed by this Bill without realizing that, instead of it being general legislation, it is legislation for a specific purpose. There seems to be an impression that the Opposition desire to prevent the Bill passing because they fear that a Royal Commission may get at some truth that is necessary for public purposes; but, so far as I am concerned, and I think I may say the same of the Opposition generally, we do not object to reasonable powers being given to Royal Commissions to carry out their investigations in the public interest, but we-do claim that the penalties, in the Bill are altogether unreasonable and unnecessary. Nothing has arisen in Australia, so far as I know, in connection with Federal Royal Commissions, which would justify the imposition of fines to the extent of ^500, or imprisonment for five years. The House would be wise if , whilst admitting the general principles of the Bill, it modified the penalties. Clause 6'.'o seems to indicate a desire to prevent criticism during the progress of a Royal Commission. Surely a Royal Commission appointed by the Federal Government, and taking evidence in public, does .not desire that its proceedings should be free from public criticism, particularly criticism through the press. I notice the suggestion to apply only the words "" false and defamatory,""' but it is a matter of opinion as to what would be defamatory in respect of newspaper criticism during the progress of a Commission. The wording is vague. It gives a great amount of power to the Chairman, and whilst I do not object to giving increased power to a Commission to carry out its investigations and control its witnesses, I think the Bill partakes somewhat of the nature of panic legislation, and is specific instead of being proposed for general purposes. I move That all the words after "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" ThisB i ll is oppressive and dangerous, inasmuch as among other matters clause 6 O empowers the President or Chairman being a Justice or Judge to arbitrarily commit without appeal for statutory contempt indefinitely expressed in wide and general terms."" 1 seconded?

I do not know to what extent the constitutional objections urged by the honourable member for Angas affect the position, or whether uncler the Royal proclamation placing Papua under Australian control we may not be debarred from passing legislation of this sort affecting that Possession, because the Imperial proclamation states that no Australian Act shall apply to Papua, unless it is specially stated that it shall do so.

The mere fact that we have had to subsidize a shipping company to carry white -crews on its vessels trading between here .and Papua indicates that it is unprofitable for a shipping company, in the absence of a subsidy, to conduct that trade and observe the condition as to the non-employment of coloured crews. I presume that this Government is not prepared to subsidize all the shipping companies trading between here and Papua, with a view of inducing them to carry white crews,_ and, that being so, the one company to which I have referred will enjoy a monopoly. We have a right to protect the pioneers of Papua in this way, anyhow, until their trade develops. The following is the resolution to which I have referred, and which was carried by the Legislative Council of Papua on 2ist November lastThat the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia be informed through the Minister for External Affairs that the proviso at the end of section 295 of the "" Navigation ' B ill "" now before the Commonwealth Parliament w ill , if it is passed, be detrimental to the lest interests of the Territory for the following -reasons :(a) Because the trade of Papua being, at -present, a comparatively small one with little export trade, we have not sufficient inducement to offer any firm or company to put on a frequent service of large steamers between Australia and Papuan ports only, (i) Because Papua, being on the high road between all the Eastern ports of Australia and China, Japan, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies, we can offer sufficient inducement in the way of passengers and cargo to cause the companies owning the large and fast oversea steamers employed in these trades, to send their vessels the slight deviation from their courses that is entailed in calling at our ports. This insures us at present a fast fortnightly mail and passenger service between Papua and Australia, which we would lose if steamers with coloured crews were debarred from calling at our ports. (c) Because these steamers bring us direct from the East shipments of fresh and cheap rice, and as this is the principal food of our native employees, it is an important factor in the successful development of the country. If these steamers discontinued from calling at Papua, and rice has to be imported vid Australia, it will cost us £ 2 per ton more than it does at present. [d) Because our only direct service with Melbourne is by a line of steamers carrying a coloured crew. This service has been of great advantage to us, and it will be a serious loss if it is debarred from us. («) Because, but for the competition caused by these oversea vessels, we believe that the Territory would still be served by vessels like the Moresby, Malaita, and Makambo. (/) Becausei f the oversea vessels are prevented from carrying to our ports our Australian carrying trade will be thrown into the hands of a firm which is established here in a large way of business. It is a distinct advantage to traders to be able to import their goods by vessels, the owners of which are not also engaged in business in the Territory. We desire also to point out to the Minister that the provisions of clause 289 regarding the wages of crews on the coastal vessels of the Territory will, if carried, be a very hard blow to the owners of the numerous small vessels that our coastal plantations and stations depend upon to connect them with the larger ports. The last clause in the resolution refers to the fact that this Bill, if applied to Papua, will have the effect of rendering it impossible to carry on the trade now being conducted between Papuan ports, because it will prevent the employment of Papuans on coastal vessels there. That, I presume, is not the intention of the Government. Although we declare that coloured crews shall not be carried on vessels engaged in the Australian trade, we surely are not going' to prevent Papuans being employed' in their own coastal trade.

I do not think, however, that the Ministry intend to do anything of the kind, and, that being so, I shall not discuss the question further. I am extremely glad to hear from the Ministerial side of the House the first note of exception to certain features of this measure quarie has struck what one might describe as the international note, since he has shown that Australia cannot afford to build a Chinese wall around its limitations, and to say that we are going to live in a smug, selfproach its discussion with a perfectly open satisfied way to suit ourselves. _ That is a. phase of the question with which I shall deal a little later. I wish to preface my remarks with the statement that I am quite willing to acknowledge both the ability and the excellent tone and temper which the Minister has displayed in his treatment of this measure. 1 suppose that no more complex question has ever been submitted to this House than is the question of a Navigation Bill, and that a layman, so little accustomed to dealing with great and involved questions of this sort, should have expounded the Bill so fully, fairly, and ably to the House as the Minister has done is a matter that calls for acknowledgment. If the spirit which the Minister has shown in expounding that Bill, and in plainly expressing his willingness to seek light from its critics be sincere, then I do not think we have anything to fear with regard to the possibility of making this measure a very valuable one for the shipping of Australia. As the Minister has admitted, the Bill is fairly crude in its form. The honourable member admitted that it had not been revised in the light of the decision of the High Court in the Kalibia case. The Minister has admitted that very fairly. He and the Prime Minister have also admitted that we cannot pass laws for the regulation of intra-state shipping: an admission which gets rid of the difficulty respecting the coastal trade of Papua, to which the honourable member for Macquarie drew attention, and of the objections of the Intrastate shipping companies, which have pointed out the impracticability 'of applying many of the provisions of the Bill to their vessels. T have had a good deal of experience in connection with shipping, acting at one time as managing director of a firm which possessed twenty steamers. No other member in the chamber has been more saturated with shipping talk, on every branch of the subject, than I have during a fairly long life. Possibly many of those who are listening to me may suspect that my criticism is actuated by personal interest, but when they have heard all that I have to say they will acknowledge that I have at least tried to be fair. No measure requires closer and more disinterested attention than does this, because its proThe honourable member for Macvisions are intimately connected with several aspects 'of trade unionism. It may be thought that on that account, as a member of the Opposition, I view it with a slight bias, but I assure the House that I apmind. The desire to improve the condition of the sailor is a laudable one, though the sailor of the old days who hitched his pants and chewed his quid is a forgotten quantity. Large steamers no longer carry large sail power to keep them off a lee coast in the case of a breakdown of machinery, because the possible advantage is more than counterbalanced by the inconvenience. Very few of the steamers which employ sails have what is termed square canvas, but limit themselves to a fore and aft canvas. Consequently, the old-time salt, immortalized in Two Years before the Mast, Dana's well known and splendid novel, has almost disappeared. Similarly the old man-o'-warsman has gone. Even the garb of the seaman has been so changed that it bears little resemblance to its one-time appearance. Seamen of to-day are of a different type from those of Marryat. On vessels of war they are largely engineers, or at least mechanics, and on mercantile vessels they have become "" deck hands,"" whose duties do not embrace the furling of mainsails, the reefing of topsails, and other tasks inseparable from the characters of the novelist. But while it is desirable that those who work on ships should be made as comfortable as possible, there is a danger of coddling them. I shall endeavour to steer a middle course between treating the seaman as a person of no consequence, and treating him as one to whom even more consideration should be extended than is usually given to a second or thirdclass passenger. Some of the provisions of the Bill, if they were applied to many",48,Navigation Bill Second Reading

It is gradually becoming impressed on those who are disposed to look on even the law of gravity as something to be legislated against, that parliamentary interference with the laws of political economy hits back in boomerang fashion upon those responsible for it . The workers have found that if you increase the wages of every class of artisan employed on the construction of houses, rents go up, and that if you raise considerably the remuneration of those engaged in manufacture, the necessaries of life become dearer. Unless the reading of a lifetime has been misspent, I am right in asserting that if you increase the comfort of the sailor to an extent that materially adds to the cost of running vessels, you will in the end so increase the expense of transport that the community will suffer by the increase of its living expenses. tation ? it must be determined by honourable members when the B ill gets into Committee; I elucidation of the problem that is to be expected from the honourable member when his opportunity to speak comes. Those who are acquainted with the coastal traffic of the Commonwealth are aware that at times New South Wales depends largely on Victoria for its vegetables, fodder, and a great variety of products, and that Victoria and all the States get much of their f r u it from Tasmania. I might enumerate, if I thought fit to occupy the time, the various ways in which our coasting vessels are used to transport the products of the States from one part of the Commonwealth to another for the convenience, profit, and benefit of the whole community. The importance of this traffic must be borne in mind in view of the fact that if you substantially increase the expenditure required of shipowners they must of necessity charge higher rates for passenger fares and the carriage of goods, until the increase comes home to every consumer. It must further be borne in mind that the consumer will be forced to make good not only the increased outlay of the ship-owner, but something additional to provide for contingencies. The same thing takes place when the cost of building operations or of production is increased. members admit the truth of my remark in a hopeless fashion, as if I were speaking of an unforgivable class which is always out for blood, forgetting that in the management of their own private affairs they exercise the same care and economy as is practised by ship-owners and all other persons in business. To remember the facts to which I have drawn attention may help us to arrive at a happy medium between providing the sailor with comfortable conditions and coddling him in a manner which will make him less helpful and independent than he is now. The Minister, I judge from an observation he made in his speech, recognises the tendency after every great calamity at sea to overdo the precautions for the saving of life. .Twentyfive years ago I had the misfortune to write a book. ( "" Oh that mine adversary would write a book,"" and upon occasions I have had my book quoted against myself. When I wrote it I knew something about shipping, and in a chapter entitled Modern Spurious anticipate with great interest the Liberalism, I showed the tendency of Legislatures to run to extremes whenever a wreck had taken place upon the coast. I said, writing in 1887A few months ago a fast and tolerably valuable steam vessel was lost upon the Australian coast during her passage from one colony to another. Unfortunately, a good many lives were lost, under very painful and distressing circumstances. Public attention was called to the matter, and, for several days, the columns of the newspapers were filled with the usual demands for the ""most searching inquiry.""

The author of this safe generalization might have learned, with a little inquiry, that the vessel in question had, as all other such vessels are compelled to do, been duly submitted, periodically, to a searching survey, provided for by the Legislature itself, and that she possessed a certificate of "" sea-worthiness,"" such as Parliament itself required. second law-maker, having satisfied himself that the vessel had chosen a course too near the coast, proposed that "" a line might be drawn on the chart within which no vessel should be allowed to go nearer to the land."" He gave as a parallel case the fact that "" the steam-ships of the Cunard line followed regular tracks to and from America,"" and, in the same easy-going way, advocated that ""more stringent regulations were required to insure greater safety."" The idea of a "" line on the chart"" or a line round the coast"" was indulged in by other equally original advocates. A third member of the Legislature was of opinion that "" it would be an easy matter to fix a simple contrivance on all lighthouses, by which a route at a given distance from the shore should be defined. The Legislature could then provide that any captains or any owners who permitted their vessels to be taken within such a limit should be liable to severe punishment."" ""They could,"" added a fourth, ""be reported by the lighthouse-keepers. I was then referring to the Victorian ParliamentThe member who' advocated the "" o l d ship""' theory expressed the novel opinion that the vessels were driven at the present dangerously fast rate in order to save coal, and he advocated Parliament laying down a minimum time in which the passage should be done, so that if any vessel travelled faster than allowed by Act of Parliament, she should be compelled to postpone her entrance to the harbour of destination. Most of that extract is quoted from the utterances of men who stood on the floor of this very House-on e an ex-Minister-and who made those wonderful suggestions with regard to the shipping of Australia. I now pass from local to British matters, and in the same book I wrote as follows: In a minute of the Board of Trade of November, 1883, it is said that, since ""the Shipwreck Committee of 1836, scarcely a session has passed without some Act being passed, or some step being taken, by the Legislature or the Government with this object"" wreck) ; and that "" the multiplicity of Statutes, which were all consolidated into one Act in 1854, has again become a scandal and a reproach,"" each measure being passed because previous ones had failed. instructive admission that "" the loss of life and of ships has been greater since 1876 than it ever was before."" while, had risen from £17,000 to £73,000 a year. . . . The report of the Koyal_ Commission which .was lately appointed to inquire into the existing depression of trade and industry in Great Britain contains the following confirmation of my contention : "" Our ship-ownersUr. Bruce Smith. have an additional ground of complaint in the fact that foreign vessels, loading in our ports, are not subjected to the load-line, and other regulations of the Board of Trade, which, being enforced on British ships, impose additional expense and trouble upon their owners. Owners of foreign ships thus . . . enjoy in our ports, a latitude in regard to loading and an exemption from other troublesome regulations which give them an unfair advantage in competition."" . . Sir Frederick Bramwell, too, learned at Quebec, A to which port English ships liad been accustomed to be sent for timber, that the trade was being done between that port and England by Swedish ships, the reason being (he says) that "" the restrictions upon the working of English ships were such that they could no longer compete with the Swedes. These are only passages taken from a chapter dealing vvith a variety of other matters; but there is a great deal more written in order to show how careful the Legislature should be if it wishes to legislate wisely in avoiding the extremes! in the first place, of the desires of the shipowner, which are naturally in his own interest, and the desires of extremists and enthusiastic reformers, who are always against the ship-owner. There is no doubt that the wreck of the Titanic, one of the most shocking and tremendous events in the history of the world in regard to the sea, has: created just the same furore for legislative steps to prevent a recurrence. ment inserted since that wreck. ister had heard my opening remarks he would know that I have given him credit for dealing with this matter in a very, fair spirit, and in excellent tone. But. there is likely to be in the minds of honourable members who will deal with the BilP in Committee some strong feeling as ta what ought to be done to try to prevent a recurrence, perhaps on a smaller scale, in our own waters, of what happened to the Titanic. People who do not understand the difficulties of ship-owning, or of running a line of steamers, sometimes display a lack of knowledge, such as my friend, the Minister of External Affairs, exhibited' (prevention of shipsome years ago in this House.

He reminds me of Lord Brougham, of whom somebody once said that he was so versatile that he would be prepared to take charge of the Channel fleet, or perform an operation for stone at a moment's notice. The honourable member for East Sydney is omniscient and omnipotent, but I do not think that even he knows much about ships. the honourable member, having "" been on one,"" thinks he knows all about them-that is characteristic of him. The Minister of External Affairs, when an independent member in this House, proposed, as I say, a line of steamers, which he said would show a very substantial profit. ber that upon that occasion I asked him what percentage he had allowed in his balance-sheet for insurance, in view of the fact that ship-owners usually allow 5 per cent. said that he had not allowed anything under this head. he had allowed for depreciation of value in the ships, and he said that, under this head also, he had not allowed anything. I may say that ship-owners usually allow 5 per cent, for depreciation. honourable member would read exactly what was said on that occasion. spend so much time over the honourable member's speech. is making an incorrect statement. for the honourable member to say that, but the facts are as I have stated. orable member to say what he has said. mind, Mr Speaker, telling me whether the Minister of External Affairs is, or I am, addressing the House? very well pointed out that, if all the suggestions that have been made from time to time by inexperienced people, as to what -provision should be made in order to make .a ship absolutely proof against possible shipwreck and other disaster, were carried out, it would be cheaper to run a second ship alongside.in case of mishap. is something more in that than a piece of satire, because the accumulated cost of making all theprovision that has from time to time been suggested would almost amount to that of running a second ship.' All this points to the necessity for this House, when it goes into Committee, taking great care to f u l l y understand all the provisions that are to be submitted for approval. I hope that the House, when it comes to that stage, will take a balanced view of the question, and see that we steer a middle course between the extreme of *he enthusiast and the extreme, if honourable I have been on one. members choose, of the ship-owner, who And no doubt would possibly like to run his vessels without any increase in cost, so far f.s regards the safety of those on board. Another point in regard to which we must take great care is the attitude which was touched on by the honourable member for Macquarie towards outI rememside people. We are beginning to realize more and more in Australia that we cannot live for ourselves and to ourselves; we cannot build a wall, and shut ourselves up, saying in a smug way that we are going The Minister of External Affairs to make ourselves comfortable inside and not bother about what is going on outside. I then asked him what It is very few years ago since in this House there was some difliculty in carrying a resolution or Bill by which Australia should"" contribute £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year towards the upkeep of the British Navy; though we all now recognise that we are committed to an expenditure of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year.

310,Mr Bruc Esmith,"containing the suggestions of the Board of Trade regarding this Bill will be found some very interesting matter bearing on that question. I mention this now because the House ought, I think, to carry itself well outside of Australian local requirements, remembering what we have to deal with when we come into conflict with the British authorities. The Board of Trade made 172 suggestions, and at page 12 of the memorandum honourable members will see that the solicitor of the Board, who, honourable members may feel satisfied, is a man of considerable legal knowledge, and is assisted by other people whose opinions are not given hastily, says, through the President of the Board of TradeI would also remind your MinisterThis was the representation of the opinion -of the solicitor of the Board of Trade through the British MinisterThat, if the standards adopted in any Dominion are considered unreasonable by foreign Governments, they are almost certain to retaliate, oot merely ngainst the ships belonging to that Dominion, but against all British vessels using tbeir ports, and it would probably be impossible in practice to induce them to restrict this discrimination merely to vessels registered in the Dominion in question. For example, in the case of the survey of steamers referred to in the last paragraph of my despatch, it would be quite possible for a foreign Government to require a -different kind of equipment, possibly of some -patented kind, to that already provided, and British ships present a wider front to this kind -of attack than any others. 15. No doubt the shipping of Australia is still -comparatively small, and the risks to which reference is made may therefore not seem likely -to entail much loss upon the Commonwealth, but in this matter His Majesty's Government believe -themselves to be entitled to ask your Ministers -to remember the great importance to the United Kingdom and to the Empire of the maintenance -of the supremacy of the British Mercantile Marine, and not to take steps which, however little barm may directly be done to Australia, -may cause serious loss to one of the most important of British industries. His Majesty's Government feel assured that your Ministers are anxious in every way to assist in the develop-ment of the trade of the Empire, and that they -will not willingly place obstacles in the way of -development. In the Bill as it now stands-and honourable -members will understand that the Minister admits that, since the Kalibia appeal to the High Court, no amendment has been made in the Bill, and, of course, it will involve a great many-out of the 172 suggestions -of the British Board of Trade only seventeen have been adopted, twenty-two have 'been rejected, in a large number of others compromises have been made or attempted, .and still others are left open. Mr Bruce Smith. tion has gone in the direction to which the Board of Trade objected. likely, and, therefore, it may cut down some of their suggestions. history. It has been on the table for many years, and I suppose every Ministry which' we have had in this House has had something to say upon it. For some of it we might hold Sir Edmund Barton answerable; for some, the present Leader of the Opposition; and for other provisions, the present Government, who had some dealings with it two years ago in the Senate. It is, therefore, a mixed production, and not a pure merino of either the Labour or the Liberal party. So many people have had a hand in it that we can well afford to approach it in a neutral spirit, with a desire to make of it as good a measure as possible. I desire to impress on honourable members, however, that, on the one hand, we have to deal with the Imperial authorities, and, on the other, with the High Court. Although we may be preparedI do not think we are, and I hope we are not -to take up a "" swashbucklering "" attitude, saying, "" We are going to legislate for Australia, and do not care what effect it has on British opinion,"" we have to remember that the measure will not be approved of by the Governor General, but will be sent Home for the Royal assent in case it comes into conflict with the British shipping laws. Already the High Court has laid down a very distinct principle in the Kalibia case, to the effect that the Commonwealth has nothing to do with shipping which goes on exclusively within a State. That principle is perfectly sound, because the object of Federation was to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with aspects of different subjects with which the States could not deal, and not to come into conflict with the States. We have, therefore, on the one side, the British Government, with its Board of Trade, its British shipping, and its shipping laws, and, on the other, the High Court. good Navigation Bill, we should have a muddle. member will admit that we do not want a muddle.

The High Court has had so many 'cases of the kind, that, following the American practice, it has laid down the principle that, although part of an Act may be ultra vires, if it is separtheir decisions if we do not think they are able from the rest of the Act, and the rest is perfectly constitutional"" that which is unconstitutional may be eliminated. I believe that attitude towards legislation of "" chancing it "" is being displayed in the House less now than it was. In one of the addresses which Mr by the figures 100. If he possessed the Bryce gave, I think at the University, he pointed out that the same spirit was very noticeable in America for many years after they began their Federal institutions; but that Federal politicians in that country now recognised pretty clearly the true provinces of the States and of the Federal Government, and that these questions were much less frequently coming up there, because it was becoming a more settled community. I wish to draw attention to the enormous size of this measure, which contains 424 clauses. before this House containing anything like that number. the size makes the fair acknowledgment that the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain has been "" the basis of all shipping laws I passed in British Colonies, .and also, to a large extent, in foreign countries, particularly in the United States."" The Navigation Commission, which sat in Australia, and which was made up very fairly of both sides of the House, made certain proposals. I hope we shall attach some importance to their very deliberate findings, because, in certain respects, the Bill departs from them. They were a very fairly and evenly constituted body, which took evidence in a great variety of places over a great period, is a wonderful and made a very careful report. While the Tariff was being considered, the honourable member for Hume took so little notice of the findings of the Tariff Commission when they did not happen to fit the particular doctrine he was espousing, that he used to take the findings of the majority of the Commission, and talk of them as the findings of the whole Commission. I submit that, if we deliberately appoint a Commission, we ought to respect its findings. If we think men are fit to make inquiries into a big subject, and report to Parliament regarding it, we ought to respect their decisions as being on the whole wiser and better than those of individual members who have not had time to look as fully into the question. right. vidual whose knowledge we may describe as being equal to the figure 5 will regard as wrong the finding of a Commission whose knowledge, let us say, is represented remaining ninety-five parts of the knowledge possessed by the Commission, he would come to the conclusion at which the Commission had arrived. tion to be taken into consideration. equation might be an even greater disturbing factor: If a man had been brought up in some other occupation, he might be unfit to appreciate even the knowledge of shipping represented, as I have said, by the We have never had a Bill figure 5.

I trust that honourable members, merely because they individually do not agree with a finding of the Commission, will not brush aside the fact that that Commission has probably not only the knowledge possessed by them individually, but .the knowledge of fifty or a hundred men, upon which it is able to come to a more mellowed and matured conclusion. The Commission sat in 1904, and I remember very well the men who constituted -it. They were not only knowledgable, but were interested in the question, and quite capable of dealing with it. The Commission took evidence in every State, and examined 163 witnesses. I propose to draw the attention of the House to one aspect of the Bill which differs entirely from the proposals made by the Commission itself. The Commission came to the conclusion that the air space allowed per man should -be increased from 72 cubic feet to 120 cubic feet. That is a fairly substantial increase; but the Bill provides for 140 cubic feet of air space per man, or nearly double the space now provided. of a grave. space that is ""allowed every man on board those who went Home to England in conship as being sufficient for his grave is not nexion with the Coronation came back betto dispose of the difficulty that confronts ter dressed, and also with more liberal us.

I have already had addressed to me by two important o shipping companies whose vessels do not go outside New South Wales, letters dealing with this aspect of the matter. One company, whose vessels trade principally within Sydney Harbor, has pointed out to me that some of the provisions of this Bill, if applied to such vessels, would make the trade almost impracticable. I do not know that we need trouble very much just now about that matter, because it is recognised, I think, that the decision of the High Court in the Kalibia case practically does away with the anticipated difliculty. I think that the Minister admits that it does. The question we have to ask is not whether we have the f u l l local power to interfere with British and foreign shipping in the local trade, but whether we shall be able to induce the British authorities so to hamper their own shipping, and to allow us so to hamper foreign shipping trading in Australian waters that there may be retaliation on the part of foreign countries in respect of"" British shipping, which is such a stupendous factor in the commerce of the Mother Country. That will depend very much on the views expressed by honourable members when we go into Committee. The Imperial authorities will look after themselves; and I have no doubt that the High Court will look after the rights of the States. If any difficulty does arise, we may depend upon it that shipping companies engaged in what is strictly IntraState trade will take steps to have these questions determined by the High Court. It is important to remember that the High Court has pointed out that if part of a Bill held to be ultra vires is severable from the rest of the B i i l , then the remaining sections take it, this Bill will be so amended that may continue to operate. thinks fit by-and-by to include in the Bill clauses that seem to be obviously beyond our powers of legislation, I trust that they will be in such a form that the High Court will be able to say that they are severable from the rest of the Act. It is important to remember that a great deal of shipping between ports within each State will be seriously affected by this measure. I have already referred to shipping within Sydney Harbor. I would remind honourable members of the trade between Melbourne Apart from the difficulty that may and Geelong, the Gippsland Lakes, Warrnambool, and Portland, and also of the shipping trade between Sydney and Newcastle, Kiama, Woolongong, and the northern rivers. It is so obvious that parts of this B ill would be impracticable as applied to these inner trades that honourable mem-, bers must recognise the absurdity of attempting so to apply them. For instance, the provision that practically every vessel shall have a false bottom, so as to insure, greater safety, would be absolutely impossible in respect of vessels engaged in trade with bar harbors. The owners of such vessels have found it necessary, in order to enable them to get over the bars, to limit their draught to ' such an extent that if would be impossible in addition to allow room for a false bottom. Then, again, we have in this Bill a provision that the crew of a vessel must be accommodated in all cases above the water-line. We shall have an opportunity of dealing with that provision in Committee; but I should like to point out generally that it could have been inserted only by a man unacquainted with the different kinds of shipping that are engaged in the work of the world. I have travelled from Australia to England in -a cabin the port of which was almost permanently under water. The cabin, however, was in other respects well ventilated. To say that the whole crew of a ship shall be accommodated above the water-line in every case is practically to ask for the impossible. In hot weather a cabin below the water-line may be very cool. One side is constantly immersed, and the effect is to have a room which is extremely cool compared with a deck cabin with large ports exposed to the heat of the day. The Minister pointed out that the provisions of the original Bill relating to construction should not apply to vessels built' prior to the date on which it was anticipated that it would come into l a w ; and, I Tf the Minister vessels built since that date and prior to its actual passing, will be excepted. In his speech,' page 807, replying to -an interjection by me, the honourable gentleman saidThe honourable member for Parkes asked speech, it will not be for me to say how whether we intend to compel ship-owners to long he shall take. Is it the pleasure of provide this improved accommodation on vessels the House that the honourable member for which were built before the B ill comes into operation. Clause 137 provides that, except in Parkes have leave to continue his remarks? regard to two matters-the amount of space to be allowed, and the situation of the quarters above the winter load-line-the accommodation on all ships must be made to conform with the provisions of the measure, but that, in regard have impliedly asked for this concession, to these two, if the Minister is satisfied that were it not generally acknowledged that the accommodation already provided is not in this is one of the biggest measures that we sanitary, he may allow the ship to continue to trade. points only. All the other conditions will replying to their questions within the space have to be fulfilled. unfair to ship-owners who have spent some are to be prevented. I agree that what t thousands of pounds on vessels within the are called ""accumulations"" should not past six or twelve months to compel them be allowed. If a sailor wishes to to make extensive alterations to conform save his money, he can do better with the provisions of the measure; with it than leave it in the hands and I have no doubt that the of the master, who, if he is not high-prinMinister will act reasonably in all cipled, may by the exercise of some of his cases where vessels are in other repowers forfeit part of it.

358,I Have Been On A Voyage From Mr Bruc E,"SMITH -We may sayto run over any legal precipices. We must, on the one hand, take care that we do not clash with British law, and, on the other hand, see that we do not practically invite the High Court to tell us that we do not know our business. There is a provision in the Bill with regard to advance notes. It has been the practice of captains to make advances, and it would appear that the Minister has heard of some cases in which this has worked badly, and in which some people have robbed the sailors. But the sailor is not such a "" soft "" gentleman as he used to be. If we read Blackstone's Commentaries, we are told that the sailoi has always been the special care of the Legislature, because he is an innocent, unsophisticated creature. He is not such an "" unsophisticated "" creature to-day, and we ought not to make him sophisticated by coddling legislation. It seems to me that an advance note is a perfectly allowable thing, especially in the case of a married man who wishes to leave some means behind for his wife and family. lotment note, which is better. what it is called, so long as some provision is made, but the Minister spoke of the advance note system being abused. better, have been substituted. so long as a man is able to obtain a small sum of money to leave with those dependent on him. The Minister, as reported on page 813 of Hansard, said something with regard to British and foreign seamen, and he later quoted from an opinion written by Mr Garran, bearing on the question of Inter-State shipping. The Minister quoted Mr Garran as followsLegislative power of the Commonwealth as to Navigation and ShippingIn the Kalibia case, 11 C.L.R. 689, the High Court held that section 98 did not enlarge the ambit of the trade and commerce clause so as to extend it to shipping engaged in the domestic commerce of a State; and that therefore the Seamen's Compensation Act, which was expressed to extend to such shipping, was ultra vires. It must be taken, therefore, that over intraof British manufactured goods and British State shipping-as such-the Commonwealth has no general power to legislate; but that does not mean that it has no power at all in regard to such shipping. Then this opinion goes on to try to make a set out in the motion is not the one he had sort of background for some differentiating in view; he believed, like a man stalking legislation of a doubtful constitutional high game, in not going directly up to it, but character which the Minister wishes to inin taking a circuitous route, and attacking it troduce. I do not suppose I shall get much sympathy in what I have to say, but, at all events, honourable members opposite know that the wages of the men employed on Inter-State shipping, whether sailors, firemen, stokers, cooks, or stewards, are so excellent, and the ship-owners have been so responsive to demands made, that there is a desire now, interpret it as we may, on the part of the Government to put some difficulty in the way of ocean steamers, when they arrive here, trading between ports which are frequented by Inter-State steamers. For instance, it is provided that ocean-going steamers shall not, after they call at one port, carry goods to other ports, and thus be brought into conflict # with Inter-State 'shipping. may so trade under certain conditions. present those large lines of steamers carry passengers from Sydney to Melbourne and to Adelaide, and so forth, just as the Inter-State shipping does. There was a provision in the original Act by which ocean-going steamers had some concession in regard to trade between Western Australia and Adelaide and Melbourne, because of the fact that the Inter-State railway had not been constructed; but I am not dealing with that matter now. I desire to show that, although it is clearly admitted that the Commonwealth has nothing to do with Intra-State shipping, there is a sort of suggestion that it is open to the Government, in this Bill, to enact some legislation which possibly may clash with Imperial legislation, but which will enable them to continue to prevent ocean-going steamers from competing with Inter-State steamers. However, we shall have an opportunity to deal with those matters in Committee. I should now like to quote from the report of the Imperial Conference of 1911 some very interesting but short passages from the speech of the English Minister, Mr Buxton. Senator Pearce moved at that ConferenceThat it is advisable in. tbe interests both of the United Kingdom and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas that efforts in favour shipping should be supported as far as practicable.

364,Mr Bruce Smith,"I know. Atfrom the side or back. In this he expressed great concern in favour of British manufactured goods and British shipping, but all the while he was endeavouring to induce the Conference to take some steps which would give intercolonial shipping an advantage over oversea shipping. His speech was .answered by Mr Buxton, who was clever enough to detect its real purpose, for he expressed surprise that these questions should be brought up under the motion. He said[ was not aware what points would be raised on this resolution, and I did not know, therefore, that this particular point would have been raised in connection with it. But it having been raised, perhaps the Conference will allow me *o say a few words with regard to it. The position which His Majesty's Government Jiave taken up upon it is a twofold one. Mr goes to foreign ports, and a comparatively small Pearce explained what was proposed by the Australian Act, and may I say, in passing, that as far as the object is concerned, we very much appreciate the desire of the Australian Commonwealth' Government in reference to this matter, namely, to assist the British shipping in connection with the Colonies, and as far as possible to give an advantage to British shipping over foreign shipping in the Commonwealth. As far its the object is concerned, therefore, we are obliged to the Commonwealth1 Honourable members will see the irony He then went on to state-and this rather standing out there very clearlyfor what they have done and what they were the decline in numbers of British seamendesiring to do. But the question had to be considered not only from the point of view of British shipping in connection with the Commonwealth, but we had to look at it from the point of view of British shipping all the world over. Mr Pearce said that the point was takenJind he is correct in saying so--that we, in agreeing to this proposed Act of the Commonwealth -would have conflicted in many respects with some of our treaties with other nations, and he -seemed to imply, I thought, that we might denounce these treaties, at all events a portion of them, with a view of obtaining freedom in connection with this matter. No doubt that might be done under certain circumstances if the end 3n view would justify the means, but the view we have taken about it is much wider than that. I am speaking now as to our position as regards foreign ships and foreign trade. We think it is not a question of merely denouncing the treaties, but that if this attempt was made, which is the -suggestion, namely, to confine the trade of Great Britain with the Commonwealth to British or to Commonwealth ships, this would be very largely resented by the Foreign Powers interested, and ""the result would be that we should be open, as we are open all the world over, to attack and -retaliation -only the trade in those articles which are the subject of the preferential Tariff. When the preferential scheme was before Senator Pearce then askedthe tiouse-and I took part in the whole of of the debate on it-no t a word was said proportion lascars? of the effect it was going to have on British shipping. It was simply a desire by some honourable members to give preference to England, in order to try to get it back from her; but Senator Pearce used it in the Conference as if it had been proposed to ton saidYes, but still it is practically confining the trade, or very largely excluding foreign ships from a portion of the Australian trade. What we, as representatives of British shipping here, and representatives, I hope, of the British Dominions as well, are nervous about is the power and opportunity of retaliation against our British shipping all the world-over on any of these matters. I would point out to the Conference that out of the 285,000,000 tons of British shipping all the world over, no less than 164,000,000 tons portion goes to Australian ports, and therefore for the advantage, and no doubt the considerable advantage, of the trade of the Commonwealth, we do not think it would be worthwhile to risk the possibility of disadvantage accruing to the very enormous trade which we have with other Powers. That is really the substantial reason why, as at present advised, we do not think on the whole it would be expedient to adopt the proposal of the Commonwealth Government. clashes with the Minister's figures showing As regards one question incidental to that raised by Mr Pearce, namelv, that they would not only propose to differentiate against foreign ships, but at the same time they would differentiate against British ships which carried crews other than white crews, that particular point I think will be raised on a motion of Sir Joseph Ward later on on some subsequent day, and so perhaps I had better not discuss it now. But I should like just to say this, in reference to what fell from Mr Pearce, that I cordially agree that as far as possible the British MercantileMarine should be manned by British subject. I am not touching on what their colour should be, but British subjects. I dare say it would be to a certain extent a satisfaction to Mr Pearce to know that since the passing of the last Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 the proportion of British sailors as compared with foreign sailors has gone up in percentage. In 1905 jt was 68 per cent, as against 15 per cent, of foreign sailors, and I am not speaking of Lascars and Asiatics-in 1910, it had gone up to 73 per cent, as against 11 of foreigners. So as far as it goes the tendency is in the right direction. If the Minister will compare those figures vvith his, he will find that they are differentI do not say it is altogether satisfactory. What proportion of them are British and what",59,Elliot Johnson Sailor S Are Combustion Being Caused By The Friction

Some men, develops more than it is at present, the position that we have taken is that the result might be, by piece-work, recently laid in Melbourne if we accepted the Australian position, possibly 1,500 bricks a day. a serious disadvantage to British trade without cases in England where men laid 3,000 material advantage on the other hand. Sir Wilfrid Laurier then made some rather New South Wales the men on Government similar remarks. In view of Mr Buxton's jobs wanted to limit themselves to 250 representations and figures, which show bricks a day. The Minister, Mr O'Sulliwhat a stupendous trade England is doing van, wanted 300, and compromised with with foreign countries, and how almost 280.

There are only two or three more points to which I desire to refer. The proby some to have tilted over because her vision of boats on shipboard-is an important and difficult question. Some people think that a ship should carry enough boats to accommodate every one on board in case of mishap. That seems very feasible, but the principle may be carried to such an extent as to become an absolute absurdity. No doubt every house in a suburb would be more secure against burglary if a policeman were always stationed opposite every front door. chances in that respect, just as we have to take our chance in various walks of life. If some of the larger ships had to carry sufficient boats to provide for all on board in case of accident, their decks would be so hampered that work would be impossible, or their carrying capacity would be cut down to such an extent that it would be impossible .for them to carrv on, save with very high charges for deck freight and passengers. boats on a ship's deck should be kept in seaworthy order; that they should be inspected frequently, and that the men who are expected to take charge of them in case of mishap should be carefully and frequently drilled. ing to prevent men on board ship nowadays being thoroughly trained in the handling of the boats. They have plenty of time on their hands which might be occupied in drilling them, so as to insure that they will be ready at any moment, in case of mishap, to launch the boats, to manage them properly, and to take their I come now to the question of watertight compartments. Practical ship-owners and experts vary very much in their views on this matter. I heard one of the greatest shipping experts in Australia, now dead, say that he attributed the loss of the Waratah entirely to the fact that she had watertight' compartments which had been emptied to allow of further cargo being carried on the 'tween decks, and that when she went over to a particular angle the. emptied tanks acted like a balloon, and helped to turn over the ship. If these compartments are to be airtight, tbey may be a menace to the stability of a vessel. As every oneknows, on many ships there aTe waterballast compartment tanks, and when they are empty they may be a menace to the safety of the ship. The Austral, which went down in Sydney Harbor, was thought watertight compartments were empty. careless coaling. men in Sydney who think that the Austral sank, in consequence of careless coaling having caused her to tilt over, until the water flowed into her open ports. Others, whose opinion is equally valuable, came to But we have to take our the conclusion that she would not have tilted over so as to take in water through her ports if she had not had empty watertight compartments, which acted as balloons,and helped, after the ship had gone beyond a certain point, so to increase the angle as to precipitate the inrush of water. We know that the Waratah's watertight compartments were empty, because at Durban she took on coal, which she carried 'tween decks. That is an illusI quite agree that all tration of what empty airtight compartments may lead to. If they are situated on the bottom of a' ship, they are a serious menace in the case of vessels carrying a big top hamper. Any man with a knowledge of shipping, when looking There is nothstem on at the great steamers that come into our harbors, cannot help wondering that so much top hamper is allowed, A big top hamper must have considerable effect in interfering with the stability and safety of a vessel in a heavy sea.

376,Mr Bruce Smith,"There are manyknow enough to justify me in saying that the authorities ought to be very careful how they legislate in regard to the provision of airtight compartments on ships. If we require such compartments to be carried along the side or on the bottom of a ship, we shall lessen that ship's carrying capacity, and provide for a ""big balloon being put into her which may be very dangerous in the case of vessels with top-heavy upper decks. The Titanic had airtight compartments, but the iceberg which she struck seems to have gone through both sides. It seems a very easy matter for us to say, "" We will provide for airtight compartments on all ships''; but, at the proper time, I shall ask the Minister to tell us what authority he has for saying that airtight compartments should be provided. If this Bill had been intended to apply to Intra-State vessels, the provision in regard to airtight compartments would have been almost impossible, because, in the case of vessels trading to bar harbors, every inch of depth is a matter of importance. vessels have to cross river bars. are engaged in the northern rivers trade of New South Wales, and the matter is one of great importance. something will be done in regard to the top hamper carried on large vessels-that we shail provide that practical men shati be called upon, from time to time, to express their opinions upon the sufficiency of the stability or the superabundance, of top hamper on vessels over which we have legal . control.
