It is -stated that permission for such a connection was practically granted by the Philp Government, and it is contended that the action of the Commonwealth Government amounts to repudiation. It is claimed that immense advantages to Queensland would follow direct cable communication with the East and British and German New Guinea, especially from a trading standpoint, and it i i suggested that the desire to keep this trade in the hands of the southern States has influenced the southern authorities against agreeing to cable communication.

I wish to address myself to this matter in a spirit worthy of its imafter referring to other duties of the Chanportance, and with an endeavour to keep quite away from any display of party feeling or personal antagonism. kind the right honourable member is. ference to this and other public matters is Todd's not measured by the peculiar standards of land, second e'dition, the; principle of Cabithe honourable member for Lyne-. orable member is getting mixed already. Who is the honourable member for Reid? honourable member for Hume; but I correctly described the honourable member in speaking of him as the honourable member for Lyne, because Lyne is the only constituency which he has ever represented.

I know that some honourable members think that we vernment, and have what is called an elecour present parliamentary institutions, ana until we adopt that new method of administering public affairs, we must pay some attention to the rules and traditions of Parliament and responsible government. BeforeI address myself to the subject on which I wisih to speak, I should like to quote a few words uttered by Earl, Grey many years ago in regard to a much milder act than that to which I am about to allude. The then Secretary of State for the Colonies, in a despatch to the Governor of Jamiaea, had used some expressions which, although rather guarded, were suffi1 cient to show that the decision of the Government which his despatch conveyed was not one with which he entirely sympathized. The matter was discussed in the House of Lords on the 14th June, 1862, when Earl Grey laid down this principle : the Cabinet has decided, if the Secretary State thinks that his colleagues are wrong,, but not so overwhelmingly wrong as to warrant his standing upon his own opinion-in which case he of will resign-it is bis duty to signify to the Go. vernor of the Colony the final decision of the Queen's Government, and not to weaken the decision by implying in his' despatch' any doubt as to the grounds and the propriety of the decision. In another case, Mr Gladstone, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, was taken to task for certain expressions he had used, with reference to the public finances, and, cellor of the Exchequer, he laid down the constitutional position in this way :He has no right, directly or indirectly, in the smallest degree to attempt to escape from the responsibility thai weighs oh his colleagues. Parliamentary Government in Engnet government is laid down in this way : The influence which is rightly exercised by Ministers of the Crown in the Houses of Parliament depends in the first instance, upon the degree of unity, and of mutual co-operation they exhibit between themselves; and finally upon the amount of control they are able to exercise over the political party to which they belong.

18,Mr Reid,"I should, have said theemplified. In tracing the origin and development of the rule which requires political unanimity amongst the Ministers of the Crown, we have seen that it has become an acknowledged principle that, so long as a Minister continues to form part of a Government, he shares with his colleagues an equal responsibility for everything that is done or agreed upon by them. Except in the case of an admitted "" open question,"" it must be taken for granted that the whole Cabinet have assented tT the Ministerial policy as officially transacted or propounded by any Minister acting or speaking on their behalf. It is not, therefore, allowable for a Cabinet Minister to oppose the measures of government-to shrink from an unqualified responsibility in respect to the same-to refrain from assisting his colleagues in the advocacy of ,their particular measures in Parliament-o r to omit the performance of any administrative act which may be necessary to carry out a decision of the Government-eve n though he may not have been a consenting party thereto-o r to withhold his support from the Ministry when attacked by tfteir political opponents. fringes any one of these rules is bound to tender his immediate resignation of office.

At the general election in 1903 the Deakin Government, of which the Minister of Trade' and Customs was a member, went to the country on the question of immigration. Sir not the present Government. will not steal my time in this way. Then when the Government came back, they announced .that the country had accepted their policy, and stated that they attached so much importance to it that they would stake their political existence upon it , and would carry it out to the utmost of their strength. Then a conference was held in 1904, at which the Prime Minister went somewhat out of his way to address the assembled Treasurers of Australia, in a brilliant speech which covers many pages of an official document, suggesting a hundred different ways in which the great question of immigration might be furthered by the Commonwealth, acting in conjunction with the States Governments. A Minister who inLater on, when the Government met Parliament in March, 1904, they put forward their immigration policy as a matter of vital importance upon which they would stake their political existence.

23,Mr Reid,"I hope that the Ministerwas fully adopting it when he said, practically, that we could judge of the sincerity of public utterances upon this question of immigration by accepting the offer. details ? Minister said; I am quoting his words, and not my own. During the same debate he went on to sayThose who accept the doctrine of a White Australia, as I have often said, must repudiate the suggestion that it means an empty Australia. It is impossible for Australia to be made or kept white except by means of a white people planted wherever white men can live and work with profit. We believe that is possible in most parts of the Continent-ever y one believes that it relates to all but a fraction of it-and this Government intends to exhaust every means of extending and multiplying white settlement. By that means only can Australia be kept white. Surely that is making a vital question of immigration. The Prime Minister said, in effect, that only by means of immigration could we keep Australia white. I am not going to take up the time of the House by multiplying references to the brilliant language in which the Prime Minister has made the subject of immigration the corner stone of his Administration. It is notorious throughout the length and breadth of Australia, that he has done so. The Ministry are now standing upon that policy, and what do we find ? After the Prime Minister had sent General Booth's proposal to the States' Premiers, and had forwarded a message to General Booth couched in the most friendly and cordial terms, one of the members of his Administration went to a public meeting, and stated that he was opposed to the introduction of these people. The last sentence of the Prime Minister's message to General Booth read as follows:Assure you of warm desire of this GovernmentThe Government including the Minister of Trade and Customsto co-operate any movement which will result in introducing desirable settlers Through the press, General Booth expressed himself as being delighted with the cordial acceptance of his offer by the Prime Minister, to the extent of his having expressed his willingness to do all he could with the States Governments to promote his scheme. Then we have later telegrams published in the press from\Perth and Hobart, showing that the Prime Minister is actively engaged in furthering the project, in conjunction with the Premiers of the States. So that we find this vital question of immigration is a matter of Government policy, and that with regard to the definite proposal of Genera] Booth, the position of the Government is unmistakable-subject , no doubt, as the honourable member for Bland has suggested, to the consideration of some details. That is the policy of the Government, and that is the policy, I believe, of nearly every member of the Government; hut fhe Minister of Trade and Customs has acted towards his colleagues in a wav that no man with any political experience could approve. What right has any Minister who is engaged in carrying out the public policy of his colleagues to let the people know that he throws his colleagues and their policy overboard, and that, while he may be dragged by them into doing what they wish, he is altogether opposed to a vital plank of Ministerial policy-to the introduction of the 5,000 families which General Booth proposes to send here? What right has the Minister to get out of the ship in that way, in order to save himself? It is known that a large number of persons disapprove of this immigration policy. I believe that the majority of honourable members below the gangway disapprove of it. be brought here to starve. of my honourable friends believe in, is the introduction of men, each of whom has a few hundred pounds in His pocketa different class of men from those who were responsible for their existence in Australia to-day. Neither their parents, nor mine, came here With .£500. in their pockets. NowI come to the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs in reference to this matter. The Prime Minister said at Hawthorn on Monday night, that he believed in Socialism, and also in Individualism. Ministers are riding two horses in this Ministerial circus. One foot is on Socialism and the other on Individualism. That is the position of the Prime Minister. Now the Minister of Trade and Customs is going with the Government, in order to derive the benefit of their policy of immigration, and he is going also to the enemies of immigration, and telling them "" I do not believe in it. I am going to tell them in the Cabinet what I think about it . "" The Minister thinks that I want him to leave office, but I",14,William Lyne Hear Hear But Of The Proposal Of General Booth Than

29,Mr Reid,"The immigration that someknow that, so far as we are concerned, he is much safer in office than anywhere else. He has no prospect of any such a position with us. He is like the elephant in the china shop. He does much more harm to the Ministry as a member of it than' he could do in any other position. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council said on one occasion, if the Japanese wanted to subdue Port Arthur they ought to throw the Minister into it. -h e would blow up a much stronger erection than that fortress. This is the speech to which I refer. The newspaper report says:Sir William Lyne, replying to the.toast of ParAmerica, and South Africa, to come to our liament, referred to General Booth's immigration scheme, and said that in this, as in other matters, ment and of the Prime Minister. That is a Minister must pull with his colleagues or leave. My objection to the Minister's position is that he does neither. with his colleagues as a loyal Minister would do, or leave them, as a self-respecting Constitutional Minister would do. He pulls away from his colleagues. lates himself from his colleagues before the public of Australia, and puts himself forward as an advocate of the policy of anti-immigration, but, at the same time, remains in the Cabinet. the people outside, ""You wait until I get into the Cabinet.. I will give them a piece of my mind. I will square my colleagues up on the question of immigration."" The Minister works up his theatrical effects In order to curry favour with the great body of the working men of Australia. He wants to be safe whatever shipwreck may come. He wants to see a little dry land ahead."" He sees none over here, but he fancies that he can see a safe place among the members of the Labour Party. wishes to appear as a sincere supporter of the Government policy, and he still believes in it to the extent of sticking to office, but he does not believe in it as a good thing for Australia. He goes on to say: The people we wanted to place on our lands were the sturdy sons of Australia's pioneers. We all agree with that. agrees with' that. is not done. We all believe in that, but is there not room in this great country for other people, besides our own sons? on the land first. now, but I am discussing a constitutional question that would be regarded as of the utmost importance in any other Parliament, and at any other time but this. The Minister went on to say :With regard to immigration itself, he believed that wherever the attraction existed, there desirable people would come. Now there the honourable member takes the other side. There are two sides to this policy of immigration. One side is expressed in these terms, "" We must use our best efforts to induce some of the people who are now going to Canada, South shores."" That is the view of the Governthe policy upon which the Ministry are prepared to risk their political existence. He does not pull The other policy is this: that no special effort should be made, that no special inducement should be offered, that we should take our chance and allow the atHe isotractiveness of the country only to operate, that we should allow people to come here if they think the place attractive, but not use a single effort to induce them to come. These are the two sides of this great quesHe tells tion. The effect of the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs is, "" I am against immigration, although I remain a colleague of the great chief of the movement in Australia. I am against immigration, but I will stick to office, although I embarrass my colleagues. I will weaken the Executive Government of the country by telling the opponents of the Government policy that I am-with them."" If that were whispered into the ear of the opponents of the Government, it would be a mean He actto a body of colleagues. If it were whispered secretly into the ear of the newspaper editor, it would be a mean thing to do; but when it is said publicly before the whole of the people, it is worse than mean and cowardly; it is a treacherous ac£. When men are joined together as a Ministry, surely they should endeavour to fight side by side. I do not know of any Every man other Government that has had an experience of this kind. I do not think that members of a Labour Government would ever fight in that way, one against the other, on a question contained in their platform. I do not think you would get any member representing a labour constituency to weaken the power of a Labour Government by proclaiming his opposition",15,William Lyne Hear Hear But Of The Proposal Of General Booth Than

33,Mr Reid,"I am not raising that pointto a plank' in the Labour platform. Such a man would be drummed out of their ranks with execration. I say that the Minister of Trade and Customs is doing to his colleagues what such an individual would do to the Labour Party. The moment men. take the oaths of office, and agree to work together as loyal colleagues, it is their duty to adopt one of two courses. If they disapprove of the policy of the Government upon a vital matter, they can show the sincerity of their belief by sacrificing the advantages appertaining to their offices. Buti f they do not disapprove of that policy, strongly enough to' warrant their taking such an extreme course, they have only one alternative. If they will not leave the Government, they ought to remain loyal to their colleagues-^they ought to solidify the strength of the Ministry. The Government ought not to speak in two voices, the Prime Minister declaring, ""We, as a Government, are committed to this proposal,"" and the Minister of Trade and Customs saying, ""This scheme is all nonsense. I am absolutely Opposed to it. I do not believe in it . "" ' I say that such a state of things is only possible under an alliance, such as we have to-day. It is not an alliance of principle. It is an alliance under which two parties with widely different aims have their own purposes to serve the alliance? liance which exists to-day, so long as members of the Labour Party obtain certain concessions, they are prepared to keep quiet. underlying the recent alliance between the right honourable member himself and others ? long as that alliance did exist, we remained loyal to one another, and the very moment there was a breath of disloyalty, we did not ""say, ""We will stick to our offices, in order to get another kick."" On the contrary, we declared, ""We will seek an appeal' to the country, and, if the Parliament is not prepared to endorse our proposal in that direction, we will go out of office."" member had no alternative. satisfied. The Minister of Trade and Customs went on to sayHe had spoken as strongly as possible without coming into conflict with his colleagues. Just fancy a Minister expressing his opinion in absolute opposition to a plank of Ministerial policy of vital moment throwing his colleagues and their policy overboard, and affirming that he had spoken as strongly as possible without coming into conflict with them. thing more than come into conflict with his colleagues. The fact is, that his unfortunate colleagues cannot get rid of him, because they are not strong enough to do so. They had to take him in, because he would be. too dangerous if he were out of office. There is no doubt that when he is out of office the honourable member is just like a famished dingo. He is bouna to get in somehow, or there will be trouble. But when the political dingo has secured a home, and is being affectionately and loyally treated by his colleagues, he might give them in return at least a semblance of loyalty. Is it possible to injure a Government more in the estimation of the people than by allowing -some Ministers to swear by a certain line of policy which another Minister openly scouts? Is that the' way for a Minister to help his colleagues, or to maintain the character and prestige of a Government? Surely honourable members are incapable of acting in that way. I am sure that they are. I admit that, for political purposes, Ministers have to endure a number of outrages without taking any overt action. I have submitted this motion for no other purpose than to discharge my duty, as one of the oldest members of a State Legislature in this Parliament. As honourable members are aware-of course, it is no fault of mineI am one of the oldest members of Parliament in this House, and I have a duty to discharge as the leader of a parti-. I wish, therefore, in the strongest possible way, to say, "" Let us have elective Ministries if honourable members so desire, but as long as we continue our present system of Government, which is founded upon the Cabinet system as it is carried out in the mother country, a position such as that created by the utterances of the Minister of Trade and Customs is absolutely intolerable.""' , He has",16,William Lyne Hear Hear But Of The Proposal Of General Booth Than

As long as he remains with his colleagues he has no right; to play false to. them he has no right to embarrass' them by giving open expression to a division of opinion, and he has no right to take the public into the counsels of the Cabinet Chamber, and to tell them that he is opposed to his own colleagues. That is a method of self-advertisement which ought not to commend itself to straightforward politicians. If the Minister wishes to remain in office he must be loyal to his colleagues; if he cannot be loyal to them, he should resign, and leave them free from embarrassment. Talk about mutiny upon a ship ! There is no mutiny which is more disastrous to a country than is mutiny in the ranks of the Cabinet Council. Only the other day, on the question of preferential trade, what did we see?

The right honourable member has hung his complaint upon a very, very small peg indeed. He has quoted from a newspaper report of a speech, the delivery of which occupied a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.

If it were conceded, there could be no further use for the Opposition, and we might as well pack up our political traps and go home. I venture to say that it is the obligation of an Opposition to take a deep and anxious interest in all matters which have to do with the preservation of the first principles of parliamentary government. I should like to say, in passingfor I may not refer further to a certain statement made by the Minister that everv one of the assertions which he made in defence of his position constituted the severest criticism that could be levelled against the attitude of his chief on the question of immigration. He told us that he is not in favour of General Booth's immigrants coming to Australia, and that we had farmers' sons going about the country seeking ballot after ballot in the hope of obtaining a block of land. All that criticism, however, should have been addressed, not to the House to-day, but to the Prime Minister, who, since coming into office, Has been advocating immigration throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Immigration has been the cardinal feature of his policy ever since he came into office, and it is at this late hour-afte r Minister is in favour of General Booth's the Prime Minister has approved of General Booth's scheme in the most cordial termsthat the Minister of Trade and Customs raises criticisms which apply, not so. much to the facts of the case as to the action of his political chief.

100,,"Mr. JOSEPH COOK I shall not bearance of Ministers towards one another,",23,William Lyne Hear Hear But Of The Proposal Of General Booth Than
101,Mr Joseph Cook,"That is as trueown defence. After the Prime Minister has irrevocably committed himself to this policy, the Minister of Trade and Customs goes about the country repudiating it, and declaring what he will do when General Booth's scheme comes before the Cabinet. Parliamentary government cannot be carried on in this way. The Government are playing a very old game of theirs. They must please both wings of their party, and must fly both flags for the purpose. Therefore, it was very appropriate the r other night for the Prime Minister to go on a -public platform, and declare that he is both a Socialist and an Individualist. The Prime Minister says that we require population from oversea, whereas the Minister of Trade and Customs says that we do not, and adds, "" We will not have it. I am prepared to leave office first."" Of course, no one thinks that he would do that. The Ministry is likely fo get into a very peculiar position in regard to this matter. Government places a dual responsibility on Ministers-thei r responsibility to Parliament and their responsibility to the Governor General. It is not a difficult stretch of the imagination to suppose that the Governor General may receive a communication from the Imperial Government on the subject of immigration, as he did the other day from Canada on the subject of preferential trade. should happen, who would advise the Governor General on the subject? Would he take the advice of the Prime Minister, or would he take that of the Minister of Trade and Customs? the honourable member under the Standing Orders has now expired. Minister's reply as wholly unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister has laid down a certain definite line of policy towards' immigration which, I think, is possibly the most important plank in his programme, since it affects all the others, while the Minister of with the infinitely more pressing claim Trade and Customs has gone behind the back of the Government, and made a statement to the country which his self-respect as a loyal colleague should' have prevented him from making. This is, unfortunately, no new departure for the Minister of Trade and Customs to take. In June last, speaking in East Sydney, in that fine old battle-ground, the Protestant Hall, of his famous change of front in reference to the r inclusion of railway servants within the scope of the Arbitration Bill, he saidDon't make any mistake. I am going to speak straight from the shoulder to-night. I shall not dwell on the unusual course which the Minister set himself to follow in determining to speak straight from the ShoulderWhen the party known as the Labour Party went to the country, to a large extent the main question was whether the railway servants should be included in the Federal Arbitration Bill or not . . . . When they met the House the questionwas made a test question, and the Labour Party was asked to go back upon the one great point that they had submitted 10 their constituents. He thought they would have been a contemptible crowd had they gone back on that point. And yet he was the Minister in the last Deakin Administration who would have been most glad if the Labour Party had proved themselves a ""contemptible crowd,"" and had gone back on that point. The reEvery one knows that Cabinet port from which I am quoting continuesAlthough he (the honourable member for Hume) was a member of a Government which was against the inclusion of the railway servants in the Arbitration Act, it was well known that he was personally in favour of the proposal. He had been twitted by Mr Sydney Smith with having first voted against the proposal and afterwards voted for it. Surely a proper subject for t w it t in g . If that The explanation was simple. Being bound to the Government, he could not vote against his colleagues, but when he got the opportunity to vote for these railway servants he did so. There are the articles of faith of the honourable member for Hume as a Cabinet Minister. He cannot vote against his colleagues, because to do so would cause him to pass into the cold shades of opposition; but he will speak against them as much as he likes. What would have been the position in regard to the claims of the railway servants had the Deakin Administration continued in office? Their claims to consideration would have been as nothing in comparison of the honourable member for Hume to continue in office. What would have been the position in such a case? Would the Minister have taken the truly awful step of surrendering that power and place which has such a strong attraction for him, and go back on his leader's promises to his constituents' a thing which he declared the members of the Labour Party should not do? Or",23,William Lyne Hear Hear But Of The Proposal Of General Booth Than

It is no new thing for the honourable member to betray Cabinet secrets outside ; but it will be a slur upon the Governintroducing immigrants with capital, and ment if they permit the Minister to continue in office and subject them to this indignity. The Commonwealth will be in an unhappy position if a Minister of the Crown is to have so small a regard for the dignity of his office that he is prepared to throw over his colleagues for the sake of currying favour with those to whom his whole past political career has been strongly opposed. I think the present position is a most pitiable one, and I am very glad that the leader of the Opposition has given honourable members an opportunity to express their views on it.

I was waiting to hear him establish the connection. me to relate the incidents which led up to the delivery of the Minister's speech. present at Henty on Saturday? Sydney when the Minister made practically the same speech. He had to confront -as he has often had to do-hundred s of splendid young men who are seeking an opportunity to make a living upon the lands of Australia. He was asked what was his attitude in respect of the question of immigration, and he clearly stated that he was not in favour of encouraging the introduction of members of General Booth's submerged tenth. It is within the knowledge of honourable members generally that the great majority of the submerged tenth are absolutely unfitted to settle upon the land. If they were placed there they would be practically useless. Even in England itself they are very far from being regarded as a desirable class in the population. Under these circumstances, the Minister naturally stated that he was opposed to their introduction into the Commonwealth. There was not one word of his speech which would warrant the deduction that he was opposed to the immigration of men who would develop our resources. Surely he was justified in making the reply that he did? He was confronted by hundreds of young men, who were asking, "" Is it proposed to grant to members of the ' submerged tenth ' a preference over native-born Australians?"" phatic denial to the statement of the honourable member for Robertson that ample land is available for settlement in the Commonwealth to-day. Quite recently, at a place which is very close to the town in which the Minister of Trade and Customs delivered the speech to which objection has been taken, the Government of New South Wales threw open for occupation a block of 640 acres. cannot yet see the connection between the honourable member's remarks and the motion which is under consideration. Will the honourable member please establish it? The question is not whether General Booth's scheme, or any other scheme, is a good one. It is simply whether or not the Minister of Trade and Customs was in his statements loyal to the policy announced by the Prime Minister. great deference to your rulings, Mr Speaker, and shall continue to do so. I regret, however, that the leader of the Opposition was permitted to go beyond the scope of the motion. He has made certain statements with regard to the conduct of the Minister of Trade and Customs, which, to my mind, are unfair. I have had the privilege and honour of being intimately acquainted with the Minister for twenty-five years. During the greater portion of that time. I have been politically associated with him-o n one occasion we were colleagues in a State Ministry-and I can say from my knowledge of him that he is the last man in this House who would be disloyal to his colleagues, or make any statement calculated to bring them into disrepute. There was nothing in the speech which formed the subject of the attack made by the leader of the Opposition thai could be construed as evidence of disloyalty on the part of the Minister to his colleagues. I am perfectly satisfied that the Government, as a whole,, are at one in the desire, if necessary, to bring to Australia a suitable class of immigrants, and that they are equally at one in the wish to exclude an undesirable class.

137,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister ofsettlers of all classes from Europe, and from the mother country, particularly with a view to their settlement upon the soil. suitable immigrants admitted. that. I think we are also agreed that it is not proposed that these settlers shall reto receive, because his own statements show ceive advantages superior to those offered the sons of the farmers of Australia now in the country. No one proposes that. We come, then, to the consideration of the particular proposal which the. Minister of Trade and Customs was discussing, and for his utterances in regard to which he has been criticised in this House. The offer made by General Booth is one which I welcomed most cordially as a touchstone of this question. I regarded it in that li<rht because it put to the States, in a form in which it could neither be evaded nor confused, the question of what lands were available, and on what terms they could be taken up. That question is of as much interest to the people already in Australia as it is to those intending to come here, because it made it necessary for the States to show that they can supply the natural and reasonable demands of the people already here as well as of those outside. I agree with the leader of the Opposition that, to look at the map of Australia, or to be acquainted with any single State, is to be satisfied that the area of fertile and wellwatered land in the Commonwealth is sufficient to supply the demands, not only of those of our own population who are legitimately desirous of settling upon the soil, but of 5,000 or 50,000 families from outside. The safety and prosperity of Australia depends upon the introduction of suitable immigrants. It was, perhaps, due to the fact that my honourable colleague was not present when the Cabinet had an opportunity to consider what General Booth's proposal really meant because, so far, his offer has not been put clearly and definitely before the public that he was led to assume that the scheme was to send to Australia a portion of what is sometimes described as the submerged tenth. I am only assuming from what I know of the intentions of the General when he visited this country what is the meaning of the proposal which he has now made. I have very little doubt that I know what he has in view, since his chief officers in. Australia support my interpretation. As I have said, my honourable colleague was not . present at the Cabinet, and. appears to have assumed that General Booth's offer was to send out 5,000 families taken from the submerged tenth. I am free to admit that if that were so, the offer would be regarded with a much closer scrutiny than it is likely that a great proportion of that number consists of city dwellers, born and bred in the streets, and possessing no knowledge of agriculture. It cannot be said, however, that it consists wholly of city dwellers. Unfortunately, owing to the harsh conditions that obtain in fhe old world, many of those who drift temporarily, at all events, into the submerged section, have had some training on the land, and have no stain on their characters. They are only the victims of misfortune, or of hard local conditions. I do not say that these comprise any great proportion of the whole, but they certainly constitute a marked proportion, and will""' make good settlers when proper opportunities are afforded them in a new country. General Booth has three distinguishing faculties that are rarely found in combination. He is not only the leader of a most remarkable religious revival, but is, and has been, a great philanthropist, and, curiously enough, is also a keen man of business. His financial control and administration of his own organization, looked at merely from a commercial stand-point, are marvellous achievements. That was brought home to my own un-commercial mind during conversations that I had the good fortune to have with him when he was last in Australia. He then described to me in detail his series of proposals for settling people on the land. He explained how he first sifted from the applicants those who were able to come out with some chance of earning a living. If they were untrained, he sent them to the Army farms, and trained them. If they gave evidence of weakness of character, or of some other defect, he kept them under control in wnat would be called ""colonies,"" some of which he hoped to establish oversea. But fhese were a class aparta class marked out for controlto be sustained until they were made self-supporting, and were able to start with some means to seek an independent livelihood. Apart from these, he had sifted out those who were already trained, and those who were fit to be trained, in agricultural pursuits, and had wives and families capable of supporting themselves to some degree.

139,Mr Deakin,"We are agreed as tosome cases these men had a little capital, and occasionally something more; but they were being driven from the soil owing to the growth of the great estates in England, and the turning of the land to other than productive purposes. Army? General is not seeking to make them members. simply acting in this respect because he was desirous of transferring them, and their capital, to countries where they would make good citizens, and would be welcomed. sure me that I am right in assuming that the 5,000 families to which reference has been made belong to this class-that they are capable people whom any country would welcome, and who, if placed upon the land, would have a reasonable chance to make a good livelihood. I think that General Booth's American experience, and his own practical instincts, have taught him that his scheme would not be successful if men unsupplied with capital were placed on isolated selections in a land with whose climate and methods of agriculture they were unfamiliar His desire is, that although these men need not form colonies, they shall be settled in districts where they may co-operate in the common work of agriculture, and assist each other in their study of the methods necessary to be pursued. scheme been supplied ? already sadd that I can only judge by the statements which General Booth made to me on the occasion of his last visit. I know that this, scheme was then in his mind. He said that thousands of strong, capable, honest families, having no mark against them, and some of them possessing a little money, were annually leaving England, and that his desire was that they should go to the country affording the best opportunities. Australia, to his mind, was one of the countries offering the very best opportunities to immigrants. Its climate and its soils were immense assets, providing splendid opportunities for settlement. why from the old land? I replied, that we were able and willing to do so. He present rates of passage were such that a [106] man's capital might be exhausted in bringing his family to Australia, and that unless assistance were given him, he would be placed on the land without means. He is wise enough to know that to put men down in a new country without knowledge of local conditions, and with insufficient capital to work their land, is The y are not, and the not to give them a fair chance to make a living. These immigrants want, not only He assured me that he was farms, but knowledge, and must be sustained for) a time either by their own capital, or by some means of earning money being placed in their way. General Booth informed me, however, that if they were His officers in Australia asplaced on the land where they could work together, or obtain, employment in the neighbourhood till they had acquired a knowledge of our methods, they would make good Australian agriculturists. I think that is the proposal he has in mind. The only course open to us was to transmit it to the States, because they have the land. But the scheme was a touchstone that has, in two or three weeks, brought home to this country more forcibly than years of argument have done, the difficulty of obtaining land, even for those who are already here. The people who will benefit because of General Booth's proposal will be not only the 5,000 families whom he proposes to send out, but those already here, to whom the land will be made easier of access. It will help on the reform of our land laws. I do not fear the submerged tenth. The men sent out will be selected according to General Booth's own judgment. The selection will be under the supervision No n e whatever. I have of the Agents-General, or others in England authorized by the States to pick out suitable families likely to be successful in Australia. These officers will see that men who would not make a success under fair conditions, or are not fit to face the new circumstances of a new country, are not selected. I have no fear in this regard. My only fear is that our response will be too slow, and that hundreds of thousands who would people our unsettled lands-wh o would face harder conditions when they understood how to face them than most of our own would be prepared to do-wil l be lost to us. What would be prosperity to those who have been brought That being so, he asked up under the severer conditions of the old should we not take these men world would seem hardship to many here. went on to explain that the to the honourable and learned gentleman's colleague.",29,Honourable Member T O What Rience And Considerable Capital He

The document has been printed, and is in the hands of honourable members. Previous Governments have had before them the question of the best, means of providing for the carriage of our mail's oversea, which will always be of importance to Australia. Their efforts have been directed to securing a quick and regular service at the lowest price obtainable, with proper regard for other public needs. L shall not enlarge on tlie benefits and blessings conferred upon the'Commonwealth by such a service, but prefer to place before honourable members some facts which will enable them to judge whether the present agreement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company should be ratified. The difficulties which beset previous Governments in dealing with the question of oversea mail carriage are known, and honourable members, no doubt, proposal is remember the alarm which was expressed when, the last mail contracts expired lest Australia should be left without, regular and efficient means of communication with the old world. Honourable members will be interested to learn the particulars of pastcontracts for the conveyance of mails between .AustBaJia and England. The facts show, that, with the ratification of each new contract, there has been an increase in the speed of the service, and a reduction in the price paid by the people of Australia, this having been due largely The to the advances made by science in regard to the construction of steamers. In view of this fact, while I do not wish to minimize the difficulties which beset the last Government in dealing, with this question, I say frankly that I do not care very much for the agreement which they entered into with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, because I think that, under it, we shall have to pay pretty well for the service which we shall receive. At the same time, it must be remembered that there are occasions, even in private business, when circumstances compel almost any payment to securethe rendering of certain services.",30,Honourable Member T O What Rience And Considerable Capital He

Orient Steam Navigation Company have carried Australian mails under various contracts from August, 1883, to the 31st January, 1905, and since the 4th Apri l of the present year have been carrying the Commonwealth mails under the agreement which I am asking the House to ratify. Previous to 1888, the company, under a contract with New South Wales, was paid 12s. a pound for letters, is. a pound for packets, and 6d. a pound for newspapers, the average annual payment under that poundage arrangement amounting to about £ 5 2 , 0 0 0 , with £ 5 per hour in addition for early arrival, which increased the amount by about £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 , making the total payments to the company about £ 7 1 , 0 0 0 per annum.

That contract was for seven years, and in 1895 it was renewed at the same price for another three years. In 1898 there was a second renewal for a period of seven years, Australia's contribution being reduced by an adjustment of some poundages to £ 7 2 , 0 0 0 per annum. or a fortnightly one? service as we have now. The unfortunate thing about the present agreement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company is that, while the subsidy has been increased, we are not getting the better service that might lie expected. The British Government, in making arrangements with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for the carriage of mails to Australia, secured more speedy transit and a slight redudtion in subsidy, and it is difficult [106]2 to understand why, after all the advances which have been made during the past seventeen years, and the greater facilities which now exist for the economical running of steamers and conveyance of mails, an alarming increase in the subsidy should be required by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. ring? cult to say to what it is due. One authority gives one reason, and another authority a different one. During the last seven years in which we subsidized the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies the time of journey for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was fixed at 686 hours, and that for the Orient Steam Navigation Company at 696 hours. The Jgritish Government provided for a service to the East as well as to Australia, and their total subsidy to the Peninsular and Oriental .'Steam Navigation Company amounted to £ 3 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, or 4s. 7d. per mile; whereas, under the old contract Australia used tb pay 2s. 7d. per mile, but the British Government obtained special advantages in regard to the use of the vessels of the company for naval purposes, 1888 a contract was made beand in other directions, which accounts for the difference. In the new contract between the British Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company there will be a reduction of subsidy amounting to £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 per annum if the contract lasts for the usual term of seven years, which is remarkable in view of the fact that we have had to increase our subsidy to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and the service given by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company has been expedited by twenty-four hours, the and the rate of speed approximately sixteen knots. Under our contract with the Orient Company we have to pay a subsidy which has been increased by £ 3 8 , 0 0 0 per annum, compared with our contribution under the former joint arrangement between the Imperial Government and the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies, which means an increase in the rate per mile from 2s*. 7d. to 3s. 8d.. while the time of journey stipulated for is 696 hours, or thirty-four hours longer than the time of journey agreed",31,Orient Mail Contract

If , instead of agreeing to pay a subsidy, we had determined to pay the ordinary poundage rates3.s. 7d. per lb. for letters and 4^d. per lb. for other articles-it would cost us £15,000 per annum, so that to have had no subsidized contract would have meant a difference of about £80,000. then, to ask the House to ratify this agreement? presently give good reasons for its ratification ; but I think that the facts should first be placed before honourable members, so that they may view the matter from a commercial stand-point, and determine whether they are getting the worth of their money. It is difficult to understand why the amount of subsidy should be increased. The reasons given are an increase in the price of coal, the cost of handling cargo, and dues, and it is also alleged that did not pay for the service rendered. The late Prime Minister stated at the Hobart Conference that the Orient Steam Navigation Company had not been very successful of late, that their dividends had been few and far between, and the percentage of profit very low indeed. to the company as an eleemosynary contribution ? do not 'think that anv such contention would hold good. The company have been carrying on the maii service for many years, and presumably their business has In view of the fact that they have made very little profit, and are getting very little return for their service, it is quite natural that they should ask for a larger subsidy. It has been contended that the increase in the subsidy has been brought about by the stipulation in the contract .for the employment of white labour upon the mail steamers; but this has been emphatically denied by the representatives of the company. The expenditure incurred within the Commonwealth by the two mail companies amounts to at least £200,000 per annum. contending that the companies come here for our good ? not; but I contend that we derive great benefit from the services which are carried on by them. from coming here if there were no subsidy ? question I cannot answer. The necessity for a new contract in 1905 was brought about by the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act for the employment of white labour on mail steamers. The Imperial Government could not, owing to that stipulation, join with us in arranging for a fresh service, and consequently after certain communications had passed between the Commonwealth and the Imperial Government, notice was given of the termination of the existing contract, and tenders were called by this Government for a new service. employment of white labour made a good deal of difference ilio the Orient Steam Navigation Company. the amount given previously Orient Steam Navigation Company deny that. had had the same power of negotiation in London as formerlv, we should have been able to make better terms with the company. to be in as good a position to negotiate here as in London.

Whilst we are making our arrangements for the carriage of mails we cannot ignore the claims of our producers, and we have found it possible to obtain concessions from the mail companies at little or no cost to ourselves. If arrangements for the carriage of produce had to be made apart from the mail contracts, they would involve us in very heavy expenditure. ""Under the old contract Sydney was the terminal port. No stipulation was then made for the carriage of perishables, and, looking at the matter from a commercial standpoint, and realizing that in order to compete successfully with other countries the mail steamers must make provision for the carriage of perishables, it-is, after all, an have extended their service, although they open question whether in framing the conditions of these contracts we are not making too much of the point that Cool storage facilities shall be provided. Every steamer that comes here has cool storage accommodation, and it is absolutely necessary for the mail companies to provide similar facilities for shippers. I have a list of the vessels which trade here, and Which -are furnished with refrigerating chambers, which shows that the total space available is enormous. Although there was no stipulation under the old contract, the Orient Steam Navigation Company, in their own interests, provided cool storage. A clause was inserted in the new contract providing that facilities should be offered for the carriage of perishables. That, however, is one of the advantages for which we should not pay very much,, because, as I have said, the company is compelled in its own interests to comply with the demands of shippers. There was practically no competition when the first tenders were invited. the results of the operations of the shipeasy for the honourable member to say that, but the statement is difficult to prove.

It is, however, remarkable that there was no competition. That appears to have been one of the reasons why a higher subsidy was asked for. The Orient Steam Navigation Company, in the first place, asked for £170,000. They afterwards reduced their tender to £150,000, and would not agree to make any improvements in the service. When my predecessor came to close quarters with the company he wished -them to extend their service to Brisbane, but they stated they could not comply with his request until they could supply another steamer. that the company have since extended the service to Brisbane, although they have not increased their fleet? bave not procured another steamer. It is questionable, however, whether they will be able to carry on with their present resources.

It was first proposed that the contract should be made for the carriage of mails from some Mediterranean port to Adelaide, but the Orient Steam Navigation Company at once said that they wanted to bring their steamers on to Sydney and Melbourne. ger of the company said, "" Surely no one would be idiot enough to suppose that we should sign a contract to carry mails to Adelaide for £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 subsidy, and make that our terminal port. We should want £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 more if -thirty-nine hours ahead of their contract we were required to Stay at Adelaide."" Therefore, as honourable members can see, the extension of the service from Adelaide to Sydney does not cost us a shilling. be made in the contract for the steamers going on to Melbourne and Sydney? the company offered us something for nothing, and we accepted it has confused the issue. haps so. As Postmaster-General, I should have been just as well pleased if a contract had been entered into for the carriage of mails between a Mediterranean port and Adelaide; but in view of the fact that it costs nothing extra, and circumstances may arise to render it desirable that the steamers should continue to go on to Sydney, I think that we were wise to include that provision in the contract. No mails are to be carried by the Orient steamers between Svdney Brisbane. That contract has been entered into purely for trading purposes, and I do not know that we should have any power under the Constitution to appropriate money for the purpose of ' subsidizing that particular service. Mr F'ISHER -D o the mail steamers always carry mails to and from Sydney? steamers always carry to and from Sydney some of the heavier mail matter only, theletters and the more important matter being, carried by train between Adelaide and Sydney. We shall be quite prepared to makea similar arrangement in regard to theBrisbane service. dition which will place us in the same position as the other States. like to point out in regard to the speed of the mail steamers, that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company provide us with a faster service than dothe Orient Steam Navigation Company, and that their boats frequently arrive twenty-four The manahours before the expiration of contract time, that is, fifty-six hours ahead of the Orient Steam Navigation Company's vessels. Averaging the last twelve trips, I find that the boats of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company have arrived timea very creditable performance. On the other hand, the vessels of the Orient Steam Navigation Company have made the voyage upon an average in about twelve hours less than contract time. Each of these companies has nine vessels engaged' in the service. Those of the Orient Because Steam Navigation Company's line are valued at about £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 each, and -those of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company at about £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 each. The tonnage of the vessels belonging to the latter is about 20 per cent, higher than that of the steamers belonging to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. In the light of these figures, one can easily see what a distinct advantage it would be to us if we could enter into a contract with, a company which would carry our mails as speedily as the Peninsular .and Oriental Steam Navigation Company liners carry them under contract with the British postalauthorities. Naturally, we endeavour to -expedite the transit of mails as much as possible, and to this end, when vessels and -arrive ahead of their contract time, we are frequently called upon to provide special! -trains.",34,Orient Mail Contract

We all know the history of the tate our commercial relations with the old country. rities run special trains north from Mel'Lourne? quently run special trains to Sydney. The subsidy paid to the Orient Steam Navigation Company is lower than the Vancouver subsidy, which represents about 4s. 7d. per of their stringent character. For example, -mile. The rate of speed of the vessels be the company wished to claim poundage upon longing to the latter company is approximately thirteen or fourteen knots. It has been stated that the Governments of other countries pay higher subsidies than we do, and the action of the French and German authorities has been quoted in this connection. But I would point out that the subsidies in question are not paid for the carriage of mails alone, and -consequently a fair comparison cannot be instituted. The amounts which we have paid fo the Orient Steam Navigation Company and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company aggregate £2,780,000. On looking through the official papers, I find that, when the late Government were considering tenders, they intimated that no tender which was not based upon the payment of a subsidy of £100,000 annually would be entertained, and then only if certain conditions which provided for improved accommodation for perishable products, and for a faster service, were complied with. aware, the experiment was tried of carrying the mails upon the poundage system. That system proved to be unsatisfactory. satisfactory because we cannot insure a regular service, and because we cannot conhave been necessary to forward them across trol the vessels carrying our mails in the way that we can if they are bound to run to a certain time-table, to travel at a speconsiderable. cified rate of speed, and to call at certain ports. We all recollect the outcry which was raised when one of the Orient Steam Navigation Company's steamers did not -call at Adelaide. People became alarmed lest their mails should be delayed at cerwe set out to obtain, such as a faster sertain places. that there has been no increase in the rate of speed of the vessels during the past eight years ? negotiations which led up to the present contract. After much' conferring, an arrangement was arrived at between the Government and the Orient Steam Navigation Company, under which the former were to pay a subsidy of £120,000 per annum. The Orient Steam Navigation Company had previously submitted conditions which the late Postmaster-General could not entertain, because all mails carried by their vessels, they desired settlements to be made in Londonindeed, they wished to have everything their own way. In. my opinion, the conditions which they formulated were most unfair, and the late Postmaster-General would have acted very unwisely if he had acceded to them. About that time we know that an offer was received from Messrs. Seott, Fell, and Co., an Australian firm, to run a line of steamers as far as Bombay or Colombo. After due consideration, the Cabinet rejected that proposal, although the price stipulated would have meant to the Commonwealth £17,000 less than the subsidy ""demanded by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. In connection with that offer, a very important factor which had to be considered was that of the transhipment of our mails and produce at one of the ports I have mentioned. The transhipment of the mails did not present an insuperable difficulty, but the same remark is scarcely applicable to the transhipment of our produce. As honourable members are Under the conditions which the Orient Steam Navigation Company desired to obtain, that company would have been enabled to collect, upon the poundage system, about £25,000 per annum, and our parcels would only have been carried as far as Naples. Had that condition been agreed to, it would) the Continent and to pay for this service.

It is difficult to understand why there was not more competition for the contract. It seems to me that one reason for this was that there was not sumcient time at the disposal of the Government to enter into an advantageous contract. In dealing with future contracts, I hope that plenty of time will be allowed. No doubt we shall then be able to obtain very much better terms. new contract has been accepted? have ratified this contract, ample time should be allowed to call for fresh tenders.

Honourable members have asked,;, "" Why should we ratify the existing contract ? '""' In reply I ask, "" What will happen if we do not ratify it? Shall we be in a position to make better terms than those which were made by the late Government?"" I admit at once that the present contract is not satisfactory. WhilstI ask the House to ratify it, I think"" we shall be acting wisely if, before the 30th January next, we give the Orient Steam Navigation Company notice of our intention to terminate it. The contract is for a period of nearly three years, and if we desire that it shall expire at the end of that time-that is, in January, 1908-w e must give notice of our intention, prior to 30th of January, 1906. If we do that, we shall have ample time in which to invite fresh tenders, and to induce competition amongst those who are willing to undertake the carriage of our mails. I ask the House to ratify the existing contract, because, until that is done, the Orient Steam Navigation Company cannot get any money for the services which it has rendered. should pay the amount due. not do so until the contract has been ratime that the agreement in question, was fied. When the agreement was entered into, it was pointed out that no money could be paid until Parliament had approved of it.

At the present time there is a sum of £50,000 in London, which will be paid to that company immediately this proposal is agreed to by the Parliament. have to pay for the services performed, even if the contract be not ratified. so; but I would point out that it is an open question as to what the company made. I sympathize with the Orient Steam Navigation Company in its present position, because £50,000 is a very large sum to have locked up. Some objection has been taken to this motion by the honourable 1 member for Oxley. He has indicated his intention to submit an amendment providing that Brisbane shall be made a port of call. Hobart as a. port of call. has as much right to be considered in this matter as has Queensland. I could easily understand the application of the Queensland Government, if the proposal of the honourable member for Oxley related to a mail contract. If we are to become a party to the agreement which has been entered into with the Orient Steam Navigation Company by the Queensland authorities, we certainly shoulcr have been consulted in some way, especially as that agreement does not relate to a mail contract. By-no stretch of imagination can it be contended that it does. Does.the honourable member for Oxley imagine that it is our duty to subsidize a line of steamers for trade purposes between Sydney and Brisbane?

For many years, Queensland and New South Wales bore the cost of the Vancouver mail service, but the Commonwealth Government have now decided that the service shall be paid for, on a per capita basis, by all the States. Under the contributes the cost of the contract with Orient Steam Navigation Company, but instead of paying £ 1 0 , 2 2 7 per annum towards the Vancouver mail subsidy she will now have to pay only £ 3 , 4 8 6 per annum. The total amount provided in connection with the Orient Steam Navigation Company's mail service for 1905-6 is £ i 2 0 , 4 7 o, made up as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £ 4 4 , 1 0 0 ; Victoria, £ 3 6 , 5 5 0 ; Queensland, £ 1 5 , 7 6 0 ; South Australia, £ 1 1 , 2 6 0 ; Western Australia, £ 7 , 3 5 0 ; and Tasmania, £ 5 , 4 5 0 . If the Commonwealth took over the contract which Queensland has recently entered into with' the Orient Steam Navigation Company, a very small moiety of the annual subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 would be borne by that State. I say, first of all, that the Queensland contract is undoubtedly not one for the carriage of mails; and, secondly, that the Commonwealth Government was .not consulted in reference to it. If Queensland seriously considered that it was a Commonwealth undertaking, surely she would have asked the Commonwealth to endeavour to make the best possible arrangements. Government refused to do so. we asked to do so? putation waited on the late Government and urged them to take action, with a view to making Brisbane a port of call under the Commonwealth mail contract with the It is the most impudent Orient Steam Navigation Company. enough that I should have to answer for the sins of the present Government. vernment consider the Queensland contract is not one for the carriage df mails that IJhey object to take it over? that the contract is not for fhe carriage of mails, and that it would be unconstitutional for the Commonwealth Government to give I a preference to any State. For these, as well as for other good reasons, the Government cannot see their way clear to pay the Queenslandi subsidy or any portion of it. The contention has been raised that the Commonwealth contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company provides for the carriage of certain postal matter oetween Adelaide and present arrangement, Queensland Sydney. I have only to say that if any £15,711 per annum to postal matter were carried by these steamers the between Sydney and Brisbane, the Government would be prepared to pay for the service so rendered. Such a payment, however, would be so small as to be hardly worKh considering. I think I have given very good reasons for the attitude taken up by the Government. We are in sympathy with the honourable member for Oxley, and are anxious, as far as possible, to prevent friction between the Commonwealth and the States. We are ready to adopt a conciliatory policy when it is reasonable and fair to do so; but I do not think any one would seriously contend that the Commonwealth should take over the contract arranged by the Queensland"" Government. If we did 'do so, we should have to pay not only the subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 per annum, but for various concessions in regard to quarantine, ^wharfage dues, and other matters, which would considerably swell the total.

Even when I have asked them privately for information I have had to force it from them. support from me if they withhold information. that any distinction is made between members on this side of the House and those sitting on the Opposition benches in regard to furnishing information is absolutely, without foundation, and the honourable member knows it. I have found by experience that Ministers are not very ready to give information with regard to the mail contract. Commonwealth should take over the obligations of the Queensland Government in regard to the extension of the mail service from Sydney to Brisbane. I do not ask a favour, but desire the recognition of a right. When the honourable member for Maranoa joined me in waiting on the Prime Minister in regard to this matter, he took the stand that Queensland had a right to be placed on the same footing as the other States. Affairs take the same view? time, and I do not see how he could very well have changed his views. The Treasurer has already committed himself to supporting my motion. On 5th September the following telegram was published in the Brisbane Courier:In the course of an interview to-day the Federal Treasurer, Sir John Forrest, referred to the arrangement entered into by the Queensland Government with the Orient Company for steamers belonging to that line to call at Brisbane. "" I notice,"" he said, "" that the Queensland Government is to pay the Orient Company ,£26,000 for this service, and I do not think it is an extravagant sum."" The right honourable gentleman does not consider the sum an extravagant one. and T do nof suppose that the Postmaster-General would have been able to secure any more reasonable terms. 'gentleman went on to sayI think there is a great deal to say in favour of this demand. wards the cost of our mail contract with the Orient Company, and Brisbane is the only capital which derives no direct benefit from the Commonwealth subsidy. I certainly think Queensland can make out a good case for assistance in carrying out the agreement she recently made with the Orient Company. Sir JOHN P'ORREST I do not admit the accuracy of that report. I had a casual conversation with a press representative, and that is probably the outcome of it. presents the right honourable gentleman as having taken the reasonable view I should have expected of him. I claim that the Government should take over this extended service, because it is only just that Queensland should share with other States the benefits of the'mail service in regard to the carriage of cargo. The mail steamers should call at the capitals of each of the States. The Queensland Government have relieved the Commonwealth authorities of the trouble of making the contract, and have made everything smooth for them. There is a very strong feeling in Queensland in regard to this matter, and very much resentment has been expressed at the way in which that State has been treated by the Commonwealth. In this connection I desire to refer to a report of a public meeting which was recently held in Brisbane to discuss matters relating to the extension of the mail serviceA largely attended meeting of representatives of the Brisbane Chambers of Commerce, Manufactures, and Agriculture, the National Agricultural and Industrial Association, the Employers' Association, the Pastoralists' Association, the Brisbane Produce Merchants' Association, the butter industry, Brisbane Traders' Association, Warehousemen's Association, and other industries, was held in the Chamber of Commerce room, Courier-building, yesterday afternoon, to consider the conditions of tenders for the new mail contract as decided upon by the Federal Cabinet, and to protest against Brisbane not being included as a port of call. Honourable members can imagine the keen interest taken in this matter when it is stated that 'the commodious room of the Chamber of Commerce was filled by business men in the middle of the dayA communication was received from the Hatton Vale Farmers' Progress Association, intimating that it was decided at a recent meeting to write to the Chamber of Commerce urging that body to use their best endeavours in having The right honourable Brisbane made a port of call for mail steamers in all mail contracts to be arranged; also stating that the benefit which would accrue to the bacon, dairv. and other industries called for a Queensland pays her share tostrenuous effort being made in the direction indicated.

255,Mr R. Edwards,"The report redemanded the earnest attention of all sections of the producing and trading interests. He hoped the meeting would show its disapproval of the treatment'meted out to Queensland by the Federal Government in no uncertain voice. From the inception of Federation, Queensland had been treated as a negligible quantity, and the time had arrived when they should enter their protest against the same. The Federal Government had no excuse for ignoring Queensland as it had done, and if ""it had any intention of being just to the State, the case in point afforded them an opportunity of doing so. He alluded to the efforts made by the State Government and the Chamber of Commerce, through Mr R. Edwards, M.H.R., to obtain common justice for Queensland in regard to the mail service, but they had all been in vain. They would have to pay their share towards the cost of a service from which they would not receive any benefit. The Mayor moved the first resolution, as follows :"" That this meeting, representative of the pastoral, agricultural, commercial, and industrial interests of Queensland, hereby places on record its strongest protest against the action of the Federal Cabinet in net directly including Brisbane as a port of call in the tenders for the new mail contract."" He said if it were only a mail contract, it would not have made such a great difference, but with the absolute fact before them that these mail steamers carried produce as well, it was patent that a serious injustice was being done to Queensland in calling for alternative tenders. The Federal Government had failed to show that it had any intention to do justice to Queensland, and the time had now arrived when they should raise their voices in protest. Mr Carter submitted the second resolution, which read as follows :"" That the actual benefit derived from these services-as a mail contract -cease s on the vessel reaching Adelaide, whence mails are carried by railway, and if alternative tenders are called at all, they should stipulate (a) price for mails delivered at Adelaide, (b) extra cost for vessels proceeding from Adelaide to Melbourne, (f)""extra cost for vessels proceeding from Melbourne to Sydney, and (d) extra cost for vessels proceeding from Sydney to Brisbane."" In speaking to the resolution, the mover gave it as his opinion that the present Federal Government would soon be wiped out of existence, and a new one would come into power, which would legislate for the weal of the States. He considered that they would have no reason to regret Federation if they were only treated fairly, as he believed good results must attend the unification of the various States. With regard to the arrangements for the carrying out of the proposed mail contract, they were anything but fair to Queensland, inasmuch as Adelaide would be the last port of call, and the other States benefiting thereby would not be called upon to pay anything extra as their share towards the expense of the same. On the other hand, if the alternative tender were accepted for the contract, Queensland would very likely be asked to pay the extra cost. This was grossly unfair, and they should not tolerate such treatment at the hand of the Federal Government. Mr Brentnall seconded the resolution, and referred in adverse terms to the way the interests of Queensland had been ignored by the Barton Government. It was for them to say Mr R. Edwards. now that they would not put up with any further injustice at their hands. The resolution was carried. Mr Arthur, in moving the third resolution"" That any contract for the new mail service which does not directly include Brisbane as a port of call is a grave injustice to ana"" neglect of the rights of this State to equal opportunities with the other States in the development of its industries in accordance with clause gS of the Constitution Act,"" said that they had been misled by the glib promises made by Mr Barton on the occasion of his visit to this State, nil of which had been broken. As their interests were being entirely ignored, it behoved them to rise up in arms against such treatment. He referred to the action of Mr Edwards in crossing the floor of the House of Representatives,, and said that it should have the effect of bringing Mr Barton to his senses. He was pleased to say lhat all shades of public opinion were unanimous on the point that a grave injustice was being done to Queensland in regard to the calling of the tenders for the mail contract. Mr Welsby seconded, and Mr Sumner supported, the resolution, which was carried. Mr Denham moved the fourth resolution"" That the primary producing interests of this State and their unquestionable and rapid expansion in the near future make it imperative that Queensland should have the. same facilities of quick ocean transport as enjoyed by the Southern States."" He referred to the growing importance of the agricultural districts of the State, and the great strides made by the various industries connected therewith. There was an urgent necessity for affording producers an opportunity of sending their surplus produce to the home markets, and the only way to do this was by the Federal Government allowing them to take advantage of the P. and O. mail service. Few in Brisbane realized the great possibilities of the agricultural districts of this State, and the only thing wanted to make them boom was a little encouragement, such as they were now asking for. They did not wantto be treated in any way different to the other States, but they simply asked for common justice. The resolution was seconded by Mr Sinclair,, and carried. Mr Reid moved the fifth resolution-""That the port of Brisbane offers shipping facilities equal to any of the Southern ports, and is able to accommodate the largest oversea shipping."" From the above report honourable members will gather how anxious the commercial community of Brisbane were at that time, and I can assure them that the same anxietv is manifest to-day. I do hope that the Government will reconsider this question. If they are averse to taking over from the Queensland authorities the entire subsidy of £26,000 per annum, I trust that they will be just enough to shoulder at least a portion of the burden. The day following that upon which the public meeting to which I have directed attention was held, a leading article appeared in the Brisbane Courier, pany should not be taken over by the from which I make the following extract:There is no mistaking the feeling aroused in £16,000 per annum for the carriage of AusQueensland by the attitude of the Federal Government in the matter of the new mail contract. tralian mails as' far as Adelaide.

Unfortunately he the Commonwealth shall not give preference to did not go far enough. When he asserted that one State over another. I maintain that the subsidies which are at present being pai'd by Queensland to the ' Orient Steam Navigation Company and to the Vancouver line should be reduced unless the Commonwealth is prepared to take over this liability of £26,000 per annum. It is scarcely necessary to point out that Queensland will be called upon to contribute her share of the £30,000 which has been voted by this House for the erection of a .telephone fine between Melbourne and Sydney, despite the fact that that line will prove of very little advantage to her. Under these circumstances, why should not the other States shoulder some portion of the responsibility for the payment of this £26,000 per annum? member in favour of granting trade subsidies all round tfie Commonwealth? question than I should like to answer at a moment's notice.

Queensland already pays Since of Federation, the That the amendment be amended by the insercertain statements were made by the representatives of the company to ""the late Postmaster-General, I think that he might well have gone further, and have given more than the bare statement that, in the course of the negotiations in regard to this contract, his predecessor was informed by the company that if Brisbane were made a port of call, it would be necessary for them to add another steamer to the service. As a matter of fact, under the agreement made with the Government of Queensland, the company is now sending its vessels on to Brisbane, and apparently does not intend to make any addition to its Australian fleet. It seems to me that the assertion that an additional steamer would be required was nothing more than a piece of bluff, and that the late Postmaster General might well have played a better game.

I am afraid that there is no reason to believe that such would have been the result. that view, I would point out that in June last the leader of the late Government received a liberal application of soft soap at the hands of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, but that nothing of advantage to Queensland eventuated. On the occasion in question, the president of the Chamber informed his fellow members that he understood that the Prime Minister would shortly visit Brisbane, and that he considered it desirable to ask him to meet them. was certainly a proper attitude to take up, derived but little advantage from the free application of soft soap that took place.

If he really wished to soft soap fhe Parliament, that was a distinct oversight. This, however, is merely by the way.. master-General, that, as the result of the payment of this subsidy, something like £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 goes to the Commonwealth in the way of increased business, militates against the acceptance of the contract as it stands. The point is, that that business goes only to the ports of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and that Queensland benefits nothing in this regard. Tasmania. a strong leason why the Commonwealth should see that Queensland and Tasmania receive fair treatment under the contract. I thank the Postmaster-General for having mentioned the matter, and so furnished me with an argument against the ratification of the contract in. its present form. I and. have shown how Queensland is disadvantaged under the present arrangement. The fact that there was no comrjetition for the service is, in itself, significant. It indicates that there is something in the shape of a combine, which prevents others from coming in and competing for the contract. Queensland has had some experience of the working of this combine, Orient [REPRESENTATIVES.] Mail Contract. for the combine actually blocks the vessels of the Aberdeen line from continuing to In support of call at Brisbane, and compels them to refrain from carrying cargo ""for Brisbane beyond Sydney, so that they run empty to that port to p'ick up cargo. It is imperative that we should endeavour, as speedily as possible, to break down the ring. The excuse made by the Postmaster-General, that the contract into which Queensland has entered with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, does not relate to the carriage of mails, is a somewhat remarkable one, in view of the fact that we are asked to That ratify a contract for a service, not merely to Adelaide, but to Melbourne and Sydney. but Queensland appears to . have The condition that the vessels of the Orient' Steam Navigation Company shall go on from Adelaide to Melbourne and Sydney forms part of the mail contract We might reasonably say that the contract should provide for Brisbane being included as a port of Ministry; but the president call for mails as well as for parcels. I am sure that honourable members will do their duty, and assist the representatives of Queensland to secure the extension of this service to Brisbane, so that the people of that State, equally with those of the The argument used by ihe Postother States, may share in the benefits to be derived from it .

I quite agree that Postmaster-General or any of his officers or agents Tasmania is entitled to equal consideration, shall from time to time and at any time or times and that the vessels of the company should require to be conveyed. call at Hobart as well as at Brisbane. Some reference has been made to the time occupied in carrying mails between Naples and Adelaide. the Orient liners is almost the same as that voyage from Naples to Adelaide as aforesai'i of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navistart gation Company's boats, and yet the latter intended to be delivered at that port continue her company provides a quicker service.

I think that those extracts show that the contract is a contract for a mail service, under which steamers have to come, not to Adelaide only, but right through to Sydney, and we ask that their journey shall be extended to Brisbane. It is a pity that the late Postmaster-General and the present Postmaster-General have not shown sufficient stiffness in dealing with Mr David Reid. I have shown how he tried to bluff the Commonwealth by asking first for a subsidy of £170,000 per annum, then for a subsidy of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, finally agreeing to accept a subsidy of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, so that what stiffness was exhibited resulted in a saving to the Commonwealth of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. It is a pity that we have not at the' head of affairs here a man who would be equal to the position, as the late Sir Charles Lilley proved himself to be under similar circumstances in Queensland. General should have administered an emetic to the agent of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, such as Sir Charles Lilley about sixteen years .ago administered on a similar occasion to the representatives of a steam-ship company who were asking exorbitant payment for the carriage of mails. the honourable member did not advocate that policy when the tenders were first received. always advocated it. advocated then. Mr Culfin. ley was in power in Queensland, and a steam-ship company asked him an exorbitant price for the carriage of mails, instead of toadying to them, he threatened to run a Government line of steamers, and actually bought a vessel for use in the service.

278,Mr Culpin,"I trust that honorableThat would be impossible under an agreement of this character. The Commonwealth would have a whip in its hand, which might be of great use to us. to oppose the ratification of the contract on more grounds than have been mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane. Of course, I have the same grievance as they have in respect of the way in which Queensland has been treated; but, beyond that, I think that under this contract Australia as a whole is paying too dearly for her whistle. As the Postmaster-General himself has admitted, instead of obtaining an improved service for an increased price, we have made no progress in that regard. orable gentleman declared that the late Postmaster-General yielded to a pressing demand to come to terms in some way or other in order that communication with other parts of the world might be maintained on something like the same terms as have prevailed for the last seventeen or eighteen years. But an analysis of that clamour would have shown that it was not so intense after all, and that the little delay which took place through the use of the poundage system was not such as to warrant us in spending £ 3 8 , 0 0 0 more for a service than we had hitherto been paying. Last week the honourable member for Barrier, in a very interesting speech dealing with shipping and the mail service, used some wise and, in my opinion, rather telling arguments against yielding to the demands of the Orient Steam Navigation Company. To me it seems to be most humiliating that the Commonwealth of Australia should go on its knees to any shipping company for a service which it could obtain by adopting the suggestion of the honourable member for Barrier, and by chartering ships of its own. times more expensive than the present system. the figures quoted by the honourable member for Barrier, not as minutely as he himself clid. but with sufficient closeness to convince me that there is a good deal of truth in his contention. He said, in the course of his remarks, that the £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum which we are paving as a subsidy to the Orient Steam Navigation Company for a fortnightly service would have provided interest at the rate of 3 per cent, on a capital of L £ 3 , 4 2 8 , 0 0 0 ; and he argued that for such an annual expenditure we should be able to place on the water a fleet equivalent to that of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and still have available for other purposes £ 1 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0. come from if the Commonwealth is to continue its non-borrowing policy ? terest, as compared with what we now pay, would more than justify our taking the proposed step. for ship-building at 3 per cent. ? 1 brokerage charges and other expenses would make the amount of interest more The honthan 3 per cent, on the whole. 1 sinking fund, and provision for wear and tear? member for Barrier provided for that. He showed that he was dealing merely with the cost of the steamers. But he dealt with the expense of running the boats, and saidWe could handle a fleet representing a tonnage of 100,000 for ^750,000 per annum. Included in this amount would be an allowance of 5 per cent, for depreciation.

291,Mr Wilkinson,"I am taking theEngland and the Continent, and the Commonwealth line of steamers might reasonably expect to secure the whole of the Government freights. Further on, he saidEvidence was given before the Butter Commission that there would be no difficulty in securing a guarantee for ^'300,000 worth of butter freight . . . Mr Evans, the Premier of Tasmania, has stated that there would be very little difficulty in securing a guarantee for from ^50,000 to ;£ 100,000 worth of freight in connection with the fruit export trade. If these statements be correct, a State-owned shipping service would be able to start off with the advantage of the subsidy of £120,000, and guarantees of Government freights from London representing ^80,000, butter freights amounting to ,£300,000, and fruit freights amounting to ,£100,000, which would yield an assured income of ;£6oo,ooo per annum. Honourable members will observe that no allowance is made in this calculation for the export of wool, wheat, sugar, hams, bacon, and frozen meat, which are very large items that may be expected to increase in the near future. We have abundant evidence that throughout the Commonwealth the production of articles of export is very largely increasing-in some instances to a phenomenal extent. Therefore, the figures I have quoted cannot be said to exaggerate the position of affairs. I do not ignore the fact that before the Commonwealth could have procured, by charter or otherwise, a fleet of steamers, a considerable time would have elapsed; but I contend that we should not have suffered very greatly during the interval, even if it had been necessary to pay for the carriage of the mails upon the bounty system. I am sensible .of the importance of having our mails delivered as speedily as possible, in order to minimize the disadvantages attaching to our remoteness from the more populous centres of the world; but we may, as in the present case, pay too much for the benefit derived. The idea of'the Commonwealth becoming steam-ship owners and common carriers by sea has been scouted in some quarters; but I would point out that if the Commonwealth embarked upon the business of oversea carriers we should be merely extending the principle already adopted in the States in connection with land carriage. The expenditure involved in carrying out such an enterprise, large as it might appear, would be a mere bagatelle as compared with the money invested by the States in the business of common carriers. the States had spent upon railways £132,000,000. Mr Wilkinson. in order to provide means of transport from point to point within the Commonwealth; and I contend that if it Le advisable and proper for the States to become common carriers upon land, there is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from entering upon the business of transporting goodsby sea. money spent upon the railways intended to> open up the country ? tend that the benefits to be derived from a thoroughly efficient service for the carriage of mails and cargo would be quite as great as those which have been conferred by the railways. The working expenses of the railways of Australia represent an annual expenditure of £7,127,887, a sum far beyond the amount which would be required to provide Australia with a mail service equal to that which is now carried on by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and the Orient Steam Navigation Companies combined. Some persons would like to see the whole of our railways handed over to private persons, but I venture to say that 99 out of every 100 citizens of the Commnowealth would be opposed to any such idea. companies would not open up the country, but would merely seek to make as much profit as they could. what is now being done in America, and the mail companies are worked upon the same principle. They do not come here for our benefit, but for the sake of the profit they can make out of us. I do not think that the Government is called upon to work its utilities for profit. The object should be to confer the maximum of advantage upon the people as a whole, and not to secure profit in the shape of a substantial cash balance in the Treasury. Those who advocate the transfer of the States railways to private ownership always point to the fact that they are being worked at a loss; but the fact'that they are not returning sufficient to defray the workingexpenses and interest charges on the capital does not necessarily afford evidence that they have not proved a profitable investment.

That iswould otherwise have remained unproductive. lar character could be conferred upon us by a Commonwealth line of steamers. that a thoroughly efficient service of steamers would offer substantial advantages to our producers. The country lying at the back, inland from Cairns, would never have been occupied but for the service of steamers which connects Cairns with the larger centres of population in Australia. ber does not advocate that the mail steamers should call at Cairns? people of Queensland do not ask for anything more than is reasonable. If Queensland had been divided into two or three States-as I believe it eventually will the papers. be--w e should have been entitled to ask that the mail steamers should call at each of our capitals. at all export centres, including Rockhampton, Newcastle, Warrnambool, and so on ? Mr W/ILKIN-SON -If that line of argument were adopted, the mail steamers would have to call at Twofold Bay and a score of other places. We are not asking for anything of that kind. Some honourable members may think that it is not fair to ask that the mail steamers should go on to Brisbane; but we think that we are placing a perfectly reasonable proposition before the House. We do not come here to crawl on behalf of Queensland; but I hope that so long as we are of opinion, as I am, that Queensland has not been fairly treated in this matter, we shall not fail to make our views known. I agree with the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane that had tenders been called for a mail service terminating at Adelaide, Queensland would have had no cause for grievance. better to pass Adelaide, and come straight on to Melbourne? have been raised by the representatives of South Australia to the claim made by Queensland, and it may be well to point out that Mr Anderson, the manager of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, stated that if the subsidy were not granted, the vessels of the company would cease to call at Adelaide. It was reckoned that it would cost the company £5,000 a year to call at Adelaide. Who is paying that money ? ing part of it. does not pay very much, unless she gets a quid fro quo. Sydney would like to monopolize the whole trade of the Commonwealth, but, fortunately, other ports in Australia are now known. I wish to draw attention to a matter which seems to have been overlooked, even by the Postmaster General. In the paper which was laid upon the table, we find copies of the tenders, arid the conditions of the contract laid down, but we do not find a condition which was submitted by the honourable member for Denison when he was Postmaster-General. tation, I think, was the one which was issued by the honourable member for Coolgardie, when he invited alternative tenders for a purelv mail service. ( A.

306,Mr Wilkinson,"The fairest invicontract was finally entered into by the late Government, which we are asked by the present Government toratify. I believe that the Postmaster-General voiced the opinion of the majority, if not the whole, of the Government, when he said he did not think that Queensland had a case, inasmuch as she entered into a contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company without appealing to the Commonwealth Government. Not only by the deputation mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley, but time after time the Commonwealth Government was appealed to, not to give Queensland any concession which was not justly her due, but to do common justice to her. By deputation, by letters, which the Minister will find in his office, and frequently by references in this House, the claims of Queensland were set forth, but, so far, they have been practically ignored. As a last resort, in order that her products might be conveyed to the other side of the ' world on terms of equality with those of other States, she was"" forced into making an arrangement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company to send their, boats on to Brisbane, which they said they could not do without having another steamship built, but which they have done after having lost one of the steamships they had when they, made that statement.. Queensland would,'not expect, and I do not think she does expect, the Commonwealth to reimburse her the whole of the charges which are being made. But I contend that had the Commonwealth Government insisted, upon Brisbane being made one of the ports of call when the contract for a part mail and part cargo service was entered into, the extended service to Queensland could have been obtained for very much less than the sum for which it is being obtained. The Postmaster-General said. I think, that the Federal subsidy is at the rate of about 3s. 8d. permile. For the service between Sydney and Brisbane, Queensland is paying at the rate of i.6s. 8d. a mile. At least some consideration might have been given to her position when, tenders were being invited, because, even although the Federal subsidy of £120,000 might have been increased by about £5,000 for sending the boats the extra distance, Queensland, instead of giving a subsidy of £26,000 a year, with all the other concessions it gives cheaply as oossible. At the same time. I to the company, would have saved about £19,000. Mr Wilkinson. would have been a very small item indeed, when it was divided amongst all the States. I do not think that. Queensland has been selfish in her dealings with the Commonwealth. I know it will be said that she has, obtained a goodi deal from the Commonwealth in the shape of the sugar bounty. That, however, was Australia's affair, not Queensland's. It was not given to encourage the sugar-growers of Queensland, but to get a white Australia. The sugar industry in that State was getting along all right, but Australia determined upon a white Australia. So that the bonus was not given to encourage the sugar industry. I ask honourable members not to forget that fact when they taunt the representatives of Queensland witfj advocating what they consider to be her just claims. Those who listened to the honourable member for Oxley must have noticed that on the deputation to the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General of the day there were honourable members representing every State in the Commonwealth. The Queensland representatives did not stand alone on that occasion. They were supported by representatives of the other States in. each House of the Parliament, because they recognised that Queensland had a claim upon the Commonwealth for consideration. The Postmaster-General leads us toi believe that it will not be recognised. If some consideration be not given to Queensland in this matter, I am quite sure that not only the representativesbut the people of Queensland generally will believe that they liave a. legitimate grievance against the Commonwealth Parliament and Government. bane included in the ports of call? want to know. ber think that the arrangement under which the mail steamers call at Melbourne and Sydney is a bad one?

I hope that honourable members will vote for the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Oxley -During this discussion reference has been made to the Vancouver mail service. be glad, indeed, if it were possible, without delaying the return trip of the vessels engaged in that service to enable them to call at the chief port of each State of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately those ports do riot lie in their line of route as do the capitals of the various States in that of the English mail steamers. When this matter was under consideration some time ago it was pointed out-as reference to Hansard will show that the Orient Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers are compelled to lie for nine days at Sydney before they can commence their return journey. Within that period it 'is quite possible for them to proceed to Pinkenba to discharge their cargo there, and to take in fresh cargo. mark would apply to the vessels of the Vancouver service. that the steamers of the Vancouver line can visit the ports of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, without incurring any loss of time, I am quite prepared to extend the resulting advantage to those ports. ports well served already? has been suggested by the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane that the high subsidy which is demanded by the Orient Steam Navigation Company is due to the existence of a shipping "" ring."" I quite agree with them. Some one has said that it is easy to make a statement of that character, but difficult to prove it. To my mind we have already been afforded proof that a shipping ""ring"" is operating in Australia. When the Queensland Government entered into an arrangement with the Aberdeen line for the carriage of perishable produce, this ""ring"" brought pressure to bear upon that company, with the result that its vessels discharged their cargo in Sydney. Their cargo had to be transhipped to coastal boats at that port, and conveyed thence to Brisbane. It is clear that the Commonwealth is being prevented by a shipping "" ring "" from making the best possible terms with, other companies. I am aware that there is an impression abroad that Queensland has a British-India service. That is not so. When she did enjoy the benefits.. of that service, she paid for the whole of itI should It was a Torres Straits service, and I suppose that it helped the whole of the States to open up markets in the East. Queensland has never gone cap in hand to the other States, nor is she likely to adopt that attitude upon rhe present occasion. We never anticipated that the whole of this subsidy of ,£26,000"" per annum would be borne by the Commonwealth, but we do contend that some portion of it should be paid by the other States, whose burdensQueensland shares. surprised at some of the statements which, have been made by the honourable member for Moreton. It seems to me that he has lost sight of one fact, namely, that the existing mail contract is practically a renewal of the old service. It is quite true that we are paying an increased subsidy, but it is nevertheless a fact that the present service was practically taken over by the Commonwealth when Federation was established. Under the old service, each State was obliged to pay a certain proportion of the mail subsidy, and each State now contributes as it did formerly. The honourable member for Moreton has declared that it cost the Orient Steam Navigation Company £5,000 per annum to make Adelaide a port of call, It thus leaving honourable members to infer that that loss was borne by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, it was borne by the people of South Australia. If the present agreement beratified, the subsidy will be paid in exactly the same way that it has always been paid. But whenthis House is asked to assent to an increased subsidy of £26.000 for the exclusive benefit of Queensland, we are invited to make an entirely new departure. Under the circumstances, I am bound to oppose tfie amendment of the honorable member for Oxley. The honourable member for Darwin desires that Hobart -should also be made a port of call by our English mail steamers.

We are well served at present by vessels trading; between New Zealand and England, which call at Hobart during the winter and spring, while, during the summer months-whe n the apple . trade is in full swing-the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation and Orient Companies, as well as those of other lines, call there for our fruit, quite irrespective of any subsidy. Queensland pays nearly £16,000 per annum towards the cost of the mail subsidy, and she now very coolly asks the other States to join with her in paying an increased subsidy of £26,000 per annum. Tasmania now pays something like* £6,000 towards the mail subsidy, and if the Orient Steam Navigation Company were asked to make Hobart a port of call they would probably require an additional payment! of £8,000 for a service which would be absolutely useless to that State. Every penny that is wasted by the .Commonwealth in this and other directions is deducted from the amount which is returnable to the States. In these circumstances, Tasmania would be in a much better position if the £8,000 to which I .have referred were paid direct to her rather than devoted to a service which she does riot require. Another point to which I desire to call attention is that,under the mail contract, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney have been ports of call for a number of years. We are dealing with a proposal to continue the old service, and to include Brisbane in the port of call under the contract would be to"" totally alter the character of the present service. of progress.

The suggestion that Hobarb should also be made a port of call is merely an attempt to throw a herring across the trail, and is one to which I and all other representatives of Tasmania, who have considered the question in all its bearings, must certainly object. At the present time, the English mails are landed in Adelaide, and are sent direct by rail to Melbourne, whence they are shipped to Launceston, and from there -carried on by rail to Hobart. It is the quickest service that we could obtain under any circumstances.

Those who are such sticklers for the maintenance of the rights and privileges of the Federal Parliament should scout the proposal that the Commonwealth should take over the Queensland contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. That contract is a direct interference with the privileges of the Federal Parliament. The Government of Queensland assert that they have repeatedlv asked the Federal Parliament to assist them in this direction, and that their requests have been ignored. Be that as it may, they entered into a contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company to pay £26,000 per annum for the privilege of Brisbane being made a port of call, and they now have the assurance to ask the other States to share the liability. Has not Queensland been treated liberally enough by the Commonwealth ? sugar bonus. I do not know whether the people of Queensland . desire it, but the fact remains that the other States have been deprived of much revenue by reason of the sugar tariff.

We are consequently hearing in this House of the grievances of New South Wales. Some honourable members speak of New South Wales, and nothing else. I think I have shown conclusively, in reply to the honourable member for Moreton, that Adelaide, at any rate, is under no compliment to the other States for having been made a port of call. This, however, is not the proper time to deal' with such proposals. If the people of Queensland are desirous of getting another bonus, they will, no doubt, not be forgotten when this kindly Government has under its consideration again the subject of bonuses. I ask the representatives of the State, however, not to press the amendment to a division, because it would be unfair to the other States to try to bring it into force. We are always willing to help Queensland when we can, but there is no reason why the other States should be roasted on this occasion. In the course of his speech, the Postmaster-General stated that the £120,000 which is to be paid to the Orient Steam Navigation Company under this contract is in consideration of services rendered, not only in connection with the conveyance of mails, but also for purposes of trade. The postal service really terminates"" at Adelaide, because there the mails are put ashore or taken on board, their transportation between Adelaide and the Eastern States being made by train. company's vessels go on to Melbourne and Sydney every voyage for the purpose of trade, it seems to me that some provision should have been made for securing the extension of the service to Brisbane, seeing that Queensland contributes her share to the subsidy paid by the Commonwealth. But we know that no company would tender for a service to Brisbane, and, therefore, the late Government had no alternative but to take the tender which was offered to them. In the future, I hope that whoever may be in office as Postmaster-General will insist upon a clause being inserted in the mail contract providing that the tenderer's vessels shall proceed to Brisbane. A'great deal has been said during this debate about the advantages gained under the contract by New South Wales. That State, however, has always treated the Commonwealth fairly, and has contributed largely to the heavy exactions made on behalf of the other States, and notably on behalf of Queensland. able member refer? bounty-, for instance. more from it than Queensland gets.

Wales would not object to pay one-third of the £26,000 which is to be expended in extending the Orient Steam Navigation Company's service to Brisbane, inasmuch as it is a trade service as well as a postal service; and, as I have said, I hope that when there is a new contract, a clause will be provided requiring the vessels performing the service to go on to Brisbane. posed to the ratification of the contract, for several reasons. In the first place, I shall oppose it because the contract introduces a system in connection with our postal service which, I think, should not have been introduced.

If it is desirable, as I think it is, that bonuses shall be given for the transport of perishable produce from Australia to the markets of the world, they should be paid by the Government out of the generat revenue, and should not form part of the postal expenditure. To my mind, a serious mistake was made by the Governments of the States, and has been continued by the Government of the Commonwealth, in providing for the carriage of perishable produce in a contract for the carriage of",53,Smith I Did Not Hear If Cargo From Sydney To Brisbane Compelling

The ex-Prime Minister repeatedly stated that his object was to create a good feeling between the States, but there is no evidence of it so far as this subject is concerned. agree with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat that the previous Government was wholly to blame for the terms of the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company which is now proposed for ratification by the House. The honourable member has accused the late Postmaster-General of making an egregious blunder; but it must be remembered that the late Government was taken at a great disadvantage, owing to the failure of two previous Governments. The first of them--of which the present Postmaster-General was a member-neglecte d to advertise for tenders before the termination of the old contract. When tenders were called for, the time available for making the necessary arrangements for a new service was so limited that the late Government were placed at a considerable disadvantage, and found themselves forced to agree to terms, which, under more favorable circumstances, they would probably have rejected. It must be remembered that the Orient Steam Navigation Company, first asked for £150,000. That amount was subsequently reduced to £140,000, b.ut the Government declined to grant such a high subsidy, and, after further negotiations, the Orient Steam Navigation Company agreed to accept £120,000 per annum. WhilstI have no objection to Brisbane being made a port of call for the Orient Steam Navigation Company's steamers, I do not think that any extra expenditure should be incurred by the Commonwealth. The contract entered into by the Queensland Government was made on their own responsibility, and without reference to this Parliament, and it seems to be rather cool on the part of Queensland to now ask us to assume their self-imposed financial responsibility. If we were to comply with their request, we should establish a most undesirable precedent. The States Governments might go behind the back of the Commonwealth Parliament, and enter into all kinds of contracts, in the belief that it impossible to reach. I shall keep my they had only to ask us to take them over. Therefore, we have to be' very careful in dealing with this matter. If fhe Orient Steam Navigation Company are willing to extend their service to Brisbane without asking for an addition to their subsidy, I see no objection to such an arrangement being made. We must recollect that the exten sion has not been arranged for with a view to facilitating the carriage of the mails, but merely with the object of offering the producers of Queensland greater advantages in connection with the export of their produce. This is purely a commercial consideration. I should certainly object to the Commonwealth being called upon to pay any more money in respect of the services rendered by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. The addition of £26,000 per annum to the present subsidy would increase it to an amount £6,000 in excess of the £140,000 which the late Government declined to pay for the carriage of the mails. ber agree to the contract being referred back, with a view to its being ascertained whether the Orient Steam Navigation Company would extend their service to Brisbane without asking for an increased subsidy? -that course being adopted; but I should certainly protest against the Commonwealth being saddled with any further expenditure. I regard the £120,000 demanded by the Orient Steam Navigation Company as excessive, but I recognise that the late Government found themselves in a very tight place, and had to accept the terms of the company or run the risk of reducing the whole of the commercial affairs of the Commonwealth to a state of chaos. of the honourable member, there is nothing to prevent him from voting for the amendment. to the increased cost. No harm could be done by referring the contract back in order to ascertain if the service could be extended to Brisbane without incurring further expense. ber must know that that cannot be done. Does he suppose that the company will extend their service for nothing? the Government are able to touch some tender chord which the late Government found mind open upon the question of referring the contract back until I hear what the",55,Smith I Did Not Hear If Cargo From Sydney To Brisbane Compelling

351,Mr Johnson,"Perhaps not, unless-late Postmaster-General has to say. Perhaps he will tell us that every effort has already tives of Tasmania recognise that its mail .been made in the direction desired. I shall regard it as a national calamity if the contract entered into with the Orient Steam Navigation Company is ratified in its present form. The increase in the sub.sidy from £85,000 to £120,000 seems to me to be outrageous. I have no doubt that if an arrangement had been made for a mail service between Naples and Adelaide, a much smaller subsidv would have been accepted. The Orient Steam Navigation Company took advantage of the absence of -competition, brought about by the influence of the shipping ring, and were practically able to make their own terms as to ports of -call and everything else. Repeated efforts have been made to secure the extension of the service on to Brisbane, but without success, until the Queensland Government took the matter into their own hands. So far as I can see, the Government have not tried to include Brisbane. by each State, as opposed to the £26,000 which the honourable member is asking for. ^£26,000 a year is too much to pay for the service from Sydney to Brisbane, and .that £120,000 a year is too much to pay -for the service from Great Britain to Sydney. I am not very* much in favour of the mail service from Brisbane by the Orient SteamNavigation Company. I believe that a mail service vid Torres Strait would suit Brisbane far better than that .service. In Northern Queensland we have ports which from the commercial standpoint are of far more importance than other ports in Australia. We may not have the population at the present time, but we have a country with potentialities far greater than those which may be discerned in the southern States. Honourable members from Tasmania say that it does not want this -or that, and speak about the sugar bounty. But Queensland is suffering more from the payment of that bounty than is any other State. The price of sugar was far cheaper before the bounty was authorized than it is now, and yet we hear very much talk about the little island's apples and jam factories. land ask for the repeal of the sugar bounty ? nothing to do with the mail contract which we are asked to ratify. The representaservice is suitable, and would not be benefited by the Orient Steam Navigation Company's boats calling at Hobart; but in Brisbane we have produce, such as butter, for which cool chambers are required by the exporters. For that reason a mail service by that company might be of some benefit to Queensland exporters. The Aberdeen line used to take away this produce, but it has been cut out by the ring. There is no greater evidence of the existence of a ring amongst the shipping companies than the fact that when tenders were called for the northern mail services in Queensland the prices asked, by the shipping companies were all about the same. When we find the shipping companies combining for the purpose of ""taking down"" the Commonwealth it is time that it established its own shipping, and did not ratify this mail contract. It would be far better for the Commonwealth to resort to the poundage system. A few persons in Flinders-lane talked about the insufficiency of the mail service, because they did not receive their letters at the stroke of the hour. That is not of very much importance to the bulk of the people of Australia, who do not notice when the mails arrive. It is only from a few commercial men in the great cities, and a few Chambers of Commerce, that we hear all this talk about the insufficiency of the mail service. I feel quite sure that the people of Australia would not suffer if the mails were carried under the poundage system. I intend to oppose the ratification of this mail contract because it is my opinion that Queensland has been treated very shabbily by the Commonwealth. It has been the greatest sufferer, not only in this matter, but in every other way. It would be far better out of the Commonwealth than in it. land been badly treated? which has been treated best has been Western Australia.

It is laid down in the Constitution that there shall be no differentiation between States by the Commonwealth. How the ex-Postmaster-General can reconcile the provision of mail steamers for carrying perishable produce from Victoria and New South Wales and not from Tasmania and Queensland I do not know. Queensland has not been, treated in a princely fashion by the Federation, and therefore I can understand the strong remark made just now by the honourable member for Capricornia, who, perhaps, was an anti-Federalist. -she been badly treated ? of this mail contract.

If the Queensland Government I know all had asked the Commonwealth Government to enter into this contract so as to extend the service as far as Brisbane, on the condition that the State should, pay all the out-of-pocket expenses which the Commonwealth incurred, does any honourable member mean to say that the arrangement would have been made as quickly as it has been? My own idea is that months would have been occupied in negotiation, and possibly yards or miles of correspondence would have followed, before anything was done; and in the meantime the Queensland producers would have been left out in the cold. The honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Brisbane have to-night referred to the fact that the vessels of the Aberdeen line were not allowed to carry cargo to Queensland direct, but had to take all to Sydney, where it was dumped down on the wharfs, and thence transhipped to the northern ports by coastal boats, while the Aberdeen vessels themselves actuallv went on to Brisbane empty. That, of course, is one of the effects of the system of the shipping In what way has ""ring.

What do we care about Queensland ? We run these ships on commercial lines, and, if you do not like to use them, vou can use other ships, but the cargo will be dumped down at Sydney all the same."" What sort of a Government would it be that permitted such a state of things to continue? Would the Commonwealth Parliament or Government have taken any notice of the circumstances?

385,Motion (By Mr Groom) Proposed,"think there was some little misunderstanding as to the particularswhich, will be collected under clause 13A of the Bill. The Minister has already assured me that under theterm "" prescribed matters "" very much additional ground may be covered. I have no desire to delay the progress of this B ill I merely wish to emphasize the necessity which exists for ascertaining who are the owners of property, how their property is held, and what is its value. I quite recognise that a householder may say, "" I am not qualified to make a valuation of my property."" that he has the municipal valuation to guide him. It seems to me that it is much more necessary to secure information in regard to the distribution and ownership of property than it is to obtain particulars of the materials of which a house is constructed, and of the number of rooms which it contains. I am of opinion that' it would be wise to set out in. this Bill the form of a householder's schedule. however, the Minister offered some practical objection to the adoption of that course,, and consequently I did not press the matter to a division. The last speaker has raised a question of considerable importance. the Minister can assurethe House that, he already possesses power to secure the information which the honourable member ""for provision should be made for it in this Bill. that we should have tlie particulars to which hereferred. all numbering the houses, and counting the rooms whicheach dwelling contains. I know of no broader and fairer test of the general oomfort and standard of decency of the population of a country than an estimateof thecharacter of the houses in which its people dwell. I had occasion to refer to a table of this kind only a little while ago for the purpose of showing that in Australia there are about 50,000 people living in houses of two rooms each, and all the rest in houses having more accommodation. I do not at all under-rate that kind of enumeration, but I do not think it should beset up in competition with the information that -my honourable friend is seeking-that is, as to the value of house property and the value of land in particular. It. is of the utmost consequence that we should make it imperative upon the Statisticians to ascertain accurately the value of land in the. Commonwealth. It is of the very essence of. a good computation that there should, be uniformity in assessing the: value of die lands of the Commonwealth. It may be that this power is latent in the B ill ; but even if it is, no harm can be done by expressing it definitely and clearly in clause 16. We have already,, in that clause, provided for a schedule covering a number of matters, but as to the value of land But I would point out and what might be called real propertythere is no stipulationwhatever. It is true that we take power to estimate all kinds of industrial occupations in respect of the numbers engaged in them and their value, but there is no provision in any! part of this B ill making it obligatory upon those W/ho will have charge of this business to estimate, the value of the realty of the community. As I have already said, it looks Last night, as if we shall more and more have to do with the question of direct taxation throughout the Commonwealth. Taxation is being differentiated in the various States. In some a tax is imposed on land; in others on land values-; in others a general wealth or a general propertytax. It is, therefore, very necessary, in Unless estimating the taxable resources of the Commonwealth that we should know what the lands of the Commonwealth are worth, what they are in extent, and what are the Kooyong desires, some definite possibilities of direct taxation in that direction. For this purpose, as well as in the It is of the utmost consequence interests of a fair estimate of the wealth of the community, we should incorporate 1 do not at. some such provision in the B ill.

That may be onlyi the very rudest guess, but whether it is ,a guess or not, it is only arrived at by an attempt on the part of somebody to assimilate various means of computing this wealth in the various States. A t the present time, as I pointed out last night, nearly every man who essays to do this work has a method all his own, differing from that of every other Statistician in the Commonwealth. It might turn out' that a very different estimate would be the result of a uniform method of arriving at these values throughout the Commonwealth. We cannot be sure that it is being done accurately and properly until we have one authority operating throughout the whole of the States in regard to this very important matter. I therefore support the remarks made by the honourable member for Kooyong. I think it is a pity that the honourable member did not formally move the recommittal of the B ill for the purpose of including in clause 16 some such amendment as he has outlined. recollected by the Minister in charge of the held Bill that with the concurrence of the Atrequiring fift y different returns under torney-General he agreed to a recommittal this ""Bill. of clause 12. it.

As the Bill stood yesterday, in such cases every office .would be a dwelling. That has been remedied by the insertion of the words ""and. used for the purpose of human habitation."" But another serious difficulty pointed out by the honourable member for Maranoa has not yet been met. Throughout Australia there is an enormous number of hotels in which persons lease a room for weeks or months. They are practically lodgers, and hold their rooms in the hotel; and under sub-clause 2 of clause 12 every one of those rooms is made a dwellingBy this Bill, if there are fiftv such' rooms in a large city hotel they will become fifty dwelling-houses. The tendency of sucK a law is to misrepresent the condition of the people of Australia, because when the total number of tenements is compared with the total number of householders, our statistics will point to a state 'of discomfort and poverty which will not actually exist. We know that in New York and in many other places it is a reproach that there are so many families in the occupation of one tenement house. That is looked upon as a sign of the utmost poverty, and of the absence of comfort. Take the enormous building that is being erected not very far away in Collinsstreet, which will probably contain 100 or 200 rooms to be let in residential flats. If fift y different people occupy those rooms, by the wording of sub-clause 2 of to be fifty dwelling-houses, That is altogether wrong.

445,Mr Johnson (Lang),"I am sorryx88 bring forward another amendment. I was surprised at the way in which the question was put by the Chairman. Not only r the honourable member for Koo\ong, but other honourable members also, myself included, were under the impression that we were voting on the question of omitting certain words from this clause, and not upon the clause as a whole. As the result of this misapprehension, the opportunity to bring forward the amendment was lost. Having in view these facts, I hope that the Minister will see his way to recommit the clause. Last nightj when speaking on clause 12, the leader of the Opposition pointed out certain defects in clause 12, and I also directed attention to imperfections in sub-clause 2^ which provides thatWhere a dwelling is let, sublet, or held in different apartments and occupied by different persons or families, each part so let, sublet, or held shall be deemed a dwelling house. I indicated that if each occupant of a separate room in a dwelling-and there might be a hundred in one building-were expected to fill in a complete schedule relating to the occupants of the building, the result would be an absolutely misleading set of statistics, because information as to the same set of facts would be multiplied by the number of separate occupants in a building. I recognise to the f u l l the value of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Kooyong, which I think, however, should be embodied in clause 16, and not in clause 13A, and I think also that both that clause and clause 12 should be recommitted. amendment of clause 12, because we have adopted the word's of other Acts which, under administration, have been found to be sufficient as recently as on the occasion of the last census. No words that would effect an improvement have yet been suggested. against making provision for an erroneous statement of facts; but in this case we not only do not so guard against error, but in sert provisions which must inevitably lead to error. ister of Home Affairs)' -The honourable member for Kooyong has suggested that we should include among the matters upon which statistics are to be collected the question of land tenure. I quite agree with the honourable member that that is an exceedingly Census and [REPRESENTATIVES.] Statistics Bill. important matter, upon which information should be obtained, but I am afraid that it will be difficult to avoid making the inquiry very expensive. If , as the honourable member has suggested, we were to inquire into land values in every State, and we were to adopt the values furnished by each individual according to his own method of valuation, apart from any uniform principle, we should land' ourselves in all sorts of difficulties. so absurd. understood the honourable member. The only valuations we could accept would be those arrived at under the assessments made by the local government bodies, and I would point out that such bodies are not constituted throughout the whole of the States. Then, again, even where such information is available, the valuations are arrived at according to differing principles. For instance, in Queensland the properties are assessed upon their unimproved value. It is a question of raising revenue, and if values decline a heavier rate has to be levied. Therefore, owners of property very often do not trouble to appeal against excessive valuations. Moreover, owners of property very frequently agree to excessive valuations, because they think that thereby the market value of their properties may be enhanced. With regard to the matter of land tenure and occupancy we shall need to proceed very cautiously, otherwise we shall land the Commonwealth in great ex, pense. I think that the matter can be dealt with in clause 16, in which I am prepared to insert the words "" land tenure and occupancy."" Eveni f those words are inserted we can only express the pious hope that those who are intrusted with the administration of the Act will have due regard to the expense of collecting such statistics as are suggested. Even in regard to land tenures serious difficulties will have to be faced. The conditions under which land is classified differ considerably in the States, and varying names are applied to areas of a similar character. Therefore, when it comes to a matter of making comparisons a knowledge of the local land laws will be required. I understand, however, that the honourable member desires to obtain information as to the area of land in each State, the area which has been alienated, the area 1 which is held generally on leasehold, the 0",64,Census And Statistics Bill
