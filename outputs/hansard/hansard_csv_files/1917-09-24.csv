I hope that a great percentage of our 300,000 soldiers will return fit to go back to their former employment if they desire to do so. Some time ago the Melbourne Herald made an appeal to employers, asking how many firms were willing to re-employ those who had left their employment to enlist, and they published a list of firms who expressed their willingness to do so. I hope that the men who come back fit to take up their former occupations will be given every opportunity to return to the positions they left when they enlisted. It will be part of the work of the Repatriation Committees to see that men are given tlie opportunity to go back to their former trades and callings. The complaint raised this morning by the honourable member for Perth( Mr could be. We are doing pioneering work Powler) that returned soldiers cannot be placed in positions in Western Australia applies to every other State. There is not a metropolitan member in 'this House who cannot mention scores of cases of men who have returned, partially incapacitated or suffering from some infirmity, who cannot secure employment. Metropolitan members may be more easily accessible to tliese men than representatives of country electorates country. for Henty( Mr Boyd) has 56,000 constituents, of whom about) 4,000 or 5,000 have enlisted, and in all probability about 700 have already returned. The honourable member is readily accessible to them, as also to the men in the largest base hospital for Victoria, which is also in his electorate, and, I . have no doubt, has very many cases brought under his notice. During tlie elections, and during the resure in order that we may inform cruiting campaigns, every one promised these men that so far as we were able we would see that no individual who remained at home should shirk his responsibilities in the matter of dealing fairly with the man who went to fight for him. We know that in the past governments and communities have shirked their responsibilities to returned soldiers. .Those who know London are well aware of the treatment of the Balaclava heroes and of many other veterans of other wars, of how these men had to beg in the streets, or to seek assistance at workhouses; and any one who hasseen even the outside of a workhouse when, casuals are endeavouring to obtain a nighti's rest knows the horror with which.' suoh institutions are regarded. We are doing no more than our plain duty in endeavouring to put every returned soldier in a fair position. The speech made by Senator Millen in another place was more illuminating than the Bill itself. The Bill is a mere matter of dry. bones, and it will be the work of the Repatriation Committees to put life intothose dry bones. Bill. administration than any other measure that I have seen. wise with a measure like this. in this connection We are framing a measure to control something that hasnever been done before, and, therefore, it must be largely a Bill that leaves a great deal to administration. That being so, ifc behoves us to be more careful than otherwise would be necessary. the Minister outlined the general scheme and pointed out that it must be elastic in its nature. the speech gives more information than does the Bill, but we have to remember that a measure which leaves so much to administration throws a bigger responsibility upon Parliament in discussing it, to indicate to Ministers what 'the desires of honourable members are. The mere wish of the Ministry ito adjourn this week and to close up Parliament for a few weeks is no reason for preventing the freest and fullest discussion of this meathe Government, particularly t i e Minister in charge of repatriation, of what Parliament desires. My view is that there must be one supreme controlling body. There must be no division of authority, either in the collection of funds or in the placing of individuals, because if there are to be half-a-dozen organizations dealing with the returned soldier, and he can go from one to the other in seeking to obtain what he desires, the scheme will be fatally prejudiced.

There must be no overlapping of functions, and no control independent of the Federal body. -seems to me to be one of the fundamental principles of any successful scheme. The J3ill provides for the appointment of a Federal Board of seven commissioners, of whom the Minister shall be chairman, and .State Boards, which will also be chosen by the Government. It is not stated whether the chairman of each State Board is to be a paid official, but in the absence of any provision to the contrary it must be .supposed that all members of State Boards will act in an honorary capacity. The Minister indicated that the personnel of the Boards will include a proportion of business men and returned soldiers. That is a wise provision. by the Minister, in his speech in another place, an amendment of the Pensions Act. A t the present time a pension continues for six months without' alteration. At the end of that time it is reconsidered, and I think I am safe in saying that in nineteen cases out of twenty the revision .has been in the nature of a reduction. That is no incentive .to a man to try to do his best. He will consider that if in the majority of cases the pension is decreased sA the end of six months there is no need for him to try to fit himself for employment. tendency be for a man to be recovering at the end of six months? validity has been worse at the end of the six months, increased. pensions have been given. the proportion of reductions is what I have stated. under my notice the pension was doubled. The honourable member will find that there is a disposition to treat the men fairly. cated that the Pensions Act would be amended to provide that whatever pension was fixed at the end of the first six months should nob be further reduced, -and that there should be no alteration in the payment unless at the pensioner's request. a pension at the end of six months depend upon the report of the medical officer ?

Coining to the proposal for a central Committee, I would remind the House that, so far, private contributions to the Repatriation Fund have not amounted to much more than £100,000 for the whole of Australia. ber for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) alone raised £40,000 in connection with a district repatriation scheme. the contributions of citizens to the central fund. Millen, in introducing this Bill in another place, said thab ""private contributions to the central fund amounted to £109,000. Of that amount Mr Baillieu, a member of the Victorian State Government, contributed £25,000, or practically one-fourth of the whole The Government have so far subsidized the central fund to the. extent of £250,000. When any new scheme is floated tliere are always a few enthusiasts who think it will be an easy matter to raise a million of money in connection with it. Some time ago it was proposed that a Dreadnought should be presented to Great Britain by the citizens of Australia, and a fund of £2,000,000 was to be raised for the purpose. As a matter of fact, however, only £40,000 was raised throughout Australia, and the money was eventually handed over to the Duntroon College. Disabled and partly disabled returned soldiers are to be taught various trades, and, doubtless, many will have such an opportunity for the first time. should be taken to teach the men such trades as will enable them to make a good living. In my own electorate a start was made some time ago to teach returned soldiers toy-making. That is a very good thing in its way, but such a trade would not absorb very many returned soldiers. We ought to bend all our energies to the training of our men in trades fr.om which they will get the best results. say what is the value of toys imported into Australia? the actual value, since, in bhe Customs liberalized returns, a great many fancy goods are included under the heading of ""toys."" The imports represent a considerable sum, but I do not think toy-making in Australia would give employment to very many returned soldiers. I am very anxious that our men should be taught trades which will afford them plenty of scope. An excellent example has been set us overseas in connection with the teaching of the blind. I observe that the Victorian Asylum for the Blind proposes to help some of our returned soldiers who, unhappily, have lost their sight, to acquire trades. Some of these men did not have an opportunity to enter St. Dunstan's College, which was established in England by Sir Arthur Pearson, and which teaches various trades which canI am reminded thatSenator not be acquired here. Massage, for instance, is one of the subjects taught; there is no opportunity, I understand, for the blind to be taught that subject in Australia. blind people have been taught massage here. was interviewed recently by Sergeant Walsh, a blind soldier, who told me that, with the exception of those who lost their sight at Gallipoli, all blind Australian soldiers were taken to St. Dunstan's College, where there was a wider field of training than is open to them here. Necessarily, such a college, dealing, as it does, with hundreds of cases, must have a larger staff and a wider range of subjects than we could hope for in Australia. Sergeant Walsh was anxious to return to England, in order that he might learn at St. Dunstan's College an industry which, he could not be taught here.

We are anxious to do the best for the whole of our returned men, hut the position of the blind calls for am quite opposed, believing that, if it special effort on our part, and I trust that were permitted, it would not only wreck the whole of the Committees for which the Bill provides will be specially considerate in dealing with the disabilities of in Australia. such men. Another matter which will call for careemployers would do that sort of thing? f u l attention is the position of returned soldiers who were serving their apprenticeship to various trades and callings at the time that they enlisted. Many of these young men were about eighteen or nineteen years of age when they volunteered for active service. They will return two years or three years older than when they left, and it will be difficult for them to resume their apprenticeship at the exact point at which they left off.. I have in mind the case of a youth who enlisted when he was eighteen and a half years of age. He was at the time apprenticed to the watchmaking trade. This youth, who had about two and a half years to serve,' enlisted, and his employer promised that, if he were still in business on his return, he would be pleased to arrange for the apprenticeship to be resumed where it had left off. employed as an improver. what the determination in the trade is, though personally I do not think that in this trade there has been a Wages Board decision in Victoria. At any rate, provision should be made to make up the full wage while an apprenticeship is being completed. made by the Minister. Of course, I know that in the carrying out of such a suggestion difficulties and dangers will be met. For instance, if the Repatriation Fund or. the Pension' Fund is used in this way to make up the amount of wages, it may have the effect of reducing the wages of the other employees. ticeship question, we have to consider journeymen who have returned from the Front, quite unfit to continue their duties on active service, but quite physically fit to resume their ordinary vocations here, and employers, knowing that assistance is granted from the Repatriation or Pension Fund, might be tempted to reduce the wages paid by the amount of the grants made. To this, of course, I the Repatriation scheme, but affect the. industrial conditions which at present exist able gentleman that it has already been done. I do not say for one moment that all employers are likely to so treat their men, but we have known of cases where returned men have been refused the employment they were promised before they went away. mittees of employers and workmen decide how much of the trade union rules may be relaxed to meet cases of the kind. be fair We have been told that returned soldiers will be represented on the Committiees under this Bill, along -with business men; but I suggest that, in addition, there be representative workers to see that a fair deal is given, so that the returned soldier, who is receiving a pension, will not be used as a lever to reduce wages. that ithe Committees will be fairly representative course, the Committees being honorary difficulties will arise. the difficulties will be overcome. ; take the present opportunity to point out the possible difficulties, so that it may not be said subsequently that we did not make suggestions at the proper time.'

This year, no such vote appears, and the Minister responsible informed Mr Stuart Robertson, in the Legislative\ Assembly last evening, has not become an industry of itself, but -that the Government could not get the soldiers to settle on the blocks got ready for them.

85,Mr Ttjdor,"I am very glad to hearParliament at the present time, but I have not followed the debates upon it very closely. I do not know much in regard to its provisions. the arrangements made between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth. in its present form, I do not know whether the State Boards will exercise any control in the matter of the purchase of land. But I do know that if one authority isobliged to find the money for this purpose, and another authority is empowered to expend it, extravagance will result. will have to raise loans for the acquisition of land. pelled to raise money for repatriation purposes, either by loan or otherwise, and the States are empowered to expend it , extravagance will be inevitable. is getting upon sound ground now. raise money out of revenue we are necessarily more careful of how it is expended than we should be if it were obtained from loan funds. The Minister estimates that this repatriation scheme will involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of £60,000,000, but I believe that anybody who has gone into the matter will recognise that at least £100,000,000 will require to be expended before the scheme can be placed upon a sound basis. We have to recollect that many of the soldiers who will return to us are utterly inexperienced in the conditions of country life, and it will be necessary to teach' them trades before positions can be found for them. I have met soldiers in Melbourne who have been invalided home, who are in a chronic state of mental depression, and who, physically, are nervous wrecks. One of them who was introduced to me said, "" I am full up. I have not a friend in Melbourne. country, but I do not know what has become of them, and though I have been ' done in ' I . intend to enlist under another name."" These men are in a morbid condition, and in dealing with them the greatest care will need to be exercised. I do not intend to say a word against that very excellent institution, the State War Council. ' I believe that it is doing its best under trying conditions. But undoubtedly it has inflicted hardship upon many returned soldiers it has never had a scheme to administer. consider that there is too much red tape and circumlocution connected with it. If the State War Council could deal directly with the cases of returned soldiers, without reference to a higher authority, the position might be simplified. But we are not likely to secure less red tape by the creation of a new Department. I recognise that this is a machinery Commonwealth Bill. We are creating the machine, but whether or not the machine will work smoothly, will not depend upon this Parliament, but upon the Department which will control it. It is .true that we shall have opportunities to raise questions of administration, bufc honourable members know perfectly well that it is very seldom that an opportunity arises to deal effectively with any Department. When once our soldiers get back to Australiaand the sooner they come back after victory has been achieved the better pleased we will be-w e sliall be confronted with a very serious problem.

Under subsection 4 of section 32 of the Acts Shortening Act, where we have the power to appoint, we have also the power to remove. the fact that the greatest care must be taken in the appointment of the Commissioners, who will form the central Board, and also the various State Boards. We have had the advantage of a good explanation of the provisions of the Bill, though it was much shorter here than that given in the Senate. Senator Millen very kindly forwarded to every honourable member a copy of the speech he delivered in introducing the measure in . the Senate. It was an excellent speech; but it contained much that does not appear in the Bill. breaking new ground, and I am sure that we are all anxious to deal justly and fairly with this matter, nor do I denounce all with the returned soldiers. Every honourable member of the House is animated by a desire to give the fairest of fair deals to the men who have risked everything for the country, and to see that on their return they are placed in at least as good a position as they -occupied before they went away. We must be careful to see that the expenditure of the £60,000,000, or any part of it, in connection with the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, is not taken advantage of to inflate the price of land. Every one who has had parliamentary experience must be aware that directly a Government steps in as a buyer of land the price goes up. If a Government requires a piece of land for a post-office, it has, as a rule, to pay more for it than would be demanded of a private individual. If it is known that £20,000,000 is to be spent in the purchase of land for returned soldiers, the price of land will go up. I say that the people who will demand increased prices for land required for the settlement of returned soldiers will pot be doing a fair thing by the soldiers or by the country. for their land for this purpose than they would ask under other conditions. I speak generally, and am not reflecting upon land-owners, as a class, any more than upon employers. Some employers are failing to make good the promises which they made to the men in their employment, that if they enlisted-their places would be open for them when they came back. As one who has had many years experience in factories, I admit that, in some oases, it-is impossible to reinstate a man m the position which he held two or three years before. That difficulty will arise in Government as well as in private employment; but I hope that, in this matter, the Government will set a good example to private employers. Soon after tihe war began, the Government decided to postpone examinations and per' manent appointments as far as possible, and in making promotions to consider the claims of those who have enlisted as well as of those who have remained here. Still, men who have not enlisted', it may be for good reasons, whether in office, factory or workshop, will have obtained superior positions, because others have We are, in this matter, gone to the war. I do not denounce all manufacturers or employers in connection land-holders because of efforts made to secure higher prices fdr land; but I do denounce those who will not honour their promise in one case, while in the other they ask more for their land than they ought to. I suppose that the State Boards will deal with this particular matter. Senator Millen has said that replies have been received from 40,000 men who are willing to go upon the land. If men enlisted from the country districts in the same proportion as from the towns, of the 300,000 who went to the war, not 40,000, but nearly 150,000 should'have gone from the country. back to their own lands. there should be more than 40,000 willing to go upon the land. The first duty of the State Committees will be to induce land-owners to make offers of land for repatriation purposes, so that the soldiers will not be called upon to pay inflated prices. largely overcome by the compulsory. purchase power. machinery Bill, it contains no clause providing that the money is to be repaid, nor",28,Gboom

105,Mr Tudor,"Whil e this ia as there any clause in the Bill stating that the money is a gift. On the other hand, the whole of the discussion at conferences and other places has been on the lines that advances were to be made. vide for that. mit that one of the duties of the Board should be to consider the proportion of the advance that will be the soldier's own. All the men who go on the land will not be fitted to make good there, and an incentive or ,reward should be given to those who do succeed in staying there. That could be done by making part of the advance their own property. I am speaking now more particularly with regard to the men who will go on the land, and the advance of £750 that they will receive. the latter part of his speech that a conference had recommended that that amount be increased by 50 per cent. to. material to my argument. The men who go on the land should know that they will not have to repay the whole of the money -that is, that it will not hang round their neck like a mortgage, and that, if they make good, part of it will be their own. If that is done, the scheme is likely to be a greater success than if the men feel that they have to repay the whole of the advance I urge the Ministry to exercise the greatest care to see that all classes the question of how the great work of are fairly represented on the State Boards, because the whole of the returned men will not go upon the land. A great number will go back to their ordinary occupations in the cities and towns, and I ask the Government to see that the workers are represented on the different committees, so that they may insure that all the soldiers get a fair deal. Ib may be argued that some returned soldiers are to be members of these bodies, but it is easily possible that they may be men who were not workers when they went away, and I am anxious that the workers should be directly represented. Realizing the difficulties of the subject, and that what is before us is only the skeleton of a Bill, the whole movement necessarily depending upon administration for its success, I trust that our fondest expectations will be realized. One pointi that must be stressed is that while a great responsibility rests upon Parliament, there also rests upon every citizen in the community the responsibility of seeing that every soldier on his return is placed as far as possible in at least as good a position as he held before he went away to do the best he could, fighting for every one of us who remained in Australia. approach this subject with a full consciousness of the almost colossal task that the Government, and particularly the Minister, have in front of them in endeavouring to restore to citizen life from 300,000 to 400,000 men who for two or three years have been withdrawn' from the ordinary life of their country, and have gone to fight for the freedom of their native land on foreign battlefields. The obligation rests upon every member of the House to do all he possibly can to assist the Government in general, and the Minister in particular, in making this scheme one that will open a new horizon for every man who returns. It would be most unworthy for any one to approach this question in a party spirit, or with the idea of seeking some partygain, and the Minister will recognise that he has had very generous treatment from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), whose speech showed throughout no trace of any captious desire to secure an advantage from a political point of view. In fact, the honourable member dealt generously with the measure. Australia has waited patiently for over two and a half years for a lead from the Government on repatriation should be undertaken. With a confident patience, it has waited upon this National Parliament, which gave a distinct.promise at the last election that a definite scheme would be evolved and placed before the country. The Minister (Senator Millen) in charge of the measure in another place, who must be regarded as -one of the most fit men in the Commonwealth to undertake this task, in a most able and eloquent speech put forward an excellent conception of the great subject of repatriation; bub I am sorry to say that the country and Parliament have taken the speech for the scheme The only thing in the measure that can at all be said to approach a Bcheme is clause 8.",29,Gboom

That clause is the only part of the Bill that appoints an .authority to create a scheme. All the rest of the Bill is mere machinery. Australia as a nation has been looking for a long time for a lead in this matter, and this Parliament has not given it. A t this stage I propose briefly tb review what has been done in repatriation up till now. tempted in this country was one with which I was personally associated. It was projected on a territorial basis; on the idea that it was the duty of the community, and, in particular, the duty of non-combatants in Australia to search their own consciences and do something for those who went out to fight for them. When that scheme was launched it aroused a magnificent public spirit in Australia; the people were ready to go into the market-place to yield up their gifts for the benefit of their defenders. The project was attended with splendid success until the Government of the day changed its mind and initiated the repatriation scheme represented by.a Bill introduced into Parliament in May, 1916, and entitled "" The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund Bill."" Under that measure the Government proposed to look to the community for the repatriation and settlement of our Australian soldiers; public contributions were to be supplemented by a parliamentary vote of £250,000. A Commission, in the nature of trustees, was appointed, but the proposal failed, as I think the present scheme will fail, because Parliament shirked its responsibility in not laying down ithe principles of repatriation. This Bill contains nothing that can be regarded as a basis for discussion by this House. Bill should set out-details of the wholescheme? of criticising the Bil l without making other proposals. At that time we appointed trustees, many of whom wereshould be the sacred duty of Parliament, alone, is to be delegated to a Minister and six gentlemen as yet unknown, and whoprobably will not be responsible to the people-ma y not, and probably will not, be members of either House of the National Legislature. I recognise the difficulties presented in framing a proposal of this nature, but I declare it ito be wrong that Parliament should say it is unableto lay down its fundamental principles. From Parliament, in my judgment, should emanate the parent measure of repatriation. The first repatriation scheme attwo and three years to consider it. we have, as our partners, the State Legislatures, which control the lands in this country, control employment, control many of its public activities, and control much more closely than does the National Parliament! the industries of Australia. I want it .to be made perfectly clear ithat any failure in repatriation in the past cannot be laid at the door of the present Minister or of this Government up to the stage at which this scheme has been introduced. There are two periods in repatriation: I regard the first as that marked by the passage of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation FundB ill ; and, in order that honourable members may judge for themselves whether Parliament in evolving that scheme did right or wrong, I propose to indicate what has transpired during what I may regard as the first period of the repatriation movement. Up to the 12th September of this year tliere have been returned to Australia, and discharged, 1,106 officers and-24,511 men, or a total of 25,617. As I have said, Parliament voted £250,000",30,Gboom

""Would any honourable member sitting behind the present Government be prepared to sign a blank cheque to hand over the question of repatriation to a Commission which the Opposition party might appoint? I have no doubt that the Government will take every possible precaution to select the ablest men in this country to administer their scheme. I think that they will neglect nothing in trying to secure the services of such men, but I submit that this Parliament is passing on the performance of a sacred pledge to the soldiers to certain gentlemen who may be in a position to override the Minister for Repatriation on a matter of policy. His representative here says that I am wrong there. be adopted in regulations to be framed under the Act, and that the regulations will be made, by the Gov.ernor-General in Council. ister says, I take it, that we shall be quite safe in regard to this matter of repatriation, because the Executive Council will have to approve of the regulations, and Parliament need not vote any money unless it approves of them. That is the only control which we shall have over the Commission. I ask the Minister to consider what will be the effect of that arrangement? Does it mean that the question of repatriation can be solved in that way, or does it mean that the Government can create a deadlock by declining to ask this House to Vote the money, and by refusing to approve of proposed regulations? That will not solve the problem of repatriation. As one who took an active part in dealing with this matter for many months, I tell the Minister that in connection with our scheme we were hamstrung because this Parliament did not have a scheme submitted for its consideration. When we were going full steam ahead the Eederal Executive thought fit to issue a proclamation denying to us even the use of the word "" repatriation."" In other words, although the Government did not kill us straight out, they let us die gradually. We could not make a further appeal; we could not complete and carry out our scheme. All that we could do, if we wished to act, was to administer the money we had in hand. In the time he has had to handle this problem, no man in this country has acquired so clear a conception of a great subject as has the Minister for Repatriation. In this measure he invites the Australian public to co-operate with him, and rightly so, too. But on what lines does he give the invitation ? How can the public coroperate with the' Minister on a measure in respect to which there is nothing before them? This'is another proposal to administer a business measure by regulation. It will be a colossal system of patchwork. Here is a skeleton Bill, and if any gentleman comes here to find out what Australia is doing for her returned soldiers, he will be referred to a machinery Bill, and invited to look up all the regulations which have.been issued under its provisions. Only in that way can he find out what we are doing for our returned soldiers. Neither the soldiers nor the community, nor, indeed, anybody else, will be able in a short space of time to learn where we stand on the question of repatriation. Is there one honourable member who follows every regulation which is issued by the Executive Council? If the measure is passed in its present form, Parliament will be helpless as regards offering any suggestion in connection with land settlement, because, under the arrangement made between the Commonwealth and the States, that question has passed altogether from the purview of this Parliament to that of the States. mentioned to the honourable member a few moments ago, and he said that I had not read the BUI. pointj as the honourable' member will see if he will be good enough to look .up what he said.

Very well; let us be' honest and clear, and admit that this Parliament has passed on to some other bodies, so far as repatriation is concerned, the responsibility with regard to land settlement.

139,Mr Rodgers,"Of what use is it toI regret that it is not proposed to make more use of the Local Committees. The one hope of success for the scheme lies in bringing home the responsibility for the repatriation of the soldier to those living in the district from which he went, who knew him before he enlisted, and know his capabilities. They should sit round the table with him and arrange the line of life in which he could best employ himself, and hold out to him, permanently, the hand of friendship. Under the Bill, however, the recommendations of the Local Committees may be turned down. They are to have power to raise money for repatriation, and to spend such money in supplementing the Government grant. Now, if the members of the Committee are rightly selected, they will be well ""balanced business men, drawn from the industries in each district, who, having made a success of their own business, will be capable of making a success of this -scheme. But the Government seems to think that, although these men may be trusted under the Bill to raise money locally and to spend that money as they think best, they cannot be trusted to spend the money of the Government properly. How long will the members of the Local Committee continue their work if their recommendations are -consistently turned down? 3 Can the central authorities know the conditions better than they? The Government takes power to appoint the Local Committees, and, having selected suitable men, it -should trust them. /The Central Commission and the State Boards cannot be better judges of the merits of any local «proposition than the Local Committees, which will be composed of public-spirited men, prepared to devote their time to helpdelicate period from the point of view of ing countrymen who have done so much for them and for the Commonwealth. My experience has been that local Com* mittees have more than justified our highest hopes. The men upon those Committees are earnest men, and since they have taken on the work their efforts have never flagged; but they object to being kept so long in the dark as to what the nation intends to do, in the matter of repatriation. Every one knows that a soldier comes back to Australia a changed man. His condition of life has changed. His health has changed. changed. But the nation's first duty is Mr Rddgers. to concern itself in the effective repatriation of the relatives of the fallen soldiers. I am pleased that the Government have seen fit to include widows in their scheme, and I hope that the limitations imposed in regard to them will receive a very generous interpretation; because, when a woman has sacrificed her husband, the rest of her life is a very dark period. recognises that any assistance to widows under a repatriation scheme will be supplementary to any pensions. but I also recognise that if it had not been for the sacrifice, gallantry, and heroism of our women, we might be in the same position of degradation as Russia occupies to-day. So long as it is conducted on business lines, a repatriation scheme, no matter how generous it may be, will nofc weaken the nation; it will enrich it. What would weaken the nation would be any failure to make 300,000 men, who have stood outside the sphere of production for some time, fit once more to enter it again. We enrich the nation if we can make these men effective to re-enter that sphere of production. Next to the repatriation of the relatives of the fallen men comes the important question of the restoration of the health of the man who is broken. The period that will elapse between a man's return from the field of battle until he is once more able to enter civic life will be an anxious one, and will probably last longer than we may anticipate, but Parliament should be generous, even to a fault, to these men. It will depend upon the treatment that the soldier receives during that curative or restorative ""period whether he ever becomes a truly effective man again. That is why I say that this is the most the nation, and most dangerous period from the point of view of the future life of the soldier. A t this stage, I wish to say that Australia owes a great debt of gratitude to those noble women who have done so much to look after the returned men, by visiting the base hospitals, by meeting transports, and by caring for the maimed. These girls arid women are not in the employment of the nation, but they are inspired by a recognition of what the men have done. That is_ the spirit we want to see displayed in this country. Unfortunately, it has, to a great extent, owing to politics, His outlook on life has ' melted away to give place to bitter party conflict.",34,Gboom
140,Mr Gboom,The honourable member,35,Gboom
141,Mr Rodgers,"I recognise that,to the extent thab it should have been. mercialized. I have had the opportunity of probing feeling in this country, and I say thab there is an unrecognised noble spirit abroad, but if any honourable member rose to speak of it , he would probably be ridiculed. There is still a wide fiefd for voluntary effort. Every member of Parliament, every public man, and every public institution can take on the work of repatriation. It is the business side of the soldier's life to which attention should be given, and officialdom is probably the least fitted, to attend to it. While public activities may lay down the principles to be followed, they do not carry on the great industries of the country, primary or secondary It is only those who control the trade and commerce of the nation who possess the knowledge which will open up opportunities for the returned soldiers. A soldier is not repatriated by the giving of a financial dole, but) he may be by the opening up of new opportunities for him. . Por that reason I agree with the Minister when he asks for the co-operation of the whole community, but I do object when he shows no basis in his Bill for the cooperation of the States or the community at large. There has been a suggestion for the establishment of a national register, a record of the names of the men who have fought for their country. The principle is probably to be followed down by devolution to .the State Boards and the Local Committees. That is what we set out to do in our territorial scheme. First of all we endeavoured to get a register of all the men who enlisted from a particular district, and then a complete record was kept of those who fell in the fight,' and of those who had returned and were discharged. Each Local Committee had sub-committees, such as a claims committee, a works committee, and a finance committee, and in that way we had a complete organization, not a mere skeleton which does nob permeate to the country districts, such as we find in this Bill. their utmost in regard to land settlement; bufc before a soldier can be rer garded as eligible for repatriation he has to show, not that he has served his country or that he has a clean certificate of discharge, but that he is eligible for assistance, and three gentlemen decide as to his eligibility. Surely that should not be the case. Surely this Parliament should set out who are eligible,, and who are not. It) is done in the Pensions Aot and in other measures; why not, in this Bill? fairly elastic. that it defines nothing. The only clause that defines anything is clause 8, all the rest of the Bill being merely enabling machinery. Clause8 is only definite in thafc it passes onfcheresponsibility. I would not have spoken at such length, or wifch so much warmth had it not"" been for the fact that for over eighteen months I have had many experiences of applicantsfor assistance who have been turned down. I know that the War Councils have done their very best in the absence of a scheme. Mr 0. Morrice Williams, the chairmanof the Associated Banks, who is also chairman of the Central Repatriation Board, has approached the matter of repatriation with the utmost fervour. No one could have better intentions than he, or thosesitting with him on the Board, but the difficulty they have is that they have to become judges of the circumstancesof repatriation, and must exercise a purely personal discretion. If the Minister for Lands in a State Legislature caii take the whole responsibility of land settlement from A to Z, why cannob we have a Bill dealing with every branch of repatriation? Why cannot we say :Institutions shall be established for vocational training-the Minister says it in his speech-provisio n shall be made for industrial organization, there shall be a maximum or a minimum amount allowed to any soldier?

Fori n stance, we should have provided that all money advanced to a soldier who starts from scratch in either business or on the land shall be free of interest for five years. be correct, 40,000 soldiers will go upon the Under the scheme which has been adopted -the soldier settler becomes at once an in terest payer, and then a general taxpayer, twice paying interest on the money which the country borrowed for his repatriation. That is not repatriation; it is merely a lending of money. I wish to see some general sacrifice on the part of non-combatants, the men who did not bear arms, but who .during the war continued their business avocations, and derived profits which, never in the history of Australia, had accrued to. industry. There is no form of taxation to which a soldier will not be a contributor All these conditions are limitations of a scheme of genuine repatriation, and which would have been obviated if we had adopted a system of far greater co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. For a long time. I have held that the most favorable form of land settlement, having regard to the high prices of wool and meat, is stock farming, which would suit returned soldiers admirably. A man who goes into agriculture must understand every one of the several operations necessary to be performed on the farm. He musb understand farming machinery, and the management of horseflesh As a wheat-grower he works from 5 in the morning t ill "" feed u p "" at 9 at night. Thab form of settlement is not'suitable for the man without experience, and who is gradually returning to health farming is different; in it there is no drudgery. All the operations associated with it can be performed without straining or twisting a.war-worn body. capital for the greater part of the year. a man starts with 200 breeding ewes, half-a-dozen dairy cows, four breeding sows, and some poultry. The sheep will attend to their own increase. The ewes will require libtle attention. All the settler has to do is to milk half-a-dozen cows, and feed his pigs and poultry, and he is linked up ab once with ready money. There is an immediate return from the cows, pigs, and poultry. W it h the breeding ewes he has the means of starting to pay . off his principal and in terest;. These operations do not involve the purchase of machinery and implements, which are an enormous tax on a beginner. If the estimate of the Minister land. That means that 40,000 homes will require to be established. A t ithe present time all material for fencing and building is realizing high prices. I was amazed to read that the Victorian Minister for Lands( Mr Hutchinson) stated, when in troducing the State Repatriation B ill , that already he had received offers of 680 properties for sale. Those offers arise from the fact that the life of the man on the land has become a drudgery, or thati he has so long remained a target for taxation and industrial assaults, that his occupation has become uncongenial; or it may be that there have been overpurchases of land, and some people wish to realize in order to avoid further possible heavy taxation. This Parliament would let the settler know where he was if we told him that from the day he commences on his holding he should be free of liability for interest for a fixed term, the interest being paid by those who remained at home, and did not go to the war. In regard to the industrial side of repatriation, an opportunity is here afforded for the Commonwealth and the States, and particularly the Ministeri n charge of Repatriation, to become a pattern employer of labour, and particularly in reference to the returned soldier, who has played his part abroad. My belief is that Stockthe Ministerf o r Repatriation should also be created Minister for Industry. The time has come for a practical linking-up system in respect to all our industries. We have established a Department of Science and Industry, and the natural corollary is thab we should have a M i nister to give point and direction to its activities. I should like, therefore, to see the Minister for. Repatriation, who will have to re-absorb into civil life these 300,000 returned soldiers, appointed also Minister for Industry.",37,Fobbest Th E Returned

I hope that the Minister, in calling for the co-operation of the country, will show the people, and particularly those in control of the industries of Australia, just exactly how they can help. I am confident that they are only waiting to assist the Government. Many of our great institutions have made the most elaborate provisions for the return of their men. In some cases, they have made the most handsome provision for them, and many others are prepared to do the same. Unfortunately, however, this Bill does not show them any one direction in which they can co-operate with the Government. That, however, is a matter for administration, and the Government should at once show the community how it may co-operate with them. Finally, I say that we cannot overdo the matter of repatriation, if we only open up to every soldier who comes home an opportunity to make his lot in life materially, if not physically, better than it was before. We have said that when these men come back their country will not forget them, and I hope that even up to the time of final demobilization this Government will show the men, when they land on our shores once more, that we have truly kept "" the home fires burning."" Sir [2.54] -We have listened to two excellent speeches by the Leader of the. Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers). They have approached the consideration of this great question in the proper spirit. To approach it otherwise-to make it a matter of party politics-woul d be to discredit this Parliament. It has been properly said that the responsibility in regard to repatriation is that of every man and woman in the community. It is, however, the especial responsibility of the Government and the Parliament. It behoves every honourable member to give to the question the most thoughtful attention and consideration, so that we may -evolve a scheme that will be a credit to Australia. I welcome the Bill, late though it is. As has been mentioned, upwards of 25,000 men have already returned. Many have returned' in a condition of health which is in itself most deplorable. Many others have returned to suffer much disappointment, by reason of the fact that there is no well-defined or permanent scheme on the statute-book for the purpose of comprehensively dealing with *heir cases. Althoughi t is late in the day, therefore, I welcome the introduction of this measure. The subject of demobilization is a colossal one. The work of the Mother Country, particularly, will be almost staggering; but since she is so thoroughly accustomed to deal with gigantic problems, I am certain that she will dispose of this in the same comprehensive and effective way that she has dealt with others. With a relatively much smaller number of men to repatriate we should find the problem capable of being dealt with comprehensively and effectively, particularly having regard to our great and magnificent resources. I venture to think that we shall be wanting in initiation and resource if we are unable to do justice tattle men who have such claims upon us. The one thing which, above all, may be relied upon to make a success of the repatriation efforts of this Parliament is the patriotic spirit which permeates the whole community It was illustrated in typical fashion by a recent occurrence. Senator Millen called a conference of delegates from various States and other patriotic movements, with the result that the mosti representative men from all the States discover the best means of co-ordinating the administration and control of the various funds for the amelioration and relief of soldiers, as well as the control of patriotic appeals generally. They did valuable work. A characteristic feature of the conference was the earnestness with which the members dealt with the several questions with the object of doing justice to our men, and to make most effective the various patriotic schemes of the several States. Our problem is to provide for the training, the occupation, and the restoration to civil life of the brave Australian soldiers coming back to our shores. That is* the problem with which we have to deal, and I trust this Parliament will grapple with it with true earnestness. I am very .glad, to see that the first proposal is to repeal the existing Australian Repatriation Trustees Act. I do not for one moment blame the men who were appointed a Board of control for the failure of that Act . They did their work w it h every anxiety to do justice, but the scheme was formulated without experience and conceived on too narrow a basis. is desirable that there should be a committee or body in supreme control of this work, yet the Act seemed to have the effect of seriously hampering, and, indeed, destroying all local effort. It was felt that the Board was too remote; it was not in immediate personal touch with the soldiers If I remember rightly, the various War Councils were not called together at any time for the purpose of considering the best means of working the Act. Then, above all, reliance was placed on private contributions for the purpose of repatriation, an idea that was at once resented by the community as altogether wrongly conceived. national responsibility, and the fact ought to be engrained in our very fibre, if we are to do justice. I pay my tribute to the glorious work and magnificent services which have been rendered by the various War Councils, Red Cross Societies, and Patriotic Committees, which have shown exactly that public spirit and determination necessary in a work of this kind -their burden, as they have already, so No. man can have met returned soldiers, and conversed with them, without filled with emotion; and, personally, have had very painful experiences in this regard. be just which fails to comprehensively and individually deal with men who are broken in health, whose nerves are shattered, and who seem to have almost lost virility. idea at once that a mere grant of land or gift of money is a performance by us of our obligations. mind that each man is entitled to personal sympathy and individual -that broken in health must be nursed back to civil life and occupation. thab men have been discharged unfit for employment, health, and in a nervous condition, and thorSughly depressed in spirits. a state they have to be specially with, for if they are left to go on their own . responsibility to worse; they must be nursed, and given special sympathy and attention. come the suggestion tor Millen, that there shall be created curative instiSir Bobert Best. tutions. These institutions will have'the responsibility, I submit, of dealing individually with each soldier, discovering his Whilei t limitations, deciding what he is probably capable of performing, and of equipping each man for the battle of life. Nothing short of that will satisfy this House. The subject of finance has been mentioned. The suggestion of the Governmenb is that the necessary money shall be raisedin part from loan and in part from revenue. No matter how we raise bhe money the suggestion means some contribution by the returned soldier himself. I submit that, in our legislation, our efforts should be to relieve the soldier as far as we possibly can, particularly from any -taxation or any burden in connection with loans or contributions from the revenue, though, of course, this cannot be This is a great completely done. means relief from income taxation, and so forth. anxiety must be to give relief to the soldier. These men have helped to save Australia, and they are entitled to our consideration. We are called upon to bear nobly and,well, borne ours. being If I understand the policy of the GoI vernment, ib is that we shall discharge our duty to the soldiers, no matter what No measure of repatriation can the cosb may be. If that is their policy, I am with bhem right up to the hilt. Our duty is to formulate and endeavour to perfect, so far as possible, a scheme of their repatriation, and having done that on the We must get rid' of the mosti generous lines, it becomes a question of how the burden is to be borne by the community. Ib is quite true that We must ever bear in almost untold millions have been mentioned in this regard. It is impossible attention for anybody to determine what the every man who is maimed and scheme is going to cost. A wealth tax has been mentioned, and the suggestion It is deplored was made that something like £3,000,000 per annum would be required over the being in a low state of first two or three years. On further reflection, this was found to be a mistake, In such and that ib would be quite impossible fco dealt legitimately spend that amount. I recollect that when thafc proposal was made, my they drift from bad friend and partner, the Hon. Theodore Fink, who has given a close and enthuI welsiastic attention to the subject, published made by Senaa letter in which he estimated that the gross in introducing the Bill, expenditure for the first year or two would be little over £500,000 per annum, and",39,Fobbest Th E Returned
161,Mr Geoom,The honourable member,41,Robert Best Kooyong In Australia Met To Confer And To
162,Sir Robert Best,"Quite so; ourLis forecast has been more than, verified. Of course, men are beginning to return more rapidly, and this means a larger expenditure. Land settlement is probably the important and vital feature of the scheme. hope fchat the experience of the various States in this regard will ever be borne in mind. any of these men on unsuitable land, or in unsuitable localities. There are recognised essentials that must be borne in mind. must be selected, and the soil must be good. Next, proper preparation must be made in the shape of a homestead to receive the soldier, and there must be decent roads. Further, no man must be placed on the land unless he has been trained, and such men must be under constant supervision and care, and every encouragement afforded 'them to make their selections their permanent homes. all-important question is that of the terms on which these men are to be settled on the land. The fatal error must be avoided of permitting them to be overwhelmed with burdens at the beginning; they must be given a fair start. I protest against the dealings with our soldiers being conducted on hard and fast commercial lines, for these ought to be eliminated. They must have concessions, and either by way of lower valuations or the remission of purchase money, I lay it down as a fundamental principle that they are entitled to better terms than those afforded to the ordinary settler. Even so far as an ordinary settler is concerned, the land in some of the States is actually given to him, while in other States like my own the terms are so low, and so extended, as to make the purchase money merely nominal. In Western Australia, if I remember rightly, 160 acres, with a homestead, is given free; in Queensland, a leasehold is given for ninety-nine years at a peppercorn rent; in Canada, 160 acres is given free, with another 160 acres at 2 dol. per acre; in British Columbia free land is given, and on the Canadian Pacific line most generous and elaborate provision is made for settlement on extended terms. This brings me to the all-important question of land resumption. In all the to the soldier will be according to the States land has been resumed, though in price paid for the land, so that really it is some to a greater extent than in others. at his expense in the long run. To fix As a member of the State Parliament, I had the honour to introduce the system of closer settlement in Victoria, and 'while, in connection with this scheme, many successes are recorded, I am free to I admit that there have also been failures. These failures were because of mistakes in regard to locality, and the excessive It is futile to attempt to settle capital cost of the land The question, therefore, is as to the terms upon which this land shall be given to the soldiers. First of all, the proper locality sons for the failures ? are the outstanding causes of failure. Settlers who were overwhelmed with debt and responsibility could not possibly succeed, and the same result followed when inexperienced men were put on land. over the difficulty of inflated values? The matter of fact, that, when the Government comes into the market as a buyer, land booms in value; but in regard to the settlement of our soldiers, no man should be at liberty to extort excessive purchase money. There are, of course, one or two ways in which this difficulty of inflating values can be overcome. One is that which was resorted to in New Zealand, where power was taken by the Government to resume land at the price at which it was valued by the taxpayer. sult of that? The principle had to be abandoned. remember, the principle was resorted to with success in several cases, though, no doubt, mistakes were made. Probably the proper scheme would be the creation of expert valuation boards. the compulsory purchase, but at no greater values than those prevailing be-' fore the outbreak of the war. member largely anticipates me.

We need to safeguard the position to insure that excessive amounts by way of purchase money shall .not be paid for land. The land-owners have the responsibility, together with ourselves, of repatriating these men, and whilst endeavouring to do justice to them we must not fail to see that justice is also done to the community. In all the States, land has been purchased for closer settlement. Something like £11,000,000 has been spent in this connection. In Victoria alone £4,500,000 has been expended in the purchase of land at £ 7 10s. per acre; in New South Wales, £2,500,000 has been spent in acquiring iand at £ 3 10s. per acre; in Queensland under £2,000,000 has been expended in purchasing land at less than £ 3 per acre; in South Australia £1,750,000 has been spent in the purchase of land ati less than £ 3 per acre; and in Western Australia land has been resumed for a little less than £ 1 per acre.

I ask them to afford us an opportunity of assisting them in the perfecting of that scheme. I note that there have been several Premiers' Conferences on this matter. The last gathering of the kind was held in January, 1917, when the question of the settlement of returned soldiers on the land was specially mentioned. On ""that occasion it was resolved -and the scheme accepted by the Government practically follows upon the same linesference that the Commonwealth Government should agree to provide the necessary money on loan to the different States for the purpose of the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, such moneys to be advanced to soldiers for land settlement purposes on the terms and conditions of the following resolution of the conference held in Melbourne in February, 1916:"" 9. That loans to soldiers for land settlement purposes, as provided by resolution 3, We had will be advanced at reasonable rates of interest, not exceeding 3£ per cent, in the first year, increasing by $ per cent, each subsequent year to the full rate at which the money has been raised, plus working expenses; the difference between these -rates and the cost to the Government of the money to be borne equally by the Commonwealth Government and the State Government.""

I have very great sympathy with provisions securing permanent residence, which find an important place in Victorian land legislation. slaves to their land. it can be said to be as bad as that. Victorian Acts provide for residence for something like eighb months in the year. If we make all these encouraging efforts on behalf of returned soldiers I venture to hope that they will be adequately rewarded. Another resolution of the Conference to which I have referred suggests that where returned soldiers desire to privately purchase land, State Governments should make land valuers available for their assistance, and, further, that no claim for assistance on land privately purchased should be entertained until a Government valuator has reported upon the property. These seem to me to be reasonable suggestions. ThenI quote the following That is very important resolution:That it he a recommendation to the Prime Minister that returned soldiers, other than those qualified for a pension, be not discharged until they are certified physically fit to follow some occupation. Great mistakes have already been unwittingly made in this connection. I trusb that in future no man will be disphysically fit and qualified to take a place in the civil life of the community. The scheme of the Bill provides for seven Commissioners constituting the ReHaving secured the patriation Commission, and for various State Boards and Local Committees. I have already stated my objection to the press the hope that when the Government have formulated a .scheme they will submit it to Parliament for consideration. I approve of the proposal to appoint the Minister as President of the Repatriation Commission. That will at once create a link between the supreme body controlling repatriation and Parliament. We shall in this way be kept in close touch with what is being done, and may be in a position to assist in. the development of different schemes. providing for what is to be done in the event of a deadlock between the Minister and the Repatriation Commission.

Sir ROBERT BEST A deadlock might occur between the Minister and the other members of the Repatriation Commission ; but the Government holds the key to the position, both in regard to finance and the cancellation of the Commission's appointment. WhatI desire to specially mention in this regard is that the success of the Government scheme must largely 'depend on the ofiicers selected to carry it out.

208,Sir Robert Best,"There seems toi n Victoria splits itself up into various committees, dealing with employment, tion, amelioration, medical assistance , to discharged soldiers, and war funds. The State War Councils receive reports from these various committees, upon which they take action. Speaking of the Victorian War Council, I may be allowed to say that their record in procuring employment for returned soldiers is most creditable. They have secured positions for 6,000 men within a very few months. In regard to vocational training, I may say that they have done excellent work. The Educational Committee deals with vocational training, and returned men chosen by the Committee are learning wood-working, toy-making, boot-clicking, weaving, bookkeeping and accountancy, and a number of o'ther things. It is suggested that provision should be made for repatriation units dealing w it h Agricultural training; wool-classing training; trade training; clerical, bank, and municipal training; military training (special units in Permanent Forces) ; technical training; acquisition of small businesses.; farming (experienced men); shipping business training; mining business training; light occupations training (for permanently injured and disabled men); labour engagement unit (for experienced men ready to take up unskilled or skilled work of all kinds in the Public Service, or with private employers) ; any special units that may be neces^ sary. This vocational training is capable of indefinite expansion, and excellent work in this way is already being done by the State War Councils. Speaking of the Victorian War Council, with, the work of which I am more fami liar than with that of the War Councils of other States, I understand that they have already spent £52,000 upon repatriation. As regards amelioration, honourable members can scarcely realize the necessity for some body immediately approachable to meet emergent claims on behalf of soldiers and their families. have the men restored to health. institutions w ill do much in that direction. The Victorian War Council has spent .£40,000 in giving immediate relief to various soldiers and their dependants. Nothing could be more degrading, or more demoralizing, than to permit soldiers to go about the streets appealing for aid to the people whom they' meet. There are, of course, individual cases that it is vocational training, repatriaalmost impossible to deal with, but apart f j o m them, meritorious cases of men and their dependants must not be ignored. There must be some institution immediately available for this purpose. There is in Victoria a War Funds Committee, which exercises control over all efforts to raise money for patriotic purposes, examines balance-sheets, and generally controls them. Thenthey have their Red Cross Fund, and the Red Cross Artificial Limbs Fund, while blind soldiers and war widows have been specially looked after. These form the nucleus of what can be comprehended within the scheme whicli has been developed by the Government. I hope what has been urged by those who have preceded me, and by myself, with regard to the scheme the Government are formulating will be borne in mind.

Australia look to the National Government and Parliament to take the whole of it , and will not be satisfied with its delegation to of secondary industries. the States. If they do so, We shall have some hope of formulating a scheme that will do justice, and be a credit, to Australia. I hope what I have to say will reach the high plane of the remarks of the previous speakers. No party tinge should be brought into this question, and I can promise that nothing of that complexion will pass . my lips. It is the greatest and most momentous question, second only to that of winning the war, that Australia can face. We are the only continent which has its lands almost vacant of human beings. The other continents are either over populated, according to our ideas, or are tendunder the direction of H . A. Hunt, Coming in that direction. That is certainly the case with the continent of North America, where over 100,000,000 English speaking people are under the flag of our splendid Ally. I purpose to concentrate my remarket on the conservation of water as one.of-the most important means of settling the soldiers, whom I hope we shall welcome back with open arms, and also the numerous members of the European races who will surely come to Australia when this deluge of murder that men call war is ended, and peace is made. No one can deny that the greatest argument that can be used to induce white people to come to Australia is the high pay our soldiers receive, and the magnificent efforts that this country has made, certainly with a huge continent to draw on, but with only 5,000,000 people. The English ""Tommy"" fighting as bravely as our boys, shoulder to shoulder with them, will say, "" I am going to get to that country which can pay its soldiers 6s. a day and give them the right of citizenship that only one person out of six in. England possesses."" How much more will that appeal to the people of our Allies, who are fighting the battle of liberty with us ? I am glad to be able to congratulate the Government on the fact that in the amendments to be proposed to the Bill they are going to give to men of the British race, coming from any of the four little nations that form the United Kingdom, the same rights as are to be given to onr fellow Australians. [93]2 The conservation of water will lead to the extension of our primary industries; but let me point out what Japan, another of our splendid Allies, is doing in the way Japan within the span of an ordinary life, not even extending to the allotted three score years and ten, has made such progress that she is prepared to launch this year ninetyseven steamers, with an aggregate tonnage of 400,000. Why cannot we make ships? We are 5,000,000 people, or only oneeleventh of the population of Japan, but would not every member be proud if we could launch even one-eleventh of the number of ships being launched by Japan, a nation that fifty or sixty years ago knew nothing about iron manufactures in that connection ? I have before me a contour map, with the following inscription:-""Prepared at the Central Weather Bureau, Melbourne, monwealth Meteorologist, by M . J. K i r ton, from contours and data by Griffiths Taylor, D.Sc, E.E.G.S., Physiographer."" Oni t is shown the Murray River Basin, covering portions of Queensland, Hew South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. In that basin lies the safety and hope for the future of Australia. There is enough water falling from the clouds to keep, if properly conserved, a population equal to that of France and Germany combined in happiness and comfort. We have been most wasteful in that regard, and have not expended what we should in water conservation. The repatriation of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and the settlement of many sturdy representatives of our Allies, is a problem not only of continental interest, but of Imperial significance.

A f t e r this war is over, when we have to face the task of repatriating our soldiers and sailors, we must make the conservation of water the great question for Australia. think continentally on this subject, and others urged us to think Imperially. care little for the choice of words, but we must consider it both Imperially and continentally, because we are fortunately placed as the only race fchat owns a continent ruled, broadly speaking, the one set of laws, and inhabited by tongue. Our opportunities are great, and the responsibility placed on our shoulders to make the best use of the continent given into our charge is great in proportion. We should give the soldiers the greater privileges, for the honor they did to the country of their birth by offering to sacrifice their lives in its defence. We owe them everything we can do for them for fighting under the flag of liberty, not only for us, but for the whole world. It w ill be admitted that the war would have been won or lost, even if Australia had not existed, yet Australia, w it h its few thousand men-sen t from its few millions of people-ha s done splendid work in the war. Here, within Australia, is a greater work ready to our hands, waiting to be done for humanity, than has been done even in this terrible conflict. We can settle 500,000 men on the land or in various industries, out our promise to our own soldiers, and make good the invitation we gave, even previous to the war, to the people of white races to come here and settle. In order to be able to approach this question in its broadest aspect, I have obtained this contour map, through the kindness of Mr terior, settle people in the River MurHunt, whom I take this opportunity thanking for his invariable courtesy. copy of this map is placed in front of the Town Hall, Melbourne., and I hope another will be placed in front of the Post Office, so that the citizens, passing by may see at a glance the immense possibilities of the Murray River Basin, and also of the Salt Lake Basin, of which the centre is Lake Eyre, in South Australia. part some day, I believe, will be made amagnificent source of fresh water by saving and concentrating the rainfall. The Treasurer ( Sir John Forresfc), by a Br. Moloney. statesmanlike action, and with the assistance of that genius in hydraulic engineering ( Mr O'Connor), made it possible for the gold-fields of Western Australia to be supplied with water. I remind honourable members of that statue in Fremantle to Mr Deakin asked us to his memory, which I compare to the statue of De Lesseps at the entrance of the SuezI Canal, and if his end was enshrouded in pathos, may it not rivet his achievements on our memory ? The Treasurer has every reason to be proud of his association with that great undertaking in the interests of by the Western-Australian gold-fields, and I desire to see the same principle applied on a people speaking . the one a national scale for the repatriation of our soldiers. We have been told that 40,000 of our fighting men desire to be settled on the land, and that the Government will make an advance of £500 for each soldier settler. This will represent a total of £20,000,000. But if it should be £100,000,000, or even £200,000,000, I would not care, provided we effectively settled the basin of the River Murray and -its tributaries w it h a teeming population of prosperous settlers. We want to build more of such places as Leeton-that splendid garden city of New South Wales, the plans of which were drafted by that great architect, Mr Griffin; we want fco build more towns like Griffith-name d after a New South Wales Ministermore Renmarks and more Milduras Are honourable members aware that land at Mildura has reached a value, based on its returns, of £1,000 per acre? What is if we carry there to prevent land all along the Murray and its 'tributaries from producing to the same extent? Australia to-day is a continent embroidered with coastal cities and settlements, with the exception of the far north and the north-west Let us go into the inof ray basin, build there prosperous cities A that will be the glory of bhis Commonwealth, and insure the success of those secondary industries known under the generic term of manufactures. This seems a policy eminently suited for our brave men who went to the Front to fight for their country. They have shown themselves to be possessed of the spirit of the That pioneers, and it is fitting that their future life work should be in this sphere of acsupply, tivity. The rivalry of the future will be, not in the arts of war, but in the arts of peace, and progress will be made along the lines of commercial discoveries, making it possible to secure the maximum production from our land. I desire to direct attention to the enormous waste being caused by the dredging system in some of our most fertile river valleys. Honourable members will, T know, appreciate the statement) made by Professor N . S. Shaler, who, in his book Man and the Earth, astounded the world when he remarked on the tremendous waste caused by the rain washing the fertile soil of the ploughed ground to the brooks, to the rivers, and to the streams, there to be lost for ever. waste from the soil washing to the sea is a slow, but sure, national calamity, it is negligible compared with the loss each year due to waste caused by lack of organized effort. were organized as a co-operative community, and taught the possible economies of work, there would be a saving of labour, besides which the cost of building dredges, operating a tremendous settling basin, and transporting the fertile soil back to the land from which it came, would be insignificant. Moreover, there would still be a surplus of labour more than sufficient to erect reservoirs in thousands, develop every water power in the country, and build and maintain enough wind engines to supply the heat, light, and power wants of mankind. I have no hesitation in saying that if Australia were organized in a scheme to assist our soldiers we would be able to insure the successful settlement of. tlie Murray Valley basin, which would become one of the most fertile areas in the world. Let us look at the disposition of our population. stands pre-eminently in the least desirable position of all the countries in the world. Melbourne contains 49 per cent, of the total population of Victoria, Sydney holds 41 per cent, of the people of New South Wales, Brisbane 24 per cent, of the -Queensland people, Adelaide 46.5 per cent, of South Australia's population, Perth 3S per cent, of the people of Western Australia, Hobart 19 per cent, of all the people in Tasmania. this with the percentage population in some of the principal cities of Europe. London contains 20 per cent, of the population of England, Brussels8 per cent, of the Belgian population, Berlin contains only 3 per. cent, of the people in the mighty German Empire, Paris7 per cent, of the people in France, Vienna7 per cent, of the Austrian population, and Petrograd only 1.4 per cent, of the huge population of between 170,000,000 and 1S0,000,000 people comprising the Russian Empire. The position in Australia cannot be regarded as healthy, and it should be our endeavour to make rural life as attractive as possible, so that this disparity between those engaged in rural pursuits and those employed in our secondary industries shall not be so marked in the future. In this respect Bussia has accomplished wonWhilst the derful results, for in Siberia she settled 21,000,000 serfs in rural occupations without the loss of a single life, and at a cost of only £300,000,000, the area allotted to e(ach family being between In fact, if the workers 30 and 40 acres. All country towns, as they were established, were supplied with all the necessary conveniences, including even the apothecary, the"" blacksmith's establishment, and the local hotel. 1 now ask honourable members to think of the result achieved in the highest epoch of the Anglo-Saxon race in America, where 4,000,000 slaves were freed at a cost of 500,000 human lives, and an expenditure of £1,500,000,000. This great civil war, moreover, did not settle one single family on the soil, but merely changed the status of the people from slavedom to that of wagedom, under which frequently they were obliged to beg from the farms or estates on which they had been reared. Let us t r y 'to emulate the noble example set to us by Bussia, and let us see that the treatment meted out to our soldiers will be different from that experienced by them at the close of the In this respect Australia South African war. The Government of the day promised that returned soldiers would be looked after, money was subscribed for that purpose, but the promise was vilely broken, and even now I understand there is in hand a sum of between £30,000 and £40,000 which should have been expended on the wives and children of those who suffered during that war. I was opposed to that war, and though I was called a pro-Boer, and Let us compare gloried in it , I never dreamed that Great Britain, when she had her enemy helpless at her feet, would extend to them a greater freedom than they had ever enjoyed. The fruits of that policy are seen in the present war, in which a gratef u l people is now fighting on England's side for the liberties of the world. The Boers of South Africa have shown that they deserve to he trusted, and have written a glorious page in the annals of Great Britain. our soldiers were not honoured when they returned from South' Africa, but one man ( Sir John Madden), to his honour, protested publicly against the violation of that undertaking. gard to fche repatriation of our soldiers in this war is not a pledge by the Commonwealth Government only, but a pledge given by the whole of the States, and it is our diitv to honour it . tempted to think that the soldiers, after their free life at the Front, will not care for ' a "" cribb'd, cabin'd and confih'd "" life in the cities. and, to the honour of their employers, they were given their old positions, but they could not stay here. As soon as they felt the rich red blood pulsing in their veins, they went and volunteered again. They said, "" W h e n we return, we must go on the land; we must have a wider life than we had here previously."" The problem of making large areas within Australia immune .from drought is a difficult one, because of the scarcity of water supply. If we take an area which includes portions of four States, say, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and which is known as the Murray Basin, we find the Murray, the Darling, the Murrumbidgee, and all their tributaries flowing through it. That is shown in detail on the map to which I have referred. But nothing can really show the eye or prove to the brain of man the splendid opportunities we have in the Murray Basin. Take the area from the Burrinjuck to the Darling, with all its tributaries, going away into Queensland on a level with Bundaberg, and coming back to the Murray. Ifc has been proved by actual gaugings that only onesixteenth of the water which goes into the Murray reaches the sea. What becomes of the balance? Ifc must go somewhere. It is 'percolating into the depths of Australia, and our duty is' to t ry to save the water which Is now lost. The rivers I have mentioned Australia's largest arterial system. find that, in this area, there are 7.400,000 acres of irrigable land, which it is the duty of _ the States and the Commonwealth utilize efficiently by conserving and distributing the waters. has already voted the sum of £1,000,000 for this ourpose. Dr. Mnlonei/. the report of the Inter-State Royal Commission on the River Murrayi n 1902. Referring to a report to President The promises made to Roosevelt on this very subject, the Commission say, on page 28The Secretary of tlie Interior, in bis report to the President, of November, 1901, said, ""In my report for 1900, attention was drawn to the The promise in re.importance of providing, through wise administration, for the creation of homes for millions of people upon the arid but fertile public lands."" ' It is an ascertained fact tliat arid lands One is become the most fertile once water is supplied. In Egypt, for instance, one sees life on one side where water is supplied to the land, and absolute death on the other Men have come back, side where the sands of the desert are not supplied with water. "" There is no function within the power of the Government higher than tliat of making possible the creation of prosperous homes."" In his speech at Minneapolis, Mr Roosevelt,said, "" Throughout our country, the success of the home maker has been but another name for the up building of the nation."" President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress, delivered 3rd December, 1901, made some statements that well deserve quoting. He said, "" In the arid region, it is water, and not land, whicli measures production. The western .half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to-day if tlie waters that now run to waste were' saved and used for irrigation. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams, and to save the flood waters. Their construction has been shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual States acting alone. Far-reaching Inter-State problems are involved, and the resources of single States would often be inadequate. It is properly a national function, at least in some of its features. It is as right for the National Government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works of water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors, of the humid region by engineering of another kind. The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country. It would be unwise, to begin by doing too much, for a great deal will doubtless be learned both as to what can and what cannot be safely attempted, by the early efforts, whicb must of necessity be partly experimental in character. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish, personal, or local interests, but only in accordance with the advice constitute of trained experts, after long investigation has I shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make tlie work most needed, and fraught with the greatest usefulness to tlie community as a whole. There should be no exto travagance, and the believers in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeThe Commonwealth ing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of public Here let me quote from money.""

A settler who may adopt dairying as a "" pot-boiler,"" whilst f r u it trees or vines are coming into bearing, or as a permanent revenue producer, is assisted in the purchase of dairy stock. The amount of help given depends, inter alia, on the quantity of planted feed a settler has in sight. A deposit is payable in respect of each cow purchased, the payment of the balance being by monthly instalments spread over two years. chinery and implements may be hired up to the limi t of the Commissioner's plant. Government Savings Bank Commissioners have statutory power to make loans upon mortgage of irrigation farm leases; many settlers have, already obtained help from the bank. actual terms on which assistance is granted by the Commission are subject to alteration as may be deemed necessary, but the information given above outlines the system at present adopted. freights are made on the New South Wales railways to bond, fide applicants for land. The annual charge for water (5s. per acre foot) is reduced to one-half for the first year, and is then increased yearly by sixpence per acre foot, so that a settler is not required to pay the f u l l charge u n t i l he is in the sixth year of occupation. Townships have been established at centres of the Yanco and Mirroolareas; the Commissioner is empowered to construct streets, and to provide water supply, sanitary and other services. A butter factory, equipped w i th the. latest plant and with the capacity for dealing with the product of 10,000 cows, has been established. Cash payments are there made monthly for cream supplied by the settlers, who are thus assured of an immediate and regular income, and placed in the position to turn their „ attention to other forms of farming, if they so .desire. A vegetable and f r u it canning factory has also been provided, at which vegetables and fruits grown by the settlers are purchased from them. ' A bacon factory and abattoirs also have been erected, and although their operations are at the present time being confined to slaughtering for the butchers operating in the district, and bacon curing, they may, no tlie settlement develops, be extended to include also the chilling of f a t lambs for the local or export market. It is felt that for some years to come the plant w ill be capable of dealing not only with the pigs produced on the settlement, but with considerable numbers from districts in the Riverina outside the i r r i gation areas. The Mirrool settlement being situated over 30 miles from Leeton, settlers carrying on dairying there have been under great disadvantages owing to the difficulty attending the transport of cream. To obviate this, a small DT. Maloney. cheese factory has been opened at M in o o l. Experiments already carried out have proved that a good marketable cheese can be produced on the irrigation areas. As an adjunct Lucerne seed is supplied to the canning factory, a pulping plant also has been installed at Mirrool, the idea being to forward the pulp to the central cannery for working up during the slackseason. One of the most important departmental undertakings on the irrigation areas is undoubtedly the State Nursery. For some years past the Leeton Nursery has been supplying trees to settlers, and this year a second nursery is being established at Mirrool. Every effort is made to supply only the very best trees, free from disease, and, to insure this, aa much use as possible is being made of budding wood from proven trees in the Leeton Nursery, and at the Yanco Experiment Farm. Pedigree bulls may be leased. MaA State Experiment Farm and an Official Vegetable Experiment Plot are in operation, The and various commercial crops are also tested on settlers' farms as to their suitability for Ioeal cultivation. The methods of treatment and the marketing of the different products The are being investigated, and the experience thus gained is at the disposal of settlers, free information and instruction being afforded by the Government officials on all agricultural matters and irrigation methods.. An electric powerConcessions in railway fares and house has been erected near Yanco Siding; electric light and power are supplied to the business people, and are available for settlers when the number of applicants warrants the connexions being made. On the 31st December, 1915, 881 farms were held, representing a total area of 40,546 acres. The revenue payable by these farms for rent and water rates is £28,147. In addition, 118 township and village blocks are in occupation, the annual -rentals for which aggregate £1,071, while 272 miles of roads, 305 miles of reticulation channels^ and 217 miles of drains have been constructed. In the matter of cultivation, the following particulars indicate the extent of the work performed by the settlers:-On e thousand two hundred acres under stone fruits, 225 under vines, 327 under citrus fruits, 2,210 under lucerne, 10,350 under otlier fodder crops, and 450 acres under vegetables. The estimated population of the irrigation area is about 5,000 persons, and the production this season is estimated at a gross value of £100,000.

Another recommendation is to provide from the Murray storage waters to augment the Goulburn Weir by a canal running from the Murray to the weir. The Victorian Government are now enlarging the cubic capacity of the Waranga Reservoir, and eventually water will gravitate therefrom to the town of Brim, in the Northern Wimmera. supply, when completed, will provide for closer settlement and limited irrigation. There are other schemes, such as the Tooleybuc proposal for tapping the Murray a few miles north of SwanH ill , and watering the greater portion of the Mallee. This Tooleybuc proposal would provide water for stock and domestic purposes, but not for irrigation. Some years ago it was advocated boring the Mallee to augment the water supply, and there can be no doubt most of the Mallee can be watered from the sub-artesian supply of the hydraulic grade. As far as the Darling is concerned, irrigation can only be accomplished by pumping, and at best would be only limited. This river should be locked, and every drop of the flood water accounted for, and the surplus diverted to fill the many lakes which lie between Wilcannia and Wentworth. The following catchments have been explored at the head waters of the Lachlan: The head waters of the Macquarie, the : head waters of the Hunter, Namoi, and the Peel Rivers; but there are many other catchments in the mountain ranges still to be investigated, particularly at the sources of streams in the humid areas, where the rainfall is 30 inches and upwards. The diversion of waters where the rainfal l is from 30 inches to 40 inches or over to by men of coloured races. Australia is streams conveying water to areas where the rainfall is 15 inches, appears to me to be an imperative necessity for the complete population of the Murray Basin; but these mountain reservoirs are not within the present scope of practicability. I merely point out the possibility, in my anxiety bo show that every drop of water that falls in Australia should be accounted for. It might interest honourable members to know that of all the rain which falls in the Murray Basin which is collected in the catchment and flows along the river courses, only one-sixteenth of it reaches the Southern Ocean. proved by gauging at the Murray mouths. Consequently, fifteen-sixteenths of the Murray Basin rainfal l goes somewhere, and the question is, where? engineers tested two sites at Dora Dora and Wagra, the diamond drill proved bhat solid rock could only be obtained at Dora Dora 144 feet from the surface, and 205 feet at Wagra, showing the possibilities of percolation of the waters there to feed subterranean channels for some sub-artesian or This water even artesian supplies. The great Australian Artesian Basin has a greater area than the Murray Basin, which is as large as France and Spain combined. In other words, the great Australian Artesian Basm measures 569,000 square miles. It is the greatest artesian basin in the world, and has been tapped by thousands of bores. Queensland members know of its great potentialities. sank through more than 1,200 feet before striking the rock. the greatest proved depth of soil in the world. I have touched lightly on what next to the settlement of this war and the securing of peace, is the most i m portant matter that we have to consider. Terrible as the present deluge of blood is, it would be a bagatelle to that which would occur if ever there were a contest between the East and the West. In my opinion, the race which ultimately holds this continent-which.a t present is almost barren of population-will , whatever may be its colour, dominate the world. Europe and America are subject to the white races; and Asia, the largest continent in the world, as well as A f r i c a , is dominated the last heritage on this rock that we call the earth, of the teeming millions that are to come Who can look into the future and say what race w ill , in the long run, hold Australia? Who can say what is in the lap of the gods so f a r as this country is concerned? When the Homeland called to her children for help in this, the greatest war the world has ever seen' she did not call in vain, and Australia was not found lacking. This country, to its eternal honour, has done more than Canada, more than South' Africa, and more than New Zealand; but, great as This is have been her achievements in war, how much greater w ill be her honour if , when peace comes again, she can hold out her arms m wide welcome to the inhabitants When the of the four httle Kingdoms which, like",48,Robert Best Ther E Must That This Committee Recommends To The Con

There are reservoirs beneath this Australian soil of ours far greater than man could build, with walls thicker than the genius of man has ever conceived, and in them,are stored immense quantities of water. Some scientists have thought that the immense mountains of India form a catchment area for water which percolates through strata underlying the Indian Ocean, until it reappears in Australia. I understand that this opinion is beginning to be modified, but it is worthy of mention. It may be that the genius of the white race inhabiting Australia will, in the future, make use of the snow and ice that now lies unused on the top of the high mountains in Papua, and, bringing it under the sea which separates this country from New Guinea, and has a depth of only from 40 to 60 feet, will make it available for the irrigation of our dry country. That, as an engineering achievement, would be as great in comparison with anything that has yet been attempted, as was the convoying of water to the gold-fields of Western Australia over a distance of 400 miles, greater than anything previously attempted. It may be, too, that, by a breach in the low ridge below the depression known as the Gulf of Carpentaria, water will be brought into Lake Eyre, which, at present, like all lakes from which sympathetic. It will take Ministers all there is no outlet, is salt. Future Australians may see the centre of this country in a condition similar to that in which, according to Professor Spencer, the natives of Australia once behold it, with trees growing again on the margin of the lake, and large animals-the existence of which in former times is proved by their fossil remains-inhabitin g country that now is mostly arid, except when the winter rains fill the depressions. I welcome the Bill, and am sorry that about as good as can be expected at the Parliament has not been able to consider present time. The speech delivered by it earlier, so that the repatriation scheme Senator Millen in outlining the scheme might be nearer adoption. Splendid atshows that a great deal of attention, intempts at repatriation were made in the telligence, and sympathy has already been beginning by honourable members of this brought to bear upon it House, and certain private' individuals, and these were supplemented by a parliamentary appropriation of £250,000; but it soon became apparent that the question was too big for private control. While some districts might provide well for the returned men whom they had sent to the war, in others, returned soldiers would not be so well treated; and, to secure that all returned men shall be on an equal footing in this matter, repatriation has been taken up by the nation. This is an extremely, wide and complex matter, which can be dealt with adequately only by the National Parliament. The scheme is one of which the country should be proud; and I trust that the result may equal our fondest hopes. We are considering a unique proposal, nothing of the kind having been attempted before. It was said after the' South African war that the promises made to those who had gone to represent Australia were not fulfilled, and it is the determination of our people that that shall not be said after tliis war. It may not be possible to do all that we . wish to do, but the country should do all that it can for those who, at the risk of life and limb, have maintained our national safety. I do not agree with those who take exception to the Bill because the Government scheme of repatriation is not outlined on its face I do not see how it it possible to lay down a definite scheme in a matter which is so varied, which is likely to have so many new phases from time to time, and of which we have very little practical knowledge. It must be left to .administration-earnest , clever, and, above all, their time to find a man with sufficient ability and qualifications to carry out their scheme and administer it as it should be administered. The Government propose to have a Central Commission of seven members, with a Commonwealth Minister as chairman; a Board of seven members in each State, and district committees, which will be intrusted with work in certain localities. The members of these Boards will do their work voluntarily, and where possible, returned soldiers will be appointed. The scheme seems to me to be",54,Robert Best Ther E Must That This Committee Recommends To The Con
221,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [4.41],"The objectt of this B ill is to restore our returned, soldiers, wherever possible, to the positions they previously held in civil life, and various schemes are outlined whereby men who have been disabled and are not able to perform the work in which they were previously engaged may be set up in such a way as to enable them to earn their living in other callings. This is very necessary, because if our returned soldiers are not able to follow occupations they will be compelled to live on their pensions, and in this way will not be such a valuable asset to the country as they would be if they are able to pursue some calling. various means by which our soldiers, when they return, may be rendered capable of , following different occupations-for in t stance, curative workshops, which will be attached to hospitals, and artificial limb factories. There will also be an attempt to establish industries not already f u l l y in operation in Australia, for which there should be plenty of scope.. An attempt will be made to establish a system of what is called reserve employment-that is to say, men will be employed at some occupation which will keep them going until . they find something. at which they wish to settle down permanently. work and employment on the Murray River locking scheme are suggested as good stop-gaps in this connection. But at this juncture we cannot expect any further details than Senator Millen has outlined in his speech. While I do not agree with all that I have heard in the chamber to-day in respect to landsettlement, I hope that the Commonwealth will be able to get some guarantee that when the States choose the land it will be suitable for the men for whom it is intended, and that great care will be taken to see that the men chosen to settle on the land w ill be suitable for work upon it . hope, but we can do nothing more. good chance of making the returned soldiers suitable for land settlement, because training schools are to be established, to the cost of which fhe Commonwealth and the States are to contribute equally. If a man wishes to become an orchardist and does r o t know anything about) f r u it growing he can attend a training school until he is fif to run an orchard. If a man is not sufficiently expert at agricultural work, he can attend a training school and be taught farming. Many of our returned soldiers have had little to do with work on the land, but it will be hard fco. keep them off it if they desire to become farmers. Their interests, as well as those of the Stale, will be better conserved, if they are compelled to go into training schools to leam the business of farming before they actually launch out for themselves. Provision is made for this in the B ill . The matter of dealing with the land should be left in the hands of the Senator Millen has proposed States, so long as we are guaranteed that suitable land w ill be obtained for the men, and that great care w ill be taken to see that the men are fitted for the occupation in which they are to engage. If this is done the scheme should be attended with success. is that uniformit y w ill not be secured. We should have passed our measure first, and then the States could have passed similar legislation. at uniformity, or to lay down a hard and Forestry fast rule, when dealing w i th such a complex matter. We must feel our way as we go along. If this scheme is to be successful, it w i ll be achieved by elasticity rather than by rigidity in the Statute under which it is administered. Elasticity will enable the administration to adapt it self to new phases as they arise from day to day and from week to week. It w ill be a long time before all the men w ill be returned to our shores, and we shall learn from day to day how best to adapt the scheme to cases which have to be met. To lay down hard and fast lines and say that the men must conform to this or must conform to that would be like sendinga man to a tailor and allowing the latter to make the man fit the suit instead of compelling him to make the suit fit the man. Failure is likely to follow the laying down of hard and fast lines. We must meet circumstances as they arise. So long as the State authorities work earnestly and sympathetically with us in this matter, we should leave as much as we can to them, because they have the necessary machinery already in existence for dealiaj with land matters. In any case, the repatriation of our soldiers is as much the business of the States .as it is the business of the",55,Robert Best Ther E Must That This Committee Recommends To The Con

225,Mr Atkinson,"It is hard to arriveCommonwealth. It is the duty of the whole community to see that repatriation is a success, not only i h order to make reparation to those men who have taken such great risks on our behalf, but also .because the more soldiers that are re-established and become prosperous in good positions in civil life the better asset they will be to the community. Whatever the land settlement scheme will cost, the country will get its money back. speculators w ill get the most of it . that matter in a moment or two. If we stimulate production, we shall secure a return for the money we put into the land. If we find blocks suitable for the men to go on, and if the men are actually able to pay for them in time, it w ill be so much the better for them and so much the better for the community, but it w ill be the duty . not only of the Commonwealth Government, but also of the State Governments and of every individual in the community, to see that that end is attained. While the matter of repatriation has been taken out of private hands, the Government still desire that private work shall be continued, in order to supplement the Government activities. The extension of the scheme to Local Committees should stimulate local interest in repatriation work, and may induce many private people to help in anything the Government may do. A t any rate there is nothing in the B ill to prevent this except, perhaps, that the Government require that the money raised in any particular district must not be spent on particular men in the district, but must be f a i r l y spread over the returned soldiers belonging to that district. That seems to me to be a fair proposition. The honourable member for Melbourne Port's ( Mr Mathews) has interjected that land speculators w ill do well out of this land settlement scheme. If we have not learned anything from previous schemes that have been attempted in the various States, his statement will be only too true; but surely we have learned from the various inquiries and commissions that have sat in connection with land schemes in Australia sufficient to avoid the pitfalls and dangers that beset the path of a Government which goes out to buy land. I believe that those dangers can be avoided if due care is taken. As soon as the Government agents go to work with a large amount of money for the purchase of land in any district up will go the price of land. We cannot expect the returned soldiers to go upon the land, no matter how good it is, if it is overburdened with capital charges from the start. They must be given a reasonable .prospect of making a success of their business. of the land An important feature of the scheme' are the proposals for dealing with apprenI shall deal with tices. Many men, who had served a portion of their apprenticeship before they lef t for the Front, are incapacitated for further following that occupation on their return. It will be a very difficult problem to fit such men for some other occupation at which they can be expected to make a living. It will be an extremely sad state of affairs if men who could have learnt an occupation by which to supplement their pensions are left to idle about with no income but the small amount they receive from the Government. The Minister is seriously striving to avoid that undesirable consequence, and I hope he will succeed. Another problem relates to the apprentice who, having discontinued his apprenticeship in order to go to the war, desires to resume practically at the point he would have reached had he remained constantly in his position. Yet he is not skilful enough at his trade to earn the money he would have been receiving in the ordinary course of events. The Government propose to make good the difference between what the man was earning before he went to the Front, and what he would have been earning had his apprenticeship been continuous. That proposal is all right so far as it goes, but it will require to be operated with great care. MrH a r t , of the Workingmen's College, points out that there will be a danger, unless the apprentice receives sound training at a technical school, or some other institution of the kind, of doing.both him and the country an injury. He may be content to draw the money which the Government will pay him, and not attempt to make himself efficient, whereas if he were properly handled he could be developed into a f u l l y qualified craftsman. I hope the Government will give consideration to Mr Hart's advice. The Leader of the Opposition expressed a fear that the",56,Robert Best Ther E Must That This Committee Recommends To The Con

Now we are setting out on a bigger -scheme-no t something in the nature of an immediate proposal, but something which w ill establish and perpetuate in concrete for m evidence of our intention to be true to our promises, and to be honest towards the soldiers. This repatriation business looms larger the more one thinks of it . In a general way, we freely recognise it as a duty ; but, when we come to consider its application and operation, we find ourselves confronted w it h some very serious and peculiar difficulties. I , for one, am prepared to give the Government every consideration, and a great amount of latitude, in seeking to establish such a scheme as is now proposed. We are sailing across an uncharted sea; we are experimenting with something that has.never been tried before. Mr J. H . CATTS -We have had «ouple of years of experience. any other country has yet faced a repatriation proposal, and we have nothing to land. We have new industries to build guide us in launching this system. men in the Old -Country furnishes a very industries we have.

Our most rethink, therefore, that the patriotism of cent experience was that gained in dealthe people of the Commonwealth will find ing with the men who returned from the a very useful salutary and happy outlet Boer war. I should be very sorry if the in this repatriation proposal. experience of the men who served the Empirei n that war, on returning to Australia, were repeated in this case. The people have subscribed most liberally, and thousands of pounds have been raised. I saw a list of questions locally may be retained to an extent for that were submitted to returned soldiers local purposes. Senator Millen, who inon their return from SouthA f r i c a , and to troduced this B ill in the Senate, stated which they were invited to provide replies that £109,355 had been collected, and when seeking assistance from the funds that with the Government's contribution provided. Speaking from memory, there of £250,000, they had thus a total of were about thirty-four questions-question s £359,355. . which had no concern whatever with the work in which the man had been engaged. the central fund . They related fo the position of his father and mother. He was asked where they were born; when they came to this count r y ; what money they had in the bank; whether their lives were insured; what property they possessed; and raanv other questions. The position I take up is that these men have rendered a service to the country, and are entitled to consideration and recognition irrespective of their social or financial position, or that of their parents or relatives. Our experience in regard to previous warsI do not refer to those wars in which Australia has been specially engaged-ha s nofc been very commendable. We read a good deal about the glory of the British arms, and of the splendid victories of our troops. We hear fine eulogies of. the officers and men,, but when the war is over the men are forgotten. Nothingi u fhe past has been more pathetic than the spectacle of crippled soldiers struggling, if not begging, for a living, or having to pawn their decorations to find the wherewithal for food. It shows that the world, after all, is advancing when we in this country are realizing that there' ought to be something more than that for old and disabled soldiers. If Australia in this matter can a give a lead to other countries so much the better for our credit. Australia, in submitting a scheme of repatriation, has, perhaps, opportunities that few countries possess. We have vast reaches of idle up. We have far from overtaken our expansion-opportunitie s for extensionI It is provided in the B ill that the various Repatriation Funds that have been so far collected shall be merged in the one general repatriation scheme, but there is a provision thab moneys collected that there have been a number of collections in local centres for this purpose, and with these it is not proposed to interfere.

237,Mr Finlayson,"Yes. We knowgard to the finding of finances will almost, if nofc entirely, cease. There will be little or no inducement for local patriotic or charitable effort since those who give in bhat way will have to submit to a double dose, so to speak, having regard to the taxation which blie Commonwealth will have to impose in order fco raise the money required for this purpose. I do not think the Government need worry themselves very much as to the voluntary contributions that may flow into the fund after this scheme is launched. We shall have to depend upon taxation either to find the money itself or to find interest on the money. I am entirely opposed to the proposal to borrow for repatriation purposes. Nothing could be more insulting to the soldiers themselves than to tell them that we are prepared to borrow to assist them, and that they musb hel p in paying interest on and in the-repayment of that borrowed .money. That is a position in which no returned soldier should find himself. He should not be asked to join with others bo repay what has been borrowed to assist him. to repatriate himself. to do what he could do better by himself and for himself. I believe the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League, if organized on a repatriation' basis, could handle and finance such a scheme on its own financial stability in these circumstances with better results than could be expected from the circumlocutory methods which are, unfortunately, attachable always to Government Departments. If the returned soldiers are not going to be freed in some way from financial responsibility with regard to' the repayment of this money it is unfair. The whole principle of borrowing money for repatriation is unsound. people are expecting and ready to pay taxation in such measure as to enable them to f u l f i l their promises to th© men, and thus to do honour to themselves. Coming to the proposals for the administration of this system, I have various objections to the scheme as outlined, i approve entirely, however, of the appointment of a Minister to supervise it . I do not think that any one can possibly envy the Minister his position. a Minister in charge of repatriation in the last twelve months theTe would have been three changes of Ministers. That is a fatal blot. the head of this scheme some one who wil l be responsible to the Parliament and to the people. manent head, who will be a link between the Commission and the Parliament. Parliament should not relax its hold upon the repatriation scheme. I have some objections to offer to the constitution of the Commission. Under the B ill the Commission is to hold officeduring the pleasure of the Governor General. Senator Millen, in introducing the B ill in another place, stated that the Commission would be composed of private citizens, and that he had already received quite a large number of offers from people who were qualified to serve upon it . The constitution of this Commission will be the first .thing that will either give the citizens and the returned soldiers confidence in the scheme, or, on tlie other hand, w ill make them think that it is a political move-thaf c it is either an employers' or an economic move. All sorts of suspicions will attach to it , and the Government cannot proceed too caref u l l y in the appointment of the members of the Commission. I object, therefore, to the appointment of the persons fco serve on this Commission during the pleasure of the Governor General. A man having been appointed, it will not be very easy to get r i d of him, should he be careless in the performance of his duty or unsatisfactory to the people. I should be prepared to see the members of the Commission appointed for a specified time with the right, if honourable members desire, to re-appointment at the end of the .term if satisfactory. satisfactory before his term had expired. easier to displace him at the end of his term than to retire him if he were appointed during the pleasure of the Governor General, which would practically mean for life. to be honorary. that.

247,Mr Finlayson,"I am aware ofCommission, and also a representative on each State Board. That is most essential^ The league should be invited to appoint its representative to the Commission 'in its own way, and for such term as it desires. The term of his appointment should be entirely a matter for it and not for the Government to determine. There should also be two ladies on the Commission. I quite expected that statement to be greeted with a laugh. There are special reasons why there should be ladies on this Commission. nothing else than the recognition of the magnificent services that the women of Australia have rendered in connection with this war, they deserve to be represented on the Commission. There is the still stronger reason that the Bill proposes -to deal, not only with returned soldiers, but with the widows and children of deceased soldiers, and also the wives and children of incapacitated soldiers. It is, unfortunately, all too true that, howture, though not necessarily the only ever willing and sympathetic men may be in regard to women's affairs, we have to recognise that in dealing with women and children we want to get the women's point of view more than we have done. women's point of view from the Local Committees. always prefer to be judged by men. that the laws on the statute-books of the world, in regard to the treatment of women, are very satisfactory or eulogistic of the attitude of men. If women had direct representation, there would be a difference in the laws, which discriminate against them in the most unfair way. It is suggested, by way of interjection, that we shall get the women's point of view from the Local Committees; and I hope that we shall. I hope that lady inspectors will be employed to investigate cases, and, further, that, both on the State Boards and the Local Committees, there will be lady representatives. Do honourable members for one moment suggest that the women of this country have neither the intellectual capacity nor the administrative ability to occupy a position on a State Board? The answer to that question is to be found in the Red Cross and other patriotic organizations that are being managed almost entirely by women. This is the answer to any suggestion that they lack the administrative ability, patriotic fervour, or genius necessary in representatives on this Commission. I hope that the Commission is not going to be a Victorian body. The Minister, I notice, suggested that the members of the Commission heed not be paid, because they will not be required, or expected^ to devote very much of their time to the work. To my mind, that discloses a weak spot in the system. If this repatriation business is simply going to be If for a sort of side line, it means that a few Victorian gentlemen, with, perhaps, one or two from New South Wales, are to be the Commission, and that they will occasionally meet to ratify the decisions of the Minister, and the suggestions of the Director. That is not what this Parliament requires. We require men, and, I hope, women, who will devote themselves to the work, making it the leading feafeature, of their lives, and giving it enough time and attention to insure that it is well done. If it is to be left to the Minister and Director, and the Commission is simply to be a sort of advisory body, with no power of veto, and very little of suggestion, we might as well allow the Minister and Director to take full charge and responsibility, while we in Parliament expressed our views on those occasions when they came to us for money. member speak of the ""Director""? does not appear in the Bill, but there is to be one, as the permanent head of the new Department to be created. I see no reason why, in addition to the Minister, tliere should not be a member of this House on the Commission. We are charged, particularly, with the financial responsibility, and the Government of the day ought to appoint a member of the House of Representatives to be deputychairman of the Commission. The enormous variety of cases, and the multiplicity of matters that will have to be looked after, demand that there shall be, in either House, a man in close touch with the work who can be appealed to at first hand when we are discussing repatriation questions.

252,Mr Finlayson,"The ""Director""have been made in this House that tbe Minister for Defence occupies a seat in another place. His is a huge spending Department, and it has been repeatedly admitted, when Defence matters were under consideration, that the Minister for Defence ought to be in this House. Of course, we could get over that difficulty, if we were not so unfortunately conservative, by arranging that a Minister in charge of a Bill should be able to appear and take charge of a measure in either chamber. I feel sure that if a measure with that object in view were introduced, honourable members on both sides would be found quite willing to agree to it. It is suggested by the Minister that this the Senate, ifc would, be difficult for a Commission shall be a permanent body, in order to secure uniformity and continuity of policy. I can understand that object quite well, and, therefore, although I object to members holding office during, the pleasure of the Governor General, I do not suggest that they should all retire at the same time. If we are to have a continuous policy in regard to repatriation, we must of necessity have some continuity on the Commission. That, however, does not necessarily mean that the whole personnel of the Commission must be permanent. There would be a decided advantage in replacing, say, after two or three years, some of the members by men with new ideas and new methods, so as to secure a fresh stream of life. In the Senate, we preserve continuity by changing the personnel every three years; and ifc will be admitted that, especially in the case of bodies intrusted with permanent! work along certain well-defined lines, it is necessary that the personnel should be more or less of a permanent character. Otherwise, there mustl be a disadvantage to the Commission itself, because it will be prone to become conservative, and so wrapped up in its own point of view as to be impervious to any new scheme or idea. If this Commission launches on a certain line of work-as it will do-it will be very impatient of criticism, naturally thinking its ideas right, and the members of this Parliament and the general public may criticise to their hearts' content. With a-Commission appointed practically for life, what chance is there of gettin? new ideas or methods adopted ? In review a. three years' term would be a fair one, and at the end of that period a certain proportion of the members might retire, and make room for others. I have 545 much the same objection to the const ii i tion of the State Boards, so iar as [ understand it from the Bill.

I am not now dealing in any way with the method of appointment, or how the senator should be elected. realizes that, during the long sittings of senator to get in touch with these bodies. a joke? meetings of the""Senate under normal conditions. dition of the Senate seems to be to sit as little as possible, and fco adjourn because there is nothing to do.

We must find some means whereby members of the Federal Parliament may be kept in close touch with the operations and management of the repatriation scheme, and I know no better way than the one I have suggested. For these reasons, in the case of the Local Committees, I go a step further, and submit that, in selecting their provided for in the Bill, the idea should be that of the Federal electoral division, and that the member for the House of Representatives for the division should have a seat.

279,Mr Finlayson,"I do not wish to be satisfied to stand at bis back and give him all the assistance that we can. I see no reason for the suggestion that the Commonwealth should accept responsibility for the purchase of land for returned soldiers. While I am becoming increasingly favorable to the idea of unification, I do not think the time has arrived when we should take over the lands of the State either in whole or in part.. not been made here to-day. very emphatically by the honourable member for Kooyong.( Sir Robert Best). There are two or three other suggestions that I wish to make. I think that the measure of co-operative control that we should exercise should be in the direction either of the States having a representative on the Central Commission, or of each Statte Board having a representative on the State Lands Department upon it . An oflicer, preferably the Minister of Lands in each State, should be a member of each State Board. the Lands Department would be the best man. this B ill , we are in danger of exaggerating the land settlement proposal to the disadvantage of other proposals. Even if 100,000 men are willing to go upon, the land, there will still be left more than 200,000 soldiers whom, obviously, ifc would be foolish to put on the land, and who, if they went there, would only make a failure of ifc. Two-thirds of the men who will come back to Australia will desire to obtain work in industrial occupations. These are the individuals, to whom more persistent attention will have to be given, than will need to be devoted to the men who go upon the land. The latter will have the better of the deal. They will have permanent employment, and they will have some guarantee of the reproductive character of that employment. The artisan, and, to a greater extent the unskilled labourer, amongst the returning soldiers will feel the pinch when the war is over. We shall have a good deal to say by and by as to the conditions which will govern the return of these men to their jobs, if what has already happened is to be taken as an indication of future possibilities, and if the fact that a man is receiving a war pension is to be used as an argument for cutting down rates of wages. If tliat kind of thing is continued, honourable members may be quite sure that there will be lively times ahead. Whatever else the people of this country will stand, they will not put up with any reduction of the industrial conditions which have made Australia what it is, and have enabled our men at the Front to do what they have done. We should devote more attention to the has industrial occupations to be provided for returning soldiers. The heaviest part of our burden and the most intricate and perplexing problem we shall have to solve is the finding of employment for returned men, who will prefer industrial occupations. To what extent .do we guarantee under this B ill that these, men will ""be provided for ? What new industries are we going to start? What existing industries do we intend to extend ? We' shall not have much difficulty in solving this problem if we have the courage to face it. We are importing millions of pounds' worth of goods which could be better made in Australia, and in the f.manufacture of which occupation could be found for returned men which would provide for them satisfactorily. Fortunately, the war has opened our eyes to some extent I fear that', under to the possibilities of development in this direction. It has made it plain that industries can be started in Australia with comparatively little capital, and for the output of which there is an immediate market. Industries are already in existence that can be readily extended. One has only to consider the array of goods that we import to realize thafc we have immediately available the means to provide employment for returned soldiers, which will secure to them a satisfactory living for themselves and their dependants. of Repatriation should also be made M in ister for Industry. good proposal. As an immediate suggestion, I think we should recognise our responsibility by adopting the principle that no man shall be discharged from the Army until employment or some position has been found for him whereby he can make a decent living. His military pay should continue until the country has reinstated him in his previous employment, or has found a new occupation for him.

No man who has served the country at the Front should ever find himself in such a position as to have to go to a benevolent asylum. To prevent anything of the kind, I contend that the men's military pay should continue until employment is found for them. I go a step further, and I say that the Commonwealth Government should recog1 nise their responsibility to the widows,and children of deceased soldiers to a greater extent than they have yet done. We give them a pension, it is true, but honourable members know' what a struggle it is for any woman to bring up a family when their breadwinner is gone. Only to-day I rewhich has been announced, they will be brought under the operation of the B ill . amendment is to be proposed, which w ill bring the widows and children of deceased soldiers under the operation of the measure.

We should immediately recognise that, so long as the widow of a soldier lives, and remains unmarried, she should be guaranteed a house to shelter herself and her children.

This scheme may be launched w it h feelings of patriotic fervour to-day, but we honourable have to guard against the wheels becoming clogged and running stiffly as the years go by.

This Parliament will have control over the operation of the scheme, because a responsible Minister of the Crown is to be in charge of it . He w ill be subject to the criticism of Parliament. There is no better means of compelling the Government! to act upon the lines that honourable members approve than that of having a Minister subject to the criticism of Parliament charged with the carrying out of the scheme. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has made an able speech. He is in a position to speak with authority on this subject in view of the grand work which he has himself already done in connection wibh repatriat i o n ; but I do not share his fears as to results likely to arise from the oper&tion of this scheme. work heartily together on the lines proposed, I see no reason why we should not pass the measure, which will be conducive to the welfare of the returned soldiers. Under this B ill our first object should be to place the men who will return in satisfactory employment. No greater calamity could befall a country than to have men oub of work. Every man out of work is a burden on the country. Some one must keep him^ When a man gets out of work he begins to d r if t until he may finally become what we have so far not seen in Australia, but what is common in the Old World, and that is an unemployable. We do not want to have any submerged tenth in Australia, and that is why I am sure we are all anxious that our returned soldiers, whether incapacitated or in good health, should be taken in hand and immediately placed I have listened with very great will return wealth to the country and be good for the men themPrevious speakers have selves. The expenditure has been spoken of. It is not a matter of expenditure, bufc of the way the money is spent. If we judiciously spent £50,000 or £500,000 a year, we should get an immediate return. It will bring wealth to the country, and we shall have the men placed in useful occupations. The money spent along lines that will return ten or twentyfold will be helpful, not only to the men, but to the nation generally. All wealth coming from the land, we naturally jump to the conclusion that the land is the place on which to put a number of these men. That is all right to a certain degree, but my recent experience shows that a man requires training to go on the land, just as for any other occupation. I recommend the Minister to be very careful indeed in the selection of the men as well as the selection of the land on which he puts them. The land should be the very best, close to the market, and witbin easy access of railway communication, and there should be good roads in the vicinity. There should be .telephonic communicar tion available where the men are placed. All this will make the land attractive to them, and the work attractive also. Tf that is done, the men will remain where they are put, but if they ""are asked to go away back, land settlement will not be a success. There are many suitable areas of land available if the States are willing fco pay for them. Cheap land is no good If honourable members for closer settlement, or, in fact, for any class of settlement}. In some of the States that I know a little about, the failure in land settlement has been brought about owing to the Government going away back into the interior, and cutting up lands fchat were not suitable. If land is selected within reasonable distance of a market, and is good, we need have no apprehensions.

If that class of country is secured, and closer monwealth will be great indeed if we can settlement instituted on it,* we shall have the' men close together, they will be able to co-operate, and work the land under conditions which have been applied with great 'success in parts of Tasmania. Laud in the vicinity of a place called The Kendron, in Tasmania, would never have been settled at all but that the people who are on it came out together on one or two ships. They settled in the one place, and co-operated heartily with each other, each lending labour to the other when' required, with the result that to-day they have splendid homes, and an excellent settlement under closer settlement conditions. Conducted on those lines, land settlement is made much more attractive than under the system existing in some places. I was very much impressed with a still closer system of settlement that I saw in France. Even the houses were not separated on the farms, but the whole of them were built close together. I was told that this method was adopted in the first place for the purpose of mutual 'protection, but is continued now' for the sake of the social advantages. I find that wherever there is closer settlement the telephone is playing a most important part. A settler connected up on a party line can converse with his friends, and get in touch with the nearest town. This has been done on the north-west coast of Tasmania, where the telephone has revolutionized closer settlement. . I hope this idea will be more grown on the land should be attended to. extensively followed, for I am sure the Minister will readily realize the indirect value of the telephone in making the land that 40,000 men are willing to settle on the land. No doubt, many of them were trained on farms before they went away. They will .come back even better fitted to take up land, and they should be allowed to do so without having to bear a great interest burden. Surely we can devise some means by which they will not be asked to pay interest, at any rate, for four or five years, or until the farm is giving can get some them a good return. In fact, I question whether we should ask them to pay interest at all. Mr J. >H. CATTS -Hear, hear! We should give them a sufficient amount to provide a living. let them pay the principal back over a number of years. The return to the Comget settlement under those conditions. The Minister( Mr Groom) very effectively pointed out that, even before the war broke out, Australia was spending huge sums of money annually in trying to settle people on the land, and competition was going on between State and State to obtain settlers. If we do not ask these men to bear the burden of interest, but spread the repayment of the capital over a considerable time, land settlement will be made most attractive, for nothing tends more to satisfy a man than the knowledge that he is getting something above the bread-and-butter line. When he finds that the place is giving him something in return, and that he will not have to go out looking for work once more, it makes him feel that what he is doing is well worthwhile. We should go still further by helping him in the marketing of his produce, and should not allow him to be at the mercy of anybody who desires to do that work for him. The supervising body should watcK that his produce is put on the market in such a way as to give him the best possible return for his labour.

I always find great pleasure at the Royal Agricultural Show in watching the exhibits of these institutions, and noting the willingness with .which information is given by the experts in the employ of the Victorian Government. If we can gain so much knowledge in one or two days there, how much greater would be the knowledge gained by intelligent young men if they were put at some college of this kind long enough to learn at least the rudiments of farming?

If they visited some of the farms I saw in Scotland, and other parts of Great Britain, and on the Continent, they will be able to adopt systems of working under closer settlement . that should be invaluable.

Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. Commonwealth should exercise some control over the expenditure in connection with land settlement, I fail to see that it would be an advantage to centralize all control, because the' States have very effective machinery already in operation, and as their officials have had long experience, it would not be wise to create a Commonwealth Lands Department to work side by side with the Departments of the various States. An official acquainted with Queensland conditions, if engaged in administering the Commonwealth Department in the southern States, might endeavour to adopt measures which, while suitable in the case of Queensland, would not be suitable in the southern States. I feel confident that the Commonwealth money will be judiciously spent by the State Departments in this direction. In any case, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will always have an effective control over State expenditure. This was clearly demonstrated during the last recess, when Sir John Forrest intimated that he expected the various States Governments to repay Commonwealth advances, and 1 know that in one State, at all events, there was a considerable curtailment of expenditure a3 a result of the Treasurer's announcement. On the industrial side it seems to me that there is an urgent need for the efficient training of our young men in the various trades to which they apply themselves. I can quote my own experience as an illustration of our faulty system. I entered the engineering trade, and was put on to clean castings, which is not engineering work at all, and I have no doubt that my experience was similar to that of many others who are kept on month in and month out doing work that is of no earthly use. In Germany, on the other hand, a comprehensive system of training is insured to all young men in industrial occupations. If a lad enters the engineering trade he learns first the rudiments of blacksmithing, how to sharpen tools, &c, then goes on to the bench, where he is taught how to use the hammer, chisel, and file Then he passes have manure put-",68,Smith Denison In Some Healthful Occupations That

In addition to this training, he is required to attend a technical school at the expense of his employer. Eight throughout, the super. vision is effective and complete. Australia will have to adopt some such system in' the future training of her young men, as sectional work is not to be desired. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) recently invited me to inspect a factory in which I was very much interested, but I found that .the work had to pass through forty or fifty different hands. ciple observed in every boot factory in the world. the case, but it is not a system under which a young man will learn his trade. Before any lad signs his indenture papers, those who are responsible for his apprenticeship should have a definite understanding that he will be taught his trade in its various branches, in order that afterwards he may qualify for a foreman's position. I have no fear for the future of the young men who, before going to the war, had served portion of their time at certain trades, because if they have an interest in their work at all they will take advantage of every opportunity when abroad to increase their knowledge by visiting workshops on the other side of the world. Experience has shown that Australians are doing remarkably well everywhere, and it is not likely that there will be any necestake a microscope to find it. sity to subsidize employers to finalize the teaching of these young men upon their return. But I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, careful supervision will be necessary to see that no injustice is done to these men, because if an employer could secure a subsidy for smart apprentices who have already served a portion of their time, he would have an advantage over his competitors in the same trade. I know of a firm of engineers who The young man was paid only £ 1 a week, but the firm charged 12s. a day for his work. As a matter of fact, I do not; think that many firms will desire to be subsidized, because they will realize thab they owe a duty to these men who went to the Front to fight their country's battles. The position here is not to be compared wibh that in the Old Country, where many businesses have been entirely ruined because of the withdrawal of employees for war service, and as employers here have not been seriously inconvenienced by comparison, but, on the contrary, have been able to carry on as if there was no war, they will not charge a returned soldier with not being up to his standard of workmanship before the war. Australian employers are not likely to adopt that attitude. mistic man I have heard of. know the Australian employer; but if any employer adoptsi.a different attitude, I feel sure that if the Government do not take action, public opinion will see thab the returned soldiers do not suffer. Let me give an illustration of what I mean=I noticed in a crowded tram last evening that two ladies insisted upon making room for a returned soldier to sit beside them, and at Mordialloc yesterday a large number of returned men were entertained as a mark of appreciation for the services they have rendered to their country.

326,Mr Laird Smith,"Al l this is evianything about that, but I do know that private citizens and members of Parliament do not turn a deaf, ear to the complaints of the returned men. Mr J. H . OATTS -Cases have been brought up before the Sydney City Council of employers refusing to reinstate employees. ployers should be exposed, and if that were done public opinion would deal with them. Let me put the other side of the case. I know of a big firm which is paying the difference between the military pay and that which the men received before they went away. number of firms have pursued that policy. That there are hard cases I will admit, but they need careful inquiry. I will now refer to the case of a man who returns from the Front broken in health. Few persons, even in Melbourne, are acquainted with a splendid institution in its vicinity for treating men who have come back maimed and in bad health. 1 believe that I am safe in saying that one of the most up-to-date hospitals in the world exists at Caulfield though few persons know of its existence. the best hospital in the world. it is, because the best methods have been adopted from all parts of the world. A d jacent to the hospital is' a huge area of ground. I do not see why suitable buildings should not be erected, so that a man suffering from a nervous breakdown could occupy his mind just as long as he cared to do such work as was suitable. establish curative workshops for such cases. hear that remark. No 'doubt they will be found to be most useful institutions. I learned from a specialist that one of the best cures-for nervous cases is to keep the men occupied at some other work than that which broke down their health. the men can receive such training at Caulfield. who is maimed, and is to be trained at an institution, should be given a say in the selection of tlie trade he is to take up. Scores of young men spend five or seven years in learning a trade, but as soon as I do not know fchey get out of a workshop they drop the trade for all time, because they were unsuited to it , and, therefore, did not like the work. If , however, a young man is consulted, and asked to say what occupation he would like to follow, he will take a great interest in the work to which he is put, with the result that he w ill "" « progress by leaps and bounds. It is well in the world never touched a violin unfcil he was fifty years of age. This shows that a man is never too old to learn. When a man states that he is too old to learn it indicates a lazy spirit. My belief is that a returned soldier will take up I understand a suitable work if it is offered to him. That is what we must always keep in view in attempting to place the men. The Returned Soldiers Association have in each State a man to look after the interests of returned .soldiers, and the result is that he becomes thoroughly acquainted with their wants. He learns the mind of the men, and hence he is the best representative they could have. One of these men, I think, should have a seat on the State Board. Inspectors, too, should be employed to watch the men and advise the Board; I do not mean that inspectors should be employed to pry into the private affairs of men, but to see how they carry out the I . believe that work, and whether it is agreeable to them. I shall be very pleased if a representative from Queensland will deal with this point, because I understand thafc in that State returned men have been engaged as in spectors with splendid results. They are doing great work. My informant is a returned soldier, Quartermaster-Sergeant Foster-wh o went up from Tasmania to look into fche Queensland land system. On his return he informed me that it is the best system existing to-day. If that I . a m glad' to is so, we should adopt the system wherever it is deemed suitable for the various interests which we shall have to consider. I believe that much advantage would be gained, too, if the Minister for Repatriation called upon a body such as the TradesH a l l , or any other association Ifc will be a fine thing if of workmen to elecb a representative'. From practical experience he would know I think that a young man the conditions under which men should work, and his inclusion would tend to bring about harmonious operations.

Men of all classes of life have been brought into close touch with each other, and, consequently, caste distinctions have vanished. When the soldiers return we shall have to proceed along these lines if we desire t'o secure beneficial and good results. None of us can say or do too much for the soldiers who have rendered such splendid service to Australia and the Empire. deed whether we should be free to-day but for their brave deeds. When I rose this evening to address the House, the thought uppermost in my mind was that there was something more to do for the men than to lend them money at interest. In my opinion, no interest should be charged, and the repayment of the capital should be spread over a considerable time, ao that the obligation shall not press too heavily on the men. We owe a duty to all these men, and we can never repay them sufficiently. No matter what money we may give them, and no matter how we may place them, we cannot make sufficient recognition of the magnificent work they have done under the voluntary system. They are entitled to the fullest recognition for the great sacrifices they have made in the interests of our country. W it h that idea uppermost in.my mind 1 shall endeavour to assist the Minister, who, I recognise, has an arduous task to perform. I feel certain that this measure will have to be amended times without number before it is anywhere near perfect. We cannot expectthe Minister to make good suddenly, but from experience he will learn-, and probably bring down an amending measure time after time, with but one object in view, and that is to do the best he can for the men who have done so much for us.

But I agree with the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) that it is useless to think that at the present time we can perfect a system of repatriation. It is nonsense to entertain such a thought. TheB ill will have to be repeatedly altered to meet the changing situation; bufc all the same, we ought to gefc a move on. As a matter of fact-, a start ought to have been made much earlier. I am not too hopeful. in regard to the future, because when the men return in very large numbers I do not see much prospect of them being handled successfully, seeing that for the men. who have already returned we have not attempted to do anything. While I agree that many associations have contrived, and thafc some have endeavoured with less success, to do much towards reI t is very questionable inlieving the condition of. returned men, still it has only been repatriation of a patchwork kind, and not repatriation which reflects credit on a civilized community. When the work of demobilizing the Army is really begun it will be an enormous job, and if we do nofc move more quickly than we have done of late, there is sure to be chaos, and we shall hear more curses than blessings from the returned men. There will be a great many men who will not ' be willing to resume their former occupations. There will be a good deal of grumbling, and in many cases rightly so. Men will say, "" We .have performed certain work and have no desire to go back to the drudgery of our former l if e . "" It will call for a lot of arrangement to meet the various objections. Many men, unfortunately, will be physically unfit to take up any work. It is such an enormous proposition to tackle that one feels that whatever may be done will not satisfy everybody, not even a large proportion of the community. Something new will have to be conceived to meet the situation. I am not one of those who believe that the scheme of placing a large number of men on the land is going to be a success. My opinion is that only-a very small proportion of the men will become successful settlers. estimate. anything like that percentage will make a success of land settlement. We hear much talk about persons getting on to the land. A number of persons think that all that a oeirson has to do is to go on I'he land and make money. Butt we know from experience that men who had money and were willing to work were nofc successful. -There have been just as many failures on the land as successes.

335,Mr Mathews,"I do not think thabwith, in Victoria during the last fifteen years, it is doomed to failure from the start, because all that the acquisition of land by the Government for closer settlement has done has been to raise the price of land all over the State, and leave in the hands of the Government an enormous acreage, which has been useless ever since, but which at one time was put to some purpose. that it has been all a failure? has been purchased at an enhanced price by the State Walmer Estate, near Horsham, by the Administration of which Sir Robert Best was a 'member, has been a gigantic success. the effect of the land resumptions during the last fourteen or fifteen years. I do not think it can be disproved that every estate purchased by the Government has comprised a lot of useless land which has not been taken up by anybody. Some land was purchased at a high price, and the original owners still have it under lease afc a peppercorn rental. If we are to spend an enormous sum of money in purchasing land -the burden on those who settle upon it will be so greafc that they will never make a success of it. In my opinion, the State Governments own sufficient land on which to place those returned soldiers who are fitted for an agricultural life. in Victoria? Crown land in Victoria available for the settlement of soldiers, of what use is it to talk about opening up the State to a large increase of population? what prices will have to be paid for land when the Government milch cow goes into the open market to buy estates? If the Government are desirous of giving! to these men the full benefit of going on the land, they can open up new areas in Victoria by building railways and new roads. Let them start with the saw-mill, and get the profit out of the timber, instead of burning it off, as has been done in the past. I know that there are not millions of. acres of land available in Victoria for this purpose, but still there are certain areas which could be opened up in this way. enemy our soldiers are to come back to subdue the forest. due the forest than to attempt to subdue land-grabbers. The evidence taken at the inquiry into the result of closer settlement in Victoria showed that the moment the Government started on the job a lot of land-owners found great reluctance in parting with their land. Although the taxation they paid was on a valuation of 25s. per acre, the moment the Government wanted to purchase it went up to an enormous value, and its productivity was equally astonishing; and when one the estate was purchased the value of the adjoining properties was enhanced to the extent of £5 or £6 per acre. The same thing will occur in regard to purchases of land for the purpose of settling soldiers upon it. Prices will be so enhanced that it will be impossible to settle men on the land so purchased with any hope of success. Experience has shown that many men who have taken up blocks in closer settlement areas have failed, though they were not lacking in money. Very often the land has not proved to be as good as it was supposed to be. There is a smaller number of settlers in Victoria to-day than there were years ago. My opinion is that it will cost about £2,000 to settle each soldier on the land. Is it the intention to select one section of the returned soldiers, and give each man assistance to the extent of £2,000, and not give the same amount of assistance to men who are desirous of entering into business? If we differentiate between those who are anxious to go on the land and those who do not wish to settle on the land there will be immediate complaints. Who knows Mr J. H . CATTS -That differential treatment exists now, but there are no complaints. human if there are no complaints. I understand that more has been done in other States in the matter ,of assisting soldiers than has been done in Victoria.

345,Mr Mathews,"It will not beby committees formed for the same purpose in Queensland and New South Wales. I am not hoping for too much success from the scheme for placing soldiers on the land, because the land w ill be loaded with such a heavy price that it will be doomed to failure from the commencement. My view is that the Government should get the benefit of the enhanced value of the land, and pass it on to the men, and that can easily be done by opening up new districts. If I am met with the answer that the Government of Victoria has no land that it is possible to exploit, then I say it is a bad day for Victoria. It means that the State can never hope for a greater agrarian population than it now has. MrJ . H . CATTS -Plenty of good land is available at Canberra. suggestion which was made the other day, that if money was to be spent in this direction it could be spent with advantage at the Pederal Capital was laughed down. The men at the Front follow every possible calling, and if there had been no war they would have been drawn upon tb build the Federal Capital, and work the land in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are great avenues for giving men employment. Any increase in land values there would go to the Commonwealth, whereas any other scheme for settling returned soldiers on the land will lie nothing but a make-believe; while it may be regarded as an effort to repatriate our soldiers, it will really be an attempt to increase the land values of private people. We are told that now is the time when the industries of Australia should be increased, and that we should produce commodities that we have not produced before ; but we are also told that this cannot be done unless sufficient Customs duties are imposed to prevent the importation of those commodities.. We know that a to supply a commodity upon which a duty is imposed is really doing harm to the community unless some attempt is being made to produce it . In my opinion, the Government could initiate the production of many commodities until they reach a certain standard. For example, the manufacture of artificial limbs could be initiated under Commonwealth supervision by the men who have returned from the Front. deal w it h the matter. get the Government interested in the matter nine months ago. ber asked to be done is now being done. who have been in the Old Country have spoken of an establishment for the manufacture of artificial limbs on which a New South Wales gentleman spent thousands of pounds, breaking all records, and quite putting the British and American manufacturers of artificial limbs into the shade. I understand that the British Government were asked to take over the concern, but that! they did not do so, and that ifc was left in private hands. However, some of our men who were employed there have T h a t is true. The returned to Australia possessed of the knowledge necessary to proceed with the establishment of the industry here, and I am glad to hear the Minister say that it is proposed to make a commencement. I hope that the matter wil l be pushed on with. The production of hand-woven woollens could be considerably increased. As a preliminary step the Government should at once proceed with making preparations for the manufacture of yarn. We are already making wool tops. Previously we lost a lot of money in Australia by allowing our wool to go away without attempting to make it up, but a start has now been made with the manufacture of wool tops, and, as a result of the war, it is a paying concern. In fact, we were told by the Prime Minister that the Government have already made a profit of £40,000 in one year from the export or wool tops, and there is no reason why the production offchisarticle should not be extended. The natural corollary to it is the manufacture of yarn. L et us get down fco the manufacture of woollens in Australia properly. It is a matter thafc country which is not prepared fche Government could easily undertake, and the expenditure of £1,000,000 in this direction would be better than throwing it away on land propositions and in enhancing the price of land in fche hands of private owners. There are many propositions of this kind that the Government could conceive in order to make a success of repatriation. Unlessi t is done, our scheme will be a failure.

But whoever comprise the Commission, should be represented. of the body with -finance, but we shall also require men who have been to the Front, and have a stronger sympathy with the soldier than the civilian has.

We know what was the experience of Victoria; the scandals associated with the placing of people on tbe land under the Land Acquisition Act stank in the nostrils of the Mr Mathews. people, and any repetition of them would cause a revuision of feeling, and bring discredit upon all those associated with the scheme.. It is with considerable diffidence that I rise in uniform to address the House, because I hold that when a man dons uniform, he does it in order to do things and not to say things. But as to-nignt we are pioneering legislatively, as our fathers pioneered geographically, I wish I have no desire to see a to endeavour to blaze' one of the trees of expensive establishments along the track, because I believe that this measure, skeleton though it be, is one of the greatest proposals with which this Parliament will ever be called upon to deal.

It has been At the head said in this Chamber .to-day that when a we must have men man enters camp, he gets an altogether a knowledge of business and different view of l if e ; there is no doubt he does.

But I do know that men who went away in the prime of life, and in the fullness of their strength and activity are coming back almost like I do not say that ofiicers children. This problem of repatriation All ranks entails not only the finding of occupations of some sort for men in the ordinary way, but the refitting of men for the occupations which they followed before they joined the Army.

353,Mr Fleming,"I shall say nothingis the talk of children-childre n in intellect, at any rate. Men have simply to go and look into the ways of Nature, and go into the back blocks and see the fight tur pioneers are waging every day to realize that we cannot do away with war. The whole theory is too ridiculous for words. The soldier knows it to be so, and to-day he is inclined to demand more from the community than he has any right to demand. worth of the soldier. Some of the best men bred in Australia have gone to the Front, many of them never to return. But I say Australia is overdoing the laudation and praise of its soldiers. The military man has always to take himself seriously. He is taught to have more regard for himself and his appearance than a civilian has, and that in itself is trying to most young fellows, but when in addition the whole world lends itself to giving him adulation and flattery, sometimes of the grossest kind, the danger, not only to the men but to the community, should be exposed. I was pleased to see that in this scheme the idea is to draft the men straight from their units -to their work when they return There is to be nq lapse of time between the discharge of a man and the placing of him in his future calling.

CATTS -There is no such statement contained in his speech. member will read the speech, he will see that there is. It is one of the announcements that I hailed with delight. There is to be no lapse of time, I repeat, between the discharge of a soldier and the placing of him in his future calling. registration before discharge. chinery for reinstating the soldier in civil way of supporting the widows and life is to be Teady as soon as he arrives. Another point is that no more cash than is absolutely necessary is to be advanced to a returned soldier during the period of his transition from military to civil life. The dangers arising from our soldiers having too much money to handle are greater than most people realize. should be remembered that those who have enlisted are chiefly young men, and that their disposition is to spend their money on pleasure as soon as they receive it. The Government will be well advised if it adheres closely to its determination that these men shall be transferred direct from their units to their future occupations, and that in the interval they shall receive as little money as possible. I do I have no wish to decry the not wish it to be thought that I am decrying our soldiers, or affirming that we are going to do too much for them. But I do emphatically express the belief, after having mixed with them-for some time, that we are making too much of them before they go to the Front, and that there will be a disposition, I fear, when the war is over, to make too little of them on their return. TheTe may be a spasm of enthusiasm when they come back, hut after that, I fear, the interest in the men who have done such excellent work for the Empire will die out. Above all, it is imperative that we should extend, to the dependants of those who will never come back our sympathy and kindly encouragement, which very often mean more to them than hard cash. Every honourable member must have witnessed these cases of bereavement and suffering, and the public generally should realize that a word of sympathy spoken at the right time frequently means more to these broken-hearted women and children than anything we can offer them, in the form of money. 'Cold cash is cold comfort, but a kindly message of encouragement may, perhaps, mean all the difference between hope and despair. I trust that I shall return to this House to assist in the administration of this measure. But when a man goes overseas to engage in"" this great struggle, as I hope to do shortly, he may never return. At any rate, he knows that he is taking more risks than is the individual who stays at home. I repeat that we are disposed to.make too much of our soldiers before they go to the Front, All the maand that we are doing too little in the orphans who have beenleft behind.

That is one of the gravest faults of the Bill. It is absolutely essential that we should 'have paid officials attending to this matman whom I know very well, and he is a ter, not only here at head-quarters, but in every State. I agree that there should be Local Committeesto handle the details, but the general administration should be in the hands of paid and thoroughly qualified officials. Upon his return to this' country the soldier will be placed in a very curious position. He will have to get his land from the State, his financial assistance from the Commonwealth, and he will be settled upon the land by men who are working in an honorary capacity. He will thus have to deal with three different authorities, so that he will not know what to do, and, being in a highly tense state, I am inclined to think great trouble will result. I hope that the Government will simplify the procedure that is to be adapted, so that the soldier may know exactly to whom he has to appeal. A good deal has been said to-day in reMillen will know that very well. ference to the land upon which returned soldiers are to be settled. I do not propose to deal with the industrial side of this question, because I have lived all my life in the open spaces. I know 'the conditions under which men turn out the raw products, but I do not pretend to know the manufacturing side of the business. I have heard adverse criticism of the land which is being resumed for the settlement of our returned soldiers. I haye made inquiries as to the estates which are being will find that it has not paid. If one conpurchased for the purpose by the New South ""Wales Government, and also as to the prices being paid for them. I can assure honourable members that those estates comprise the very best lands in New South Wales, and that they are being acquired at very reasonable prices. Although there are land sharks in the community, who will rob the Government or anybody else whenever the opportunity offers, there are, nevertheless, amongst land-owners as many high-minded"" and patriotic men as are to be found in the ranks of any other class. These men are to-day offering their lands to the Governblock he occupies is in inverse ratio to the ment at less than their real value. They realize that they should do something to [94] show their gratitude to the men who have gone overseas to defend them. Mr J. H . CATTS -Did the honourable member look into the charges of Mr Trethowan, the president of the Farmers and Settlers Association? hard-headed land-owner. But in the case of the property with which he dealt he was somewhat misled. I have very good reason for believing that he was absolutely misled, and that he has since regretted his action. Mr J. H . CATTS -He still insists upon his charges. personally since he made those charges, but I have seen some of his friends, and they tell me that he has made the greatest error of his life. The Government of New South Wales, I repeat, have made very good bargains in the estates which they have acquired for the settlement of returned soldiers, and the men who go upon that land ought to make a success of the venture. Of course, I know that many soldiers who will go upon the land will be absolute failures. Senator map. thing is that while most people imagine that the majority of those who go .upon the land get their money very easily, if one chooses to take any large property in Australia from the date of its settlement to the present moment, and capitalize the money which has been spent upon it, he siders the compound interest that has accrued upon itstepped into a property after the pioneering work has been done. bad laws, and exceptional cases ought not to be quoted here. To the man who has invested his money in land the average result is not nearly as good as is the average result to the man who has invested his money in other lines of industry.

Now, Senator Millen has had a long and practical experience of land owning. Others of us are similarly situated, and I absolutely disagree w it h the honourable gentleman's statement. f a r m of 1,000 acres w ill show more return for a man's work in a short period than w ill the 10-acre block. In the majority of instances the latter w ill cost a great deal for clearing, whereas the 1,000-acre f a r m will probably only need a fence around it , one or two fences across it, and a dam upon it . But when it has been stocked it w ill not be as easy to look after.as we have been led to believe. One honourable member told us that the stock would look after themselves. My experience is that in these days of foxes, flies, and other pests the stockowner has as busy a time as has any 'other man in the community. When we talk of men living on small areas we are apt to forget that very often they really do not live on those areas, but on the tourists who come to them. There is in Australia today a great tendency to cut down these areas below what is sufficient to in sure a decent living in average seasons. A t present, the returns from stock are abnormally high, and it seems probable that those high returns will continue for some years; but it is a great risk for a man to run. The Government, that may not have occurred to many, are taking a very great risk in this matter of repatriation and settling men on the land What guarantee have the Government that the men who accept the £500 to improve their properties are going to stay on them? which most of the men will come back, can we believe that they will be able to settle permanently quite possible that many of them will desire to go into the country for quietude and rest for a vear or two; but perhaps in a much shorter time their nerves will get the better of them, and all their work will go for nothing. the Government going to give the public for the protection of public property ?

Here is an open door for fraud, and that' is not fair to the people. I know soldiers here to-day who are prepared to go on the land and play with the £500. They say openly, to their comrades, at any rate, that if , when the £500 is done, they have "" made a mess of it , "" they can go back to where they were before. If there is that feeling, we ought to protect the good men against the bad, and also protect tlie public.

Some of these ways have been suggested by the Government, and others have been suggested during this, debate, with a view to bringing these men back to their ordinary avocations. problems is to make their life worth living to them, and to make them of real use to the community. Are honourable members aware how pessimistic the great number of our returned soldiers are?

I have here Professor Gregory's book, The Dead Heart of Australia, in which he writes at some length of the centre of the continent, and what may be done with it . at one time almost a Garden of Eden, but that when it lost its waters it became what we know it to-day, the centre of what is practically a desert. Gregory saysiAccordingly Lake Byre lost its outlet; its waters were henceforth removed only by evaporation; the salts, carried into the lake by the rivers, were concentrated, until the .waters beand Victoria. came salt, and the, fish and crocodiles were all destroyed. As the lake shrank in area, less and less rain fell upon its shores; the vegetayards wide, and that the evaporation tion withered; the once green, succulent herbage was replaced by dry, spiny plants; ithe giant marsupials died of hunger and thirst; hot winds swept across the dusty plains, and the once fertile basin of Lake Eyre was blasted into desert. What appeals to me as an inlander is the fact that we have lost what used to ameliorate the climate for all the western divisions of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. heard of Professor Gregory's book, hardheaded practical .men, who had travelled the interior of Australia-north , south, east, and west-ha d drawn my attention to the fact that all that Australia apparently needs to make it the garden of the world is to restore, as nearly as is humanly possible, the conditions which obtained in the centre a few hundred [94]2 years ago. Professor Gregory goes on to sayThe revival of the ""Dead Heart of Australia"" appears to depend on the chance of restoring to the surface the waters that now lie useless underground. One of the greatest' That may be one way out of the difficulty. There is a vast body of water under all the westernmost part of Queensland, New South. Wales, and Victoria, and it is also believed that there is a similar body of water under Central Australia. But there is another way which has been often suggested, but which Professor Gregory rather decries, and that is They have that the sea should be let in to Lake Eyre from Port Augusta. I have heard it stated that, as Lake Eyre is above sea level, that idea is impracticable, but I It is our duty to restore think that' people get confused between Lake Torrens and Lake Eyre. Lake Torrens, which'is on the road that would be taken by a canal from Port Augusta to Lake Eyre, is 100 feet approximately above sea level, but the water of the Lake Eyre basin itself is 39 feet below sea level. What the depth of the lake is I do not presume to know, b u t it is stated, He states that Lake Eyre was not only in Professor Gregory's book, but in other books, and by a New South Wales professor within the last few years, that there is a sufficient area below sea Professor level round about Lake Eyre, and further north and east, to make an inland sea which would soften the climate, and give an increased rainfall to the whole western division of New' South Wales, Queensland, that this would require a canal 200 would be such as to render the scheme impossible ? made that statement, and Professor Gregory says that' the distance from Lake Eyre to Port 'Augusta is 260 miles, and that the cosfc of construction would be too great, and also that evaporation would fill the lake with salt. This only shows, Before ever I however, that Professor Gregory does not understand geographical and meteorological conditions in Australia. Every man who has been in the interior knows that every few years there comes down a flood which fills this area, and which, if it were given an outlet, would r u n into the sea. Professor Gregory, in decrying the scheme, says that the maximum depth of the lake would be 21 feet,",79,Smith Thes E Em Known That One Of The Greatest Violinists
370,Mr Tudob,Hav e not engineers said,80,Smith Thes E Em Known That One Of The Greatest Violinists
371,Mr Fleming,"Engineers havethough he states two pages further back that the surface of the lake is 39 feet below the level of the sea. He further tells us that in thirty years the whole bed of the lake would be slowly choked with salt owing to evaporation. Professor Gregory should have realized what every practical man who has studied the weather conditions knows, that possibly ten or fifteen times in thirty years, when the rain falls abundantly in the Northern Territory, or north-west Queensland particularly, there comes down a flood of water into the central basin. With the increased rainfall that would certainly eventuate ^on the realization of such a scheme, we should add millions of pounds to the wealth of each of the States affected. It needs only about 2 inches more rain over the western districts of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland to make those States more'productive than people have ever dreamt of. There is only a very narrow margin between the districts which to-day are the best producers of wheat, wool, and meat, and this dry interior. Then, as Professor Gregory and the New South Wales professor states, the dew itself would probably be quite sufficient to make a vast difference for many miles around the great inland sea. I mention this subject to-night, because I think it is one that ought to be thoroughly inquired into. If such a scheme be feasible, we have a magnificent way of absorbing much of the labour of our returned men. It would be an ideal proposition from their point of view, because it would keep them out in the open, in large camps, where they could obtain the same sort of entertainment thafc they are accustomed to. Not one, but, perhaps, a dozen practical men have expressed the opinion to me that such an idea is feasible, and, if that be so, it would be one of the finest outlets possible for the energies of our returned men. to the cost? says tlie cost, would be about £30,000,000. Bufc what is £30,000,000, if it will add another inch or two of rain over the central district of tEis vast continent? It is a mere bagatelle. No man can realize what it would mean to Australia if we had an inland sea instead of a desert. As mentioned in Professor Gregory's book, instead of dry dust and sand, we should have a tempered wind sweeping across the continent; instead of the outback districts being smothered with sand, the hot winds would be, to a large extent, cut off, and the shifting sand held with a growth of herbs and grass. No man can compute the additional wealth which this would mean To the community as a wholes face area of that inland sea ? square miles. The lowest estimate is 2,000 square miles, andfchehighest is four times that area. The matter has never been fully gone into. Some inquiry, I believe, was made into it by the South Australian Parliament, but' it has not yet been looked into with that thoroughness which such a possibility deserves, and it is in this respect that I commend i tfcothe consideration, of the Government. would it be? new constituencies. would out-do Mr Balsillie. the rain-making idea will, so to speak, "" hold water."" I believe that by some scheme of this sort which must come somewhere in the future, we would recreate the ""dead heart "" of Australia into a life-giving area, and save all those districts which are to-day blasted by the winds that blow across the desert. I do not wish to delay the House much longer, but I would impress upon the Government the desirableness of fulfilling its promises in every respect. One of the things which is injuring recruiting to-day, one of the things which is rendering men uncertain as to their future, and causing them grave doubts such as should not exist in the minds of men who are doing their dufcy as they are, is thafc the Government has so far nofc fulfilled its pro-Professo r Gregory mises as fully as they think it should meet them in the future.

379,Mr Fleming,"No, I do not thinkhands. That is a matter of everyday occurrence with a man who has in him any of the blood of manhood. There is no question as to the bravery or otherwise of our men. I believe that ninety-nine out of every hundred in Australia would be quite prepared to go and-face the worse that the world could do for them if they knew that those whom they left behind would be thoroughly cared for. I want to impress upon the Government the necessity for instilling, by their actions, that belief in the minds of those who are going abroad. U p t ill now the men have some reason to doubt that these promises will be fulfilled. I have had brought under my notice even recently cases that often proved misleading-case s which, proved to be without foundation. There have been made in this House n.any statements in regard to soldiers which I am sure, from my own experience amongst soldiers, .would have been found groundless if honourable members had inquired into them. Honourable members will find that the Government is not nearly as bad as it has been' painted; that most of these cases are brought up by men who would not make good in any walk of life. Whilst the best men in Australia-and they are the best who have gone-hav e volunteered, the worse have also gone with them in many cases, and one can only accept the word of every returned man for what it is worth. Eveni f they, were reliable when they went away, some of them have been ruined oversea, and hardly know what they are saying. I have been on recruiting platforms with many of them who seem quite sane and normal under ordinary conditions, but who, when given the extra excitement which is engendered at public meetings, go over the edge, and one has to help them away. That is the state in which many are coming back, and it is due, not only to the stress and trial and nerve-racking experience of modern warfare, but to the fact that they never felt sure in their own minds of the promises so many received as to what would be done to them when they came back, or of the promises as to what would be meted out to the wives and children-the widows and orphans, it might be-of the men they were persuading to go oversea. Just recently the Government issued a , statement that it would help the parents of boys at the Front who were suffering from a financial stand-point because of their enlistment. I brought before the Government a case which, to my own positive knowledge, was as genuine as any that could be put. It was a case of real hardship, where the parents put all their capital into the educating of their son, so that he might be equipped in a reasonable way for modern competition, and assist to provide for them in their old age. When the call came they knew .what it meant to send their boy to the Front. They knew they were sending h i m where he could not carry on his profession, in which he was doing well here. They knew, further, that they were taking the risk of losing him altogether, and of getting a small pittance, which would mean when probed, very little to them. But they sent him. They sacrificed everything. Thank Heaven, the boy is alive to-day, and we hope he w ill return. But those two old people are, or were, in danger of losing their home, because they sent that boytheir only son-to do what they believed to be his duty to the Empire. When the Government promised to relieve cases of that kind, these old people, much against their grain, put in an application. It was turned down. That sort of thing should not be possible. it turned down? only know that the letter I received stated that the authorities had made inquiries into the case, and had regretfully turned it down. I am hot speaking from hearsay, or of a case which I do not know to be thoroughly genuine. I know this case from beginning to end, and it is such in cidents that are breaking down quite a number of men at the Front. There is also the fact that-men are induced to j o in up and be sworn in here by promises which lead them to believe that they w ill be treated differently from what they are treated. opportunity to make it impossible for genuine cases to be turned down. trying to do.

Surely the trials and struggles months' experience in dealing wifch the of modern warfare are sufficient to strain question of repatriation, and I repeat that a man's nerve, without his having any the measure now before us does not go doubt concerning his own position or that one inch further than that which was of those whom he leaves behind. I have dealt with this Bill from the point of view of a man who is inside. I have endeavoured to show as emphatically as I can the dangers in whichfchepublic are apt to be placed because of oversentimentalism in respect of our soldiers. But I wish to impress most forcibly upon the Government the fact that this House is responsible for having sent thousands of men oversea on promises that were made to them, and that this House should see to itfchatthose promises are fulfilled to the letter. The true soldier wants only fair treatment. He does not want any sentimentalism or adulation or flattery. The only thing the Government and this House have to do is to see that the promises made to these men and to those whom they have left behind-som e of them, alas, never to return to them-ar e fulfilled to the very letter; to see that the men who go abroad, and wbo are often, lying in hospitals oversea for months, shall know that whether they come back or go over the Great Divide, those whom they have left behind will be safe in the great comforting arms of Australia.

""The Commission"" means the Repatriation Commission. "" The Minister"" means the Minister of State for Repatriation or the Minister for the time being administering this Act. "" Prescribed"" means prescribed by this Act or the regulations. These are practically. the opening clauses in the two measures, and it will he seen that while there is a difference in words, there is practically no difference in the scope of the two. The only difference is that, whereas the previous Government passed an Act to constitute a Board of. Repatriation Trustees, this B ill abolishes the Board of Repatriation Trustees, and empowers the Minister to constitute a Commission. It is said that we are now starting out to make a Minister of the Crown responsible for the administration of repatriation, but, under last year's measure, a man was made responsible for the administration of repatriation who has had most to say about the war and our duty to the soldiers, namely, the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). He was definitely charged in that measure with its administration. He was Chairman of the Board of Repatriation Trustees, and associated with him were a number of leading public and business men of the country. merely repeal that measure and appoint, instead of tEe Prime Minister and a Board of Trustees, Senator Millen and a Repatriation Commission composed, it may be, not of better men, but) of some different men, does not effect any advance or reform in dealing with this question. the public and business men referred to?

There is a change from a Board of Trustees ito a Repatriation Commission. Two or three of the men included on the Board of Trustees may not be members of the Repatriation Commission, but practically all that is being done is to abolish one Board and substitute another for it , and to substitute Senator Millenf o r the Prime Minister To as the presiding genius. There is no great reform or advance in that. . There is in this B ill no provision to raise a solitary penny for the repatriation of our soldiers.

CATTS -But on that occasion the Postmaster-General very skilfully had all the headings incorporated in Hansard by reading them out one after the other to show what had been cut out of the report. Senator Millen dealt with the line of demarkation between voluntary and Government effort. He pointed out that there would be a registration immediately, and upon the soldier's discharge the Government's responsibiltiy would commence, whereas prior to that he might be assisted from patriotic funds. demarcation is the line drawn between the activities in connection with the various patriotic funds for this purpose and Government activity. On the question of registration Senator Millen saidThe real work of repatriation is to reinstate tend to side-step the insistent demand the discharged soldier in civil life. The first necessity is to insure registration as early as possible. Much delay can be avoided by effective registration prior to discharge. There is nothing new in that. Every man is registered now immediately upon his discharge at the office of discharged soldiers, which is now an existing institution in each of the States. Senator Millen addedRegistration having been effected, the repatriation authorities will proceed to deal with the applications. That is what is being done at present. The next heading is "" L a b o u r Bureaux,"" under which the Minister saidAs a very essential feature in the work of repatriation, it is proposed to establish, in the Central Office of each State a Labour Bureau. The Amelioration Committee of the State War Council have a Labour Bureaui n existence, so in that regard the B ill proposes nothing that is new. Disablement. On this point the M in ister saidWe turn now to the men who eome back with their efficiency impaired as the result of wounds or of illness. It will be necessary to give them training to fit them to take up a new calling to which their present disablement presents no bar. A t the present time, and before this B ill was ever thought of, each State had experts under the StateW a r Councils in every State dealing with this question. Curative workshops. On this the M in ister saidPostmaster-General The first provision will be curative workshops attached to the hospitals. There is now, and has been for some considerable time, a curative workshop at the RandwickM i l it a r y Hospital, with all the necessary scientific instruments to help men, by working them in different directions, to regain the use of paralyzed or partially paralyzed limbs. TheB ill , therefore, does nothing new in that respect.. Private employers. On this the M in ister saidAdvanced training will be provided by an arrangement with private employers, under which the latter will pay in proportion to the What is called value of the amount earned. That means that the Government w ill apparently subsidize private employers, but in many cases these have already agreed to take the men back into their employment. The Government apparently in that private employers shall .carry out their contracts to their employees upon enlistment. of them are keeping their promises. MrJ . H . CATTS I am not referring to most of them. Most of our labour laws are designed for the purpose ;of keeping the unscrupulous employer up to his obligations' and protect the fair employer from unfair competition. The same principle should be incorporated in this B ill in regard' to returned soldiersr There are cases in which private employers are nofc carrying out their promises to the returned soldiers. The New South Wales Government are not doing it. The Commonwealth' Government, who are directly charged with the conduct of fche war and the repatriation of the soldiers, have it in their power to see that all these things are done, if necessary by legislation, so that when the glamour of the present time has passed away, those who have been making these extensive promises will be compelled to honour them. The matter of dealing with private employers was the subject of a question put in the Senate during the short reign of the Government which came in between the last Labour Government and the present one. The present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister then, and the present Ministerf o r Defence",86,Smith Thes E Em Known That One Of The Greatest Violinists

401,Mr Mcwilliams,"I think that most(Senator Pearce) was Minister for Defence then. The reply of the then Minister for Works and Railways (Senator Lynch), recorded on page 10043 of Hansard, was to the effect that it was not within the proper domain of the Government to compel private employers to reinstate their workmen returning from the war. most emphatically that it is within the proper domain of the Government: to see that all promises that are made to the soldiers are f a it h f u l l y carried out. Apprentices. The Minister in the Senate referred to apprentices in these termsAn opportunity to complete their indentures will be afforded to apprentices who had to break off when responding to thc country's call. The country must accept the responsibility of supplementing their wages to enable them to do so. I never heard of that particular proposal before. That insignificant proposal is the first new suggestion of this much-boomed Government, and even that is not in the Bill. Hostels. The Minister saidSome of the incapacitated men will require constant care and attention, and for them special provision will be made, first, by providing special hostels for them. There are such hostels now, so that there is nothing particularly new inthat idea. Sanatoriums. The Minister saidI t is proposed to establish sanatoriums for, tubercular cases. There are such sanatoriums now. Medical Attendance. On this point, the Minister statedTlie initial steps have beentaken to provide medical attendance for discharged soldiers at. local hospitals. That is done now. cases. Mr J. H . CATTS -It may not be so in all local hospitals, but it is certainly so at the big hospitals in the cities. are at a disadvantage at present. Mr J. H . CATTS -As far as I know, our hospitals are treating returned soldiers without question, whether they be city or country institutions. No case has yet been brought under notice where any difficulty has existed; but I will tell the honourable member what the Government are doing. A t the Randwick Military Hospital, in Sydney, there are upwards of 200 men who were discharged from the hospital before they were fit to be dis-' charged, and after being outside for some time they had to be taken back for treatment. Their pay has been stopped, and they have been getting a very small pension of from 7a. 6d. to 15s. a week. This means tliat the Government have robbed I assert those soldiers of their pay for a considerable period when they should have been on the pay-roll of the Government for the whole time, and in the care of the hospital. faul t of the medical men who discharged them? MrJ . H . CATTS -No, it was the faul t of the directions issued to the medical men under which they were compelled to act. It was not done at the wish of the ofiicers in charge of the administration of the institution. you refer? MrJ . H . CATTS I do not know the number. That is a very good catch question. a regulation. Let us know what it is. MrJ . H . CATTS -The Minister is endeavouring to side-track me by asking for the number of the regulation. He' could not himself give the. number of one single Defence regulation dealing w i th any question, although he helps to pass them. Senator Millen, in his speech referring to the manufacture of artificial limbs, saidI t is proposed to establish a factory for the manufacture of limbs, with branches in the respective States. I point out that at least six months ago It is not done in many a Committee was in existence for the purpose of carrying out this proposal, so there was nothing fresh in what the M in ister said. It is the country men who member trying to make out that re-. patriation is not needed ? MrJ . H . CATTS -The Ministerf o r the Navy has just come into'the House, and does not know what I am referring to. WhatI am saying is that this B ill does not show that we have gained anything from the experience of the last eighteen months in the administration of a repatriation scheme.

It has not been shown that there is any real difference between the scope of the two measures at all. ferred to finance, and he remarked"" Land settlement is a big proposition."" Of course, everybody knows that. Minister spoke of the Conference, held last February between ithe Commonwealth and. the States on this subject, and saidThe Commonwealth Government undertook, therefore, to make advances to the States, to be in turn advanced by them to the settler, to enable the latter to effect improvements, purchase plant, seeds, stock, &c. The limit in every case was to be £500. The advances to the settler were to be upon favorable terms as to interest and repayment. The Government, like a Je-w money lender, must extract its f u l l pound of flesh from our returned soldiers. I repudiate this demand for interest. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 2nd A p r i l of this year, there appears the following statementsMelbourne, Sunday -A t a meeting of Russians on Saturday night, the Consul-General for Russia, Mr A. D'Abaza, stated that tlie Commonwealth Bank had agreed to advance £20,000 without interest towards the cost of repatriating Russians. If we can advance money without interest for the repatriation of Russians, why cannot we advance money similarly for the repatriation of Australians ? A f t e r all, we shall be giving them nothing, if we advance them a sum of money and require payment of interest and principal. Let us infuse some life into the dead bones of this B ill , and see tliat our soldiers get an advance, without repayment of either principal or interest, of an amount necessary to enable them to' provide for the support of a family. If we do that we shall have done something of a practical nature for our soldiers in ret u r n for what they have done for us. Senator Millen went on to sayThe States undertook tbe responsibility of paying to the Commonwealth the interest, ""and repaying the principal of the amount so advanced. . . . Queensland, through its representatives, intimated its inability to fall in in the establishment of residences in urban with the arrangement, and for the present, therefore, the agreement is limited to five States. I point out, however, that the Queensland Government is doing more than the Mr J. H. Catts. Government in any other State, and more than the Commonwealth Government propose to do under this scheme, because Queensland is offering good land to returned soldiers, irrespective of the State from which they come. British or AusSenator Millen retralian soldiers alike may get an advance to the amount of £1,500. The are doing that under an agreement made by Sir Rider Haggard. Mr J. H . CATTS They are not doing so much as Queensland. In New South Wales the whole of the land settlement work is removed from the Repatriation Fund, and the State Government is arranging for the settlement of the men. Senator Millen also stated that some 40,000 soldiers had indicated a wish to go upon th« land, and addedTt is difficult, therefore, to state the average -Amount required for a holding, but if the present forms of settlement are continued, it may be estimated at £1,000. If to this is added the £500 for improvements, &c. then a total of £60,000,000 is involved. Does the Government propose to do anything about that? I see no provision for it in this B ill . scheme for shifting sand? MrJ . H . CATTS I noticed that the honourable member who preceded me conceived a brilliant idea that our returned soldiers should be put on to dig a canal in the heart of the desert in the centre of Australia-fro m Port Augusta to Lake Eyre, and that this proposal to spend £30,000,000 for shifting sand was rather enthusiastically acclaimed by the honorbald). Seuator Millen went on to sayForestryA considerable volume of labour could lie employed in forestry development. . . . . Another and larger undertaking which, whilst having a distinct and important bearing on Australian development, can also, I think, be made a useful adjunct to the work of repatriation, is the Murray River scheme. . . . I am inquiring to see how far it may be practicable to provide a joint employment and settlement scheme in connection with this work l t is reasonable to assume that many of those returned may desire that the assistance to be rendered, shall take the form of assistance areas. This, to some extent, is also being done at present.

410,Able Member For Hindmarsh ( Mr Archi,"far has provided relief in about 300 cases. If the Commonwealth Government wants to advance along progressive lines it might very well imitate the work done in New South Wales by making it apply throughout the Commonwealth, as has been requested by the War Councilsi n the respective States. We are told by Senator Millen that in regard to administrationthere will be an honorary Commission of seven, of which the Minister will be chairman. The Commission will include two returned soldiers, and will prescribe by regulation tbe nature and extent of the many beneficial activities embraced in the work of repatriation. In all this there is nothing representing any advance upon the administration of repatriation at the present time. Members .on this side have a few definite proposals to make with regard to this important subject, and we hope they will be fairly discussed by the House before this B i ll is disposed of. Mr J. H . CATTS I cannot too strongly emphasize, the point that unless guarantees are put in the. B i ll the promises made will not be very much good. experience of legislation know that all sorts of things are promised at election time, in the heat of the moment, when some sentiment is prevailing, such as there is afc present. It is an occasion on which wholesale promises are made, but they are forgotten very soon. We shall have no guarantee to the returned soldiers unless it is put in the B ill . It should not be lef t to the mere whim and caprice of any Minister or set of Ministers to say whether things are to be given effect to or not. One provision we would like to have in the B ill is that all totally disabled returnedsoldiers, and widows of soldiers, and dependent children of deceased soldiers, shall be housed free for life by the Government. are grandfathers? MrJ . H . CATTS -No; I said while they are dependants. life."" Mr J. H . CATTS I mean until they reach the age of sixteen years. We want a provision that widows and totally disabled soldiers shall be housed free for life, and that the dependants of deceased soldiers shall be housed while they are dependants-that is, until they get beyond the age of dependency. Here is a definite principle which could be incorporated in the measure, and would be a legal guarantee to all those who go to the war. Another provision we want is that returned wounded or otherwise incapacitated soldiers shall be kept on the pay-roll until provided with employment. Then we should not have returned soldiers walking about the streets unable to obtain employment as we have at present. We also want a provision that employers promising to keep positions open for those who enlist shall register such promises, with the names of the men enlisting to whom it applies, and shall be compelled to honour their contracts un fche return of the soldiers. This provision should also apply to public authorities and to all inducements, such as promises to make up the difference in pay, to pay in I hope so. surance premiums, <kc. Further, we want to provide that where assistance-to returned soldiers is necessary to establish them in civil life, the amount required to enable them to support a Those of us who have had family shall not be subject to the payment of interest or the repayment of principal. In these three groups we deal with dependants of soldiers, who, without question, are a proper charge on the country. In the second group we deal with private employment for the men where their re-employment has been promised upon return from the war. And -thirdly we should make some guarantee to those who will have to be dependent upon tlie Government for their re-establishment in civil life. Ib means that in those cases which are not provided for by private employers, and in those cases where private employers have promised to reinstate the men on their return, the Government shall takeon its shoulders the responsibility of seeing fchat the men's interests Until after they are properly protected and advanced. If we do thab, we shall cover the whole range of the returned soldiers and their dependants. If we wish to show our said "" for sincerity towards the men we w ill put these provisions in the B ill , so that there can be no dispute that these matters have to be dealt with.

421,Mr Palmer (Echuca) [10.38],"son at the Front tliat her boy had only been food for German cannon. I have a further letter this morning from another person at Epping, who states that Umlauft said that England had no right to interfere in this war. He has annoyed the people of Epping to such an extent that they are prepared to go a long way to have this man removed; but, owing to the fact that there arc many German residents living in the district, the shopkeepers especially are loath to appear, in Court in support of affidavits, which otherwise they areprepared to make. I have personally investigated this case, and I have discussed the matter with Major Hogan, O.C. of the Intelligence Department. My request is. therefore, that affidavits made -by the citizens of Australia may be treated as confidential by your Department, and only subject to confidential investigation by any officers of your Department other than the CourtI desire to bring under the notice of I am quite sure you will see that it is a very the House a case of most infamous and hard matter that people who have been insulted, as undoubtedly this man has insulted many residents of Epping, tliat the3' should have to bear insults, and have practically no redress, short of intimidation, loss of business, and annoyance from the remaining German residents, owing to their having to appear in Court. IfI might be allowed to make a suggestion, I would submit that any affidavit made under these circumstances should be certified to by the magistrate before whom it is sworn as to the credibility of the signatory. On 22nd August, Sir Robert Garran, Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, sent this replyWith reference to your letter of the 13th ult. and loth inst., I have the honour to inform you that advice has been received from the Defence Department that inquiries made regarding Mr Umlauft have failed to disclose any information that would justify action against him. That letter shows that apparently tant communications do not get beyond the Secretary of the Department to the Ministerial head. In this instance, the citizens .asked that in a case in which a man was known to be disloyal, and was intimidating a whole district, should be held sub rosa; but the departmental head, instead of bringing the matter under the notice of bis Minister, apparently submitted it to the Defence Department. The latter, which, I assume, is not accustomed to the sifting of evidence, presumes to say that the correspondence fails to disclose any that would justify action against the man. To whom did the Department dence ? I submit that there is a substantial grievance here. If the citizens of the Commonwealth Germans they have a right to be protected by the Government. Afr.

I think he has a right to be made aware of it , and I take this, opportunity of bringing the matter under his notice. I ask the Government to see that the case is properly investigated, and that those wh.o are prepared to give evidence receive ithe support mentioned in the first answer, namely, that the sources of any information supplied to the Government are not to be disclosed. brutal treatment of a soldier's wife by a landlord. I have here the rent book of Mrs. Violet Clarke, living at 28 Dickensstreet, North Carlton, which shows that her rent has been paid up to next Saturday She was known to the agent, Mr. William Dodd, who is the reputed owner, before she took the house, but a notice to quit was nailed to her door; the agent had not the decency to call. For the last two years and four months Mrs. Clarke's husband has been at the Front fighting for the liberty of this brutal landlord, and I have been informed by a neighbour that this man has dared to take this action in time of war because the lady is a Socialist. I regret that Parliament is about to adjourn for some weeks, because when Parliament is not sitting there is no opportunity for ventilating cases such as this imporand the one mentioned by the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer). So far Parliament has done nothing of importance, and I take this opportunity of protesting against an adjournment at this time of the an investigation year. I shall hand the rent book andpapers to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, and I know that the matter will be attended to. But is it not time that the War Precautions Act was utilized to prevent actions of this kind ?. information rent are now being framed, and will be issued immediately. stances I have nothing more to say.

Surely when accidents are taking place on ships going to sea there should be no question whatsoever as to the men employed on them being loyal Britishers. I do not say that the fact that a man is a unionist or a non-unionist, or is prepared to uphold the strike or to try to break it, has anything to do with his loyalty to the Empire But in the carrying on of these internal disputes care ought to be taken that the Government's enthusiasm for smashing up the unions and breaking a strike does not extend to the employment of any one merely because he applies for work. first asks whether it is a fact, and then alleges that ib is. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not allege that it is. I do not say that the Government have gone so far. The information given to me in this case, however, has all the appearance of reliability. The person who informed me of it has never informed me wrongly concerning any .matter, and I have known the party for many years.
