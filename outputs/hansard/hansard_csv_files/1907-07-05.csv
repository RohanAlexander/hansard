Notwithstanding the absence of the leader of the -Opposition, for reasons about which I am not called upon to express an opinion, I think that, as the Prime Minister has just returned from a visit to the old country, where he took part in a Conference with representatives from all parts of the British Empire, he had no justification for withholding from the House information as to what was done there. yesterday that he is unwell. and I am sorry to hear it. I hope that we shall have the privilege of listening to the honourable and learned gentleman as soon as he is in health again, because it would be most reprehensible to allow to pass the earliest opportunity for informing the House of what took place at the Conference. The position of affairs in this Chamber to-day is much the same as that which existed during last Parliament. We had a general election! in December last, but on the new House reassembling,,: although the cjry of many members of the Ministry had been that' a change in the Tariff was urgently necessary, we were immediately asked to consent to a prorogation for several months. According to some members, the settlement of the Tariff question was an urgent matter two years ago. hence. would have to go without their Christmas dinner in 1904 because of the starving condition of some of the Victorian industries then, but while the Deakin Administration has been in office ever since, they have done nothing in the matter, except to announce that the Tariff Commission has presented reports from time to time. I am anxious to have the Tariff question settled, and the Ministers now in power are those who should bring forth proposals for settling it. But, while engaged on this work, to use the language of Jim in the "" Squaw Man,"" "" They should not stop to pick flowers on the way."" Although most members of the Government granting effective protection to our industries, at least one Minister did nothing of the kind. The Treasurer gentleman does not choose to remain! in the Chamber while I am criticising his actions, that is entirely a matter for himself. I wish to say that although I believe some members of the Government are genuinely in favour of granting an increased measure of protection to Australian industries, the Treasurer is not. The sole issue upon which he fought the recent election in Western Australia was an anti-Labour one. "" swells "" should be returned to Parliament. other things, that only "" swells"" and wealthy men should get into Parliament. But I propose to deal with his attitude in regard to the Tariff question. Whilst his colleagues in the Ministry were appealing to the electors to return candidates who were pledged to alter the Tariff in the direction of granting effective protection to our industries, the Treasurer was supporting the candidature of a free-trader in the person of Dr. Thurston, who was standing in opposition to Mr Fowler for the seat of Perth. He did so, despite the fact that Dr. Thurston had proclaimed himself a Reidite and a free-trader. the only differences between himself and the leader of the Opposition are differences in respect of the Tariff. tween them is that they do not seem to be able to fit into one Ministry.

One of these readsThe Labour Party had fourteen members in the Senate, and expected to get five more. This would give them a majority, and every single measure that was passed would have to be approved by that party. This seemed to him one of the gravest questions they had to confront. The Labour Party would then carry out their whole platform, which was against the vested interests of the community, and it meant taking from those that had, and giving to those that had not. They had no admiration for self-denial or economy, but they took the industry of others and gave it to those who had not been so industrious. that? tion campaign. I notice that the right honourable gentleman has not put in an appearance in the Chamber. It is a singular circumstance that he never can be present when he is to be subjected to adverse criticism. At such times some matter of pressing importance always calls him elsewhere. In view of his attitude during the recent election it is somewhat remarkable that at the present time he is as gentle as a cooing dove whilst occupying a seat upon the Treasury benches, where he is, to a great extent, under the control of the very party which he so violently denounced. fortable seats upon the Treasury benches. comfortable to some Ministers as they appear to be. The Treasurer went further, and declaredThe Labour Party were aiming at a Utopia where every one would be equal, and every one would be poor. Probably there are some members of this Parliament who believe that they conform to the latter portion of that description. To my mind it is an extraordinary circumstance that a gentleman who has had a pretty considerable /public career, who has occupied a proud position in the politics of his State for many years, should in the final stages of that career be so absolutely incapable of giving effect to the opinions which he has so openly expressed. I would also remind honourable members that we have had experience of the right honourable gentleman as a constitutionalist. When the Labour Government were in, office he affirmed that they were unconstitutionally there, because they did not The present management of Parliament by the Labour Government is scandalous as well as being demoralizing to responsible government. May I remind him that when the Labour Government were in office their followers were considerably in excess of the adherents of the present Ministry, so that if the former were unconstitutionally upon the Treasury benches, what can be said of the latter? Apparently the only consideration which weighs with the Treasurer is whether he is a member of the Government of the day. If he is, everything is satisfactory from his stand-point, but if not, did he say the reverse is the case. There is another complaint which I have to urge against the right honourable gentleman, and it is certainly the most serious of all. Whilst his attitude upon the Tariff question un-. doubtedly evidenced, to use sporting language, "" an extraordinary reversal of form,"" it did not inflict any considerable injury upon the Commonwealth. But to his action in another connection we should all give serious attention. During the progress of the recent campaign it was not an unusual thing to find the Treasurer openly coquetting with the anti-Federal movement, promoted by a small section in Western Australia. In one of his afterdinner speeches at Newcastle he went so far as to assert that I f there was no railway there would be no union, so far as he was concerned. He participated in the cry which was raised of injustice to Western Australia, and did all in his power to foment anti-Federal feeling, regardless of what might be the consequence of his assistance to the movement. conduct. duct. What was the object that he had in view ? After violently denouncing the Labour Party in another speech he concluded by saying thatHe wanted men to go with him to the Parliament of the Commonwealth who had opinions of their own, not men who obeyed labour unions. He wanted colleagues who would obey him. Then Western Australia would be safe. He obtained one colleague from Western Australia-o r at least one who was supposed to be a colleague-bu t as soon as this gentleman arrived in Melbourne he took his seat upon the Opposition side of thei House.

Throughout Western Australia we had to contend during the recent campaign with this anti-Federal feeling, and I do say that it i ; most reprehensible for a Federal Minister, who has sworn to uphold the Commonwealth Constitution, to give expression to utterances which can only tend to embitter the feeling which exists between the States and the Federation. Now, I wish to say a word or two in reference to the Conference of Premiers which was recently held in Brisbane. correct title to apply to such gatherings would be ""the anti-Federal conspiracy."" Whenever the State Premiers have met since the establishment of Federation, they have in the main discussed questions with which this Parliament alone is competent to deal, whilst the tone of their debates has been distinctly hostile and embarrassing to the F'ederal authority. ference in Brisbane, the Federal Treasurer practically gave his consent-and , I nresume, that of the Government to a continuance for a period of ten years of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth upon a basis somewhat similar to that underlying existing relations. Paragraph 6 of the Governor General's Speech readsThe subject of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States has been further discussed with the States Premiers, and the results arrived at will be communicatetd to you. The great issues affected, including the federalization of old-age pensions, will be considered in this relation. I wish to say that if there be one question more than another upon which the attitude of the Government has brought them into popular contempt, it is that of Federal old age pensions. speaking at Bunbury recently, shed crocodile tears in discussing the position of the aged poor of Western Australia, he concluded his address by telling them that, under existing financial conditions, the Commonwealth had not the means to pay them the pensions that he would like them to receive; but these conditions were soon to be ended. tion, which was evidently made for th»j purpose of misleading the old men and women of that State, he [6] attended the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane, and actually agreed to a proposal to continue the existing financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth for a period of ten years It is where .he will be on nearly the present basis. In my opinion, the arrangement which he made with the States Premiers would hamper the Commonwealth to such an extent that its sphere of usefulness must be very seriously reduced. AlthoughI am not opposed to a reasonable return being made' by the Commonwealth to the States, I certainly object to the continuance of fhe system prevailing under the Braddon section, whilst I consider that, from the Commonwealth point of view, the new scheme proposed by the Federal Treasurer would be In my judgment, the infinitely worse. As to the faking over of the States debts, I think that the Government, if they wish to settle the question, must either exercise their right under the Constitution to take over the debts existing at the time of the establishment of the Federation, or seek further constitutional powers. Judging by the attitude of the States Premiers, I do not At the recent Conthink there is a possibility of our securing from the States anything to which we are not entitled under the Constitution. That being so, if we desire to effect the savings that we are told must result from the taking over of the debts of the States, we should either make up our minds to exercise our present powers, or seek from the people an extension of our constitutional authority 'enabling us to take over the whole of the debts. I am sure that such an extension would be readily granted. I sincerely hope that, in the near future, arrangements will be made to place the finances of the Commonwealth on such a basis that an end may be put to the dreary repetition of the statement in speech after speech by the Governor General that the Government intend to establish a system of old-age pensions. Instead of such promises, let us have the announcement that Although the Treasurer, a scheme so beneficial has actually been carried into effect. Having regard to public opinion, a Government that is not prepared to face) the necessities of the situation in this regard has no right to remain in office. There are other matters which indicate that the Treasurer's Federal spirit is a doubtful quantity, but since the right honourable gentleman has left the Despite this declaraChamberI shall not refer to them. Turnijhg from the financial problem to other considerations, may I say that I trust",17,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
31,Mr Page,That is where the Treasurer,18,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
32,Mr Frazer,"that in any new agreement for the carriage of our oversea mails we shall achieve something better than we had under the mail contract recently cancelled. apparent months ago to any one familiar with the methods of financial speculators and syndicate hawkers, that the contract was in the hands of such men, and the Government, by allowing them to trifle with them, and failing earlier to take decisive action, have held themselves up to the contempt of the people of Australia. I trust that in any new agreement that may be entered into, provision will be made for a substantial deposit being lodged with the Government as a guarantee of good faith. For some months prior to the cancellation of the contract, it was pointed out again and again that the contractors were not making such progress with the building of the ships and the other arrangements necessary for the carrying out of their agreement as might reasonably be expected; and I sincerelytrust that we shall take care that the Federation henceforth is not used by syndicators for money-making purposes. The transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is another question of great importance. From the meagre information that I have been able to secure from the Government since my return to Melbourne, I am forced to the conclusion that the agreement which the Prime Minister entered into with the Premier of South Australia was made without caref u l consideration ;as to the possibility of the undertaking being made a profitable and satisfactory one. I am at one with those who say that it is absolutely essential to people the Northern Territory. that it is within striking distance of hordes of Eastern races, who are awakening to a sense of their power, and that if allowed to remain unpeopled, it may at any time become a menace to us. mare. honourable member, but it is not to me. I thoroughly appreciate situation that must be apparent to any one who has given the matter careful thought. The most effective defence open to us is that to be secured by settling a white population on the lands of Australia. The Commonwealth should be able to control the Territory to better advantage than can South Australia, but I wish to draw, the attention of the House to statements which I think we should seriously consider It was before confirming the agreement tentatively made between the, Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia. In yesterday's issue of a Melbourne daily newspaper we had the statement thatIt will thus be seen that out of a total of 136,475 square miles leased, no less a portion than 86,295 square miles, or 55,228,000 acres has been alienated from the Crown for a period of fortytwo years, during which time it cannot be resumed without payment of compensation, and, for the first ten years of the term, not at all, except with the consent in writing of the lessees. period has expired. but the position is sufficiently serious to arrest attention. Surely the Prime Minister was conversant with these facts when he entered into the agreement. We may rest assured that the lands that have been alienated comprise not the sandy patches, but the best pastoral, agricultural, and mining country available. areas may be resumed without compensation. to hear later on from the honourable member an explanation of these matters. the leases in question? able to ascertain, they are held by about a dozen men. Another significant statement-and we have not yet heard from the Prime Minister anything in regard to it-isitha t reported to have been made by the Premier of South AustraliaThe Commonwealth Government also agreed to take over the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta-that is, to take control of it, but to give South Australia the same facilities and running powers as the State has at present, and to give any improvements that may be necessary. In other words we are to give them the present service, or, if desired, something It may be to the better. We shall run the railway as at present, but the situationa it w ill be done for the Commonwealth Government. Then we come to the pith of the statement by the Premier of South Australia. This will relieve South Australia of an annual loss of j£82,ooo. Another statement made by Mr Price, and published in the Adelaide Advertiser",18,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

42,Mr Frazer,"S o far as I have beena couple of days after the agreement was entered into, is as follows:A most important matter that it the Northern lineshall be the first through line. WhatI mean is that there will not be any shooting off from this trans-continental route to touch Brisbane first, or anything like that. Including the loss we are bearing on our lines, this agreement will relieve us of a burden of a quarter of a million a )'ear. AlthoughI recognise the necessity of altering the control of the Northern Territory, and am prepared to make many small sacrifices in order that the control may be transferred to the Commonwealth, I feel that such statements as these, coming as they do from the Premier of South Australia, will justify us in most carefully scrutinizing the agreement before we finally adopt it. I am prepared to approach its consideration with an open mind. this, the Legislative Council of South Australia will not confirm the agreement. point to which I desire to refer relates to the alleged labour necessities of Queensland. The attitude adopted by the Government in regard to this matter shows that they are far from being in sympathy with the aspirations of the people of Australia. They are permitting agreements Colonial Office, for some reason or other, to be made for the importation of foreign advised British people not to come to the labour-so long as it is white labour sugar fields. -to be employed in the cane-fields.

EDWARDS -We have no desire to change the opinion of the House; we wish lo have white people. wish to see the industry continued as successfully as it is at present; but I think that the honourable member for Oxley will admit that the attitude of this Parliament towards the sugar industry has been pretty generous throughout. The Government ought, however, to insist on an effort being made to obtain labour in the British Dominions before the representatives of those engaged in the sugar industry are permitted to seek it in foreign countries. I have been in communication with several of the immigrants who lately arrived in New South Wales under the conditions offered by the Government of that State, and amongst these were notably some Scotchmen, who assured me that if the all conditions of labour in the Queensland sugar industry had been made known in many parts of Scotland and the North of Another England, they were certain there would have been no necessity to go to foreign countries for labour. In my opinion the agents of the sugar planters in Queensland have made no serious effort up to the present time to get British labour. In this connection there is certainly room for an alteration in the attitude adopted by the Britishers in preference to foreigners.

51,Mr Frazer,"That is unfortunate, i fhave the history of these negotiations repeated. We know, however, that in the opinion of the members of this Parliament the settlement of the site of the Federal Capital is constitutionally in the hands of the Commonwealth; further, that certain sites, including Dalgety, were offered by a previous New South Wales Premier, and that both Houses of this Parliament agreed on the site I have just mentioned. never offered. amongst those offered by the then Premier of New South Wales, the late Sir John See, and I am sure that the honourable member who interjects will admit that it is only a quibble to say that this site was not offered, but that Bombala was. Federal Parliament carried out its portion of the contract, and settled on a site which, in our opinion, would be acceptable to the people of Australia. That decision was arrived at by a majority vote of both Houses; but New South Wales got a new Premier, in the person of Mr Carruthers, who deliberately withdrew the offer, and broke the agreement entered into by the previous Premier. Personally, I desire to see this question of the Federal Capital Site settled, and New South Wales given that to which she is entitled under the bond. ThisI am prepared to grant to New South Wales at the earliest possible moment, but when that State has deliberately broken the promise she gave to the Commonwealth I refuse to reverse the vote I previously gave for what, in my opinion, is the best possible site. Of course I do not know what are the provisions of the promised B ill , or how it will advance the setcase of the Federal Capital site, there was tlement of the question, but there is no doubt that we shall have to face the inevitable. The Commonwealth Parliament must take one of two courses-w e must bow to the New South Wales Parliament, and let the latter choose the site, or we must assert our constitutional rights, and make ourselves possessors of the territory on which we have decided. Victoria? majoritv of the members of Parliament, or the bulk of the people, desire that the seat of Government should continue to be in Victoria. In my opinion there is no truth in the cry raised by the Premier and the newspapers of New South Wales, in order to embitter the feeling against Federation, that the people of Victoria are anxious to retain the Seat of Government within their borders. ring "" to cover up the land scandals of New South Wales. at any rate, I have never heard any desire or opinion expressed to that effect while I have been resident in Victoria. However, all that does not affect my position; I desire to see the question settled quickly. The Commonwealth ought not to bow down to the State of New South Wales in view of the fact that a site has already been constitutionally agreed upon. My opinion is that provision should be made to permit the highest legal tribunal in the ComThe monwealth to decide once and for all whether the Commonwealth or the State of New South Wales has the power to fix the Capital Site, and I hope the Government will take steps to that end with all reasonable despatch.

In the other case, there was a verbal or implied promise by the leaders of the Federal movement, and there now seems to be a disposition on the part of a section of the Federal Parliament to repudiate that promise. As I say, Parliament is desirous to settle the question of the Federal site, whereas the majority in another place do not seem to approve of tbe I do not think that the construction of the transcontinental railway. If there be any analogy between the positions, Parliament is doing what it can to settle the question of the Capital Site, but has not done all it can to settle the question of the railway.

The great natural resources of Australia-whic h might have been exploited years ago-have , owing to the absence of a little assistance, been allowed to remain undeveloped. That position will , I believe, be overcome by the granting of a bounty. Although we have the squealing Premier of New, South Wales stating that he is opposed to any action on the part of the Federal Government in connection with the iron industry, I believe that that industry will require further assistance than has been granted by the State Government, and, personally, I am prepared, as a member of this House, to give that assistance. The pearling industry is another that could be benefited by the application of the bounty system. That industry at present is entirely in the hands of coloured people, although white people are as competent and successful divers as the men now engaged. The only difficulty is the absence of any assistance or encouragement, and I think it would be possible to grant a bounty Cn a well-matured system, which would lead to the encouragement of white labourers and the displacement of foreigners. would white-wash the bottom of the ocean ! ; dertake such an impossible task, but I <lo desire to encourage the jemployment of white Australians and Britishers in preference to coloured people. other points in His Excellency's speech to which I desire to refer. In conclusion, I may say that if the Government show any desire to so amend the Tariff as to make it thoroughly effective, and, if the member, of the Government to whom I made particular allusion this morning is still prepared to swallow everything and remain in his present position, I shall still be prea protectionist. Therefore nothing could pared to assist in getting the Tariff out of the way. As to other matters, I shall take a later opportunity to express my views more f u l l y . I hope the consideration of the Tariff will be proceeded with almost immediately. companion to the Tariff is not mentioned in conjunction with that measure in His Excellency's speech. immigration and of the necessity for population, we seem to forget that the land monopolist is the greatest bar to progress in this connection, and, although we are always hearing the expression of opinions in favour of attracting immigration to our shores, and of providing employment in Australian industries at the expense of the Commonwealth revenue-n o effort has been made, by the imposition of an equitable land tax, to cause land to be available for our people, and to obtain revenue for a humane system of old-age pensions. This is a deficiency for which the Prime. Minister may be able to give us a reason, and I hope to. have an opportunity of listening to him in the near future. I should not have risen this morning but for the personal attack on the Treasurer made by the honourable member for K a l goorlie. over Western Australia denouncing the Labour Party. large part of Western Australia almost before the honourable member was born. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made a personal attack on the right honourable member, and tried to make me appear as one of his followers. tacked himself on to the Treasurer during the election contest. statements which the honourable member made in regard to the doings of the Treasurer were no more true than his statements There are no relating to Dr. Thurston, no reliance can be placed upon them. I was present at the Queen's Hall in Perth when Dr. Thurston was asked if he was a protectionist or a free-trader, and I heard him say that, -while in the past his sympathies had been with free-trade, he was now sure that protection is the proper thing for Australia, and came before the constituency as be said against the Treasurer for supporting Dr. Thurston, supposing that he did so. Dr. Thurston was opposing a free trader in the honourable member who represents Perth. I can understand a profesI am sorry that the natural sional man being a free-trader, but I do not know why a Labour man should be one. In my opinion all^Labour men should When we talk of be protectionists. The remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie about the Treasurer were quite uncalled for. I wish that there were more men who had done as much for Australia as the Treasurer has done, and, although I am not a follower of the right honourable gentleman, I shall not allow him to be abused in his absence.

The honourable member for Gippsland congratulated us upon the departure from precedent shown in its for m ; but, to my mind, there is nothing commendable in that. In the first place we find that it is addressed to nobody in particular, but to the world at large or to anybody who may choose to take it to himself. Further, it contains no reference to the question of .granting Supply. Whether the statement be true, which was published in the Age, that this omission was made in order to placate the'Senate, I cannot say, but I very much question the right of the other branch of the Legislature to have .an equal voice with this House in the granting of Supply. I am of opinion that the speech should have contained a reference to the question of voting Supply, and that such reference should have been addressed to members of this House only. ThenI should like to protest against a third omission from the speech. I observe that all reference to Divine Providence has been omitted from it-eve n the customary prayer at the end of it. The statement which commends itself most to my judgment is contained in paragraph 10, which relates to the cancellation of the mail contract. .greatest piece of muddling with which the present Government has been associated. Personally I regret that the contract was not cancelled months ago. drawn-out negotiations have brought, only ridicule upon the Commonwealth and discredit upon the Ministry. As soon as it was seen that the bona fides of the syndicate were open, to question, that it had merely secured a speculative option for the purpose of exploiting the London moneymarket, action should have been taken to cancel the contract. It was not sufficient for the Postmaster-General to adopt his usual attitude of admitting nothing and denying everything. I hope that the new specifications will be so drawn that there w ill be no room for a repetition of such muddling, and that the Commonwealth Government will insist upon a substantial cash deposit being made as an evidence of the bond fides of tenderers. To my I believe that money for a mind it is one of the most serious indictments which can be levelled against Federal administration that after six years' experience of it there is a feeling of antagonism to it throughout all the States. We have bitter complaints concerning Federal administration, not only from New South Wales, but from Queensland and Western Australia. complaints. lying these comiplaints is that Federation has not fulfilled the great predictions which were made at the time it was inaugurated. At that period we had streams of oratory, which were intended to show the absolute necessity of enacting uniform laws throughout the States. We were assured that we needed uniform banking, company, and bankruptcy laws. But nothing has been done by Parliament in that' direction, and after six years' experience of Federation we merely find a reference to them at the fag end of the Governor General's speech. I saythat it behoves us to do our best to redeem the promises which were made when the Federation was established. Even in connection with the transferred Departments we have not had any judicious administration. In the Post Office, which was one of the first Departments taken over, we have found that the last state is worse than the first. Even now we have no uniform administration in connection with the Department. We have not a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth. The stamps So ends what is perhaps the sold in one State by the Commonwealth Government are dishonoured by the Federal authorities in an adjoining State. Similarly we have no uniform telegraph forms, The longand we have different postal notes. I was recently informed that a gentleman handed in at the Brisbane Post Office a telegram which was written upon a New South Wales telegraph form, and the officer in charge refused to accept it until it was written upon a Queensland form. So much for Federal administration. Then we have a constant concentration of Federal business in Melbourne.

The Telephone Department does not evidence any better administration, though the Postmaster-General has only told us that when he obtains new telephones we may expect ;a better state of affairs. A good deal has been said during the course of the debate upon the question of the Federai Capital. So far as New South Wales is concerned, nothing hjas created such a bitter anti-Federal spirit as has the unsatisfactory position which exists to-day in regard to this matter The honourable member for New England deprecated what he called the parochial spirit of the honourable member for Lang. But, to my mind, it is not a question of parochialism, but of adhering to a bargain which has been made. a reply which he made to the honourable member for Maranoa, he stated that the cry in reference to the Federal Capital in New South Wales was merely a political one, which was raised by a few Sydney merchants. In making th,at statement he showed that he is in absolute ignorance of the real state of affairs there.

WheneverI omitted to refer to that the Parliament shall observe the spirit the question of the Capital site, I was inof the promise made to New South Wales variably asked whether I would do all in my power to expedite its settlement. The position of New South Wales prior to Federation was very different from that of any of the other States. This House must always was a very strong minority against Federation from the beginning to the end of the fight. If I remember rightly, there were I visited the Departover 83,000 electors who voted against the Constitution Bill upon the referendum. One of the strongest .arguments used by the opponents of that measure, particularly that the clause which gave the Seat of Government to New South Wales was merely a bogy, that the Federal Capital would be located in Melbourne, and would remain there for an indefinite period. That statement was broadcasted throughout New South Wales. It was repeated so frequently that the champions of Federation there deemed it necessary to secure personal letters from the Premiers of the other States indignantly repudiating the -suggestion. These letters were published at the time. Now those who fought for Federation are continually being met with the very irritating statement, "" I told you so. WhatI said has come absolutely true."" I admit that it has come true, inasmuch as the In Seat of Government is still in Melbourne, and is, apparently, likely to remain there for some time. The bargain which was made with New South Wales was that the Capital should be within its borders, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. I do not forget that that limit was agreed to as a compromise between two proposals. The feeling in New South Wales is that the Federal Capital ought to be somewhere on the line of the 100-mile limit. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was very insistent that there was an unwritten promise that we should have a transcontinental railway connecting Western Australia with the eastern States.

I take exception to the selection which the Government made of representatives of the Commonwealth at the two recent Conferences in England. Why was the Minister of Trade and Customs selected tc* represent Australia? He certainly went to England without any mandate from Parliament. I recognise, of course, that the Ministry had the power to appoint whom it pleased, and have no doubt that they found it very convenient to send the Minister to the Navigation Conference, since such a man as the Treasurer was to be Acting Prime Minister during the absence of the leader of the Government. The position reminds one of the story of the individual who had to cross a river in a boat, taking with him a fox and a goose, and who found it very undesirable to leave both of them together on the land.

Nothing, however, has been said by the Prime Minister, nor have we heard anything from the leader of the Labour Party. to say that the leader of the Opposition is not present, though we know therp are -certain circumstances in his case which preclude his attendance. What are the facts in regard to the offers made by the Commonwealth Government to the Imperial Government in the matter of preferential trade? astute statesmen like Mr Lloyd George, Mr Churchill and Mr Asquith to at once see through the offer which the Australian Prime Minister presented. What did the Australian representative offer? The Imperial Government asked for bread and the Prime Minister offered a stone; all the preference he could offer was to raise the Tariff of Australia against the foreigner, and to maintain the present Tariff as against the mother country. That was not preference; it was simply another method of taking the bread out of the mouths of the British working men. In order to show what the opinion of the British working men and the Labour Party in the old country is on this matter, I shall take the liberty to quote from a report which appeared in the Melbourne Argus of the 2nd -of this month as follows :Twentv-two Labour members of the House of Common's, belonging to the trade union group, have issued a manifesto headed "" The Colonial Conference and Preferential Trade."" In this document the declaration is made that it is time the British working man protested against the absurdities of the contentions of some of the colonial Premiers. This shows exactly tbe feeling of the British working man, whatever may be the feeling of the working man in Australia. Although New Zealand's white population only ister himself has told us that he was re-equalled that of the Birmingham district, and ceived in a magnificent manner. Australia's half of London's, their Premiers ashear how our representatives were bansumed to treat with Great Britain with queted all over the country, and how they .40,000,600, as nation with nation, using threats if we refused their demand. which had made the most advance in national motor-cars, and so forth. importance, being represented by a statesman, old trick which Great Britain has found dissociated herself from these demands.

D . to a would be beyond from 10 to 15 per cent., affecting about a quarter of 1 per cent, of the total British trade. In return for this magnificent result, securing ^ per cent, fewer unemployed, the cost of every necessary article consumed by the British' workman would be inI further regret creased. The manifesto ridicules the Premiers who supported the foolish proposition that a small rise in the price of wheat would not affect the price of bread, and quotes approvingly Professor Marshall's declaration that free-trade was never more essential to Great Britain's prosperity than now. "" Needless to say,"" the manifesto sneeringly remarks, ""one of the chief objects of the PreI t was very easy, indeed, for miers is the welfare of the British workman. Their anxiety is only equalled by that of the tariff-reform ing capitalist at home, who never speaks and never thinks of his share of the plunder."" Those mem were able to see very clearly the object of the Commonwealth Ministry in offering preference to England under such conditions. In testing the disinterestedness of the colonies by a concrete instance, the manifesto refers to Mr Deakin's ingenious proposalHow like the Prime Minister that is ! to raise a common fund for Imperial, but chiefly colonial, purposes, to which Great Britain would subscribe 4^ millions, and the colonies a few hundred thousands. The manifesto states that British workmen do not think they are called upon to contribute to the maintenance of children beyond the sea to this tune, nor are they to be entrapped by those who exploit the Imperial sentiment in the interest of tariff reform at their expense. The Times condemns "" the utterly parochial point of view displayed by this amazing manifesto, its entire failure to realize the stand-point of the working classes in other parts of the Empire, and the cheap sneers against the bona fides of the colonies and the spokesmen Premiers."" It would probably be realized that the signatories of the manifesto represented a very small fraction of their countrymen. That, of course, has been the attitude of the English people throughout in reference to the Conference. The Prime MinWe Yet Canada, were carried about in royal carriages and But that is an New very useful in connection with the Indian Many times when in EnglandI have seen examples of the Even with a liberal estimate of the get round men they wish to conciliate.

If it were not for the Naval Agreement we should have fewer British warships in our waters. The first object I am of the British authorities is to make the North Sea safe, and to thoroughly fortif y the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland.

Care should be taken to see that we get only the proper class of immigrants. All immigrants should have to pass through some office abroad where their desirability could be tested. risk of importing undesirable immigrants.' One of the conditions which should be enforced is the passing of a medical examination. Minister of Health. America has such a Minister, and employs in every part of the world medical officers whose duty it is to examine and report on intending emigrants to America. Those upon whom they report unfavorably are refused admission to that country. The whole subject, it seems to me, should be dealt with in connection with the establishment of Federal quarantine. That, I am sorry to say, has again been placed last but one in the list of measures for the coming session. I do not see what strong relation there is between the appointment of a High Commissioner and the proper control of immigration. my opinion, the control of immigration is largely a matter for health authorities, and I hope we shall soon hear that a Minister of Health has been appointed. At the same time, I think that the sooner we appoint a High Commissioner the better. Whoever fills that office should not be merely a comreads :mercial agent. We should be represented in the motherland by men who will reflect credit upon' the Commonwealth. Other countries have their ambassadors, and we should choose a man who is eminently suited to fill the office of High Commissioner.

One matter to which I take exception in connection with the adminisThe Commonwealth should have a tration of the Government during the recess has reference to the repatriation of certain Australians who were stranded in South Africa. I am given to understand that a great many of the unfortunates who have reached our shores are not Australians at all. I think that some inquiry should be instituted as to why these men were allowed to come here under the auspices of the Government, and to have their passages paid. Further, I fear that many of the returned Australians are not exactly what we might call "" desirable"" immigrants. However, I have no fault to find with the Government upon that score, In because the mere fact of a man being an Australian was quite sufficient to arouse popular sympathy, and even if a few undesirables were introduced, the vast majority will undoubtedly prove an acquisition to the country. Paragraph 17 of the Governor General's Speech Effect has been given to many of the recommendations of the Papua Royal Commission, and others are receiving consideration. I feel, as a humble member of this Parliament, although I do not see why I should call myself a humble member in view of the fact that I represent some 20,000 elechonorable members sufficiently into their confidence.

But upon its return to Port Moresby the administration was subjected to all sorts of unfavorable criticism. Judge Murray appeared to entertain to the Administrator were that he was a friend of the natives, that to a, certain extent he was opposed to the introduction of a large mining population, that he was entirely opposed to Australian sentiment, and objected to the colonization of the country by the white man. In reply, the Administrator has declared that he is not opposed to the population of the country by colonists, that he is in favour of extending its agricultural capabilities, but that he does not favour the introduction of a mining population because experience has taught him that it is not the most desirable form of population to encourage in such a country as Papua. is the honourable member quoting? ments upon the report of the Royal Commission. not a member of that Commission. said that he gave evidence before it.

119,Mr Liddell,"The Commission recontinue to be theirs, but if the Government act upon the recommendation of the Commission that land will be taken from them, irrespective of whether or not they are will-, ing to part with it. I believe that the Administrator of this Territory has not received justice. When we reflect that he superseded a man who naturally expected to be appointed to that office himself, we cannot wonder that Captain Barton found it very difficult to work with him. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2 p.m. ment for luncheon, I was endeavouring to show that Captain Barton had not received justice at the hands of the present Administration. It is generally understood that Captain Barton has practically been retired from his position as Administrator of Papua, and I shall endeavour to substantiate all that I have said in regard to his treatment. I propose now to quote from the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the present conditions, including the methods of government of Papua, and the best means for their improvement. after carefully inquiring into the subject, they had come to the conclusion that they could not recommend Captain Barton's permanent retention in his present office. Thev further reported that it was not until their return to Port Moresby in November last that they were for the first time met with the long array of charges and recriminations, which will ton, although no one usually attaches any be fgund in the evidence. This goes to prove my statement that it was such circumstances. Mr Murray said, furnot until the Commission returned to Port ther, that when he called the attention of Moresby, a hot-bed of disloyalty to the Adthe Administrator to the delay in dealing ministrator, on the part of public servants with a certain applicationappointed to assist him, that any evidence was found against him. Since the Minister ness of the Lands Department. I had not been of Trade and Customs appeared to have here some doubts as to the identity of the Mr to Resident Magistrates. Whether it is due to Murray to whom I referred, I must explain the Lands Department or the Resident Magisthat the gentleman in question is Mr John trates, my contention is that the Administration Hubert Plunkett Murray, who, in reply to is to blame. an inquiry by the Commission, stated that He endeavoured to place the whole blame he was the Chief Judicial Officer of the upon the shoulders of the Administrator.

For example, in dealing with Captain Barton's policy, he stated thatIn regard to the natives, after twenty or twenty-five years of settlement, a harmless old market gardener, Weaver, is killed within ten miles of Port Moresby, and the object of the murderers who killed him, and who had lived,' some of them, within rifle shot of Government House, was partly to have the right to paint the posts of their houses red, and to wear feathers in their heads. Now comes the argument: If that is the result of twenty years of the present policy, I think another policy should be adopted. Is it not a fact that even in this settled community we hear from time to time of most heinous crimes being committed; of innocent men being murdered while at work in their offices? And yet because one man happened to be killed by untutored savages in Papua, Mr Murray considered that there was evidence that anThe Commission reported that, other policy should be adopted. should have taken careful notes of private conversations with a view to attacking the Administrator. to the fact that he took notes ot certain after-dinner remarks made by Captain Barserious importance to observations made in He said that the delay was due to the slowlong at the time, but my subsequent experience showed me that the delay is generally due The Commission asked Mr Have you any specific cases coming under notice of his want of sympathy for the white settlers? 1",32,William Lyne I N Respect To The Action Of The Administrator Was Per

He said he would do without the revenue, as if they had no miners they would not have the trouble and expense of administering the Northern Division.

To this he replied:I think it is both. settlement is due largely to his sympathy for the natives. So far as I have been able to ascertain that is the keynote of the whole position. Mr Murray continuedI t is largely also due to a lack of sympathy with democratic ideas. you to understand that he sits down and says deliberately, "" I will oppose white settlement,"" or that he acts dishonorably, but I think that fear on the one side and sympathy on the other have led him into a position which appears to me impossible. Later on, a question arose as to the shooting of some natives who had committed depredations on a far-out white settlement. Mr Murray said, in his evidenceI do not say for a moment that the shooting profess great anxiety to encourage rifle of these natives was not justified, as I do not know the facts. a great number are shot, and the two men who applied again and again without success shoot nearly all of them are the two particular for the transfer of a rifle range in my elecfriends of His Excellency.

In fact, I believe that the future prosperity of this country and the salvation of the natives depend upon agricultural development. The only obstacle which has stood in the way of inducing such settlement has been the unsettled condition regarding the land policy. If the statements in the letters which have submitted to the Commissioners on this Mr Murray had the conduct of the Chief Government Surveyor, Mr Richmond, and his relations with Mr Matthews. case cited to bolster up the charge of delay in dealing with applications for land related to a lease sought by a Mr Graham. His opposition to white He said:Mr Murray cites the case of G. Graham as an instance of culpable delay on the part of a Resident Magistrate. I have not the papers before me, but as far as my recollection goes, it was an unusual case, being complicated by (1) a change of officers:I do not wish to give At this time, the officers were frequently being changed(2) an Acting Resident Magistrate being in charge of the Division who had many other duties to attend to; and (3) the attitude of the native owners. In any case the lease applied for was that of a small paddock for grazing a horse, and I believe the applicant was allowed to be in possession of the land notwithstanding any delay which occurred on the part of the Government. Such delays are not confined to Papua. As a matter of fact, although the Government I am only pointing out that shooting, during the last four years I have torate from the State to the Commonwealth. in Parliament.""

That was a very grave charge to make against a public Administrator. Captain Barton's reply to this allegation was:I take it that the Commissioners will not accept that statement as far as it applies to me without proof, and I challenge His Honour to show that there is as much as a vestige of truth in it. When such a charge is made it should not be difficult to substantiate. I shall conclude my quotations from this report by reading an extract from the evidence of the Administrator in which he vindicates his conduct. He says:ray's evidence that I became convinced of his disloyalty. loyal from the very first. had doubts sometimes, but I have always succeeded in brushing them aside. Instead of doing his best to help my administration, it is evident to me now that he has seized opportunities to weaken it. why he should have taken a dislike to me. I have not, as far as I know, given him cause. Judging from his social attitude, I have had every reason to suppose that his disposition towards me was friendly. failed to accept my hospitality, and I have talked to him and before h'im without reserve, and with the result that I now find that he has been carefully noting things I have said in friendly, unguarded conversation, with a view of using them to my disadvantage. ray has betrayed my confidence, and in the face of this he has the effrontery to say that I am not a fair-minded man. troduce more personal reflections into this matter than I can with justice to myself avoid, but one instance goes to show that Mr Murray has deceived was passed in Executive Moresby, a liquor licence-fee of £25 was approved. which then took place relating to possible amendments being moved by the non-official members to the several Bills, and as to how long it would probably take to put the Bills through. be any amendment proposed to the Liquor Bill, and Mr Murray replied that he did not think it likely, unless Mr Whitten, who holds several licences, tried to get the licence-fee reduced.

When the Bill came before the Council at Samarai, Mr Whitten proposed that it should be reduced to £15. without demm, supported the amendment, and it was carried. action in this case was due either to his inclination to hamper the Administration, to gain popularity public. Mr Liddell. veals, in my opinion, a personal bias against me, and against Mr Ballantine. He has mixed up truth and fabrication with ingeniouscare, but I urge that, where spite and betrayal are two such notable features of the evidence throughout, the evidence, in my opinion, cannct be considered to carry weight. The only thing which lends importance to the evidence is that it was given by the Chief Judicial Officer. Had it been given by any other peTson, I should not have troubled to answer it. That is all. The evidence referred to no man would expect from the lips of one who had been trained in the study and practice of the law. Had the evidence been given by any other person I should not have troubled to draw attention to it. I suppose that no good can. be done now, because the officer in question has practically left the service, on the usual terms, I suppose, of six months' leave of absence.

129,Mr Mur,"honoured custom of an Address-in-Reply,we possess to be curtailed. I give the Prime Minister every praise for the way in which he endeavoured to make the resources of Australia known, and I am pleased also to think that the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to have impressed on the people of the old country that Australia is a power in the Empire, and that he would not play a secondary part, but claimed an equal footing with all the other representatives invited to the Conference. that in regard to the Navigation Conference also a good understanding was arrived at. If that means that the Imperial Government now recognises that we have the right to deal with out own coastal trade in what manner we think best I ami satisfied that the Minister of Trade and Customs has done good work. That honourable gentleman talks about providing regulations to deal with oversea shipping which engages in our coastal trade. But I contend now as I have contended before, that this matter will never be effectively dealt with until we follow the splendid example of America, in seeing that not a single passenger or pound of cargo is carried from one Australian port to another except in Australian ships. I am delighted to see the Treasurer in his place, because I have something to say of importance, not only to the House, but to him. According to the Governor General's Speech it is recognised that there is urgent necessity for an amendment of our Electoral Act, and I am sure every honourable member will agree as to the correctness of that view. I was rather astonished two days after the last Commonwealth elections to find the Acting Minister of Home Affairs congratulating the Chief Electoral Officers of the Commonwealth on the efficiency they had displayed in the organization and conduct of the huge electoral machine. Tefurned. anv cause of complaint? of electoral machine did not have to operate in my case, and I hope it never will. If the electoral machine had been operated honestly as it ought to have been, I am quite sure that I should have had at least one other Labour colleague in this Parliament ; but I am in hopes now that his place will be satisfactorily filled. If we are to have an amending Electoral B ill , I trust the Government will make all in -, quiry that is possible as regards the defects in existing legislation, and see that these defects are remedied. I hope the Government will go further and ascertain whether some of the blunders which were made were not criminal; because, so far as my experience goes, I am quite prepared to say that some were criminal. In the case of the vacancy which has been declared by Mr Justice Barton, I am quite satisfied, after my experience in connection with the election, I find that something radically wrong, if not criminal, occurred; and the case ought to be inquired into. I acted as scrutineer in the recount, and dealt with all the votes in my own district; and in not one single instance did the recount tally with the first count. There were differences of twenty-one votes, nineteen votes, eight votes, and so on, and there was the enormous discrepancy in Hindmarsh at one polling-booth of ninety-six votes. toria lost thousands of votes in the case of the Labour senators. fied that thousands of votes were lost in South Australia through the same blunder. The chief blunder was actually a blunder, but, at the same time, we must take care to provide that no such blunder is possible in the future. I have before me the results of the first and second counts at the Senate elections in South Australia, and, as I have already indicated, I find that the differences were very considerable. In the Angas district, in not one single instance did the second count tally with the first, and the sarhe condition of affairs prevailed in nearly all the other districts. In Hindmarsh, the difference represented ninety-six votes lost by Senator Crosbie and 101 votes gained by Mr Playford, and other differences were thirteen, eight, and fourteen. The South Australian electoral system is so simple that I am glad to I have no cause say we have never had a protest in regard complaint personally, because the to the conduct of elections. a recount in South Australia how can the honourable member say that ? had a recount in the Federal elections in South Australia.

I am not permitted to say anything to the Public Service Commissioner as to the unrest in the Service, but he must know full well that dissatisfaction exists when a man arrested for theft is promoted over the heads of honest officers. Reference has been made during the debate to the Northern Territory, and, whilst I do not propose to discuss in detail the agreement for its transfer to the Commonwealth, since it will be submitted to us later on, I feel it necessary to deal with some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Government. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was very mucihconcerned because of a statement in one of a series of excellent articles in the Age dealing with the Northern Territory. I think that the writer of those articles takes too pessimistic a view of the position in regard to the locked-up lands. It is true that .86,295 square miles have been leased for a period of forty-two years, but I would remind honourable members that tihe area of the Territory is 526,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. It will thus be seen that a comparatively small part of the Territory has yet been leased. I admit that the land so held at present includes some of the best to be found there; but when honourable members say that tihe whole of it has been locked up for forty-two years, they, like the writer of the articles to which I have referred, are labouring under a misapprehension. The position is that, on notice being given and compensation paid, agricultural lands may be resumed at any time after the expiration of ten years from the date of the issue of the lease. We are not going within a year or two to settle hundreds of thousands of people in the Territory, and I would draw attention to the fact that four or five years hence much of the land that has been leased by the 'Government of South Australia can be resumed. The position, therefore, is not nearly so bad as it would appear at first sight. If the lands locked up are really suitable, as I believe they are, for closer settlement-for the growth of tropical products-the y are of value, and in the event of their not being used, it would be only right to impose a reasonable amount of taxation in respect of their unimproved value. If that course were adopted, the bulk of the land would soon fall back into the hands of the Government. I have no desire to prolong the debate, but wish to refer briefly to the necessity of appointing a High Commissioner. In view of what has been said as to some of the Commonwealth delegates at the recent Conferences in London, I sincerely trust that the Prime Minister was misrepresented in regard to his utterances with respect to the Labour Party. It has been mentioned, both in the House and out of it, that the Treasurer is likely to be appointed as High Commissioner of the Commonwealth. I hope, however, that no appointment will be made until the Government have submitted to Parliament the name of the gentleman whom they propose to nominate. I am anxious to see, not only that the Labour Party is not misrepresented by the High Commissioner, but that such an appointment will be made as will insure fair treatment to every section in the Parliament. If a selection were made from some whose fitness for the office has been suggested, we should not secure that fair play to which we are entitled.

As a member Of the dominant party-the party uppermost, both in regard to its numbers and its positionI feel that it will be our duty to consider how long we shall support the smaller party unless it is prepared to take action towards the establishment of a Federal system of pensions. If the Government are in earnest in their oftrepeated expressions of approval of certain principles included in the programme of the Labour Party, they must give us some proof. Mr LI DD E LL -The Labour Party can obtain only that which they can squeeze out of the Government. that we have been unable to squeeze much out of them. The Opposition have said that, although there is not much of a socialistic character in the proposals of the Ministry itself, the Labour Party can secure its support for any socialistic measure. No one has been able, however, to point to one socialistic measure introduced by a Labour member and carried with the assistance of the Government. who by private members will find, on placing their notices of motion on the business paper, that they are lamentably mistaken'. It is high time the Government took a stand, and gave a tangible expression of 0 their sympathy, not only with the aged poor, but with the sick poor. We all know how funds devoted to charity are wasted. On an average the object of charity receives J £ I , while the distribution costs about £ 5 ; at any rate, that is how the system worked out in connection with the Victorian Humane Society. That being so, charity organisations should be relieved of a great deal of the work they now perform, and some relief should also be afforded to those generous-hearted citizens who do not make f u l l inquiry into the charities to which they contribute. For those reasons I am prepared to go as far as possible towards compelling the Government to carry out what every section of the House is in favour of, namely, a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. I desire to say one word in regard to the Federal Capital site. I have no preference, or, rather, I had no preference, for one site over another in New South Wales when I entered this Parliament. But having, viewed the several sites, I believe I honliament but to New, South Wales, when I voted in favour of Dalgety. I did not cast that vote because I considered Dalgety to be the best site, but the site I preferred having been rejected, I regarded the territory now favoured by me as the second best. On looking into the matter I find that Dalgety, which has been accepted by this Parliament, was the verysite offered by Mr Carruthers, the Premier of New South Wales. It is the duty of honourable members opposite, and also of members on this side, who are now opposed to Dalgety, to tell us what we have not been told up to the present, namely, what has led them to change their opinions on this question. The site of Dalgety, it I am sorry to sayappears, was offered by Mr Carruthers some time ago, when the matter was under discussion. able member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Lang, when the question was put to them, failed to explain which site the Premier of New South Wales now desires to have chosen. It is of no Those use appealing to me on this question, unthink that much can be done less I am told something definite.

The people of New South Wales would reap the greatest benefit from the trade which would result, and, at the same time, the revenue derived would be sufficient to cover the cost of government. I do not desire to prolong the debate, because I shall have an opportunity later tr> deal with the other subjects mentioned in His Excellency's Speech. I trust that very soon we shall be actively engaged in a work which is of the greatest importance to Australia, namely, the reform of the Federal Tariff. 'Honourable members, who have already spoken, have set a good example in making their remarks brief; and that example I intend to follow, because I have no desire to unduly trespass on the valuable time of the House. In the first place, if I am not considered too presumptuous, or as lecturing honourable members, I should like to say that, in my opinion, we have arrived at a critical period in our Federal history. Seven years have not passed since Federation was inaugurated, and, unfortunately-whethe r justifiably or not I am not arguinga feeling of grave dissatisfaction has spread over more than one State. In fact, it is freely declared that if the question were again put to the people of New South Wales and other States at the present time, there would H o w will the revenue be be an overwhelming majority against Federation. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of it. not agree with that view. If such a feeling exists it is our duty to recognise it, and, acting in sympathy with the States, to endeavour to observe in every particular the spirit of what we area Federation. We have also to recognise that the last general election was fought, not on the Tariff, but on the question of Socialism v. anti-Socialism. It appears, however, that the Tariff is in the way of other business; and, therefore, I for one should be exceedingly glad to see the Government introduce their Tariff proposals with all expedition. I hope the House will take a reasonable view, and assist in getting the Tariff out of the way as quickly as possible so that other measures may be proceeded with. If that course he followed, it is possible that there may be then found in the House a party strong enough to form a Government with sufficient legitimate followers-and by that I mean followers who do not lend their support from any ulterior motives expect from the honourable member. found a Government with sufficient f o l lowers of its own to pass the measures which they introduce, and that those f o l lowers will be in close touch, and see eye to eye with the Administration. If we should succeed in bringing about that desirable state of affairs we shall be able to freely congratulate ourselves on re-establishing, or perhaps, establishing for the first time in our Federal history what is known as responsible government. That should be our object, and the sooner it is attained the sooner Australia will be satisfied with its Federal Government, and will confidently look for pood legislative work. When the Tariff is introduced, as I hope it may be soon, I intend to take a free hand, and treat each proposal on what I consider its merits-to vote for an increase or decrease of duty, as either course may commend itself to my judgment.",44,Margaret Elvire Forrest

This paragraph refers to our present abounding prosperity. If we are prosperous, and that fact is due to remarkable expansion in local production and in the export trade, I cannot see how the Ministry can expect any great increases in the present Tariff. owing to the necessities of our peculiar circumstances in Australia, the Tariff should first and foremost be one that will produce the revenue required to carry on the work of the Commonwealth. Why not direct taxation? sire to avoid direct taxation that I am so firm on the point that we should obtain all ithe revenue we need from the Customs.

I do not agree with the policy which he advocated for the establishment of preferential trade, or in many other matters; but he bore himself so well as our representative, and gave us such a splendid advertisement, that we owe him our thanks. Undoubtedly he was playing a part which fitted him like a glove; but he played it so well, taking such full advantage of the opportunities presented to him, that he did admirable service. Owing to his eloquence, courtesy, and firmness, his visit bas done much to restore the good relations which existed bewith the matter than that embodied in the tween Australia and the mother country prior to Federation. I am glad that the proposal to make the Conference an executive body was not pushed. In view of the cordial relations between Australia, the mother country, and other parts of the Empire, we should let things develop gradually and naturally. In this way alone can we strengthen the ties that bind us together. have to face the serious problem of how The Tariff having been dealt with, I hope that whatever Government may be in power will do its best to deal with the subjects which the people thought would be speedily settled as the outcome of Federation. At the present time the country is extremely prosperous, statistics showing that our proinjuring their constitutions. However, duction now is greater per head of population than that of any other country. This prosperity is noc due to our legislation, but to the beneficent seasons which we have had, and the consequent bountiful harvests. Still, we should do our best to encourage the immigration of the right class of people, to further develop our territory, and to increase our production. But I do not think that the Commonwealth should be in too great a hurry to undertake large developmental or experimental works. I represent the smallest State of the Union, and I say that the interests of the smaller States should be studied when proposed Commonwealth expenditure is being considered. It is true that the Tasmanian finances show a surplus of £70,000 this year; but that is a small amount compared with the Victorian surplus of £800,000 and the New South Wales surplus, which exceeds £1,000,000. The surpluses of the other States have come about more naturally than that of Tasmania, which has practically been wrung from the people. Our direct taxation is so heavy that our people cannot bear very much more. Therefore, the Commonwealth should not enter upon works whose expense will be too heavy a burden upon the smaller Mr Atkinson. States. The proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is likely, if agreed upon, to cost us a vast amount of money. I admit that in its present undeveloped and undefended state the position of the Northern Territory is calculated to give the Minister of Defence great anxiety. Buti f the Territory were transferred from South Australia to the Commonwealth, would its development proceed at a faster rate? If only the question of defence has to be considered, some more satisfactory method of dealing proposed agreement should be found. I admit that South Australia has had a heavy task, and has done good service in holding and administering the Northern Territory. But the terms of the proposed transfer are unjust to the smaller States, and I hope that better terms will be agreed upon. The Territory having been taken over, we shall best to develop it. There is great difference of opinion as to whether white men can work in the tropics without ruining their health. In my opinion, the balance of evidence shows that they are not able to perform work continuously there without when the matter comes before us, I hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be made, whereby South Australia will be relieved of her burden, and the position of the Territory improved without unfairness to the remaining States. The mismanagement of the recent mail contract reflects discredit on Ministers, since it shows that they have not displayed the business capacity to be expected from men in their position. From what I read in the newspapers, the Minister of Trade and Customs would have liked to terminate the contract some time ago. That should have been done, and new tenders called for as soon as the Government found that the syndicate was playing a game with them. In paragraph 8 of the Governor General's Speech it is stated thatA progressive scheme for the improvement of harbour and coastal defences is under consideration ; our fixed defences are receiving special attention; the number of members of our M i l i tary Forces proceeding abroad for instruction and training has been increased; provision for a further increase of Na\al and Military Cadets will be made; the progress of the Rifle Clubs is still satisfactory; the local production of the munitions of war will be provided for. To deal with the last-mentioned matter first, I should like to know what procedure the Government intend to adopt before expressing any opinion on the proposal to produce munitions of war locally. As to the progressive scheme of harbour and coastal defences referred to, I doubt whether the provision of a small torpedo fleet will be sufficient. It might be a good thing to provide such a fleet as an auxiliary to the Imperial squadron. That was suggested by the Government last session. The consideration of this matter opens up tlie question of the Naval Agreement, and of the establishment of an Australian Navy. 1 am sorry that we have not the benefit of the real opinion of the Ministry in regard to the suggested termination of the Naval Agreement. ence was sitting in London, a cablegram was published in the Australian papers to the effect that the Prime Minister had practically given notice of his intention to terminate that agreement. formation with the greatest surprise-in deed, it came as a shock to me-becaus e it is not many years since the honourable and learned gentleman did all that he could to induce Australia to enter into the agreement. Only last session he spoke most eloquently in favour of it , and consequently I was very much astonished to learn that he had notified the people of England that Australia would rather spend upon local defences the paltry sum which it now contributes towards the maintenance of the I m perial Squadron in these waters. If a referendum were to be taken to-morrow, I am satisfied that the Prime Minister would not find his view supported by the people of Australia. Popular feeling is decidedly in favour of the continuance of the present agreement. that it forms a splendid link between the Commonwealth and the motherland, and affords us a far better protection than we could hope for from anything in the shape of an Australian Navy. Sir member would not object to our employing fers to the payment of income tax by submarines and torpedo destroyers on our Federal officers. I do not pretend to coast ? that there may be something beneficial in Federal officers shall pay State income the proposal of the Ministry to build small tax. torpedo boats and vessels for our coastal who has the good luck to hold a Federal defence as an auxiliary to the squadron position should be above the law in this already in our waters.

I cannot see how we can insure that supremacy unless we keep up an extensive Navya Navy that shall at least be equal to the combined navies of any other two powers. If we do that, we can protect our trade routes and insure the safe passage of our great ocean carriers. If Australia wishes to do more in the way of naval defence, let her increase the subsidy which is at present payable under the Naval Agreement.
