12,Mr Finlayson Asked The Minister,"Department of information is available. Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon noticeIs any deferred pay still outstanding in connection with non-commissioned officers in the New South Wales Military Forces? If so; when will the overdue payments be made? honourable member's question isThe Regulations do not provide for the payment of deferred pay to members of the Permanent Military Forces, consequently no such payments can be due or overdue. Probably what is referred to is the practice which was in force in the Instructional Staff extend Australian trade and interests as far as in New South Wales prior to Federation; when, in consequence of slow promotion and advancement, a system of deferred pay, payable at the end of each year, was instituted at the rate of 6d. per diem after ten years' service, and a further 6d. per diem after fifteen years' service. representing the Minister of Defence, upon Such payments were only made as "" bonuses"" on favorable recommendation for zeal, energy, and good conduct. It was not only possible, but more than probable, that .1 man would remain for ten or more years upon the same rate of salary, which might be the lowest. No further addition as deferred pay or bonus was made for any other period of service. Shortly after the Defence Department was taken over by the Commonwealth the pay and allowances of members of the Permanent Forces were consolidated, and all who were at the time entitled to same had the deferred pay added to the total of their approved rate, such amount payable under the regulations being drawn until the individual was entitled to higher pay by promotion or by higher rank. Representations have from time to time been made for the reinstitution of this deferred pay or bonus system, but such has not been approved. The question of rates of pay for the instructional staff, warrant and non-commissioned officers, throughout the Commonwealth has recently been under consideration, and provision has been made for certain increases in the rates for different ranks, to come into force as from the ist July last, as soon as the Estimates are passed. asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice1. Whether the attention of the Minister has been drawn to a paragraph that appeared in the Argus of the 29th November last, to the following effect :"" The German mail steamer Coblenz, which has arrived from Yokohama vid the ports, brings news of the commercial activity of the Japanese in the Caroline Islands and German New Guinea. Trading stations have sprung up in the Carolines. . . .

Has the Department reliable information showing the extent to which Japanese trade and settlement are developing in the Caroline Islands, German New Guinea, and New Caledonia? 3. If the Department has not such information, will the Minister take steps to obtain it? 4. Does the Minister consider that the extension of Japanese trade and settlement in the islands of the Pacific and North Pacific is conducive to the safety and well-being of Australia? honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. See above. 4. It is considered that it is advisable to possible in the islands of the Pacific, but it is not thought desirable to express an opinion on the actions of foreign countries in this regard. noticeWhat is the present rule or practice with reference to the free conveyance of cadets from their homes to rifle ranges, and will arrangements be made to reduce the distance within which they are required to walk or pay their own fares or travelling expenses? honourable member's questions areThe firing of a musketry course is one of the statutory obligations of a senior cadet in the third and fourth years of his service. Transport is provided for cadets who have to travel distances exceeding five miles to the range. For distances of five miles and less they are required to make their own way. Any cases of special hardship being dealt with on their merits as they arise. . Owing to the magnitude of the expense involved for transport, if all cadets were franked to the respective ranges, it is considered inadvisable to make any amendment at present in the practice which now obtains. representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice1. Whether the attention of the Minister has been directed to an article in The Christian Commonwealth^ published in London under date 4th September, 1912, headed ""Conscription in Australia,"" where it is stated that Major-General Bridges has recently returned from France and Germany, where he was sent to study the military systems prevailing in these strongholds of conscription, and has said"" We boast of our civil liberty, but if the present trend of affairs is not soon checked we shall find that we have little or nothing to boast of.

[10.40] -This Bill is the culminating stage of a series of Bills trending in one direction, and that direction, as honourable members on this side have frequently pointed out, is tlie ultimate goal of the Labour party, namely, the nationalization of all industries, as I propose to show a little later. I would remind honourable members that monopolies, in their basic element, always have some special privilege upon which to rest, and, in almost all cases, these privileges rest upon either a prerogative of the Crown or some Act of Parliament. Most of the monopolies which have been specially referred to here are monopolies which have grown up as the result of our own legislation, and we can deal with them without nationalization at all by retracing the various steps which we have taken to establish special privileges on behalf of certain sections of the people, whereby they can exploit the rest of the community for their own pecuniary advantage, and, very often, to the detriment of the whole of tiie community. The first monopolies of which we have any knowledge, so far as British experience is concerned, date back, I think, to the time of Edward III . The first case was tried in 1602, when the question of monopolies was determined by a Court of law. Originally, all monopolies were vested as a prerogative of the Crown, and were really in the gift of the Government, but it this prerogative of the Crown, exercised by the King, came into general use. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it had become so extensively exercised by that Sovereign as to constitute very grave abuses, which ultimately were brought before the notice of Parliament, and led to many very strong complaints and protests, and ultimately a prohibitive proclamation. Hume and other historians relate accounts of many heated, debates in Parliament from the years 1565 to 1601. At the time of JamesI . , when monopolies had grown to very noticeable and detrimental dimensions, the House of Commons appointed Sir Edward Coke as chairman of a Committee of Grievances, the object of which was to inquire into, regulate, control, and suppress, injurious monopolies; and the result was that prohibitions followed, and. for a long time monopolies were kept in check. In 1623, a Statute of Monopolies was passed making all monopolies illegal, except such as might be granted by Parliament, or were in the interests of new manufactures or inventions. This Act was strictly enforced, and eventually by its aid the evil system of monopolies was pretty nearly abolished; at any rate, the evil was greatly abated, and a normal condition of things was practically reached by strict administration. This law has really formed the principle ever since on which patents, trade marks, and similar enactments, both British and otherwise, have been based. It still remains in existence, although it is frequently abused; but I think that if we have to follow, in Commonwealth legislation, on similar lines, we shall find that we have plenty of power to effectively deal with monopolies without inviting the creation of a still greater monopolya parliamentary or national monopoly-by means of the proposals embodied in the Bill. The whole principle tends in the direction of surreptitiously altering entirely the Federal character of the Constitution, without making it apparent that the intention is to set up a unified form of government. That was pointedly referred to by Mr Beeby, in resigning his post in the New South Wales Ministry. So strongly does he feel that this is the main intent and purpose of the",16,Pacific Conveyanc E Of Cadets To Rifle Ranges Brigadier General Bridges

23,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang),"Federal Labour Government, and so strongly opposed is he to that system, that he has gone to the length of resigning his seat in the Legislative Assembly rather than submit to be coerced by the Labour Conference into supporting their referenda proposals. In his manifesto to the electors, he saysThe Australian Constitution was framed purely for a Federal as against a unified form of government. If Unification had been the objective, the whole scheme would have been different. The record of the Conventions shows that the delegates began, continued, and completed their labours with one purpose-that of maintaining f u l l State autonomy after vesting in a Federal Parliament control of specified questions of national importance which could not be effectively dealt with by the existing State Governments. To-day we are asked to completely, depart from the Federal conception without refraining the Constitution. All I ask is that the issue be honestly dealt with, and that the supporters of the amendments will make it clear that they are asking for the powers of a unified Government, but have not courage to ask for those changes in the Constitution which must precede Unification. This states the position as I view it, and I think that anybody who has examined this proposal, and read it, in conjunction with the preceding proposals, can form no other conclusion than that the sole aim and object of this series of measures is to invade the State authority in matters where State control should be supreme, and to set up a unitary authority in the Federal Government over areas and subjects which it was never contemplated should be included in the Constitution when the question of Federation was being considered. I think it would be, as Mr The honourable member himself, in the Beeby says, very much more honest for Certain sections of this Parliament to go to the people and say that they find that the Federal scope of the Constitution does not enable them to do certain things which they desire to do to carry out the real Socialistic objective of the Labour platform. I may point out that when some of these proposals were being discussed in the Labour Conference of 1911, it was a very significant thing tliat Senator Gardiner is reported in the press as having expressed the hope thatMr Holman would not tell the press the fact that the Labour party intended to amend the Constitution in the direction he had urged. It might defeat the referendum proposals if it leaked out. Let them first get in the thin edge of the wedge by the carrying of the referendum proposals. Here is a cat let out of the bag by one of the leading members of the Labour party connected with the Federal Parliament. last Labour Conference Senator Gardiner, according to this newspaper, said that it might defeat the referendum proposals if certain things said at the Conference leaked out. Let them first, he said, get in the thin end of the wedge by carrying the referenda. The only inference to be drawn from this desire for concealment is that they should first carry out the thin end of the wedge and keep concealed from the public the ultimate goal of all these proposals, and once they had got in the thin end they could drive the wedge home, and have their "" whole hog "" Socialism in full swing. There is no doubt that the aim and object of the whole of these proposals is first to help to create monopolies by legislation, and then to declare, by parliamentary vote, to be monopolies all the industries which the Labour party desire to nationalize, and so by one declaration after the other to secure the sole control of industry in its ramifications throughout the trade and commerce of all the States. the honourable member who is making that statement. not the only one who has made it, and I propose to show that the statement is amply justified by making a few quotations from utterances of members of the Labour party. course of an interview with the Queensland Worker, saidI let them know where Jim Page stands all right. I am a Socialist, and I not only believe in Socialism in our time, but in Socialism all the time. go back on that statement, and have not attempted to do so. so; but when the Opposition point out that this proposal for the nationalization of monopolies is intended to cover the whole gamut of Socialism, the honourable member himself, as well as other honourable members opposite, take exception to our statement. I desire to show that we have the authority of their own statements for the opinion we express in this regard. Mr J. C.

36,Mr Roberts,"It seems only yesterdaynot made any such statement. At no time of my life have I advocated land nationalization. Henry George has demonstrated its undesirability. The late Leader of the Labour party in: this House, Mr J. C. Watson, speaking at Redfern, saidIt was time they intervened by nationalizing the shipping industry. Then, again, the honourable member for Herbert, speaking in this House, declared that his party was going in for "" more Socialism, and of a more pronounced type."" During the last session of the Federal Parliament the business-paper fairly bristled with notices of motion, in the names of members of the Labour party, making various proposals for nationalizing industries. These proposals related amongst others to the nationalization of the tobacco industry, the shipping industry, coal mines, the sugar industry, and the iron industry. In addition, as I have pointed out on previous occasions, there are in the platforms of the State Labour parties several planks for the nationalization of industries by the State. Taking the two programmes together we find that the Labour party have in hand all sorts of Socialistic schemes and enterprises. Brisbane Worker, on the front page of which is a cartoon depicting two men rearing aloft the banner of International Socialism, bearing the words "" International Socialism,"" "" Workers of the world unite,"" whilst various figures are shown, representing France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Great Britain, and America, waving their hats before it. that notorious cartoon drawn by the honourable member, and published in a singletax newspaper. never drawn a cartoon for the present single tax paper, The Standard. I do not know precisely to what the honourable member refers. Tihe quotations which I have made from speeches delivered by, various members of the Labour party show, not only the character of the Labour movement, but that the objective underlying these proposals is the whole-hog Socialism of the International Socialist party. Our actual experience of Labour Governments bears out my contention. We have the Federal Government engaging in all sorts of Socialistic enterprises, not a single one of which I believe is paying its way at the present time. Every one shows a loss. speaking of commercial enterprises upon which the Government is entering-suc h works as are usually conducted by private enterprise. We have the Saddlery Factory, the Woollen Mills, the Laundry in the Northern Territory, some cabbage-patches growing here and there, and other things of that nature. In Western Australia, as reported in the Argus of 6th December, the Labour Government has been raising a loan of ,£5,600,000, and the Loan Bill includes items of expenditure for Socialistic enterprises such as saw-mills, . £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 ; steamers, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; workers' homes, ,£150,000; State hotels, , £ 1 9 , 0 0 0; State brick-yards, ,£10,000; and State milk supP'y> ^ 4 J ° ° O . Here we have a further indication of the fact that, not only does this trend manifest itself in connection with Federal legislation, but that we have the Federal and State Labour parties working together for the establishment of State enterprises, and using public money for the purpose, without first having obtained the sanction of the people. We have, in NewI have here a copy of tbe South Wales and Victoria, enterprises of a similar character, such as brickworks, cement works, saw-mills, and coal mines. My own opinion is that, in regard to all these matters, we are going on a wrong track. I do not believe that the evils of restriction, which breed the workers of monopoly, can be cured by greater restriction and the creation of greater monopolies. I have held the opinion, ever since I have studied political economy, that the only cure for monopoly, and for the evils of restriction of trade, is freedom of production, coupled with freedom of exchange. Where everybody is free to engage in production, where everybody is free to engage in exchanging the products created by the application of labour and capital to the forces of nature, there is no foothold for monopoly, which can exist only where artificial barriers are raised, between the people and the things which the people need. It is the creation of these artificial barriers which make practicable the creation of monopolies. They exist only where special privilege exists; and the moment you interfere with the freedom of the people to produce and to exchange the products of their labour, and create artificial barriers between the community and the needs of the community, thereby enabling certain sections to",19,Monopolies Bill Second Reading

41,Mr W. Elliotjohnson,"I ammonopolize production, fix prices, and corner markets, you are laying the foundation of monopolies, and thus bringing about injury to the whole community. The way to cure that injury is not by the creation of larger monopolies, but by sweeping away the foundations upon which monopoly and privilege rest. It is not by nationalization, but by freedom, that we can cure monopoly. I may remind honourable members that the methods proposed for running various concerns by the State are not new. again, in older countries, for centuries past, they have been tried. in every case. cannot recall a single instance of a successful European Socialistic experiment in any country or period. When an effort was made, at the time of the French Revolution of 1848, to control all industry, Lecky points out that it led to a terrible system of tyranny and oppression. The contract system was penalized, wages and hours of labour were arbitrarily regulated, the State formally guaranteed work to all who needed it, national workshops were established to provide work for all, and private enterprise' was everywhere discouraged. What was the result? Universal satisfaction and content ? Nothing of the kind. The result was chaos, discontent, and trouble on every hand. According to LeckyA l l steady industry was arrested or dislocated; and the fact that men holding a leading position in the Government were preaching a complete revolution in the conditions of labour and the rights and distribution of property had very naturally destroyed all credit. the Revolution? . during the period when the French Government was running all these nationalized concerns. Articles of first necessity rapidly rose in price in a city where thousands depended for their subsistence on the sale of articles of luxury and superfluity. Every employer of labour restricted his business within the narrowest limits. majority of Parisian workshops the number of persons employed, was now only a fraction of what it had been before, and according to the most moderate calculation, the loss in Paris alone was not less than 3,000,000 francs-^80,000a day; a loss which fell on the humblest and most industrious. The Congress of workmen at Luxembourg claimed and exercised a despotic power, and, says LeckyThe poison which Louis Blanc and his followers were diffusing was not the less deadly because it was abundantly mixed with sentimentality, and coupled with the loftiest professions of virtue and philanthropy. That is just as we find it to-day. History is repeating itself. The very same kind of sickly sentimentality which used to tickle the ears of the populace in those days, and was indulged in by the popular orators and Over and over demagogues of the day, is indulged in today by those who preach this pernicious They have failed and soul destroying doctrine. How did the In all my reading, I French Socialistic regime end ? It ended in riot and bloodshed, in bayonets and guns, so that in four days 16,000 men were killed in the streets of Paris. That is an experience which I sincerely trust is not likely to folIOAV experiments in the direction of the nationalization of industry in Australia. Fortunately we have a means at our disposal which the French people had not at their command, in that we have so wide a franchise, and that so large a measure of political power rests with the people. But I would commend to honourable members opposite Ruskin's answer to SocialismI t is simply chaosa chaos towards which the believers in modern political economy are fast tending, and from which I am trying to save them. The Socialist, seeing a strong man oppress a weak one, cries out, "" Break the strong man's arms,"" but I sav, "" Teach him to use them to better purpose."" Put it at its worse, that all the poor of the world are but disobedient children, or careless cripples, and that all the rich people are wise and strong, and you w ill see at once that neither is the Socialist right in desiring to make everybody poor, powerless, and foolish, as he is himself, nor the rich man right in leaving the children in the mire. That is the opinion of a well known writer whose views honourable members opposite are very fond of quoting. I ask them to lay those views to heart. Speaking yesterday the honourable member for Capricornia said that this Bill was mainly directed against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Now, that company's monopoly rests upon legislation which was enacted by ParliaIn the great ment. That legislation has enabled the company to achieve their present position, and to establish the monopoly which they now enjoy.

43,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"It wasbuilt up. Tariff and bounty legislation, the operation of which hasgtended to convert this company's business into a monopoly. Having prepared the road for them, and having buttressed them in every possible way, honourable members opposite now denounce the company as one which is opposed to the best interests of this country. Without saying whether its operations are injurious to Australia or not, there is no doubt that people have to pay much more for their sugar under it, and I do claim that the remedy, if the company be a monopoly, is in our own hands, without resorting to the extreme of nationalization. We have legislated to create this monopoly, and it seems peculiar that we should denounce something of our own creation-somethin g which we have bolstered up by legal enactment. It is in our power to remedy the mistake which we made. where we made that mistake, and by so doing we shall destroy this monopoly. I need hardly remind honourable members that a Royal Commission was recently appointed to inquire into the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that that Commission was largely composed of men who were sympathetically disposed towards the Labour party. Yet even they are not prepared to recommend the nationalization of the industry. course of his speech the honourable member for Capricornia read certain extracts from the report of the Commission dealing with the subject of the monopoly itself. But he was careful not to read the recommendations of the Commission which are opposed to the proposals now put forward, which he says are directed principally against this monopoly. Upon page 46 of their report the Commissioners, in discussing the nationalization of the refining industry, sayThe refineries are the controlling factor in tlie sugar industry. If the refineries were nationalized by the Commonwealth Government, public authorities would fix the prices of refined and raw sugar respectively; and they could also make the payment of the fixed price for rav£ sugar conditional in the case of each mill upon a payment by that mill of a fair price for the cane. Any profits resulting from the control of the industry would find tlieir way to the public purse. Despite these indisputable advantages, we cannot recommend the course suggested. Several reasons in their cumulative aspect convince us that, at any rate for the present, the nationalization of. the refineries would be inexpedient. These reasons may be briefly stated. This Parliament has enacted The Commission then set out their reasons under the following headings :1. The efficiency of the refining industry as it is at present carried on. 2. Costs to the Treasury. * , 3. The speculative character of the refining industry. This portion of the report concludes thusWe believe that the foregoing considerations constitute in their cumulative aspect a convincing reason for seeking some other way of insuring an equitable distribution of the profits of the sugar industry among its various branches. So that after the most careful inquiry, and after an investigation into all the ramifications of the industry, extending over a period of many months, the Commission were not prepared to recommend its nationalization, but suggested that the Government should seek some other means of insuring an equitable distribution of the profits of the industry. Then, in paragraph 24 of their report, the Commission stateLet us hark back to the point The suggestion has been made that, since refiners are in a position to control prices in the sugar industry generally, the Commonwealth might enter into competition with existing concerns with a view to keeping down the price of refined sugar, while raising the price of raw sugar. We cannot recommend the adoption of this suggestion :1. The suggestion is probably due to an exaggeration of refining profits. The profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are largely due to items other than refining. Honourable'members who know anything During the about the industry will recognise that the principal profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are derived from the commercial use which is made of the by-products. It is by turning into a marketable article the various by-products which previously were regarded as waste products that they are able'to secure a larger profit over the whole of the operations of the industry. I quote the following from page 48 of the report of the CommissionI f the Commonwealth Refinery entered into competition with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Commonwealth Refinery would be severely handicapped. It would have great difficulty in obtaining regular supplies of Australian raw sugar, and in getting its refined article regularly on the market. It would be expected to pay high prices for raw sugar, and to accept low prices for refined sugar. It ""would, moreover, come into competition with a longestablished business conducted with a very high degree of efficiency. We have frequently had occasion to criticise the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from various points of view, but we do not hesitate to express our admiration of the economic efficiency which characterizes every branch of its business which has come under our notice. In order to prove really effective for the purposes we have now in view, the Commonwealth Refinery would have to proceed on a laTge scale. This would imply a duplication of refining plants in Australia quite inconsistent with a sound economy of national resources. For the foregoing considerations, as well as for others, we are of opinion that the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Refinery is impracticable. After the most exhaustive examination of the business of the company and of questions of production, labour, cost, profit, and distribution, and, although the majority of the members of the Commission were reputed, if not known, to possess sympathetic leanings towards the Socialistic objective of the Labour party, the evidence convinced them that, notwithstanding the fact that the industry is a monopoly-and , as such, I do not defend it-it is carried out in the most efficient and satisfactory way. In one portion of their report the Commissioners describe it as a beneficent monopoly. The evidence showed that the business was conducted economically on scientific business lines, and the Commissioners are not prepared to recommend that the Commonwealth should enter into competition with it. They point out that, if the Commonwealth did so, it would require inevitably to duplicate plants and works, and it could not expect to make a Commonwealth refinery a profitable undertaking. We have this Royal Commission telling the Government that their main objective in this matter is undesirable. say that they do not recommend it. is concerned. mind the honourable gentleman that yesterday the honourable member for Capricornia told us that the main purpose of this Bill was to suppress this monopoly. He said that the measure was directed mainly against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, if my memory serves me right, claimed that to be its chief purpose. orable member's opinion. honourable member did not say so. He stated most definitely, without qualification, that that was the chief purpose of the Bill. Yet we have the Royal Commission, after thorough inquiry into the affairs of the company, recommending the Government not to proceed on these lines so far as the sugar-refining industry is concerned. member think that that will alter our minds ? Q experience has shown that no amount of evidence or argument, and no appeal to reason, will alter any determination which certain honourable members opposite have arrived at. They come to conclusions with ill-informed minds, irrespective of any evidence which may be tendered, and then, like spoiled stubborn children, persist in their ill-formed conclusions. member arrive at his conclusions when he was in the Labour movement? . on sound lines. It was only when those in the movement departed from those sound lines, and left the path of freedom and justice, that I found myself at the parting of the ways with them. I left them with very much regret, because I am so sympathetically disposed to the democratic point of view and the legitimate aims of Labour. It always causes me a pang of regret to find honourable members opposite departing so widely from the paths of freedom and justice, and espousing principles injurious to the community, because founded on class prejudice, tyranny, and injustice. pang in view of the fact that we have succeeded so well since the honourable member left the movement. fact that many people succeed in doing wrong does not justify wrong-doing. The speeches made by honourable members opposite show that behind this proposal to nationalize monopolies is a much more far-reaching purpose, embracing the nationalization, not merely of monopolies, but, as opportunity arises, of every form of industry now carried on 'by private enterprise, which they may consider it worth their while to nationalize. I do not think the proposed amendment of the Constitution would be in the best interests of the community. We have had sufiicient experience of Socialistic experiments, even in our own time, to know that they can never be made a success, because they leave out of account the one essential element that cannot safely be ignored, the'element of human nature.

55,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Th eregard the Post Office as altogether a Socialistic institution, because it lacks many of the fundamental essentials of Socialism, according to some of the best informed Socialist writers. orable members' interpretation. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Hubert Bland, a Socialist author, in the Fabian Essays, Office and similar institutions are not in their nature Socialistic, because they do not conform to the fundamental tenets of Socialistic principles. I commend those essays to the perusal of honourable members who are so fond of pointing to the Post Office as an evidence of Socialism in our midst. Hubert Bland says that it is not so much what the State does as the purpose for which the State does it , that is the factor determining whether an enterprise is Socialistic or notthat the delivery of letters or telegrams by a State does not necessarily include any of the elements of the Socialistic principle. However, I leave that aside, making a present to honourable members of all the advantage they can get. or think they can get, by instancing the Post Office. and the State railways as evidence of Socialism in actual fact in our time. Socialistic authorities are practically unanimous in saying that such enterprises are not Socialistic, and I say they are not. They are semi-Socialistic: and, so far as they go, particularly the Post Office, they are a byword of reproach. The people point to the administration of the Post Office with scorn, and it is one of the most unsuccessfully managed commercial institutions to be found in any part of the worldmember hand the Post Office over to private enterprise ? but it should be put under commission in the same way that the State railways are. When the State railways were wholly under the political control of the Government of the day, through a Minister, they were hotbeds of corruption, favouritism, ineptitude, and inefficiency; men of no ability were put into the highest positions, and political influence was the controlling factor in most of the appointments. Generally speaking, throughout the States political control, management, and influence led to so many abuses that the Governments were forced to abandon direct conl > 4 i] trol, and place the management in the hands of independent commissioners. And the same thing has had to be done in connection with our Public Service, which, when it was under political control, showed similar evidences of abuse. All this proves that Governments are not the proper authorities to entrust with the management of enterprises in which large bodies of points out that the Post labour are employed ; and it stands to reason that this must always be so while human nature is what it is. cquallv Socialistic with the Post Office? honourable member cannot have been listening. Sccialistic authorities tell us that the Government control of railways, and other' utilities, does not constitute Socialismthat it is not the actual carrying out of State enterprises that constitutes Socialism, but it is the principle on which, and the purpose for which, they are carried out which are the factors determining whether the enterprises are Socialistic or not. We have had many experiments in Socialism opposite in this and other countries, even in our own time. In former years America was the happy hunting ground of Socialistic experiment, and that country, I suppose, is the graveyard of some hundreds of such enterprises. We had the departure from the shores of Australia of a band of some of our most enterprising spirits who were imbued with the principles of Socialism, and who attempted to form a Socialistic colony in Paraguay. We all know how the Royal Tar departed from Sydney with an enthusiastic contingent on board, though it is true that the numbers had been somewhat thinned owing to dissensions which arose while the vessel was delayed in sailing. Little cliques and societies were formed amongst these enterprising colonists, and all the elements of disruption 'were really present before they started; and owing to the play of human nature, which must always assert itself, these developed on board, and many of those who were supposed to be a brotherhood and sisterhood, about to give the world an object-lesson in Socialism, were not even on speaking terms. Nevertheless they persevered with the experiment, but ic was not long before they found the whole thing a failure. Gradually little parties began to d r if t away until only a mere handful were l e f t ; and these divided up what property remained, and started out on those purely individualistic lines to",23,Monopolies Bill Second Reading

60,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Th ewhich we have been accustomed from time immemorial, and which really are the only lines that have proved successful. Then there was another experiment in . northern Queensland by Socialistic regenerators, on the Alice River, near Barcaldine. That seemed to prosper for a little while, but gradually there appeared the same indications of self-interest and of a human desire to excel. The spirit of emulation was there as a necessary part of human nature; and the early promises of the settlement were dispelled by complete disruption. In a paper called The Capricornian, there appeared the following in reference to the Alice River settlementThe men gradually drifted to what, in the dialect of the strike which gave birth to the settlement, was called the old wages slavery. They simply could not stand everything in common. What killed the settlement was not death, nor the hardship of the climate, nor the difficulties of agriculture, but simply Socialism. The system broke down; men could not stand it , and in the end a settlement which started with over 100 men dwindled down to seven. It is interesting to learn that these seven remnants of this socialistic community subsequently formed themselves into a limited liability company on capitalistic lines, and have since flourished exceedingly. All of these Socialistic experiments have failed, notwithstanding the fact that they have been initiated with enthusiasm and engaged in by men imbued with the highest sentiments, and actuated by the strongest desire to reform and ennoble humanity. In every case, the last resort has been the much-despised capitalistic system, which, after all, is the natural system of carrying on all enterprises -The honourable member for Lang could not unnatural, but. often, unfortunately, abused. I admit that there have been causes of grave discontent and complaint owing to the Inanner in which the capitalistic system has been carried out as the result of the greed, rapacity, and unscrupulousness of many employers. I do not defend such men, but I say that the abuse of the power in their hands, and their failure to deal with men as human beings rather than as beasts of burden, has led to the growth of the Socialistic sentiment. This failure on their part dots not"" make Socialism right. I do not think it is right; but the fact that it is wrong does not absolve us of our responsibility to find a remedy for the evils which have sprung up. It is our duty to teach employers, as well as employees, the right thing to do, and we have the means at hand in the shape of Wages Boards and other tribunals which have been brought into existence in order to enable employers and employee's to adjust their differences. I am glad to say that in this country we have growing up now a class of employers who make a close study of this question, and who are anxious to do what is fair and just, emulating the example of some humanitarian employers in Great Britain and on the Continent. Recently, I inspected a large factory owned by one of the much-abused trusts, and I found that the employees were contented, well clothed and preserved, and were working under healthy conditions. Everything possible was done to minister to their comfort and convenience, and also to promote their mental and bodilv development. Such employers would be a credit to any community. I maintain that it is by adherence to the principles of freedom, justice, and equality of opportunity for all, and by recognising cur responsibilities one to the other, that the true solution of our industrial and social problems really lies. To the mutual recognition of our responsibilities one to the other, and the recognition of .the responsibilities of employers to employees so that work may be carried on harmoniously, and ths interests of all may be considered, we must look for the true solution of industrial questions and the establishment of just conditions between employer and employ^, and the good of the community at large. net help, here and there, sounding a note that had a truly Socialistic ring about it. He was harking back to the old faith he once professed, and I cannot altogether blame him for doing so now and again. I would remind the honourable member, who speaks, in a fine large fashion about Socialism and its definitions', that we have for our guidance the definitions given by some of the most able clerics. mistake Christianity for Socialism.

The honourable member also spoke of harmony being brought about between employer and employee by means of Wages Boards and similar tribunals, rather than by the nationalization of industries. But the honourable member seemed to forget that even in such a case the aid of the State would have to be invoked. It would be necessary for the State to create Wages Boards, and for the Federal Parliament to create Arbitration Courts, and thus at one stage or another the help of the State would have to be enlisted in order to overcome difficulties. Further, I would remind the honourable member that, notwithstanding bis meagre definition of Socialism, from which he excludes our postal system, our education system, and our railways, every man in this community is a Socialist-it is only a matter of degree. I believe that the people recognise this fact, and that Socialism does not now wear that alarming aspect in which it once presented itself. The honourable member also remarked that there were a number of matters which might better be left to the State Parliaments. In this respect he emphasized what had already been said by the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Ballarat. All these honourable members seem to be scared at the prospect of the Commonwealth taking over some small businesses. In this matter we can best be guided by the history of the past. The State Parliaments have conferred certain functions on municipal bodies, and they have rarely interfered in the carrying out of these functions : but, on the other hand, they have in many cases broadened the powers and elevated the status of the municipal organizations. If the States have acted in this way in relation to municipalities, may it not be reasonably assumed that the Federal Parliament will act similarly in regard to the States, and that they will not take over duties that can be better carried out by States? We have only touched on the fringe of Government experiment on Socialistic lines. In Germany, the Government make an annual profit of ,£2,000,000 out of their State coal mines. They also carry on the salt industry, and look after the brewing industry. Coming nearer home, I may point out that the Government of Western Australia are even conducting an [241]2 hotel with great success, and are obtaining a considerable revenue from it, although I do not altogether believe in making profits out of such enterprises. I advise honourable members to pay a visit to our Newport workshops, one of the finest institutions south of the line, and conducted by the Victorian Government. Instead of its being an expensive experiment, the manufacture of our rolling-stock has saved several thousands of pounds to the State of Victoria. When our State Government proposed to send cut of the State for engines, the prices quoted by Baldwin, the American manufacturer cf railway engines, and Beyer, Peacock and Company, the British manufacturers of railway engines, ran into thousands of pounds more than the engines could have been manufactured for in our Socialistic workshops at Newport. That is a fact that is practically well known to everybody. So that as regards the talk about our indulging in experiments, and entering into businesses and doing work that is absolutely essential for the carrying on of the State, to say that those experiments have not been a success is to say something that is not in accordance with fact either here or abroad. Members of the Opposition are always alleging that our party is drifting, and that our legislation has a tendency in a certain direction only. Buti f there is one thing that can be said about the Labour party it is this : that they have a programme, they have no hesitation in presenting it to the people, and there is no doubt as to the programme which they do present. Here is the objective of the Labour party(1) The cultivation of an Australian sentiment, based upon the maintenance of racial purity, and the development in Australia of an enlightened and self-reliant community. (a) The securing of the f u l l results of their industry to all producers by the collective ownership of monopolies, and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality. That objective has been before the people of Australia for eight years, and honourable members have only to compare our numbers in this House eight years ago with those of to-day, and they will realize the great increase that has taken place in our numbers, until we now occupy the unique position of being in an absolute majority both here and in another place.

The honourable member for Bendigo delivered a most exaggerated speech. He pictured all kinds of ills that would befall the community if we indulged in the nationalization of monopolies. One point which he and the Leader of. the Opposition made was that, as we had already passed measures dealing with trade and commerce and trusts and combinations, we held sufficient power to deal with these monopolies and regulate them. The honourable member for Bendigo referred to the many ways in which we were going to interfere in small matters. Anybody who has any idea of the operations of the Commonwealth Government will realize this: that municipalities have their well-defined sphere of operations; the States, too, have their well-defined area of operations, and wo are trying now to increase the area, of the operations of the National Parliament. As regards those small matters which municipalities can deal with, there is no intention of interfering with them. To show conclusively that we do not intend to interfere with those matters that are now being carried out hy the StatesI shall read sub-clause 2 of the proposed clause 51 AThis section shall not apply to any industry or business conducted or carried on by the Government of a State or any public authority I might direct constituted under a State. In clear and distinct language, it is proposed not to interfere where the States are carrying on certain industries, such as railways, workshops, and other Socialistic enterprises, because they really cannot be called by any other name, and a municielectricity or by gas, or performing any other public service, will not be interfered with. The Bill in its terms is in consonance with the objective cf our party. The honourable member for Bendigo was also very much affrighted that by the nationalization of industries we would create a. very large Public Service. He enumerated ""the number of persons who were temporarily employed, and said that AVhen the offer made by .the if various industries were also to be conducted by the Government it would mean an undue enlargement of our Public Service. If that is good logic, the honourable member should argue that we ought not to extend our educational system, because, by However, two of them, perhaps building schools in new localities, we must add to the number of our public servants in the shape of teachers, or, again, that we ought not to extend our railways, because the opening of a new railway must mean the extension of our Railway Service.

75,"Mr Fenton""","Yos, it will be forced-services which have been performed by private enterprise must of necessity employ labour in order to carry on those works. And so, should both Houses of this Parliament decide by resolution that an industry is a monopoly, we shall have the right to deal with it in that particular way. Another objection has been taken which I was about to elaborate when I was interrupted, and it is that we have no reason to pass this B ill , because we have already passed a measure asking for power to regulate monopolies. The fisherman will, I think, supply a very good illustration here. If he desires to catch a certain class of fish, the mesh of his net has to be very small. 1 am not going to regard these Bills, five of them at any rate, as nets in which' we shall endeavour to catch those who are carrying 011 nefarious practices in the community; but if the mesh of the trade and commerce net, or the combinations and trusts net, is not sufficiently close to catch all the men we desire to catch, we shall certainly catch some in the nationalizing of monopolies net. The power to nationalize monopolies is absolutely essential if the safety of the community is to be maintained. That is one argument I put forward for passing the Bill as an extra safeguard against the people in this community being dealt with as the people of other communities have been dealt with. The honourable member for Kooyong also had a good deal to say about the taking over of businesses, and he asked what kind of a body was Parliament to fix prices or to say whether a business was a monopoly or not. He must have known f u l l well when he gave utterance to such a sentiment that he was dealing with the question in a very flimsy way.' Is any Government-Labour, or Liberal, or Conservative-likel y to propose the taking over of a business without making f u l l inquiries into the conduct of that business? of harvesters. ber for Kooyong was Minister of Trade and Customs in a Government which practically did fix prices in connection with the harvester industry, and, wriggle as they may, they cannot get away from that fact. Any reasonable body of men will make f u l l inquiries befoie they arrive at such a decision. with as a business proposition. Suppose that we have an idea, or good grounds for believing that a certain industry is a monopoly, and that it is conducted in a manner which is detrimental to the best interests of the public. Full inquiries w ill . be made in regard to the conduct of that business; then, certain recommendations will be submitted, I take it, by an independent body, and as we are about to create an Inter-State Commission I can conceive of no better body to undertake that work. For the sake of argument let me put a proposal before the honourable member for Kooyong. If we had an idea, or good ground for believing that a monopoly was carrying on business in the community, an intimation could be made to the Tnter-State Commission, which could make f u l l investigation and submit a recommendation to Parliament. A recommendation, of course, would be an essential preliminary to any legislation in that regard. Therefore, all these men of straw which are being built up and so nicely knocked over by honourable members opposite, are so much dustthrowing. I am certain that the people feel the effects of the methods of conducting many businesses to-day, j in d that when they have an opportunity of making their position more secure they will have no hesitation in voting for this proposal above all others. It surprises me that members of the Opposition can stand here and defend monopolies. It seems to me a very peculiar stand for them to take, and one of which. I think, the people will not be slow to disapprove. . . The honourable member for Lang has quoted from the report of the Sugar Commission. I do not intend to quote the whole paragraph again, but merely to refer to a few wordsSeveral reasons, in their cumulative aspect,' convince us that, at any rate for the present, the nationalization of the refineries would be inexpedient. It will be seen that the members of the Sugar Commission have not finally made up their minds in regard to the sugar industry, but they say that at present the nationalization of refineries would be inexpedient. I infer from that statement that if the same Commissioners had to inquire into the operations of the. Sugar Monopoly, or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in twelve months' time, they might quite consistently submit a recommendation for the nationalization of the The matter will be dealt industry. The quotation continuesThe cost of nationalizing the refining' industry would involve an initial capital outlay of some millions by the time allowance had been made",27,Monopolies Bill Second Reading

To secure a fair interest on this capital outlay without penalizing consumers would, we believe, be difficult, if not impossible. bine. We have in this State a Liberal AdI t appears to me that the Commission only looked at one aspect of what we call a nationalization system. It does not mean that we are going to buy up the existing businesses; that might cost too much money. We can nationalize in another way. We can start a refinery, and conduct it in opposition to that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. A splendid illustration of the good effect of such a course is furnished by South Australia. It was reported in the press, of either this morning or yesterday evening, that a deputation from the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce waited upon Mr Pascoe, who is Minister of Agriculture, and, I believe, a member of the Legislative Council, and desired certain alterations to be made in the conduct of the Government butter factory. The State Government have been buying the cream from the producers, manufacturing it into butter, and selling the butter locally, and, I understand, exporting it, too; practically they have been carrying on the whole of the manufacturing industry for the producers. The Chamber qf Commerce were desirous of bringing about certain alterations, and, I presume, that at the back of their mind was the abolition of the State butter factory. But Mr much information as possible within the Pascoe very emphatically stated that the butter factory was a very good.thing, indeed, in connection with the industry, because it helped to protect the producer of cream on one side, and the buyer or consumer of butter on the other, and that he as a member of a Liberal Government, not long returned to power, did not intend to make any recommendation to the Cabinet on the lines which the deputation had suggested, but that he and the Government intended to keep the butter factory going. That is only a small illustration, but, to my mind, even a small Commonwealth sugar refinery, conducted on proper lines, would keep the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in a proper relationship to the public. The honourable member for Bendigo, referring to the brick combine of Victoria, said that it could not be a very bad thing since the State Government had consented to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into it. That appears to me to be rather strange logic. There must be some ground In other words, the Commission, although for complaint, otherwise the State Governit thinks that it would be inexpedient to Mr Fenton. ment are placing themselves in a peculiar position by appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of the comministration, and it appears to me that it is anxious to obtain information to prove whether or not the statements that have been made in regard to this combine are correct. I believe that the evidence will show that it is about time that the Government, or some other public body in Victoria, took in hand the manufacture of bricks. The late Sir Thomas Bent, when Premier of Victoria, acquired land on behalf of the Government and set up a brickmaking plant to carry on the industry, but did not actually commence the making of bricks, because the present manufacturers undertook to supply the State at a certain price. The State brick yards are now held by a company which has agreed to supply bricks to the State, and not to join the combine. Notwithstanding that, however, the Government evidently think that there is need for an inquiry. Returning to the report of the Sugar Commission, I intend to quote a passage to which the honourable member for Lang did not refer. I do not say that he purposely refrained from doing so. I recognise that he was anxious, just as I am, to crowd into his speech as limited time allowed by the Standing Orders. It cannot be denied that the delivery of electioneering speeches has already commenced on both sides of the House. The reports of our speeches are to be circulated throughout the country, and I presume that every honourable member is trying, to use a colloquialism, to "" get in his little bit."" The Sugar Commission, in paragraph 4 of 1 their report, stateWe recommend that the Parliament of the Commonwealth should endeavour to acquire, by an amendment of the Constitution or otherwise, such powers as would enable Commonwealth authorities to control the prices of raw sugar and sugar-cane. 2. We recommend, should such powers be acquired(a) that the price of raw sugar be fixed on a sliding scale by the Inter-State Commission; (6) that the price of cane be fixed by a Board for each mill, consisting of a representative of the growers, a representative of the millers, and a chairman to be appointed by the InterState Commission. recommend at the present time the nationalization of the sugar refining industry, goes so far as to suggest that in respect of two important branches of the industry, the growing of sugar cane and the production of raw sugar, prices should be fixed. It does not think it right that the one company which has the dominating influence in the industry should be permitted to say what price shall be paid for raw sugar and sugar cane. It practically recommends the fixing of prices. There is one country to which we can specially look for information regarding the operations of the wealthy combines, trusts, and monopolies that are exercising so detrimental an influence upon the community. I refer to the United S.ates of America. I propose to put before the House one or two quotations from a book written by a man who belongs to the millionaire class. writer to his own class, and it tells them exactly what they have done by means of combinations of capital, the formation of trusts, and by acting in a monopolistic way. The title of this book is The Passing of rick Townsend Martin, says at the outsetI know society. I was born in it, and have lived in it all my life, both here and in the capitals of Europe. I believe that I understand as well as any man what are the true traditions and the true conditions of American society; and for comparison, I also know and understand the conditions and traditions of society in other squeezing of him out of competition, the lands. He speaks of the first inroads made by capitalists upon industry, with a view to conducting great enterprises in a way that would be exceptionally remunerative to themselves, although hard upon the workers whom they employed and injurious to the consumers of the articles they manufactured. He speaks of the early life of these men, who came from the gold-fields of California, the forges of Pittsburg, the forests of Michigan, and the '' metalled mountains of Montana,"" and settled in great centres of population where, engaging in manufactures, they gradually wiped out the competition of all small industries and securely established themselves. Writing of those whom they left behind at Pittsburg, Michigan, California, and Montana, he saysI t is not too much to say that they left behind them a people reduced to industrial slavery. our fathers knew. Faded into history was the ideal of Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln. From the year 1890 onward the progress of the United States has been the fearful march of manufacturing industry. In that year the products of industry and agricultural wealth were about equal. Ten years later the products of industry were two to one against the wealth gathered from the fields. Side by side with this conquest of America went the growth of tenant farming, as against the old free tenure farming that had marched steadily into the farthest untitled corners of the land so long as land was free. To-day there is no free land within the borders of the nation, save for a few small tracts hardly worth mentioning. Here, as in the industries, capital did not hesitate to claim and capture all that it dared. Law after law was passed to prevent the centralization of the power of exploiters over great tracts of the West. Law after law was broken, evaded, or laughed at. Once the spirit of exploitation on a large scale was abroad in the land, nothing could stand against it. To gain its ends, wealth crept stealthily into every seat of power. The law stood in its way: therefore, in Legislative halls and in political caucuses wealth had to have its representatives. It is addressed by the The Legislatures, the Courts, the press-thes e were made pawns in the game of exploitation. Wherever possible, the army of exploiters laid profane hands even upon the trusteed funds that guard the property of the spoiled and broken, the funds of the savings banks, and of the insurance companies. Nothing was sacred; nothing was secure. The raw material of wealth, as I have stated in a previous chapter, is the labour of men. In the days of individual effort, exploitation of labour was not possible. . . . These quotations, and one or two others which I shall make, all deal with the subjugation of the smaller manufacturer, the treatment of labour, and the creation of monopolies, on lines that have led to the exploitation of the American people want here. these quotations .because we are governed under a Constitution very like that of the United States of America. Unfortunately our Constitution has been too much Americanized, with the result that we are suffering. Yet because, by means of these proposals, we are trying to free fhe people of Australia from the shackles with which they are bound, we are denounced by the Opposition. Mr Martin goes on to sayYet, I confess, the terrific sweep of industrialism across this land throughout the past century appals me as I study it from records written and unwritten.

That is strong language from a millionaire. To' my mind, as I have studied this question, there has come a sad conviction : This nation is betrayed. The planting of the seed of our industrial system, whose fine flower has been reached in our class of idle rich, was quite possible without any betrayal of the people. Even its growth for two decades was possible without a conscious effort on the part of the keepers of the public citadels to throw open the doors to a public enemy. May a thinking man dare to say that the growth of' this system since i8qo could have been possible without criminal negligence on the part of those public servants sworn to guard the true and lawful interests of the people of this nation.

A machine-made politician in New York, in Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania is crushed by the votes of the people he fondly had dreamed he owned. A firmly entrenched public officer is branded a liar and a thief, no matter what committees may whitewash him.

London; the Guggenheims, or Morgans, of New York; the Rockefellers, or the Rothschilds, of New York or Germany. They are the first in the field. They pre-empt for fortunes already far beyond competition, the opportunity of making a tremendous fortune out of the new -discovery. Think of the raw materials of commerce-sugar , meat, oil, iron, coal, copper, cotton, wheat, corn, lumber-is it not absolutely true that in the manufacture and exploitation of this tremendous mass of the raw material of wealth the possibility of amassing enormous fortunes is almost hopelessly limited by the activities and the world-girdling power of capitalistic groups already far beyond the reach of competition? The free land of America is gone. All those -great staples that have been in generations past the vehicles in which men have been carried upon the road to lordly fortunes are already in the hands of a few hundred families. . This fact, sinister as it undoubtedly is in the broader economic conditions of the country, must certainly tend tn eliminate more and more the possibility for the creation of additional gigantic 'industrial fortunes in this country.

I am not going to deny anything which is contained in the book from They represent the Piersons, of which he quoted. I do not know whether the facts, as he has quoted them, are correct or not, nor do I think it matters very much. The author of that book has made plenty of money out of the toil o.f other people, and I was waiting to hear the honourable member quote some passage which would evidence remorse on the part of this man, but I did not hear a sentence which indicated that he entertains the slightest remorse, or that he has made any restitution for all the tears and blood that he has wrung from the American poor. Not one word has been forthcoming to show his sincerity. There is only one test of the sincerity of a man like that-h e should tell us whether he is giving back the money which he has wrung so foully from these men and women, whom he has so eloquently and tragically described. All I his rhodomontade which the honourable member has read will not assist us to solve the problem with which we are faced. Let us admit that things are bad in America.

The author whom the honourable member quoted was addressing a few co-millionaires in America upon the passing of the idle rich. But what remedy does he suggest?

I recommend it to him. judged by the passages which the honourable member has quoted, I think that the book is exaggerated and tremendously overdrawn. ThisB ill represents the last of the proposals of the Government which will be submitted tor the consideration of the country in the early future. We had better regard this practical proposition in the light of our own local circumstances, and pay a little less heed to the moving and eloquent I do not know appeals of the millionaires of America, who, having made money to satiety, now think that they may gain a little notoriety by denouncing the very methods which they themselves employed. Let lis leave them to their millions, to their regrets, and to their remorse. We have practical work to do, and that sort of sentimental writing will not help us very much.

In other words, this Parliament, by a resolution of both Houses, is to do what all the judicial experience of the world has so far found a supreme difficulty in doing. Is this Parliament wiser than are the Judges on the Bench? Doesi t possess more experience than the learned and trained jurists of the world?

103,Mr Fenton,"The Inter-State Commismade by a body composed mainly of the dominant political section of this House, as in the case of the Sugar Commission. Was that inquiry a fair inquiry? The honourable member for Maribyrnong thinks that it was. We, on the other hand, think that the Sugar Commission was not constituted as fairly as it might have been. They have done their work, and it does not now appear to satisfy honourable members opposite. I wish to say that an inquiry by untrained and inexperienced men will not bring us any nearer to a decision as to what is a true monopoly, and such a monopoly as interferes unduly with the private affairs of the citizens of the Commonwealth. The great issue lo be raised at the coming elections is to be this : Whereas the Opposition will contend that the State may very properly use all its powers, resources, and influence to control and regulate, and keep within proper metes and bounds the wealthy industrial enterprises of Australia, our honourable friends opposite will urge that they cannot be controlled by regulations, and must therefore be nationalized. They aim at the dispossession of the individuals who control these huge enterprises, and the placing of those enterprises under the control of the State. What are the motives which urge honourable members opposite to this course? I should like to say here that it is quite in accord with the programme of the party as decided at the recent Hobart conference* There the Prime Minister himself, instructed by the Maryborough section of his constituents, moved the following motion :That there be one uniform objective for Comof honourable members opposite in seeking monwealth and State, and that to be the Queensfor an amendment of the Constitution to land Labour Party's objective.

The critics mainly were Mr Watson, Mr Griffiths, and others. Here is Mr Watson's criticism. He saidThe Federal objective asked for "" the extension of the industrial economic functions of the State and municipality."" There was no limit to that sphere of activity. Therefore, be contended that it was of no use to adopt the Queensland objective, because it brought the party no nearer to what they desired. As a working proposition, he contended that 'the present objective was all that they required, and was as thoroughly radical and Socialistic as the objective suggested from Queensland. Later on, Mr Griffith appeared on the scene, and he saidHe did not apree with the previous speaker. The objective, providing as it did for-the ""extension of the industrial economic functions of the State and municipality"" covered everything from flying machines to brickmaking. He was a Socialist, and the Labour movement was a socialistic one. cepted that years ago. attacked by the Sydney press because they said the movement was socialistic. He had a paternal interest in this objective, having been present when it was framed, and he felt, with Mr Watson, that there was everything in it that a progressive Socialist would require. It h in k this is the first step in the w o r k in g out of that objective to which my honourable friends opposite are pledged, and which they have declared, through their leaders, to involve all the Socialism necessary to help them later to nationalize all the means of production, distribution, and exchange.

Further, I say that during tbe last two years, in the Sydney General' Post Office, at any rate, overtime has been worked unceasingly, and Avithout payment for it, unless it has been made in the last week or so. There has been more overtime worked in our Socialistic institution, the Sydney General Post Office, than anywhere else in Australia. I make that statement without the slightest hesitation. So we have it that the average wage is £125 or, it may be, .£127. for the most part, has not been paid for, while the loss on the Post Office this year is 37?r per cent. out Australia is only ,£83, so that the wage in the Post Office may be regarded as 50 per cent, abetter than that. doubt that. to quibble about these points; I am talking about the Post Office. But even if ,£83 is the average wage for Australia, and there is a better condition of affairs in the Post Office, is that all that honourable members opposite have in their minds when they talk about Socializing all enterprise's? Is their only ideal £126 a year? able members opposite that the latest German Socialist writers are frankly telling the people of Germany that there can be no substantial increase 'in wages under Socialism.

Mr Knibbs has furnished us with, a very interesting set of figures lately, showing the wealth production of this country, and what would be the result if it were divided amongst all classes of the community. Why Mr Knibbs should be instructed to make out a table of that kind I cannot imagine, but he showsthat, if the wealth were equally divided, it would mean about £ 1 6 ios. each over a minimum of £200 per annum. It will be seen that even in Australia there is not that enormous wealth production which would make every man a millionaire if it were equally divided, nor would it very materially increase the wages or improve the conditions enjoyed to-day. I am glad that these inquiries are being made since the Labour party took office, because the information will show the people outside thatmy friends opposite have not the elysiumto take them to that they picture, but only the same hard, grasping, poverty-strickere world, taking it by and large, from which they are led to hope for escape whenever Socialism is realized. show us the people who can stand taxation. but Mr Knibbs shows that, if all the large owners were taxed out of their wealth, there would be not very much per head if it . were divided.

Honourable members opposite are always pointing to this or that State institution as a marvellous example of Socialism; but if all the privateenterprises of the country were conducted by the State, with precisely the same financial results, the country would be bankrupt in a year. Even with all the saving of money which ought to have been spent on the Post Office, we find that in eleven years the Department is in debit to the tune of £ 6 , 6 2 4 , 0 0 0 ; and if private enterprises are to be taken over and conducted in the same way, the nation will be bankrupt before it begins its career of Socialism. I have nothing to say against State Socialism as exemplified in the Post Office. We have to carry the Department along because it is in the nature of a monopoly and because we can make use of it, and similar instruments, in a collateral way for the benefit of the people. We must remember, however, that this can only be done because the Post Office is subsidized by private enterprisea fact that honourable members opposite always gloss over. the services rendered. woman, and child will have to contribute about 9s. each to make up the deficiency on the Post Office alone; in other words, 35s. per family will have to be paid at the end of the year.

It would seem that there is as much dissatisfaction inside the Public Service as outside. Many of the men employed by the Commonwealth, in all Departments, think that they are not getting just remuneration for the work they do; and human nature inside Government institutions works in exactly the same way as outside in industrial enterprises carried on by'private individuals. Who has not had public servants complaining to him of the injustice and hardship inflicted by the authority of the Government itself? Only last week I was talking to a postal employee, who, without any reason being given, has been ordered to take up a position 300 miles away from his home. positions man has to go. Silting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. out that the Post Office has paid its way this year, because private enterprise has subsidized this Socialistic institution to the amount of £ 3 7 ios. on every ,£100 required to square tlie ledger. I do not deny that there are other advantages; but were the industries of the country run on the same financial basis as the Government enterprises, we should be bankrupt within I am in favour a very short time. The honourable member for Maribyrnong says that one of the reasons why this power is needed is to give us control of the railways, so that we may put an end to the scandalous sweating in Victoria. To-day, he has spoken of the admirable Newport workshops, but the the other day he said that there was more sweating in the Victorian Railway Department than anywhere else in the State. There have been strikes, threats of strikes, If so, the Post and requests for Wages Boards to adjust differences, so that the lot of the railway employee' under Government control in Victoria would seem anything but ideal.

139,Mr Joseph Cook,"I have pointedthe same cause that brings ""trouble in private employment. Human nature is the same everywhere, hence we have discontent and a sense of injustice. One man is preferred before, or promoted over, the head of another, who thinks that he should be getting as much or more wages. Among the measures yet to be dealt with this session is a Bill to help to cure the discontent which exists in the Commonwealth Public Service, notwithstanding two and a half years of Labour administration. Apparently, our public servants do not trust this Government, or the Public Service Commissioner, who has no motive in the world but to give them justice; they must have a Judge to deal with their complaints. What does one find in the Northern Territory? There we are ,£500,000 on the wrong side of the ledger, and after two years of Labour administration the debit does not seem to be diminishing. The other day we had a fine splash at Port Augusta; a railway being Begun, although we had not a rail to lay down, and had not conserved a drop of water in that dry district. According to the present Minister, inferior powellised sleepers are to be used on that line, yet he tells us that ""he is comThis was, perhaps, the saddest aspect of the petent to run*the world, and that it would pay this country to give him. £1,000,000 a year to run its Departments. Further, we have the statements concerning "" the man on the job."" Everywhere I find the Public Service as discontented as private employees, and I see no prospect of getting the working man to heaven by means of any of the Socialistic processes that are advocated. The supposition underlying the proposals which have been put before us seems to be that the State is a perfect, omnipresent, omniscient instrumentality which can dispense justice to its employees more perfectly than any other. But, as I have already said, Government _ schemes have to be run with human ability, skill, and ambition. To-day, Government control means control by the Government of the dominant party in the State, and in Australia it is the Caucus which controls the Government, with the result that allegations of, jobbery, favouritism, preference, and privilege are abroad, as they have not been before for many years. Has Socialism ever succeeded in any part of the world? The other day, the honourable member for Melbourne referred to the Socialism of Japan. He told us that the Japanese Government have a monopoly of tobacco manufacturing and match making, but Mr Joseph Cook. gave his case away by saying that it imposed duties amounting to 250 per cent, to protect these industries, and this notwithstanding the fact that the workmen receive only is. a day. Is that the perfect example of Socialism which we should follow? Would the honourable member set up a monopoly of that kind here? 1 shall not say whether the tobacco pf France is good or bad, but it is certainly no better than that made by private firms, and it is alleged that the wages paid by the Government to its employees are not any higher than those paid by private firms. What a picture we had of successful Socialism in the New Australia movement. Let me quote some passages from the latest book on the subject, Stewart Grahame's Where Socialism Failed. Speaking of one of the settlements, he saidA blight seemed to descend upon everything managed by the community, and the children proved no exception to the rule. Deliberately cut off from the softening influences of religion, and brought up to ignore all distinctions of age or sex, it was natural for them to seek always their own pleasure and ride rough-shod over the old and infirm. Untaught and unrestrained, the neglected children seemed doomed to suffer all their lives for the follies of their parents. New Australia fiasco. As soon as the resolution abolishing Socialism was carried, Frederick Kidd, under whose sane aud practical administration the change was brought about, set off to Asuncion to interview the Government, whom he found sympathetically disposed and prepared to do all in their power to assist the colonists. Withdrawing the original grant of territory, the President confirmed them in possession of twenty-five square miles, on which they were actually settled, and approved a scheme whereby every man was entitled to select for himself an allotment of sixty squares of agricultural ground, for which he would be given title deeds, when he had built a house and complied with the usual conditions. The right of grazing over the grass lands was reserved in common for all, so that it was possible for every individual colonist to become a big cattle farmer if he could find the necessary capital. This fact created fresh ambition in the heart of every familv, and there was a general exodus of able-bodied men to the railway works at Sapucay, to Asuncion, Kosario, or Buenos Aires-anywher e where good wages could be earned by a man willing to work his fingers to the bone. . . . One and all found salvation in the "" iron law of wages,"" and discovered for themselves that capital is the indispensable ally and friend, and not the enemy of labour. The legitimate ambition of each one was to become himself a capitalist., for "" Capital is the result of labour and abstinence."" There is a sentence in Levy's Outcome of Individualism, which well sums up the conditions at New Australia: A brief but brilliant span of existence may be attained by a socialistic State living on the capital of its predecessors; but it soon runs through this capital, and goes out like a spent squib, and leaves a nasty smell. The"" nasty smell"" at New Australia took the form of rancour and bitterness of spirit, so that many families were not on speaking terms with their nearest neighbour-no t that any one had time 'it inclination in those terrible days for sociabeing lent by Mr Miller to the private bilities. Then as to the Cosme experimentEventually, as at New Australia, the Government stepped in, withdrew the original grant, «nd divided the Cosme settlement up, on the usual colonization terms, each family being allotted so much agricultural and so much grazing land. "" The Cosme Colony has now definitely thrown its dreams overboard,"" wrote a correspondent to an Australian journal. "" For several years before it abandoned the original principles it was an open secret (scarcely even concealed by the interested parties) that the few remaining members were held together only by the expectation of the final break up, when the property would be divided, and the fewer that remained the greater individual share would accrue to each."" Thus, after wasting the best part of their lives in hopeless experiments, the Cosmans were given a new lease of life and they, too, began to make some progress towards prosperity. Yet one of the most sane and intelligent of Australian leaders at the time, Mr earth where an experiment could be made William Lane, was the head of the New Australia movement. ceeded in Australia under the regime of the Labour party?

There is, therefore, no help coming from that quarter. about the "" will be."" Lots of things were to be done, we were told, before the last general election, but none of those promises has been realized. I have not time to refer in detail to the Commonwealth Bank, about which so much was said this morning, but the latest information in regard to it is that the little money that has been deposited with it is banks to strengthen them still further, and to enable them to continue to bleed the people, as we are told by honourable members opposite they do. The extinction of the private banks prognosticated seems to be further off than ever. lending the money, not to local banks, but to English banks carrying on business here. money to private banking companies, and so making their position stronger. By means of money deposited with the Government Savings Bank, he is helping them to "" bleed "" the people more. I would also remind honourable members ' of the little incident connected with the Government works at Yanco. One would have thought that if there was a place on this it was there. Mr Griffith proposed to set Has Socialism sucup a Socialistic store at Yanco, but, after careful investigation, came to the conclusion "" I should have to give the men credit,"" he said. That is exactly what every private storekeeper has to do.

If he dared not run a little Government store on Governtionalizing these services on any large scale as to make an impression on the private enterprises of Australia? The more I see Mr Griffith, of Government Socialistic enterprises, the more they seem to me to be like the proverbial bunch of carrots. There is nothing in them. While Mr Griffith has spent £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 on his little Socialistic experiments in New South Wales, the private enterprise of that State has expended a couple of millions more in putting down plant. In other words, while he has spent £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 in trying to catch up to them, they have spent ,£2,000,000 in getting further away fro m him.

166,But Are Trusts Singular Mr Joseph Cook,"Mr Wise saysCourt to avoid inquiry into that particular part of the Coal Vend's arrangement. Experience is the test of ail truth, and experience shows that we have not yet a successful example of State Socialism anywhere in the world. By that I mean that we have not an instance which will fit our Australian conditions. The Japanese experiment is good enough in its way, I suppose, and we might imitate it if we wished our men to work for a shilling a day behind a 250 per cent. Tariff. The tobacco industry of France is good enough in its way. But will that fit jhe conditions which obtain in Australia? We must look for experiments which have been worked out on the plane of civilization that we are following-o n the plane of industrialism that we have fixed for ourselves by Statute law. No other experiments will be a guide to us; no other experiments are conclusive so far as this argument goes. It does seem to me that the tendency of the times is well summed up in the following extract by an American writerWe will make a sky-reaching, an all-powerful law. We will all work for the Government, and the Government shall feed us all. This is the plan of the Nationalist. It is the loftiest strucAustralia scheme. ture of its kind that man ever sought to rear; for Socialism seeks to outwit mother nature herself and to legislate the law of nature off the face of the earth. It is the modern tower of Babel. But it is not to be built of bricks, but of men; and the mortar of legislation never can make a man stay put. Legislation is invoked to cure all the ills that flesh is heir to. Is there injustice? Let us make a law against it. Is there too much competition-mak e a law to put it down? Is the millennium slow in coming-invok e the law? Mr Henry James. But I come back to this point: that we have not any experience on which we ought to base these tremendous and far-reaching social experiments, even under our Democracy in Australia. Experiment is the test of all truth, and experiment shows the uniform failure of Socialism upon any large and national scale. Experience proves the truth of the following propositionThat the condition of civilization or barbarism among nations is in proportion to the security and inviolability of private property. The certainty that a man can enjoy the fruits of his toil is the great stimulus to production, enterprise, and prosperity with the individual and with the nation. often that I engage the attention of honourable members, and on this occasion I shall be as brief as possible. I regard the proposal which is embodied in this Bili as one of transcendent importance. It does seem peculiar that the Opposition should oppose Commonwealth control of monopolies on the ground that the Government propose to nationalize them, and that they should oppose the nationalization of those monopolies on the ground that the Commonwealth can control them: So that, whether we propose to control or nationalize them, they raise an objection. They have raised bogies in regard to monopolies. They have urged that this Parliament will have power to define what is a monopoly, and that the High Court will be vested with a similar power. But it seems to me, as a layman, that the High Court will deal with the question of the control of monopolies, while this Parliament will deal with the question of their nationalization. Each authority will be sovereign within its own ambit, and each will determine what is a monopoly for the purpose which it has in hand. The honourable member for Parramatta has quoted a number of isolated instances of the failure of Socialistic enterprises-such , for example, as the failure of the New What does it matter if there have been failures? How do they point a moral or adorn a tale? Why, the whole path of progress is strewn with failures. If the circumstance that efforts on the part of the public to control public utilities have failed is to constitute a condemnation of public ownership, how much more ought the failures of private enterprise^-the failures of private corporations and banks, which have spread destruction over a wide area-to constitute a condemnation of the system of capitalism which surrounds us ? One cannot pick up a newspaper without reading of private insolvencies, in which the creditors receive, perhaps, is. in the £ 1 . Do honourable members opposite quote these instances? Not at all. To them they mean nothing. A ll the arguments which can be adduced against public ownership account for nothing in the face of the world's experience and the world's practice. This is not a question of Labour or anti-Labour. It is not a question of Socialism or anti-Socialism, it is not a question of theory or of the application of a theory. It is a question of national necessity as applied by all the Governments of the world. The fact is that in every direction this question of public ownership is becoming a growing factor.

But in every case public ownership is a growing force, and in no country are any efforts made at denationalization. Whetheri t be a question of the public ownership of railways or of schools, or whether it be a question of the municipal control of the water or gas supply, or whether it be a question of ""making a roadway or a footpath, at every step we find the class of man who is mirrored by honourable members opposite. there .have been those who have prophesied that it meant horror, peril, and social destruction-wh o have urged that it was doomed to failure.

But all experience has defeated their prophesies. plied them with a complete answer to their gloomy forebodings. members opposite who have addressed themselves to this Bill have raised the objection that we have power to control monopolies and that therefore their nationalization is not necessary.

It is the attitude which the troglodytes of politics have taken in every country on every national question. stand: that it is not a question of party at all. gress, of revolution, or of Socialism. Boiled down it amounts to this: "" It is a national necessity?"" is. sity arise in this country? It arises from the peculiar position in which we find ourselves. We have established a system of national defence and a system of national Protection. We propose to maintain Australia as a white man's country, and we propose to carry on in this country all those industries which will provide the people within our boundaries with a variety of occupations. We are face to face with the fact that to-day an immense volume of imports is pouring into this country. Whether we are invaded by labour, or by The fact a foreign army, or by the products of cheap labour, the national spirit calls upon Australia to defend itsel.f against this foreign aggression. What solution have we to this problem ? Honourable members opposite propose to remit it to some Board and to leave ihe task which confronts us now to be dealt with some years hence. But any man who considers the situation knows f u l l well that there can be no greater piece of hypocrisy than is provided by any public man who talks about the solution of this invasion of Australia by foreign products, but who fails to face the problem of how and by what means foreign goods may be A t every step excluded, while at the same time the revenue obtainable from the influx of those commodities may be collected. We have to maintain our defence policy, our old-age and invalid pensions, and f u l f i l all the functions of a National Government out of revenue, and the only means at. our command is the Customs, owing to the peculiar Constitution imposed on us. There, Thus they therefore, remains only one solution of the trouble-onl y one means of making up a revenue depleted by a national system of Protection. We can only meet the situaI t has suption by imposing additional taxation, with the one alternative of getting within the Most honourable control of the nation the industrial resources of the nation in many directions, and diverting the profits from the hands of private individuals into the coffers of the State. Only by such means can we secure the end we have in view. We are told that this is an irrational and improper means of securing revenue, and that in pursuing such a policy we are going in the face of the world's experience. We are told that the I take up this countries which threaten our national and industrial supremacy are Germany and It is not a question of labour, of proJapan. These are the countries, apparently, in view of which we are spending millions of money in order to defend ourI affirm that it selves against possible invasion, both indusWhere does the national necestrially and politically; and yet these are just the two nationalities that are building up their powers and resources by the policy that is embodied in the Bil l before us. Japan is endeavouring to save its people from additional taxation by excluding the American Tobacco Trust, and thus securing revenues which previously went to the United States of America, and a similar policy has been put into operation in many other directions. The first thing that Germany did on the establishment of the Empire was to found a national bank. The honourable member for Kooyong has talked to us about confiscation; but the German Government, which was not composed of Socialists or Labourites, or even of Radicals, but of men who were determined to build up an Empire, were not particular as to the methods they pursued. not spend millions of public money in laying the foundations of a new bank. They made the national interest their supreme interest, and seized the existing banking corporations without paying them a penny. They took over the capital of the banks a» part of the national debt of the Empire, and from that time those banks have been paid 3^ per cent, on their confiscated capital. What would be said of us to-day if we, in the interests of the nation, pursued such a method ? We should be denounced as confiscators, and yet that is the method pursued by the men who laid the foundations of the great and growing Empire of Germany. And it is exactly that policy which the Japanese are carrying out. In England ^40,000,000 of profit is annually made on railways in the hands of private individuals, whereas in Germany the Government have control of railways, smelting works, banking, and other enterprises, and devote the profits to subsidizing shipping, building up industries, and constructing men-ofwar. It is those lines that Australia can pursue. Of all questions presented to us, none transcends in importance the one that we are now considering. grounds of theory or of party policy, but on the solid ground of national necessity. To merely turn aside and raise quibbles as to whether this or that is an evil proves nothing-national necessity is the para-mount necessity. We can only have effective Protection by devising new methods whereby to replace the depleted revenue which must result; and the only methods are to take over the ownership of our induspursued,"" and he held them up as an extrial resources, to reduce the expenditure, or to impose additional taxation. No member of the Opposition can tell us how and by what means they would solve the problem of how to establish a national Protection in Australia, side by side with a depleted revenue-how to make that revenue up. The Bill before us constitutes the only effective national policy which will enable Australia to march with other countries of the world. I think, Mr Speaker, I have occupied your attention long enough in placing these few thoughts before the members of this House. Mr Anstey. honourable member for Bourke is ""master of a fervid and attractive oratory which gives immediate satisfaction to his own supporters and more permanent comfort to his opponents.

We find exactly what it is that honourable members opposite are carrying in the bag they have been giving us a peep at in the course of these debates. We have occasionally seen a few of the claws through the sacking, and an ear or two, but now the whole cat is out. It is taxation, and nothing but taxation, which underlies these nationalizing proposals. And where did the honourable member go to for his inspiration ? To the Democrats of Germany? No, he went to the man who, he himself admitted, was.the very reverse of the Democrat, namely, Bismarck. He said that im Germany it was that stalwart Conservative and Tory who suggested nationalizing proposals, not for the purpose of uplifting the people, paying higher wages, or evenly distributing profits, but It rests on no for the one essential purpose of providing the means for national defence. The honourable member is to be commended for his frankness, and his friends are to be congratulated on the complete exposure he has made of all they have been pretending for some days past. The honourable member in referring to Germany said that the German statesmenI quote his exact words""were not particular about the methods they ample to his own supporters.

The fact remains that the proposition, as we understand it, is one for nationalizing industries broadcast not only the sugar monopoly-in order to get still further profits and"" still more taxation by indirect methods from the pockets of the people of Australia. The honourable member for Parramatta has quoted statements by the Sugar Commission's adherents of the Labour party with regard to the possibility of nationalizing the sugar industry with financial solvency. a jury drawn, not from all sections of the community, but from the colleagues of the honourable' member for Bourke, and this jury of the honourable member's friends declared against the nationalizing of the sugar industry. what the honourable member said before. to look at the report of the Sugar Commission which has been read by the honourable member for Parramatta, and which is signed, first by the Chairman, and then non.

Let me take another side of this question, which has been referred to by ihe honourable member for Bourke. He started his oraticn by saying that this was a new principle-as a matter of fact, the principle is as old as the Pharaohs-and that there has been no recession from anynationalized project.

It was not the reply of a popular administrator ot public affairs, but the reply of a Czar, j have no complaint to make against the reply; but I repeat that it was the reply of a Czar. It was as followsI have communicated with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who has furnished me with the following reply :"" I beg to advise that, as the management of the Commonwealth Bank is to be free from political interferencethat? world. I am pointing out the humbug of pretending that the public will run the industries of AustraliaI respectfully decline to answer this or any question of a similar nature. Thus even the basis of the business of this institution is not to be the subject of political knowledge, let alone of political control. The national institution that was going to cheapen money to borrowers, and to assist every agency of the Commonwealth, is being run on lines which-as the Opposition showed at the time, it should and must be-ar e divorced from political influence or popular control. In deed, every Government agency that we create in the sphere of finance must from the very risks of the enterprise be only another private enterprise financed by the Australian people. I do not think that his fervid oratory was the cause of the extraordinary error made by the honourable member for Bourke, when he said that the party to which I have the honour to belong opposed the control Bill on the ground that there was to be a nationalization proposal, and now opposes the nationalization proposal because there is a control B ill . That was a "" clever "" distortion of the fact. VVe, on this side, are prepared to give the fullest and most complete control over any trusts or combines acting to the detriment of the public. We have always taken that fair position. All we sought to do in regard to the control Bill was to have it so amended . that the Commonwealth, while possessing all the power needed, should not exercise it in regard to innocent bodies, but should concentrate its energies upon the regulation and control of trusts and combines acting to the detriment of the public. The honourable gentleman went on to say that the B ill before us was a measure, free from interference by the High Court. The fact to which the honourable member refers is a dangerous one, and should give honourable members pause. T h f members of the Labour party have been constantly referring to the Australian trusts as enormously wealthy corporations, which, for"" the sheer love of doing it, contribute enormously to the party funds. That is a picture which they have constantly held up to view. Now the Bill says tnat when each House of the you object to Parliament has ir. the same session, by resolution passed by an absolute majority No t the least in the of its members, declared that the industry or business of producing, manufacturing, or supplying any specified goods or services is the subject of a monopoly it may be nationalized. Will it not be worth the while of the trusts to prevent such resolutions being passed in regard to any of them ? Will hot the trusts be ready to make enormous financial sacrifices to prevent the passing of such resolutions?

Honourable members opposite, to keep themselves in power for a year or two, have used this poison, and it will stay in our public life if the Bill passes. That is one of the most serious criticisms I have to offer on the measure. The honourable member for Bourke admitted that Socialistic enterprises have invariably that insolvencies are constantly occurring in private life. I would remind the House that insolvency is a process for weeding out the unfit. The unfit in the financial body are, as it were, a cancer which is better cut out than retained. unfortunate. fortunate, but they are generally unfit financially. Is it not better for men to be weeded out of positions which they are not capable of filling than to be kept there by Government support? The objective of honourable members opposite is complete Socialism. has been enunciated since the days of Mr Watson, and no honourable member opposite would, moments, deny it. nationalization would be detrimental to every section of the public. able member for Bourke admitted that the consumer has to pay the cost of nationalization, and the consumer is the general public. A nationalized industry would permit no possibilities of comparison of its products with similar products produced elsewhere. At the present time you can compare the bread of your baker with that of any other; and find whether you are getting value for your money; but were the baking industry nationalized there would be no possibility of comparison, and it would be impossible for the ordinary person to know whether the Government was not depreciating quality with a view to increasing revenue. In other countries Government monopolies, such as the manufacture of tobacco, are used in this way for taxation purposes, and the quality of the article produced suffers. In France, Italy, and Japan, where the manufacture of tobacco is a Government monopoly, we consequently find the worse tobacco in the world. But mean enough to suggest inlet us see what happens in Australia. Here the sending of telegrams is a Government monopoly. A few years ago a telegram used to be sent with reasonable speed for 6d. for sixteen words, but a new system has been initiated. The Government say, ' ' You may still send a telegram at the rate of sixteen words for 6d., but we cannot guarantee that it will be received soon enough to make is worth your while to send it . If you want to send a real telegram, you must send it as an urgent message, and we failed, but pointed out shall charge you double rates."" By this means there has been extorted from the public double the price charged a few years ago for sending an ordinary telegram. Telephone rates have also been increased. -There are no standards of comparison, and the public forget that they are getting less value for their money. The Government, in operating every monopoly, alter the basis of conducting their business, and up goes the price to the ordinary consumer. If time would permit, I could give many instances where taxation has been increased by this insidious means to users of departmental services; and that is the inevitable result of every system of State Socialism of That which I know. to use a telephone in Canada or the United in bis candid States of America. telephone service is to be found in StockThe honorholm. The fact remains that the cost of the telephone service in Australia has gone up very considerably during the last year or two. The taxpayer is sold both in the way to which I have referred and in another way. Owing to the same sort of considerations of Government inefficiency as were placed before honourable members opposite by their own colleagues on the Sugar Commission, the taxpayers are sold both as consumers and as general taxpayers who have to pay to nationalize and run all these successful private enterprises.

If they do, they will see the inefficiency of Government management, even under the existing control, which, according to honourable members opposite, is all that could be desired. I asked what was the price per bell tent quoted by Messrs. Thomas Evans and Company, of Bourke-street, Melbourne, and what was the Commonwealth Harness Factory's cost price for a bell tent made to the order of the Defence Department. In reply I was told that the actual cost price of the Commonwealth agency is £ 3 8s. 1 id., whilst the price quoted by the private firm mentioned, after allowing fer rent, advertising, and other charges ,£3 8s.

I recently asked the prices of mail-bags as made for the Postal Department by our glorious Commonwealth factory, and the,prices at which the same bags were manufactured in the Postal Department before that factory was established.

It was put on the notice-paper I do not know how many weeks ago. The Estimates in respect of the Northern Territory for this year show that the Government are exercising there to a very considerable extent the powers of nationalization which they already possess. Provision is made for Government cottages for the use of the employees, and for the erection and equipment of a steam laundry. It was not thought proper I shall give some inthat the white men at Darwin should have their clothes laundered by Chinese, and now we are to have a "" white "" laundry to wash the clothing of the Chinese in that part of Australia.!

There is also to be ;i fodder farm, whilst advances are to be made to settlersa business that should be carried out as a sub-branch of the Commonwealth Bank. .All these matters relate to the Northern Territory.

Will honourable members opposite have the effrontery to say they will start with the nationalization of the tobacco industry?

I should like to refer very briefly to an interjection made by the honourable member for Brisbane, who said there was something of the early Christian ideals about this proposition on the part of the Labour party. I do not profess to be as good a Christian as he is, but so far as I can see there is a material difference between the tenets of the early Christians and the taxaT h e present Government tion tenets of honourable members opposite An early Christian tenet was to "" give that which thou hast to the poor,"" whereas the Labour party's tenets would have them abolish wealth, establish industries, take The delay away what others have earned, and give away a very small percentage.

Goodwill is thus to be excluded. Let me take the case of a surgeon by way of illustration. In the practice of his profession he uses certain property. That property consists of his offices and his instruments. The instruments and the property may be worth only a few pounds. But his skill and his brain may have so organized his business that it is worth thousands of pounds a year to him. Under this B ill the Government would be able to take his business from him for the payment of the price of his instruments. skill and brains to anybody else? nationalized. There lies the injustice. If , again, one purchased the Age newspaper in the open' market, one would probably have to pay something like .£1,000,000 for it. But a man who purchased the Age newspaper offices, would, perhaps, have to pay only .£50,000 or ; £ i 00,000 for them. So that, under this B ill , the Age newspaper could be nationalized for ,£100,000, and its proprietors might thus be deprived of nine-tenths of its purchase price, which they would have been able to realize for it in the open market. The same thing applies to almost every phase of industry which can be brought under the operation of this B ill . Yet the Attorney-General had the effrontery to say that there was no hint of expropriation about tlie measure ! For the reasons which I have advanced I shall oppose it . the Commonwealth the power to nationalize, which is incidental to its other powers, but every State has the complete power of nationalization within its own borders, and the bulk of the nationalization which might be undertaken is nationalization by the municipalities and State agencies of the people. If the powers sought in this B ill are vested in the Commonwealth Parliament it wil l be more difficult for us reasonably to regulate and sanely to administer the Departments which we already control. We shall have a great many more toys to play with, toys of a very expensive nature-as has been pointed out by the members of the Sugar Commission-and the public servants of Australia will get still less of our attention year after year. This Bil l is opposed to the interests of the Australian consumer, and in the light of the speech of the honourable member for Bourke, is opposed to the interests of the Australian taxpayer. It is also opposed to the interests of the Australian public servant, and of the Australian public. I urge the electors to read the speech of the honourable member for Bourke, if they wish to realize the exact -nature of the beast which is being placed before them, and to vote out this proposed power at the forthcoming referenda. ney-General) [4.8] -The objections which have been urged to this B ill are, shortly, that the power to nationalize monopolies is not necessary, and that its exercise would result in disastrous consequences to the nation and to the morale of the community. Yesterday, the honourable member for Ballarat directed his attention primarily to the first of these classes of objections. He said that the B ill was not necessary because we have power to deal with monopolies under the B ill dealing with "" trusts, combines, and monopolies in relation to the manufacture and supply of goods and services."" He said that, under the Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) B ill , and the Constitution Alteration (Corporations) B ill , we have power to deal with other monopolies, and that, therefore, we were completely armed against all possible enemies in this direction. Consequently, he urged that this power was superfluous and dangerous, and one which ought not to be granted. I think that his statement upon examination will prove to be fallacious. If it does not prove to be so, I admit that we ought not to have a power at once superfluous and dangerous. But the argument that we have other means of Not only has dealing with trusts does not dispose of our contention that we require also the power which is asked for in this B ill . Let us examine the question. Let us consider the attitude of honourable members opposite towards these proposals. They say that they will oppose this B ill because all the powers that we require are conferred by the preceding Bills. That is quite satisfactory as f a r as it goes. But let us consider their attitude towards the other Bills. They were opposed to every one of them.. They smote them hip and thigh. The position is that they will go to the electors, but will not say to them, "" We advise you to grant this power in relation to the nationalization of monopolies, but do not grant the powers which are asked for in",48,Distinguished Visitor

"" On the contrary, they will counsel the people to reject every one of the six proposals to amend the Constitution. That being the case, I submit that the argument of the honourable member for Ballarat breaks down. He has said that the powers conferred by the other Bills are sufficient. But he has also pledged himself to oppose granting to tnis Parliament the powers which are contained in those other measures, which he says are amply sufficient, and by implication in his argument necessary for our purposes. That is one point; now to another. He says that there is no necessity to nationalize a monopoly which we can control. I dispute that entirely. 1 say that the only way to control some monopolies is by nationalizing them. While we may control a domestic cat by a word, a sound, or a gesture, if we wish to control a Bengal tiger we must cage it , or subdue it by means appropriate to a beast of that kind. There are some monopolies which are so powerful that the State and they cannot exist side by side. I submit that the Beef, the Oil and Steel Trusts of America are examples of such trusts. They have, by various means, got such a hold, not only of the economic sources of the well-being of the people of America, but of its institutions of government, legislative and judicial, as to make government by the people a mere sham. middle course; the people must either rule or be ruled. The power to control monopolies, therefore, implies the power to nationalize them in certain cases. Let us now consider the honourable member's argument from another stand-point. The powers which are sought in the other Bills with which we have dealt would not enable us to control monopolies unless every one of those measures received the assent of the people. The Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) Bill will probably give us the power to control a monopoly. The trust, combine, and monopoly power will give us authority to deal with combines and monopolies in relation to manufactures or the supply of services. I wish to put the position as set before the House by the honourable member for Flinders, and contrast it with the attitude of the honourable member for Ballarat. 1 submit that the arguments Nor will they sayof these two honourable members are mutually destructive. The argument of the honourable member for Flinders is, shortly, that there is no necessity for the "" Trust, combine, and monopoly "" power, because we have, in the "" Nationalization of monopolies "" power, sufficient authority to deal with trusts. Therefore the honourable member for Flinders contended that to grant the "" Trust, combine, and monopoly "" power would lead to confusion, since there would .be two authorities, each having independent power to decide what was a. monopoly. We were asked, on this ground, to reject the Trust, Combine, and MonopolyB ill , and now, for precisely the opposite reason, to reject the Nationalization of Monopolies Bill. If we had taken the advice of the honourable member for Flinders, we should have rejected the Trust, Combine, and MonopolyB ill , because the Nationalization of Monopolies B ill was sufficient; but if we accept the honourable member for Ballarat's advice, we shall reject the latter B ill because the former is sufficient. If we take the advice of both or follow the example of either we shall reject both Bills. I leave the people to decide which of these two authorities is right-that they cannot both be right is evident. In the circumstances, we shall do right to reject the advice of both. Let me now say a word on the difficulty which arose in the mind of the honourable member for Flinders as to the definition of ""monopoly"" by the High Court and by this Parliament. He said that the High Court would define "" monopoly "" in any In such cases there is no way it pleased, and that the Parliament would define the word in any way it pleased, and that there would be difference of opinion and confusion. There may be; but whether there will or not I cannot say, nor can any man. Why should it be supposed that Parliament and the High Court will differ? They may or they may not. I do say, however, that we ought not to hesitate to ask the people for sufiicient power to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies, merely because there may be a clashing of opinion, or because the High Court is not the ultimate tribunal in regard to the interpretation of terms in both cases. Nothing is more clearly evident in these later days than the fact that the Judiciary is frequently quite incapable of interpleting plain words-word s that are in the mouth of every citizen, which circulate freely throughout commercial circles, and are accepted as current coin by the whole community. These plain words are bandied about in the Supreme Court of the country body that lives in a stagnant pool. Parasi f they were foreign tokens.

Every three years It has a meaning common to the have to say on any subject. It knows just The must be allowed to rule; and I cannot see I have said that there is no way of conAnd yet alizing them, and I say that again. There But can it do so? In admirable speeches we have listened to durpower to nationalize is a power which fifty years ago was viewed with fear and To-day, hide-bound Conservatives are advocating its exercise under the It is a fact suggestive, but incontrovertible, that So, if we are asking And the movement grows daily more What is our own experience? applied in this country of -ours than in any country on earth.' So far from being a doubtful experiment, or one pregnant with disaster-on e into which we should enter only after grave and about with many restrictions-it has bacome the accepted policy of Australia. And it is a policy which, entered upon, has never been receded from in any one case. What is a better test of any policy than that? It is a policy for the world as it is, and not for the world as it should be or as it might be. We see around us a world, as I have said often, in which competition no longer holds sway. We see great corporate 'bodies, exercising tremendous powers and influence. There is but one remedy for all this; and it is a remedy which finds its strength, not in the flimsy theories of the arm-chair professor or idealist, but in the vigorous growth of a plant rooted in deep soil, and springing out of the very nature -of things. People nationalize enterprises now because it is the only thing to do not because some man got on the stump and told them to do so, or because some philosopher has supported the theory in a book. The people nationalize because nationalizing has to be done; just'as a man eats, without thinking about it , in order that he may live. So we must nationalize, and secure public ownership of utilities, at any rate, or economically perish, or at best be serfs at the disposal of great and merciless corporations. This is ' no new and experiment; it is one with which we have grown familiar, and which has proved itself. The railways of this country are nationalized, though the honourable member for Ballarat hinted yesterday that perhaps they were not successful-that their nationalization had been a failure. I remember some years ago an agitation o i some considerable strength that reared its head in New South Wales in favour of handing the railways of that State back to private enterprise. Sir William McMillan, late member for Wentworth, figured most prominently. But times have changed. If Ave went over New South Wales-whic h is politically disturbed just now owing to various causeswith the finest hay-rake, not one man would be found who would dare to go on the public platform and advocate such a proposal. The public ownership of railways is as much an accepted fact in Australia as adult suffrage. There are men, I admit, who are opposed to both; but they dare not go on the platform and say so; and, generally speaking, the man who is opposed io government by the people is opposed to State-owned raillaborious thought, and hedged ways. The nationalization of railways has proved itself, and by its fruits we know it. The public debt of all the States of Australia is ,£267,000,000, on which there is an annual payment for interest of .£9,000,000. Of the £267,000,000 borrowed, about three fifths, or .£154,000.000,. has been invested in the State railways. Last year the railways provided £5>3<5g,ooo of the interest due on the public borrowing of Australia, and showed a clear profit of .£1,424,000. after paying interest, upkeep, and other costs. That is a magnificent tribute to national enterprise. Without the railways we should be taxed over ,£5,000,000 more to provide interest on> our public debt. No doubt honourable members may say that the moneywould not have been borrowed. But, as the honourable member for Bourke has pointed out, Germany, by the revenue from its railways and other national utilities, has been able to build up a great navy, to subsidize a great mercantile marine, and to move from the rearguard to the very van of the commercial and maritime world. Today Great Britain, the greatest commercial nation on earth, is hard pressed by Germany's competition, and rejoices when Canada, or some other part of the Empire, offers to find £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or venturesome £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 to help in her defence. In Australia we have many other examples of State enterprise, in addition to railways. The States have freely exercised their power to nationalize, and will do so more largely in the future than they have done in the past. They have exercised this power because circumstances demanded it. For a like reason we ask for it. We have been asked, "" Why do you desire both power to control monopolies and power to nationalize In that agitation than?"" Let me ask in my turn, "" Why have the States both power to control and power to nationalize and yet have exercised the latter so freely?"" They have not been satisfied with exercising their power to control, but have nationalized certain industries. Why? Because they have found it more conducive to the public benefit to have them managed directly by the people than left in the hands of private individuals. As to the general objections to this B ill , they are the same as those put forward against all the others. Our proposals have met the fate that reforms. has neverbeen a proposal for reform which some crusty and hoary-headed Conservative has not denounced as fraught with disaster. been painted by our friends of the consequences that must follow the measures which the Labour duced In 1910 we listened of the disasters that would follow the imposition of the land tax. to roll like a sea of glowing lava across the land. unfortunates who had invested their scanty earnings in huge tracts of country, were to be ruthlessly crushed. show that there was never before such prosperity as has attended this country during the last two years. That is the answer to the croaking of my honourable friends opposite. When we proposed to issue Australian notes,'it was said that artisans would be seen, haggard and weary, through the streets huge piles of notes which they vainly endeavoured to persuade credulous tradesmen to cash. But we have never seen anything of the kind. notes are negotiable at 20s. in the £1, and the only fault which the artisan has to find with them is that he cannot get enough of fhem. Ballarat and myself were not separated by the width of this table, I listened with great pleasure to many admirable dissertations 011 anti-Socialism which he delivered. He described the anti-Socialistic policv of the honourable member for the then honourable ' member Sydney, tionaries,"" wreckage of every party, including the black labour party, and the party that opposes every reform."" honourable member for Ballarat saw the reactionary behind his cloak of hollow pretence. Now the honourable member has become purblind, and sees only the cloak, and on it blazoned those fearsome things which, in 1907, he denounced as bogies to frighten children and credulous electors. If proposals for reform had been rejected when denounced form, no progress, legislative wise, would civilization. British House of Commons to pass a Bill providing for a ten hours day, some of the best men in Great Britain denounced it in Mr Hughes. unmeasured terms, declaring that it would usually threatens undermine the commercial and indusSince the time of Noah there trial supremacy of the. country. They asked how could we compete with ten hours a day against Germany with an eighteen-hours day ? But the measure So many dreadful pictures have was passed, and Great Britain has not succumbed.

It will be a truly civilized nation, peopled Ruin was with men and women with sound physical bodies, with alert and highly trained minds, Squatters, poor rich landlords, that we need fear. When Simpson announced his epoch-making discovery of chloroform-the greatest boon, with antiBut the records septic surgery, that science has given to suffering humanity-h e was denounced, because it was said that he had destroyed pain, which had been sent by the Deity to remind us of our mortality. Thank God, he held his own, and the world is the richer for his science and courage. bearing The honourable and learned member for Ballarat says that there is no need for the nationalization of monopolies, and that The nationalization would mean extra taxation. That is an extraordinary view. Monopolies are able to pile up huge profits so as to build mountains of reserves out of the When the honourable member for exploitation of the people. Yet, according to the honourable member, if they were nationalized, the people would be taxed more heavily ! On the face of it , the statement is absurd. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, as an example, has built Parramatta,'and up reserves worth millions out of profits for East wrung from the people. Were the Goas ""the cry of the reacvernment running the industry, those miland their partu as "" the lions would have been spent either in giving better wages to the workers, and better prices to the cane-growers, or cheaper At that time tlie sugar to the consumers, or distributed evenly among all these, and taxation, instead of being increased, would have been decreased. That, at any rate, is the opinion of the company itself. It is very much on the alert in these days. It fears the Referendum dreadfully. To show that, it is necessary to nationalize an industry like this because it is too big to control, let me as dangerous, no requote from the Benalla Independent of 6th r otherDecember.

Any remedy at all must be suited to the circumstances. What will suit such circumstances as these? A letter dated 27th November last, and addressed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, was sent to the proprietor of the Bcnalla IndependentDear Sir,-R e the enclosed letter from the general manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Tlie company wish to have this inserted next issue in your open column, and without any advertising mark. While this can in no way be claimed as an advertisement, to insure publication the company are prepared to pay, and you may charge us up to £ 1 15s. for the service. There is, however, one condition, attention must be drawn to the letter in your editorial column in the same issue. You make the comment as long or as short as you like, and may, of course, comment adversely or otherwise, but public attention must be drawn to the letter. Please post marked copv showing insertion to Mr Macdonald, Colonial Sugar Refining Companv, Svrinev. Yours faithfully , T. M. SHAKESPEARE, Manager. A similar letter was sent to every newspaper proprietor in Australia. the way in which the company has tried to put its side of the case before the public. I replied to the letter, the insertion of which was asked for, in die metropolitan press, but my reply was not published by the country press. I 'cannot pay £ 1 15s. to each of a thousand The letter which the company wishes inserted is one written by Mr Knox, to which I replied so effectually that ; i Second letter written by him was to the first as a bleating lamb is to a roaring bull. its fashion ! great company must be dealt with very carefully and gently. It is on behalf of great corporations of this kind that the Opposition tell us that we ought to be careful, and not to ask for the power to nationalize, because such a power is quite unnecessary. Yeti t was the general manager of this company who, when asked whether it was correct, as had been stated, that it had given ,£50,000 to the funds of the campaign against the last referenda-to throw dust in the eyes of fhe people, so that they should vote against our proposals-sai d that he would not deny that something had been paid, although a contribution of .£50,000 had not been made. It is very evident that we need power, and plenty of power, to deal with such conditions. No company in Australia need fear that it will not obtain from this Parliament a fair deal. the Colonial Sugar Refining Company or the smallest company in the community, it need have no fear in that regard. Let me give an illustration showing, from quite a different point of view altogether, why we should have power to nationalize. The Commonwealth wants power to nationalize for purposes connected with the development of certain industries of which the iron industry is an excellent type. The iron industry of Australia was supported by the State Government of New South Wales, and is now being subsidized by the Commonwealth, but no one can say that the position of the industry is satisfactory. The Commonwealth Government, for its own purposes, requires thousands of tons of steel rails. It also requires thousands of steel plates for shipbuilding. It requires great guns, and it requires in a dozen different directions the products of an up-to-date iron and steel plant. But the Commonwealth, while it has power to erect a plant to supply its own purposes. Such That is not be justified in erecting such a plant .unless it were able to keep it going all the time. For a plant that could supply the Commonwealth requirements on an economical basis would supply far more than it could consume for its own purposes. Such works must have an opportunity to newspapers. supply, not only the wants of the Commonwealth, but the wants of others, and to do that we must have added power. We have not got the necessary power, but we must have it. Is any one going to say that it would not be a wise But the company buys or business-like proposition to make our way to the electors in this own rails and steel plates? We are buildYet we are told that this ing our own ships, but every ounce of material we use has to be imported or purchased locally under circumstanceswhich mean that the Commonwealth is paying by way of subsidy or concession of one sort or another a great deal more than it should pay. One point more, and I have finished. The Opposition have said that the word "" m o n o p o l y "" is not defined in the Bill, and that it ought to be. I have also seen in the press articles urging that we ought to define in this Bill what we mean by ""monopoly."" With all deference, I cannot agree with that view . 7 It is impossible to insert in the B ill a definition of monopoly that would nor make confusion worse confounded. In Tp.xas, laws have been passed to deal with trusts, combinations, and monopolies, and in one cf those laws an attempt has been Whether it is made to define what a monopoly is. I shall read a few lines of that definition. I could not read it all at this stage, for it comprises over a page of closely printed matter. 2, page 1131, the definition is given as follows :A "" monopoly "" is any union or combination or consolidation or affiliation of capital, credit, property, assets, trade, customs, skill or acts, or of any other valuable thing or possession, by or between persons, firms or corporations or associations of persons, firms or corporations, whereby any one of the purposes or objects mentioned in this Act is accomplished or sought to be accomplished, or whereby any one or more ""->£ said purposes are promoted or attempted to be executed or carried out, or whereby tlie several results described herein are reasonably calculated to be produced; and a ""monopoly"" as thus defined and contemplated includes not merely such combinations by and between two or more persons, firms or corporations acting for themselves, but is especially defined and intended to include all aggregations, amalgamations, affiliations, consolidations or incorporations of capital, skill, credit, assets, property, custom, trade or other valuable thing or possession whether effected by the ordinary methods of partnership or by actual union under the legal form of a corporation, or an incorporated body resulting from the union of one or more diss tinct firms or corporations, or by the purchase, acquisition or control of shares or certificates of slock or bonds, or other corporate property or franchises; and all corporations or partnerships that have been or may be created by the consolidation or amalgamation of the separate capital, slock, bonds, assets, credit, properties, custom, trade or corporate or firm belongings of two or more firms or corporations or companies are especially declared to constitute monopolies within the meaning of this Act, if so created or entered into for any one or more of the purposes named in this Act'; and a ""monopoly"" as defined in this section is hereby declared lo be unlawful and against public policv, anil anv and all persons, firms, corporations or association of persons engaged therein shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a conspiracy to defraud, and shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in this Act. Literal party's policy. pienty of it. Any reasonable man would think that definition sufficient to cover the ground. The average man would say that a monopoly, in order to get through that definition, would have to get up bright and enrly in the morning, but I have not the slightest doubt at all that monopolies have got through it very easily. What would be the position of the unfortunate electors of -Australia if we were to put in front of them such a definition, and to ask them to say "" Yes "" or "" . No "" to the question, "" A r e you in favour of it ? "" I can, in fancy-, feel myself quailing under the caustic castigation of honourable members opposite for attempting to bewilder and delude the unfortunate electors by putting such technical and involved language In Eddy on Combinations, vol. before them. Definitions will not help us. As a matter of fact, a monopoly is something which we all know very well when we see it, but efforts to define a. monopoly only increase the difficulty of understanding and dealing with it . It was said last night that we ought not to have this power, because we propose to exercise it in a way that would be unfair to those from whom we acquired an industry. The honourable member for Kooyong made a strong point of that contention, declaring that there was no provision in the Bill covering good-will, and that consequently we were going to take away from people that which belonged to them, and to pay nothing for it. I do not want to take up the time of the House in dealing at any length with that question. I desire only to say that in my opinion the Bill does provide for good-will being taken over on fair terms. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, volume 3, page 1586, it is laid down that "" Good-will is property."" Potter v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and Ccommissioners of Inland Revenue v. A?igus. I shall quote the decisions shortly. In the case of Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Angus, reported in i-K Q.B.D., 1889, page 590, Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls, saidNow the propertv which was to be conveyed in the present case is a legal property. I have no ' doubt that the good-will of a business is '-'property."" . . . . Then, again, in the last paragraph of the judgment of the Court in Potter v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, reported in Exchequer Reports, volume 1:0, page 158, we have the statement--ounds like the We think that good-will falls under the description of property. T h is B ill provides that The Parliament shall have power to make laws for carrying on the industry or business by or under the control of the Commonwealth, and acquiring for that purpose on just terms any property used in connection with the industry or business. In view of the language of the clause, and the authorities I have quoted, the honourable member's efforts to discredit the proposal now before the House by stating that this party would be guilty of attempting to take that which belonged to another without paying for it, is quite unjustifiable. The language of the clause does not support his contention, and it is not the intention of this party to take property from any one without paying for it. We are asking the House and the country to agree to this proposal. We have not made the request for this power without",49,Distinguished Visitor

216,Mr Hughes,"There is certainlycarefully considering the position, and the necessity for dealing with it. We are satisfied that the several powers for which we are asking are all necessary. We are perfectly satisfied that the power to nationalize is one of the most valuable and essential that could be at the disposal of modern civilized Governments, and we are convinced that the condition of things existing to-day calls for the vesting of that power in this Parliament. We believe that this is a power over which the people will have ample control. It will not be exercised at the mere caprice or fancy of any faction or party. It will not be exercised without consideration and thought.' Rather will it be exercised as the deliberate policy of a party formulated and presented to the people and approved by them. It will be thought over with care, exercised only after careful inquiry into the facts by some independent ""tribunal, and directed against some substantial and overpowering condition of things which does not permit of being dealt with in any other way. In short, this is a remedy to be used with discretion, but a sovereign remedy for a condition of things which defies in very many cases all other attempts at cure. It is a remedy which has been freely used by other Governments. which has been more and more resorted to as the years have gone on. remedy which in the very nature of things will be still more and more resorted to. It is a remedy which the press in 1910 endorsed very strongly. The Age in its issue of 8th December, 1910, said in the course of a leading articleThere is no such objection to the demand for the nationalization of monopolies. To that question the electors will have no hesitation in saying Cook, Joseph ""yes."" With that I entirely agree. It is a message which I trust that great newspaper, and every other great journal in Australia, will send out to the electors. It is one that once having been sent out should not and indeed cannot be recalled. proposal now before us is a facsimile of that put before the people in 1910, save that one alteration has been made in order to meet the objection that without amendment; report adopted. under the power for which we asked we should be able to deal with monopolies put-controlled by State or public authorities, .

In paragraph 10 of their report, however, the Commissioners tell usIn the fresh distribution herein proposed your Commissioners have endeavoured to so adjust the boundaries of the divisions as to include in each division a number of electors approximating as closely as practicable to the ascertained quota of 34,657. In so doing it has been found necessary to increase the number of metropolitan and sub-metropolitan divisions by two, and to correspondingly reduce the number of countrydivisions.

There is an allowance of 15 per cent, by which the Commissioners may either increase or decrease the number as necessity arises; and, in the past, without exception, it has always been decreased in the case of country electorates, and increased in the case of metropolitan centres. This plan, however, has been departed from. The maximum number allowed to the Commissioners was 41,588, and the minimum 27,726; and they could have utilized the difference had they so pleased. But they decided to simply approximate as nearly as possible to the maximum number. In other divisions, the numbers are, in round figures, Barrier, 33,000; Calare, 33,000; Illawarra, 34,000; Robertson, 34,000; 34,000; and so on. I cannot lay too much stress on the fact that Parliament charged the Commissioners to give due consideration to country interests on the various points I have already mentioned, but the Commissioners, by equalizing the figures numerically, have deprived the-country districts of two electorates, and created two new metropolitan electorates. ThisI regard as an outrage on the Act, and as a violation of the intentions of Parliament. the redistribution, the constituencies of Barrier and Darling will comprise more than one-half of the whole area of New South Wales; and I contend, in the presence of the representatives of those electorates, that it will be physically and monetarily impossible for them to faithfull y and honestly represent the whole. To traverse [24232 these electorates would take so long as to leave no time for legislative duties. sired one-vote-one-value, and now he does not like it . lier is wrong. I have always said that while one-vote-one-value is theoretically and morally correct, the policy should always be applied so as to give due consideration to country districts. It is possible to cover a city electorate in a few hours by means' of a cabThe whole of the electors of some citydivisions could be addressed at two or three meetings, but it would take seven months, travelling by motor cars or any other conveyance, to address all the electors of at least two of the New South Wales country divisions. Is that a fair and equitable arrangement of boundaries? In redistributing the electoral divisions of Western Australia and Queensland, due regard was not given by the Commissioners to community of interest and means of communication, and the House returned the Queensland scheme for reconsideration. As a result a second redistribution was submitted, giving'effect to the directions of the Act, and it was adopted. I have pointed out in regard to the New South Wales redistribution thatto give a sufficient number of electors to the Barrier division, the northern portion of the Riverina electorate could have been merged in the Barrier electorate. That arrangement would have studied community of interest, because the district to which I refer is populated largely by a mining community, and contains mining centres such as Mount Hope and GilgunParramatta, 34,000; Lang, yah, and would also have studied the means of communication, because a line is to be taken from Condobolin to BrokenH ill , to link up all these districts. The Riverina division proper would have had its own community of interest, and would have been conveniently served by means qf communication. However, that suggestion was not considered, and the scheme before us gets r i d of the Riverina division altogether. I ask honourable members, should not the Commissioners, in re-arranging the Under boundaries of the divisions of a State, concern themselves with the question : Is the population of certain divisions likely to increase or decrease? Riverina is the only division in the southern part of New South Wales whose population is rapidly growing.

Such a principle is absurd, -and the scheme which was based upon it first saw the light in our State Parliament, where it was brought forward to convenience the representatives of country districts, and not the people generally. I notice that tbe Minister of Home Affairs is again reading the newspaper. If this redistribution scheme be rejected, and no other scheme be submitted to this Parliament for its approval, I shall make charges outside this Chamber which I am not permitted to make here.

In introducing a proposal to the notice of the House, it is usual for a Minister to assign reasons why honourable members should vote for it . A great deal has been said of the provisions which are embodied in our Electoral Act. in regard to community of interest. Community of interest is a matter on which the Commissioners are likely to take a more unbiased view than that held by any individual member here. It is ridiculous to suppose that we can regard these matters from a disinterested and impersonal point of view. If I were making a speech as full of matter on any other subject, what chance would there be of seeing so many honourable members on the benches opposite as there are at present ? It is inherent in human nature to take -a personal view of such a question as that before us, however much we may beat our breasts and declare to the contrary. If it should happen that this second scheme of the Conimissioners is thrown aside, an amendment of the Act will be required to make the decision of the Commissioners absolutely final, a necessity which, in itself, would be deplorable. I like the safeguard which is provided in the ventilation, of the question in this Chamber, but if the opportunity is to be used for the promotion of accidents of the kind contemplated, the only way will be to prevent the recurrence of such eventualities. The people of New South Wales will not quietly sit down, and? permit a vast number of electors to be disfranchised. Under the existing distribution ten country electorates will have approximately the same voting strength as seventeen city electorates -That is to say, that proportion' qf the electors in the cities will be absolutely disfranchised, not by, the removal of one member or another, but through not having equal representation iii this place. I am accordingly reinforced by this fact in demanding that the position may be made perfectly clear as to what is to happen'.

There are 30,000 miners collected around' BrokenH ill , whilst 15,000 agriculturists and I am merely stating pastoralists are spread over the remaining portion of the Barrier electorate.

But I am prepared to accept the reliberately drawn over the actions of the Government, the right is in some considerable danger. If the scheme of the Commissioners is not adopted, the electors of New South Wales, I understand, will have to go to the poll at the next election in the divisions for which they are now enrolled, and, therefore, to place the facts on record, I propose to show the allotment of the electors according to the 1912 enrolment, leaving the. matter then to. the consciences of honourable members opposite. I shall take first the eleven city electorates.

He would like the House to unanimously support the dear brothers of the Labour party ! No definite objections have been urged against the scheme now before us.

The one is a Minister and the other only a supporter, . and, therefore, perhaps in a steadier job. There is, however, nothing justifying the opinion that the transfer of electors from one to the other would be tantamount to their disfranchisement. In the absence of explanation, I am forced to vote for the scheme, because the objections urged against it are almost frivolous, and because if it is rejected there will since it embraces towns with which they do be no equality of representation, so far as New South Wales is concerned, in the next Parliament.

I voted against the last scheme because I thought that it required amendment, but I did not object to it as strongly as I object to this. It gave the country a predominance of representation, if anything, and to-day the cry from one end of New South Wales to the other is "" More representation for the country."" There is talk of a Country party forming there, the people of the country feeling that they suffer from the centralization of everything in Sydney. I am in sympathy with them. We have suffered too much from this centralization, our interests not being understood by the city people. I thought when the last scheme was rejected by the SenateI have quoted the cause it does not change the Senate elecHe torates-that the Commissioners would have amended it in the light of the views' expressed by the majority of the representatives of New South VVales in this House, who voted against it, but they have not done so. I have no personal interest to serve. As a matter of fact, if the scheme now before us is adopted, my majority will be doubled; but I should like to know what community of interest there is between Boggabilla and Glen Innes. The last scheme had regard to community of interest so far as New England was concerned. Of course, every honourable member knows his own electorate best. In the last distribution, there was added to my constituency a piece of country in the north containing a number of small towns, the residents of which have been asking time after time to be transferred to the electorate of New England, business. They have no community of interest with the Richmond division.

From the stand-point of want of community of interest, I have ground for complaining of the way in which my constituency has been redistributed, although I know that the people who have been included within it will treat me well. My chief objection to this redistribution scheme is that under it the country districts of New South Wales would be deprived of two representatives. means greater concentration, and the placing of more power in the hands of the people of Sydney. member of this House, I shall always protest against the domination of the country .by the city. one of those who voted for the last scheme submitted by the Commissioners. so because 1 recognised the difficulties with which the Commissioners were confronted, and also because that scheme preserved the existing representation of the country districts of the State. the Commissioners could increase, as they had to do, the numbei of electors in Eden Monaro without cutting into a large portion of my electorate, and also into the electorate of Werriwa. fore, that, although 1 should suffer under that scheme, the Commissioners had made as fair a distribution as was possible in the circumstances. opinion that the country should be fairly represented. I have always recognised the difficulties connected with the representation of country as opposed to city electorates ; but it comes to me rather as a surprise to learn that an honourable member of the Labour party should be urging the special representation of the country as against the large centres of population, in view of the fact that the Labour party have always endeavoured to lead the electors to believe that they, above all others, support the principle of one man one vote, and one vote one value. I am going to support this scheme, as I supported the last, because I think that under it the Commissioners have given expression, as far as possible, to the principle of one man one vote and one vote equal value. It goes nearer than does any other to the observance of that principle. Underi t an attempt has been made to equalize the voting strength of the electorates to a greater extent than has hitherto Then, again, the Commissioners prevailed. The honourable member for Riverina and others have said that the Commissioners have failed to give effect to the requirement of the Act that, as far as possible, community of interest should be preserved. I agree that every effort should be made, in redistributing the electorates, to observe that principle; but I disagree with those who have said that there is a greater want of community of interest under the scheme now before us than prevails in the electorates as at present constituted, or than existed under the last scheme. By This scheme simply way of example, let me refer to the position of Illawarra. We have along the coast in that constituency the great mining As long as I am a centres and the southern gold-fields of New South Wales. All these are within my electorate, as well as large dairying .districts. Running immediately down the centre of the constituency is the Illawarra dividing range, and no one will say that I did there is any community of interest between the people on the coast and the residents of Moss Vale, Bowral, Mittagong, Camden, Picton, and other towns on the other side of the dividing range. The constituency, I failed to see how however, has remained as it is at present ever since Federation. The honourable member for New England has also shown that there is a want of community of interest in that electorate. It is for those who It appeared to me, thereobject to this scheme, on the ground that it fails to take into account community of interest, to show that it is worse in that respect than is the present distribution. I I have always held the do not hesitate to say that the constituencies as they stand to-day show a greater want of community of interest than exists in connection with the redistribution now before us, or would have existed had the last scheme been accepted. terest is there between Narrandera and BrokenH ill ? of interest between BrokenH ill and other districts included under this scheme in the electorate of Barrier is certainly apparent; but there is just as great a want of community of interest in some of the existing electorates.

339,Mr Fuller,"I am very glad to hear the people proper political representation. I submit that with the constituencies constituted as at present, the people would not be able to secure the representation to which they are entitled if another election took place. It is desirable that we should equalize the constituencies as far as possible within the limits allowed by law, and the proposed distribution would equalize the values of votes in New South Wales more closely than in any other part of the Commonwealth. debate closes the Minister will give us the benefit of the fullest information he has been able to obtain from the officers who are responsible for submitting the present scheme. principle of equalizing the electorates is all very well in theory, but it works out unfairly to the country constituencies, and as a representative of a country electorate I take this opportunity to enter my most emphatic protest against the principles on which the Commissioners have based their redistribution scheme. that the Commissioners shall give due consideration to(a) Community or diversity of interest; (i) Means of communication; («) Physical features; (d) Existing boundaries of divisions; (e) Boundaries of State electorates; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution. But, as is pointed out by the Commissioners, they considered nothing but the quota! They have absolutely ignored their duty to consider the other matters referred to. that ? will find the following statement in paragraph 10In the fresh distribution herein proposed your Commissioners have endeavoured to so adjust the boundaries of the divisions as to include in each division a number of electors approximating as closely as practicable to the ascertained quota of 34,657. In so doing it has been found necessary* to increase the number of metropolitan divisions by two, and to correspondingly reduce the number of country divisions.' That is to say the whole object of the Commissioners was to adjust the boundaries so as to include in each division as nearly as possible the ascertained quota of electors. They are allowed by law a [8.40] -It is amusing to hear honourable margin of 13,800 electors. The quota is members opposite crying out that the coun34,657, the maximum 41,580, and the try electorates are being deprived of minimum 27,726. The margin is fixed so as to allow of the consideration of diversity of interests in the scattered country districts, but the Commissioners have ignored all such considerations, and have endeavoured to make the electorates as equal as possible in regard to numbers. If the present tendency continues, and the population of our great cities increases by leaps and bounds, our country constituents will be deprived of representation to an I hope that before the increasing degree under every distribution. Even under present conditions the country electorates are becoming so large, and the diversity of interest is becoming so great that it is practically impossible to secure adequate representation. The constituency of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro extends from the border to within 50 or 60 miles of Sydney, and the electorate that I represent extends from the Eden-Monaro electorate in New South VVales to within 58 miles of Melbourne, and it will be practically impossible for representatives of such constituencies to attend to the requirements The law requires of those they represent. I heard the representative of a thickly-populated city electorate-wh o evidently did not know what he was speaking about-sa y that it was more difficult to represent a city constituency than a country constituency. I would like the honourable member to have some experience in connection with the representation of my electorate, which is small compared with some of the country constituencies in other States. It is because of the extent to which the interests of sparsely-populated country electorates have been ignored that I enter my strong protest against the principle upon which the Commissioners have formulated their scheme. I am rather surprised to hear some honourable members, who have always been supposed to look after the interests of residents in the country, and who have previously insisted that there should be a smaller numiber of electors in country than in city electorates, strongly advocate the system of equal representation so far as numbers are concerned. Whilst no doubt this principle is all right in theory, and may be carried out where the people are closely settled, it will work great injury if applied to our scattered country districts..",67,Foster Th E Honourable Order To Give Equal Voting Power As Far As

Wethe country districts of New South Wales of two seats, because they directed the Commissioners to redistribute its electoral boundaries in a way which compelled tbem to take two seats from the country and give them to the city. That was unmistakably the argument advanced in both branches of the Legislature on the last occasion, and in obeying that direction the Commissioners have apparently done wrong. It is time this battledore and shuttlecock ceased. It is time that we stopped this consultation of merely party feeling and party interests in the redistribution of the electoral boundaries of the different States. parently is to be the one State which is not to have its electoral inequalities redressed. If this redistribution scheme be rejected we shall go to the country at the next election with huge gaps between some seats and others-one man counting for twice as much as another in the final decision of the people-thus outraging the principle of a Democracy, getting nowhere near a proper redistribution of the electoral strength of the country, and altogether ignoring the democratic voice of the people, which postulates that every man in Australia shall have, an equal say in the direction of public affairs see any possibility of securing another redistribution early cso that it would be of use at the next election, I should not say what I am saying now. But I see no such prospect. tunity we shall have of discussing this matter.

One would imagine that there was something sacrosanct about the Minister from the way in which he brings down these schemes, pitches them on the table, and then goes out of the door. Never has a Minister acted in that way previously. ister who has preceded him has stood up to his task, and urged that the redistribution which he has submitted should be adopted. -do with this scheme.

The way in which he brings forward these Mr Joscfh Cook. proposals is an invitation to the House to reject them. I believe he will be glad if this redistribution 'is rejected just as the other scheme was rejected. It appears to me that the first redistribution was the only possible one having in view the preservation of country interests and the keeping intact of all the country electorates.

I have yet to learn why New South Wales should be singled out for treatment of this kind when every other State has had its disabilities reviewed and redressed. Something ought to be done, and this scheme appears to me to suggest the only method, although there is much in it to criticise, and much, I frankly admit, with which I do not personally agree, and which I do not understand. In the case of my own electorate, I could have arranged it much better than it has been arranged by the Commissioners on this second occasion. I remember the honourable member for Nepean, when the first scheme was before us, suggesting that the fruit and farming district of Hawkesbury should be put into the .Nepean electorate] and this has been done in the scheme now before us, only to a greater degree than then suggested. right out of shape in order to get a huge industrial centre tacked on to the farming and fruit-growing district. not agree with that? orable member agree with it? He did not agree when less was proposed in the last scheme, but fulminated against it in the House. Now, however, that the whole thing has been arranged in such, a way as to give him "" a leg in,"" he sits as silent as the sphinx-no t a word do we hear about any want of community of interests between two sections of the same electorate. fancy that the honourable member has been making recommendations in connection with the redistribution. The singular thing is that if we get the Parramatta newspaper of a week or two ago we can see a paragraph foreshadowing the very distribution that has taken place, and that paragraph is headed, "" Cann versus Cook."" At any rate, there Have been some prophets about who are pretty good at guessing. prophets in Parramatta! Parramatta, apparently. Indeed, I think that a prophet is talking to me now. At any rate, the honourable member for Nepean has got what he desired in this scheme, and it suits him, however it may not suit others. No doubt we could all criticise the scheme, pull it to pieces, and evolve a better one for ourselves if we were permitted; but I doubt if we could get a scheme which, on the whole, would fit the interests of New South Wales in the same way as the last scheme ciid. In that scheme, community of interest was studied, although that may not have been so in one or two instances. However, nothing human is perfect, especially in a redistribution scheme, when there is a wide and diversified area to manipulate and apportion. On the whole, as I have said, the last scheme was the best, consistent with the requirements of the Act, to preserve intact all the country seats; but it was flung out by my honourable friends opposite. Why that was done, I do not know. They never told us, and I have never seen a scheme rejected for less adequate reasons. There was not a weighty argument addressed to the question during the whole time we were considering it ; much more argument has been applied to this, and I dare say with greater reason. But what are we to do? If we throw out The electorate has been pulled this scheme, we shall get no other,'and shall have to be content with the old electorates. We would not be justified, in my judgment, in casting this proposal, which represents our only chance, to the winds, and permitting the present electoral disabilities to remain; and, therefore, with all its faults, the scheme will have my support. marks of the honourable member for Parramatta should not be permitted to pass without comment. Those remarks would have come more appropriately from any other I member in the House but himself, and he should be the last person to utter such sentiments. He has assumed an attitude of lofty principle, and taken a stand on the high ground of ethics in regard to the position of the Minister of Home Affairs and of some members of the Labour party. I do not know anything of the pros and cons of the case, but take it that the members from New South Wales are the most intimately conversant with the situation. The honourable member for Parramatta takes the objection that this redistribution ought to be left in the hands of the Commissioners, and that Parliament ought to have nothing to say. Well, the honourable member was at one time a Minister of the Crown, but he never took any action in that' direction; on the contrary, he presented a spectacle",71,Foster Th E Honourable Order To Give Equal Voting Power As Far As

If I remember rightly, it was the honourable member and the members of his Government who left their own Minister. stranded hopelessly. They thought they were going to lose a seat in Western Australia, and, to preserve their own party, they let their own Minister go on the rocks. That was an ignoble position for a Government to' occupy, and yet the honourable member has the audacity to stand up here to-night and speak as though people had no memories. However, honourable members will doubtless vote as they think fit, and, in any case, this Ministry will not present to the Chamber and the country such a spectacle as was presented by the honourable member for Parramatta and his colleagues. member vote? this stage of the session to occupy time over this or any other question, and when I record my vote I shall be able to satisfy the curiosity of the honourable member for Wentworth. I do not think that the honourable member for Parramatta is quite correct in saying that the Commissioners took their instructions from this House, for, had that been so, they would have kept closer to the redistribution they first submitted. So far as I can remember, the criticism on the last occasion was mainly caused by the fact that the provision of the Act in regard to the consideration of community and diversity of interests had not been strictly adhered to. larly to Werriwa and one or two other electorates where the division seemed to run counter to this-first principle laid down. I intimated that I thought the distribution was one that met all the conditions generally ; but that in some minor details there were faults, which it would be possible to remedy without recasting the whole scheme. At the same time, I supported the proposal because I did not care to take the risk of sending the distribution scheme back, and, perhaps, getting one with which I agreed much less. The present position fully bears out my judgment on that occasion, because the scheme now before us is one of which I approve much less than I did the first one, with all its defects. While I agree that the electorates should, as nearly as possible, have equal voting strength, and should represent living men and women in preference to acres or trees, some regard must be paid to country interests. We have had Federation for less than twelve years, and in that time there have been three distributions in New South Wales, including the one before us. If we adopt the present scheme, it will mean that, as compared with the first division, we shall have sacrificed no 0 fewer than four country electorates, with a corresponding gain to the cities. In the redistribution of 1906, Canoblas, which I represented in the first Parliament, and Bland, which was represented by Mr J. C. Watson, were cut out, and the new electorate of Calare was formed. The State gained a seat by increased population, and the effect of the redistribution was to give two seats to the cities, namely, Cook and Parramatta. The scheme before us proposes to practically repeat that-the country divisions of Riverina and Macquarie being thrown into other divisions, and two fresh city divisions-Botany and Lane Cove-bein g created. If the Commissioners took instructions from the Parliament at all, they took them from the Senate, where the point in sisted on was the need for equal voting power in the divisions. This proposed distribution gives as complete expression to that principle as is possible, the divisions being as nearly as practicable equal in voting power, though the 'result is the disfranchisement of the country to some extent, and the increasing of the representation of the congested metropolis. In the country, long distances have to be travelled by candidates to canvass the electors, and by members to get into touch with On that occasion, I pointed particutheir constituents, and by electors to get into touch with their representatives. Some allowance should be made for this fact, due regard being had to the basic principle of equal representation. The first distribution proposed went as near as possible to meeting these conditions without the cutting out of any country divisions, and it recognised the quota. With asmall re-adjustment of boundaries to secure community of interest, that distribution would have gone further towards securing general approval in country districts than this now before us. But, as the result of the census, all the other States have now been redistributed, and New South Wales should be brought into line with them.

The chief object of this Bill is to safeguard, not only the public health, but the health of immigrants. The present Immigration Restriction Act, under which alone the Government has power to prohibit the landing of diseased persons' in Australia, has proved to be quite inadequate. Its inadequacy has been specially marked whilst the present Government have been in office, owing to the large stream of immigrants that has been pouring into the Commonwealth. The purpose of this measure is a fourfold one. In the first place, it is to prevent the introduction of persons who might communicate disease to others; secondly, it is to prevent the introduction of persons likely to become a burden upon the State; thirdly, it is designed to prevent the introduction of persons who, although not likely to become a burden upon the State, are possessed of defects",73,Foster Th E Honourable Order To Give Equal Voting Power As Far As

Under the existing law considerable difficulty has arisen. Immigrants now coming to Australia may be divided into two classes-thos e who pay the whole of their passage money and those who are assisted by a State Government. It is the practice of State Governments to require those whom they assist to come to Australia to undergo a medical examination before leaving the port of embarkation, but those who come here unassisted-thos e who pay their own passage money-underg o practically no medical examination whatever. only examination to which they are subjected, if they travel by an immigrant ship, is a sort of medical examination, made in accordance with the requirements of the Board of Trade, as they are passing on board. That practically is really not a medical examination. We purpose establishing a Medical Bureau in England, and every person leaving Great Britain for Australia, no matter in what class he travels, will have, on arrival, to produce the certificate of a doctor in the country from which he comes. officers in the different ports? have doctors in various ports of Great Britain, who will be nominated by the medical officer in charge of the Bureau, and it will be necessary for any person coming to Australia from Great Britain to obtain a certificate from one of those doctors. It is not our intention to establish a depfit at the port of departure where intending immigrants to Australia must be examined, because we think it is only fair that, before a man breaks up his home with the intention of coming to Australia, he should undergo a local examination, so that if he is medically unfit he will not be subjected to any hardship. A certificate obtained from the local medical officer will be prima facie evidence of his fitness to land here. It is further provided, however, that it shall be necessary for the doctor on board to personally examine every passenger, whilst they will also be examined when they arrive here. Whilst a person may obtain a certificate of health from a doctor before he leaves Great Britain, and may also pass the medical examination on board ship, we hold ourselves free to return him whence he comes if the medical officer in Australia does not pass him. We think it desirable to provide for a medical examination before an intending emigrant leaves Great Britain for Australia, because if, on arrival here, he were found to be suffering from a disease, the sending of him back might involve some hardship. We retain to ourselves the right to take that action, even if an immigrant passes the examination at Home and the examination on board, but fails to pass the medical examination on arrival in Australia. At the same time, we feel sure that of those who pass the first two examinations very few will have to be returned when they The reach Australia. This Bill is urgent, because we find that the percentage of unassisted immigrants coming to Australia is becoming greater than the percentage of assisted immigrants. I am sure we are all glad that that is so. Until some twelve months ago, the percentage of assisted immigrants was higher than the percentage of unassisted immigrants, so that the greater number of those coming here had undergone some medical examination before they left Great Britain. During last year, however, 51 per cent, of those coming here were not assisted, whilst the remaining 49 per cent, were assisted by the States, so that the greater percentage of the people now landing in Australia have undergone practically no examination whatever before embarking. I am speaking now of those who come from Great Britain. Some immigrants are also coming to Australia from the Continent of Europe; but as the proportion is comparatively small, we do not propose at present to establish a medical bureau save in England, although we shall have power under this Bill to establish bureaux'in other countries. gard to immigrants coming down from the East? sent with those coming from European countries. We require that those coming from countries other than Great Britain shall produce the certificate of the ship's medical officer.

The provision as to the certificate of the ship's doctor is necessary, because a person might pass the medical examination before embarking, and yet develop a disease on the voyage out. There is only one provision to which I desire to specially direct the attention of the House, and that is sub-clause 5 of clause 4> under which we provide that the fee paid by an intending immigrant for a certificate of health shall be refunded to him on his being allowed to enter the Commonwealth. sion of that sub-clause.

However,we intend to make that the maximum, so that doctors appointed by us will not be permitted to charge more than 5s. It is also provided in the Bill that members of the crews of ships coming to Australia, who ai the present time are permitted to land merely because they are members of crews, may be prevented from landing if tbe doctors certify that they are suffering from any contagious disease. Then, again, in the case of Chinese members of crews, who now have the right to land, although we do not take away that right we require that before the men land the captain must provide us with some means of easy identification. I am sorry to say that there are a good many members of ships' crews who suffer from contagious Every diseases, and it is only right that we should have the power to quarantine such men on their ships. I have explained practically the whole of the provisions of the provision with respect to identification ? that, so far as Chinese are concerned, before they are allowed to land, the captain will be required to furnish some means of easy identification. cursory glance it is difficult to ascertain what is the real scope of the Bill.

Although scarcely fee in the threshold of scientific discussion in reA fee of 2s. 6d. should be gard to eugenics had been reached, the Imperial Government rushed in with a Bill which was regarded as a material advance upon all previous measures, but which, when it came to be dealt with in the House of Commons, was in respects amended out of recognition.

The discretion as to where the line shall be drawn is left very much to the medical man, and in some cases will rest upon an officer of Customs. Do we mean that this should be the case? Our present law provides that -an idiot or imbecile may be excluded; but it is now proposed to extend the scope of that provision to embrace a "" feeble-minded person."" scarcely walk down Bourke-street without meeting, in the opinion of some, a "" feebleminded person,"" or ""defective"" within the meaning of this Bill. bers of this House regard those who are politically opposed to them as feeble-minded persons. In the next paragraph it is provided that any person suffering from "" a serious transmissible disease or defect "" may be excluded. Now what is a defect? The grades of human intelligence range from i to 100 in probably every thousand persons in the community. the pupils in the Edinburgh schools are reported to be suffering from ear, nose or throat troubles. makes for the restoration to the normal or tlie mean. If this were not so, human society could not be held together, and the race would gradually die out. There is continuous fighting going on towards the mean. The provisions in the Bill are so drastic and far-reaching that very few of us would care to be an immigrant, and have our mental capacity, or our capacity for transmitting some serious defect, left absolutely to the decision of a Customs, or even a medical, officer. Then, again, it is provided that "" any person suffering from any mental or physical defect"" may be excluded. If is further provided "" that any person suffering from any disability or disqualification which is prescribed "" may be excluded. Does this mean a physical disability or disqualification? All these matters are to be left to the discretion of an officer, and Parliament will not, except through regulations, be permitted to exercise any check whatever. Any efforts ih the direction of protecting our population against the lowering of its physical vitality is to be commended; but the draftsman has gone too far in including within the provisions of the Bill all sorts of defects, some of which are common to average persons one meets in the street. I shall be very pleased to hear what the honourable member for Melbourne has to say with regard to this matter, because I know that, apart from his experience as a medical man, he has given a great deal of consideration to the subjects dealt with in One could the Bill. A ll I can do, under the circumstances, is to suggest that we should exercise reasonable precautions. I am inclined to think that it is proposed to go too far. According to my reading, where defects such as those mentioned in the Bill exist, the vitality of the people is not so great, but nature, in her unerring way, rectifies the evils we are seeking to remedy by legislation. In one line Max Nordau has shattered the ex cathedra statements of some so-called experts in dealing with these matters. In endeavouring to exclude those who ought not to be admitted, the Minister is going entirely beyond the bounds of reasonable necessity. I would like to know whether these provisions have been taken from legislation passed in other parts of the world. States of America work on the same lines. whether aU these grounds of exclusion have been adopted in Canada. I admit that I have not had time to examine Canadian legislation, and all I can do is to utter a word of caution to the House not to rush into scare legislation of this class without a thorough knowledge of its scope. I did not expect this Bill to be brought on to-ndght. AlthoughI agree with much that has been said by the honourable member for Angas, I am pleased that the Government have introduced the measure. If the BiU were to be taken literally, scarcely 5 per cent, of the population of Australia would be eligible as immigrants. There is no doubt that our policy should be to make Australia an example to the world in the matter of health, both mental and physical. But we must proceed circumspectly.

We are not showing them the same consideration that we now give to a horse, a cow, or a dog, and an assurance from the Minister that he would be in a position to order into quarantine a person suffering from temporary illness, so that he might be afforded opportunities for treatment and recovery, would greatly relieve my mind. say that if the Quarantine Act does not posed provide for it we shall provide for it in regard to the Act this Bill. ister is in thorough sympathy with me. the Of course, medical men sometimes make ""prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited. mistakes.

I am sure that the Minister strongly desires to make the measure one which will reflect credit on Australia. -Nobody can find fault with the Minister of External Affairs for endeavouring to do what he can to prevent Australia being burdened unduly by those who are affected with permanent disease which is likely to inflict injury upon our own people.

Will it be possible for the Minister to determine that a person is suffering wealth until five years after the expiration from tubercular disease?

That was settled by the Defence Department, and the matter was referred to the Attorney-General, but for four or five months it has been, like Mahomet's coffin, in mid-air.
