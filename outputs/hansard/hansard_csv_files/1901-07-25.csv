3,Mr Speaker,""" The increasing employment of coloured labour on subsidized mail steamers."" Five honourable members having -'risen in their places, Question proposed. of those who think that the power to adjourn the House should be taken advantage of very sparingly by honorable members, but it seems to mo that in respect of the question that I am bringing up on this occasion, there is justification for directing immediate public attention to the increasing effect that seems to be likely to follow from the employment of coloured labour, especially on the mail boats that this Commonwealth subsidizes, or will have to subsidize. Por many years past there has been an agitation among a great number of people against the continued employment of coloured races' on mail boats, and I think that, at one of the postal conferences some years ago, a resolution was come to that steps should be taken in respect to any future contracts entered into with the various steam-ship companies to insert a clause to provide against the employment of these people objected to. Stepsi n that direction were, I think, taken by the then Postmaster-General' of New South Wales on behalf of the other Postmasters-General to obtain from the British Government their concurrence-in view of the fact that they contributed towards the subsidy. Of course, the main point of objection was to tbe crews with which the P. and O. boats were manned. Por some years previous to that, in fact ever since the know atfchepresent moment of any other of Orient Company started opposition to the P. and O. Company, the former company had been employing white labour, and at the same time hod to compete against the P. and O. Company, whose crews were composed almost entirely of lascars. think the only exceptions so far as the P. and 0. boats were concerned were in respect to the engineers and officers and quartermasters, who were Europeans. Well, I am sorry to say that the Fostmaster' General of New South Wales was not on that occasion able to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies or the British Postmaster-General of the necessity of taking steps in the direction desired; and only very rosently a development has occurred which seems to point to such serious consequences that the whole ground may very well be covered again, and the question rc-opened. We have to consider thafc this is a question affecting not only those who travel by the mail' boats between here and the old land, but one which very materially affects the conditions of employment of seamen right along the Australian coast. We now insist, and, I think, very properly, that seamen and other maritime workers engaged along the Australian coast shall be employed under something like fair conditions, and at fair rates of wages, and I am glad to say thafc fche colonial steam-ship owners have been extremely reasonable in meeting fche men, afc any rate during the last year or two, with fche result thafc we have as good conditions obtaining along our coast as exist in any parfc offcheworld. The importance of this new development;-in ' which the Orient Company have apparently afc last had to succumb fco fche . competition of fche P. and O. Company in respect to fche employment of coloured labour-affect s every seaman on the coast, because these mail steamers compete is regard to the passenger traffic to a large extent, and 'in a lesser degree, perhaps, in respect to the carriage of cargo, with fche vessels on fche coast owned by our own people and manned by white labour. If we are to have an extension of this new development to fche whole of the vessels employed byfcheOrient Company in fche Australian mail service, ifc seems almost; a certainty that the other lines of steamers trading with fche old country, which are not subsidized, will be also compelled to follow suit. .1 do not the regular liners trading between here and fche old country, such as the Lund line or fche two White Star lines, that are employing anyfching-bufc white labour-as far as I know fchey are employing white labour only. It dqes I seem, therefore, that apart from the question as it affects our citizens, who become passengers to Europe, we are interested by reason of fche competition' between these vessels and our own coasters in insuringfchafcthose who own the coastal vessels should not have to compete on an unfair footing with these steamers manned by coloured races. The developmentfcowhich I have referred is the fact thafc the Orient Company has at' least one vessel on the. coast .manned almost entirely by lascars: We have heard this development attributed fco fche Admiralty regulations governingfcheaddition of vessels to fche naval reserve, but I dissent from",14,Adjournment
4,Mr Watson (Bland),"I am onethat view altogether. It was stated that because the Admiralty regulation regarding vessels attached to the naval reserve, or classed as Admiralty cruisers, provided that a certain proportion of the crews of such vessels must be British subjects, that therefore the Orient Company were discarding their white crews with the view to the employment of British subjects only in the persons of lascars. I do not think that argument will hold water for a moment, in view of the fact known to. myself and others who are interested in shipping matters, thatfchewhole of the men who were employed on the Orient Company's boats, and who, I am glad to say, are still employed onfchemajority of them, are British subjects. The stokers and engineers, and fche whole offchedeck hands on these boats, with few exceptions, have been British subjects up to tbe present time, and therefore the argument that tbe Orient Company has been driven to' this course by the Admiralty regulations is altogether beside the question, points of view. In Queensland also, some time in my view; and the -whole thing narrows itself down to the fact that the Orient Company after a struggle extending over many years, during which they have been anxious to properly preserve the British seamen as a class and keep them from absolute extinction-whic h seems to be the way fchey are going, under the present policy of tlie British people-ar e now driven by the fierce competition of many other lines, and especially of the P. and 0. Company, to employ coloured labour. Tbe P. and O. Company has been allowed for years to continue, even with the subsidies thafc were paid, to employ lascars at very low rates of wages, and not only at low rate of wages, but under conditions as to air space and accommodation under which the Board of Trade will not allow any white man to work. The Board of Trade have passed a regulation, under the Merchant Shipping Act, governing the minimum air spaces to be allowed for each seaman on a vessel, but unfortunately the P. and O. Company have been enabled fco avoid these regulations, in the past -althoug h I believe there is an attempt now being made to compel them to abide by them-o n the ground that the' people they employed were not subject to the Acti n the way that white men were. In spite of this the Orient Company have continued to employ white men, and now we have the development; in the shape of one boat afc least, probably as the precursor of others, with a lascar crew. I contend that, notwithstanding that these lascars are British subjects, we have the right to object to anything that will have fche effect of lowering the tone of the race generally or will have the effect of unfairly competing with our own citizens who are already employed on the coast. And if we give a certain subsidy to the various vessels engaged in carrying the mails, surely we have a right to insist upon the conditions which shall obtain. I might direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that in New Zealand fchey now have a section in the law-I forget the name of the Act-whic h governs the letting of postal contracts, providing in so many words thafc any vessel which receives a subsidy must; employ white labour only. There is no possibility of the money of the New Zealand Government being used forfcheemployment of a race which is objectionable from many ago, the Government had a clause inserted in tbeirmail contracts, I believe, which precluded the possibility of tbe employment of coloured labour on the mail steamers; but I understandI speak subject to correction by those who are better acquainted with the local details-that the action taken in Queensland at fche time that fche clause was inserted, was the direct consequence of the proved unreliability of these lascars in time of peril and trouble. Most honourable members will probably recollect fche circumstances attendingfchewreck of the Quetta on fche Queensland coast, arid I understand that it was because of the behaviour of the lascars on that British-India boat on thafc occasion that the Queensland Government were forced by public opinion in that State to take steps to prevent the repetition of such a scene in connection with subsidized mail boats. I do not wish to say a great deal with respect fco the behaviour of the crew on that occasion, but ifc is well known that fche boats were rushed by the lascars, and that a very poor' chance was given to women and children and other passengers, probably unable to take care of themselves, to save their lives. stricken. stricken and rushed the boats. I have another instance in my mind. I think it was in the case of the steamer Deuccm in",15,Adjournment

6,Mr Watson,"Yes ; they were panicthe Red Sea, where an almost similar set of circumstances occurred, and the whole evidence goes to prove that, while for the mere purpose of stoking or doing casual work in fine weather, these lascars may be fairly efficient, it is certain that in time of stress and trouble-which thing in the way of stamina, and coolness, and courage is required-they are wanting, and it does seem to me that we, who participate in any proceeding which encourages the employment of that class of men in duties of this sort, .are certainly moral participators in the responsibility, which must be shouldered by those who have charge of these affairs. ""We hear constant complaints in the magazines and other thoughtful about the disappearance of the purely British seaman, not only in the old land, but also on our own coast. Other nations, I am glad to say, take a little livelier interest in the encouragement of their marifcimepopulations. We do not find, as far as Germany is concerned, that her subsidized mail boats employ other than her own citizens, and in respect to America they put a clause in their Acts, which govern the granting of subsidies to mail steamers and others working under their flag, that they must employ at least a certain proportion of their own subjects before they are eligible to claim any subsidy. me that, apart from the question of the competition that our own steam-ship owners and our own seamen have to put up with, we have a right from the point of view of the encouragement sailors who form an important port of our population, ence shall be given to their One reason why I bring the matter up at this stage is that recently we saw adopted in another place a provision, in respect to this very subject, and I am sorry to' say, that as far as we have been able to glean the intentions of the Government, it does not seem that they are prepared to take any steps in the direction indicated. reason which actuated me in bringing forward this matter to-day was a desire to emphasize the new development. bad enough in all conscience whilethe thing was confined to one particular Large company as that is, still it only did a fraction of tbe business that was transacted throughout Australasia but when we see f the sheet-anchor of white employment disappearing, and the Orient Company forced Mr Watson. to give in to the severe competition with which it has had to contend, surely it becomes a matter for tlie reconsideration of the Government whether they shall not take some steps to preclude the possibility of the further extension of this evil. I is the time when everyhave no desire to weary the House with anything more on the subject; but I do ask the serious .and earnest consideration of honourable members to the danger that seems to be before us in respect to the employment of these lascars. Especially do I ask the Government to reconsider their position beforefchePostal Bill comes on for discussion in this House; and that an opportunity may be given honourable members of projournals nouncing in favour of a white Australia, so far as our maritime population, as well as that within the borders of the Commonwealth itself, is concerned.

There are taking that opportunity, I thought he was treating the honourable member for Blandi n rather a shabby manner, but now that I understand that there was no intention to do so I desire to apologize. Like the leader of fche Opposition, I must certainly enter my protest against the continued suspension of the standing orders. It is one of the most dangerous practices that any assembly can fall into. In the early history bf this Parliament ifc was overlooked, on the ground that"" the standing orders wei-e new, and thafc honourable members were unfamiliar with them. But; when once the provisional standing orders were placed upon the table of the House the genei'al impression was that ifc would be wise not; to allow of their suspension so frequently. There-is another serious point which suggests itself to my mind in connection with the suspension of the standing orders in the present instance. The House has already come to a deeision upon the motion submitted by the honourable member for Bland. Now, without any attempt to rescind that decision, we are about; to re-open the question. I am sorry that this difficulty has arisen. I should like to It is a suggest that seeing that a mistake has been made, unwittingly on the part of the Prime Minister, ifc would have been a wise course -for him to ask the permission of tlie House to say a few words in reply. out the suspension of the standing orders. avoided the suspension of the standing orders.

41,Mr Speaker,"There are two ortwo standing orders the matter of urgency. Standing Order No. 38, which permits of an informal discussion for the purpose of dealing with a definite matter of urgent public importance, which the honourable member raising it must state and hand in to fche speaker. The other standing order is No. 407, which statesIn cases of urgent necessity any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended for the day's sitting on motion duly made and seconded, without notice : Provided that such motion is carried by an absolute Miujorifcy offchewhole number of the members of fche House. In both these cases clearly, I think, according to the intention of the standing orders, and clearly according to tlie practice, so far as laid down in them, and so far as our practice member for Kennedy, that the Prime goes-clearly, according to fche standing orders and our practice the responsibility of determining whether a question is or is not urgent, rests on the honourable member who moves tbe motion. Naturally he knows more about fche question than any other honourable member, and if an honourable member, be be Minister or private member, rise to move a motion which can only be moved as one of urgency, then urgency is at once presumed. under Standing Order 38, urgency has been presumed ; members have risen in support of the motion, the debate has proceeded; and even to-day the same thing has heen done. In regard to tlie suspension of the standing orders, urgency has been presumed from the very fact that under the necessary plea of urgency been moved; therefore', the practice I propose to follow is that wherever under fche standing orders a member, Minister or otherwise, presumes that a matter is of urgent necessity, requiring action under the standing orders, that urgency will be admitted so far as I am concerned, and I do not think the Chair ought to challenge it. If tlie House chooses to challenge ifc that is another thing, but tlie way"" the House can challenge it, in tbe case of Standing Order 38, is first by refusing to rise in support of the urgency, and, under Standing Order 40, by the majority of the whole House required under the clause to suspend the standing orders, refusing to give their concurrence. Kennedy has raised two points, first, as to whether the motion proposed is not a rescission of a previous question. I maintain Mr Speaker. which refer to that ifc is not a rescission. The previous The first is motion wasThat the House do now adjournsome half an hour ago. "" The motion which will be before the House, if the Suspension of the standing orders is agreed to, isThatfcheHouse do now adjournat a quarter past three, or such other time as it shall be put. That is no more a rescission of the previous motion than a motion carried at ten or eleven o'clock to-night thafc the House do then adjourn, would be a rescission of the vote taken now. MrV . L . SOLOMON -What is the motion now ? in a moment. The further and only other point is a . suggestion by the honourable Minister might have spoken tofchemotion by leave of the House. I would remind that honourable member that fche Prime Minister did propose to speak to the motion, by leave of fche House, but that leave was refused by one honourable member, leave always being refusable by any one honourable member who chooses so to refuse' it .

That was put forward as a reason for this particular motion being carried. Por myself I was rather expecting tlie New South Wales practice, or custom, to be followed, namely, thafc a number of honourable members, if there were a difference of opinion, would get up and say what they wished to say before fche Prime Minister replied. That has been tbe custom in New South Wales, though ifc is nofc a practice laid down; but in any case I trust, as there seemsfcohave been an error, the House will carry the motion, and that the Premier will make the statement he desires to make on behalf of the Government. think any honourable member of the House can have the faintest desire to prevent that which is aimed at by the motion /",20,Personal Explanation

44,The Honourable Member For Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I do nofcof the Prime Minister. No one could wish that after an honourable member of the House has made a statement on an important question, that the Prune Minister who as we now see was by mere inadvertence deprived of the opportunity of speaking, should not be debarred from replying. I wish it to be distinctly understood that my only desire was that, as these are matters which are bound in the future to be of very great importance we should have a practice clearly settled I certainly intend to support the motion. I wish, however, to point out that there is one thing that the suspension of tbe standing orders cannot do, so far as I can see. The motion of tlie honourable member for Bland having been negatived, cannot be put before us again. There are a number of things we can do by the suspension of the standing oi'ders, but we cannot undo some things unless, as I suggest, the Prime Minister includes in his motion something that will have the effect of doing that. The mere suspension of the standing orders, so far as I can see, will not do that. motion to be made. the honourable member has used might be taken as sufficient. This is one of the awkwardnesses of the situation-namely , thafc tbe discussion has been closed and the House has decided, so that something more is required than to merely move the suspen-. sion of the standing orders. However, I shall co-operate with the Prime Minister in every possible way, in order to give him the opportunity he wishes.

Therefore, tbe re-opening of the discussion carries with it all that follows the discussion,. and must therefore carry with i tfcheputting of the motion.

56,Motion By Mr Watson,"External Affairs) -The honourable member for Kennedy is right in saying that under the practice of New South ""Wales, with which many of us are better acquainted than with the practice in the other States, it is customary for a Minister' who can speak only once on a motion for adjournment, before he exercises his f u l l right of speech, to hear, what has to be said, or at any rate enough to enable him to gather the scope of the question. I intended to follow that course, and I was taken by surprise by the putting of tlie question. As to this matter I do not intend to detain the House at any length, but simply to put myself right with honourable members lest it might be supposed I was not considering the question or not giving sufficient attention to the views put forward by the honourable member who raised it . The Government are aware of the proceedings at the Postal Conference to which reference has been made, and our attention has been called to tbe recent development of which the honourable member speaks. There was a statement in tlie newspapers-though , of course, I cannot guarantee its accuracy-to the effect that the Orient Company are yielding either to competition of to some other influence, and are likely to employ a considerable number of coloured labourers in the working of their ships. All that can be done by the Government in a case of this kind is to regulate those matters in which as a Government they have control. In all matters in which this Government has control it will certainly use its best influence to prevent any employment of coloured labour that can be avoided. In the contracts with the companies which are carrying the mails, there are some difficulties. We in Australia ate not the only parties to the contracts. The Imperial Government, as well as the companies concerned, are parties as well as ourselves, and tbe difficulty which arose to which the honourable member for Bland ""has alluded, was due to this very fact-that , while there was a readiness here to exclude the employment of black labour from shipscarrying specified mails, there was not the same readiness on the part of fche Imperial authorities, who thought these matters could not properly be included in a mail contract. No doubt their rigid adherence to what are considered their -fiscal principles might to some extent impel them to such a conclusion, but the difficulty was that fche contract could not be carried out, or rather, hedged round in the way we desired at this end, because there was nofcfchesame readiness at the other end. There are many matters in which this restriction does not prevail, and in respect to those matters we shall, as I said, take such a course as will minimise the employment of coloured labour. Theni u reference to mail contracts-another factor has yetfco be considered, namely, that the boats which carry the mails carry them in fche main, between Australia and another country, which is an equal participant in the contract, and the views of which are equally entitled to be respected, and which, on the whole, has the greater power. think there was sufficient firmness in fche application made last time on behalf of the colonies 1 was. We must always expect such a difficulty as has arisen, from the fact that the bulk of the journey is between two countries equally participant i nfchebenefits, and one of which countries has, in matters of this kind, ultimately the greater power. On fche other hand, ifc may be as the honourable member has suggested, that sufficient firmness was nofc exercised. There is always the consideration to be faced that in respect to postal contracts regulations dealing with the class of labour to be employedI am talking of oversea contracts has not hitherto been generally considered to be within the scope of the Postal department. NowI admit thafc, notwithstanding the past, it is possible to take further steps and to bring about, I think, a larger measure of success in these matters, because I take it that the minimising of this class of labour is fche success we shall be united in desiring. So far as T am concerned, that is my desire and my object, a*id I hope that in future contracts we shall be able to provide that this class of labour shall be discontinued on the ships which carry the mails. I only wish to point outfchedifficulties in order to show fco the House that the matter is not so easy as may be generally supposed, notwithstanding our strong good-will towards the object which the honourable' member for Blaud has in view. So far as 1 am concerned, notliing will please me better than to endeavour to bring about thafc object.

Now, there is some which will minimize, if they cannot utterly difficulty arising from the fact that lascars do away with, this class of labour on are, I believe, very numerously employed on sucli journeys. So far as I am concerned, the P. and O. boats if that class of labour can be totally done away with I shall be the better pleased. The honourable member for Bland has pointed out one or two reasons besides racial reasons for his motion. He has instanced certain cases in which coloured labourers have given way to panic in times of stress and disaster. Of course we know that panic is unfortunately a universal accident on occasions, but I believe fche people of our own race are not so liable fco ifc as are coloured races, and there is a .good deal of reason i u what the honourable member has put forward. Taking the whole question, the honourable member may rest assured of the mail service to India% co-operation and support offcheGovernment. It rests with the Government to take the any distinct line in connection with the initiative in matters of this kind, and when, actual trade that is carried on by these the question is re-opeued, the honourable steamers, because, up to a certain point, the member may take it for granted tbe Governtrade is of a general character.

That creates a considerable difficulty in the way of tbe Government as far as the P. and 0. Company is concerned. As far as the Orient Company is concerned, the question is a simple one, but this difficulty arises with them-that if a rival company trading to Australia, such as the P. and O. Company are allowed to employ coloured labour, the claim of the Orient Company to use this labour becomes very strong. I only moke these few observations with a view to emphasize whatfchePrime Minister has saidas to the great difficulty of getting at what I feel sure everymember of this House desires. Buti t will greatly strengthen the Prime Minister when he knows that he has practically a united House behind him in this matter. fche leader of fche Opposition go the length of excluding the products of coloured races 1 the member for New England, who is generally inclined to save time, and is conservative in his ideas, should nofc throw out a bone of contention of thafc sort. I think the Prime Minister unnecessarily referred to this as a fiscal matter, but I wish the Prime Minister to remember that, as far as the British flag is concerned, ifc is nofc a fiscal matter, bceause ifc endeavours to give the utmost; amount of freedom beneath its folds to men of every race, and every colour, and every creed. It is nofc a fiscal matter i nfchafcsense, and as far as we are concerned in Australia tlie honourable member for New England must know well that the foremost men in Australia who lnv\e grappled with this question of the introduction of coloured races were men like Sir Henry Parkes and the others who followed him. I had the honour of carrying au Act which dealt with the restriction of tbe immigration of coloured races generally, whilst Sir Henry Parkes brought forward legislation dealing with the restriction of the introout one or two matters in connection duction of Chinese into Australia. Therefore, I think thafcfcherecord of the party fco which I belong, in the matter of legislation to keep out coloured races, and prevent them from mixing with our race, is a very good one. herefcomix with us at all j they only help to bring goods here for our consumption. ber drinks tea, although ifc is grown in China. Why does not the honourable member draw the line at Chinese tea, and drink colonial beer 1 I will guarantee that with all the fiscal views of my honourable friend, you will often see him drinking British beer, .but you will never see him by any chance drinking a glass of the colonial article. That is a matter of white labour entirely ; but as for colonial labour; I do not think there is a bigger tea drinker in Australia than the honourable member for New England. When he is drinking the beverage is there never a cloud passing over his mind as to the horrible depravity of drinking tea made .of an article thafc is grown in a place inhabited by coloured people, which is manufactured by coloured jieople, and which comes greatly into competition with colonial beer ? fco say a word or two witb reference to the matter to which the honourable member for Bland has calledfcheattention of the House. I was very glad to hear from the Prime Minister that he propose-i to take steps at au early date' to, as far as possible, restrict tbe employment of coloured labour. I understand from what be saysfchafchis attitude is simply one which is limited as far as fche complete abolition of coloured labour is concerned by the fact that Great Britain herself is a partner in the postal contracts, and necessarily may limit his actions in fchafc direction, and in certain other ways. I did understand-althoug h it is obvious I must have been misinformed-that tbe Prime Minister's colleague in the Senate expressed an opinion altogether afc variance with, or afc any rate not nearly so hopeful as, that which he has himself given us to-day. I understand that the Postmaster-General was questioned as to his intention in respect to this matter, and that he declared that tiie Government could nofc see its way at all to deal with ifc, and I am now very glad to know either that I was misinformed, or that the Prime Minister has seen the better way. I would like to be able to point with this question, and I do so because I have some acquaintance with the subject.

We see foreign subsidized mail steamers coming into our ports, and we shall not find in one of them one man who is not a native, or at any rate a naturalized, subject of the country which pays the subsidy. The Messageries Maritiraes employ all French sailors-the stokers, I admit, are men from Africa. The Nbrddeutscher Lloyd steamers, and the Japanese mail boats, are all manned with natives of the respective countries to which the vessels belong, withfcheexception, in the case offcheJapanese boats, offchequarter-masters. Now, it is a notorious fact, as fche honourable member for Bland has pointed out,fchafcthe lascars have nothing to recommend them, except, perhaps, a docility that is absent in the Britisher, and a picturesqueness which, although afc other times ifc is doubtless effective enough, does nofc appeal fco one in a time of danger. The fact that these lascars are British subjects, I admit, opens up a very big question, ""but it is one which I am very certain thafc our fellow subjects in Great Britain would nofc for a moment view with equanimity if they were face to face with the same imminent danger thafc presents itself to us. To the Englishman, the coloured man is an object of interest, and not of danger or menace afc all. He is a man who ""is to be found so seldom that he is an object of curiosity, and I will venture to say that nofc one Englishman in every hundred residing in Great Britain bas ever seen a coloured man of any sort or kind. Therefore I am not at ali influenced by the fact that the Imperial Parliament opposesfcoour demand some sort of decision that does not accord withourown views. The Imperial Parliament has never had to face fche Imperial constituencies on this matter. Britisher knows of the coloured man is fche part he played in bringing about a spectacular effect in connection with the jubilee and other processions. We, however, have to deal with him as he is, as a competitor-as a hawker, and in other avocations. We know how dangerous he is. We know what an insidious and tireless competitor he is. He has an}' number of virtues, which I am not slowfco-recognise, but we are not concerned with his virtues. We know that he is a competitor who has a tendency to lower the industrial, moral, and social tone of the country, and for thafc reason I am opposed to his employment. I wish to point out to honourable members thafc this question is now becoming a matter concerning nofc Australia only, but the Empire, and I wish to quote upon this subject a very excellent authoritya man whose word in this particular should go for more than that of anybody else. I refer to Lord Brassey. His remarks on the lamentable and deplorable falling away of fche element of the purely British seaman in the mercantile marine of Great Britain are worth noting. He says thatIn the mercantile marine the number of British seamen is diminishing year hy year, and unless steps are taken to prevent ifc they will diminish still more rapidly iu the future. I have here a table showing bow the number of British seamen has diminished from the year 1891 to the year 1896, and I find that under uo age from 15 fco over 50 has. there been an increase in tbe number of British seamen, either per cent, or actual; whilst in nearly every one there has been a substantial decrease. I find that the whole of the British seamen rated as belonging to some British port---that is, bo'rn in the British Isles-numbe r 115,824, ancl the British seamen not otherwise defined number 4,368. The colonies supplied 4,621 foreign countries, 27,446 : and lascars and Asiatics made up a total of 27,911. These figures show 55,000 foreigners, including lascars, out of a total of 180,000 British seamen. The foreigners are not even naturalized. I think thafc these figures present a most deplorable outlook ; and the position of affairs which they disclose is becoming worse every year Lord Brassey thought'so much of this matter thafc he called a conference in Melbourne in 1S96, at which all masters of ships lying in port were asked to be present. Apparently the result All fche of the conference, according to the Naval Annucd, page 106, was a statement fchafc whether the seamen were Britishers, Scandinavians, or Dutchmen was a matter of no concern to the ship-owner as a man of business. Lord Brassey' points out, however, what a matter of vital interest ifc is to the nation, ancl I do nofc think any one will deny fchafc. Prom the stand-point of the man of business, ifc does nofc matter whether a man is a Britisher, a Scandinavian, or a lascar; but in time of trouble it will be better for these men of business to have their marine manned by British seamen than that they should perhaps lose their avocation ancl their marine as well. The employment of British seamen is an insurance fund against risk in time of clanger. Ifc is not to be supposed that the foreigner will fight for a country in the same way as a native of it . That is an absurd supposition, ancl I do nofc suppose any one would contend thafc the lascars like us so much that at a time of great danger they would come to our aid. I am not referring to such a time of national danger as we have just passed through in connection with the South African war, but I have in my mind a great European crisis when the hands of England will be full. Isi t to be supposed that in sucli an emergency we shall turn to the lascars for support and protection 1 Shall we nofc rafcher be afraid that they will be found amongst our enemies instead of amongst our friends 1 A t least that is a fair supposition. Now this matter of finding seamen for the mercantile marine is becoming so serious that in the JVavcd Annual of 1891 it is pointed out that 50 years ago there were 200,000 British seamen in the mercantile marine, whereas to-day we have scarcely half thafc number; thafc is a reduction of 50 per cent, in 50 years, and it is a very seiious the position of the whole of our mail conthingfcocontemplate. Ifc is onewhich the ship-owners, however, apparently regard only from fche .stand-point of commercial gain. labour is, in the first place, to lower the inI rejoice that this matter has passed over dustrial standard, to lower the standard of living, fco lessen tlie intensity offchedemand for better navigation laws, and generally to institute a condition of things which is highly objectionable to the passengers who have to travel by sea, and, in addition, to fche nation at large. I only wish to say in conclusion that I think it will be a very unfair thing-seein g that now the ocean-going companies are competing with the local companies in carrying Inter-State traffic ancl passengers-to ask fche local companies fco pay men at the rate of £ 6 or £ 7 per month, and allow the P. and O. boats to cany men whom they pay 30s. per month. Viewed from any stand-point one pleases, it is a highly objectionable condition of things; but I am pleased to hear from fche Prime Minister thafc he proposes afc an early date fco deal with fche matter. I hope thafc he will nofc allow anythingfcohinder him from going as far as he has indicated to-day. entirely approve of the course the Prime Minister proposes to take, and my objection to his attitude in tbe first instance arose from that of cheapness 1 What does the agent tbe impression thafc he intended to give us nothing more than a mere explanation. I objected fco that; but when he told us that he proposed to re-open the whole question I was delighted, and I am glad that ifc has been re-opened. I view witb the greatest possible apprehension the advent of coolie labour to the Orient Company's boats. Ifc seems to me that the matter is assuming so serious an aspect fchafc fche Government should take it up with some degree of firmness, put its foot down sternly, and say, "" As we subsidize these boats to the extent that we do, we shall take care that our own race is not excluded from employment on board them."" That is the serious aspect of the question.' It would not be so bad if these steam-ship companies employed either black or white labour indiscriminately, but in employing black labour they go further than thafc, and discriminate i u favour of black labour. In effect-they say that they will not have white -> labour to do this particular kind of work. Ifc seems to me thatfcheychallenge tracts and the entire sentiment of tlie States when they take up an aggressive attitude of that kind, because I cannot The effect of employing coloured describe it as anything else but aggression. fco the Commonwealth, because I believe that the Commonwealth Government will be able to take up a stronger attitude than we were formerly able to adopt through the medium of our postal conferences. We used to meet from time fco time, and invariably when we met we discussed this question of coloured labour. So surely as we discussed ifc, we found that our views had to be subject to a compromise. We could not do anything such asfcheCommonwealth Government will be able to do. I do not think there would be any serious consequence if the Government put their foot down firmly and said, once and for a l l "" Our labour must not be excluded from these boats."" That is the attitude we should take up. Ifc is uot so much a question of black labour being employed, but that white labour is being pushed off these boats. That is the grievance we should take the earliest possible opportunity of remedying. I do not agree with the honourable member for .Bland that fche Orient Company, is being d ri ven, by stress of competition, to employ black labour on their boats.

Under such circumstances ifc behoves every honourable member of this House, and every individual in this country to take warning by the Motion of the ship-owners in this particular connection. A little while ago the employment of black labour was confined to one or two companies. Now, owing to competition, another company follows their example. But, if it is a reasonable thing that these companies should be allowed to make bigger dividends by the employment of coloured labour on their ships, why should we not allow the same thing in connection with our coastal steamers 1 Without going any further into this matter, because we shall have an opportunity of dciling with ifc later on, I wish heartily to congratulate the Prime Minister on the statement which he has made this afternoon, that he will endeavour to deal with it in a way that will be creditable not only to the Government, but to the country generally. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am indeed pleased that the leader .of the democratic party in this House, the honourable member for Bland, should have risen this afternoon to move the adjournment in order to call attention to a growing and intolerable evil. the time has arrived when something should be done to give the white man in Australia a chance. It is gradually becoming a black man's country. Every time that the democrats of Australia attempt to do something to put the white man on a level of equality with the gentleman' of colour, a wire comes from across the continent, saying-""You must not interfere withfcheBritish subject."" I suppose that if 50 or 60 of these coloured gentlemen were to knock a man down and kick him, the answer would be"" you must nofc interfere, because they are British subjects."" United States? Mr O'MALLEY -Shoot them. I am very glad thafc my honourable friend has southern states were forced upon them 200 years ago by the merchants of Liverpool. The commercial age demanded it, and to-day the American people have to face one of the greatest problems of the age through the commercial sordidness of England 200 years ago. I am pleased fco think that the Prime Minister is the right man in the right place, because he is a trueblooded Australian, and wants to keep Australia for the white man. Mr W. H . GROOM (Darling Downs) I desire to say that I am very much pleased thafc the honourable member for Bland should have brought this question before the House. I had a conversation with some honourable members the other day in relation to it. This question bas been before the people of Queensland both at general elections and also particularly before its Legislature, and the unanimous opinion is that all ships coming to Queensland which are subsidized by the Government should carry none but white sailors. We had a most painful illustration of the undesirableness of lascar crews, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Bland-in the unfortunate wreck of the Quetta. The terrible scenes which were witnessed On that occasion, and the way in which fche women and children were thrust aside in order, that the lives of these lascars might be saved, sent a thrill throughoutfchewhole of Queensland, and the Legislature demanded that there should be no more lascar crews employed upon steamers subsidized by the Government. There is no question now that fined to one race? MrW . H . GROOM I do not say that ifc is. I am only mentioning this as an instance. I dare say that those acquainted with fche circumstances of thafc wreck will remember that there was one unfortunate young lady who was in the water for 36 hours. Afte r she bad been there for 24 hours she succeeded in reaching a raft, on which there",28,Adjournment Employment Op Coloured Labour On

In place of exhibiting any traces of humanity on such a terrible occasion, these lascars exhibited such a savage character towards the young lady that she preferred to go into the water again rather than risk her life with those men. MrW . H . GROOM' -It is perfectly true, because it is in our official records. The Queensland people at once demanded that there should be a change in reference to the employment of black labour on vessels subsidized by the Government. That change was carried into effect. delighted to hear what has fallen from the Prime Minister and the leader Qf tbe Opposition. can now appeal to the British, authorities with confidence knowing that he has the States afc his back, and that allfchemembers of this Legislature are also behind him. I think this is a time when firmness should be exercised. I have every confidence i nfcheright honourable gentleman thafc after such an expression of opinion as he bas heard to-day he will make such representations to the Imperial authorities as will bring about all thafc we desire. refrain from adding afew words to this debate. We have had a great fuss made about the employment of a few lascars on board ships subsidized by fche Australian Government. I am quitein touch witlifchehonorable member who brought this question forward, because I have always advocated that we should do our best to give all possible employment toour own people in preference to coloured races, but I cannot understand the consistency of the honourable member for West Sydney, who delivered such a glowing free-trade speech in-this House some time ago, or tlie leader of the Opposition upon this question. What position do they take up? That these lascai*sa miserable number after all-ar e robbing a few of our white population of employment. I would call attention to the fact that nofc long ago there ' was a great industry in the Scottish town of Dundee, which was then the centre of the jute trade. the question of the jute trade is under discussion, .and unless the honourable member can connect ifc with the subject he will nofc be in order in referring to ifc. cuss the jute trade. I am only giving an' illustration of the way in which fche people of India have robbed the people of Dundee of a great industry. Dundee was the centre of a great trade, but because the jute trade could be carried on in India at a cheaper rate than was the case in Dundee, the Indian people have captured that trade all over tlie world. YetI will guarantee thafc the leader of fche Opposition is an advocate of tlie Indian people retaining thafc trade as against our own people I wish to point out the absolute inconsistency of honourable members and fche degradaI am tion of this screeching to the galleryof this bid for tlie democratic vote. There is no consistency in the attitude taken up by I think that the Prime Minister honourable members on the other side of fche House. health is, I think, a guarantee that I will not detain the House very long. But I feel impelled to make one or two observations principally in connection with tbe tone of pessimism adopted by the Prime: Minister when he discussed the likelihood or otherwise of our suggestionsbeing adopted by the Imperial Government. There is no doubt that in the past fche Imperial authorities may have been somewhat unwilling to deal with this matter; but although the lasfc postal conference does not take us very far back, still from that date until tlie present time events of a very important character have happened with regard to the Empire, and the importance of conserving the interests of tbe Empire. I feel quite sure thafc if this Parliament presents this matter to the Imperial authorities in the proper way-no t as a question affecting Australia alone, and not by any means as a fiscal question, as some honourable members have tried to make ifc, but as a matter affecting as ifc really does fche whole of the EmpireI take it we have every reason to hope for tbe careful consideration of the Imperial authorities in dealing with this very great question. It is rapidly assuming a serious character. The thin end of tbe wedge has already entered, and commercialism is rapidly driving ifc home. We know that there is no patriotism I do not think that in the commercial spirit of the age. AYe know that commercialism is willing to trade as far as it can witb the most deadly enemies of fche country. That has happened time and again in the past, and it will happen in the future.

I would ask fche Minister to amend the clause in such a way as to meet this objection. Apart from the representations made by the honourable member for Soufch Australia, I desired to see this clause recommitted. My objection is that it gives extra power of imposing duties where it is not intended by tlie Tariff that they should be imposed. Any part, if imported by itself, will be proportionately chargeable with duty afc the rate applicable to the goods in their complete form. There may be some chemical preparation which bas so many parts of one chemical and so many parts of another, and under fchis provision, although one of these chemicals would be free if imported by it self, because fchis chemical goes into an article which is dutiable, power is to be given to enable duty to be charged upon ifc. tion. a duty upon buggies, and some one imports spokes for a buggy, although those spokes are notduitable, they are to be charged duty if they form a portion of the buggy. But if they are imported separately they will not be dutiable. I should think the substitution of the word ""pieces"" for ""parts"" would be desirable. machinery. machinery. I think thafc what I propose would effect the desire of the Minister. Then there is the question which has been raised by tlie honourable member for Soufch Australia, Mr Solomon. If Parliament puts spokes on the free list, and spokes came in accompanying a buggy, but not as a part of that buggy, then under this provision fche Minister would have power to charge duty on the spokes thafc are separate. machinery which come in free. be free, and engines might be dutiable. As tlie clause stands it gives power to the Minister fco impose a duty on all sorts of things that are nofc i nfcheTariff. to me to be very clear. There is so much duty levied upon an article. The people interested cut the article into two, and say that it is not the article which is dutiable. Thus they get at us. covers that. upon buggies, for instance, of say £ 1 0 , I do not think that the honourable member wishes that fche persons importing a buggy should be able to put the wheels into one package and the body into another, and thus evade the Customs. In such a case they might say-""Oh, this is not a buggy."" Surely that ought to be prevented. There is no intention to impose a duty upon an article which this Parliament does nofc intend to be taxed. The clause says ""any part"" of dutiable goods. Here there is a lump sum as regardsfchewhole. Whenever any part of dutiable goods is introduced we charge in proportion to fche whole of fche fixed duty.

124,Mr Kingston,"I think so; it is the matter vague. Let us suppose that bicycles carry a duty of 10 per cent. All parts of bicycles are admitted free at the present time, tlie object being to give employment in putting the machines together. It seems to me that this clause will in all probability interfere with some such object in many oases. Under this clause every part used in the manufacture of a bicycle would be -dutiable, and yet Parliament might say thafc parts of bicycles are to be admitted free. Then the Minister might raise the question that some particular part of a bicycle might be used in some other way. I am a strong believer in the principle thafc everything which is not specifically made dutiable should be free. difficulty. I cannot quite understand the meaning of the word "" proportionately "" in this clause. The second portion of the clause is clearly applicable to specific duty, or to specific and ad valorem duties. Presumably, therefore, tbe first part applies to ad valorem duties. I do not know that it could nofc be interpreted to mean that if an engine which was worth £100 pays a duty of 20 per cent., and that part of ifc were imported which was worth £ 1 0, that it should only pay one-tenth of 20 per cent. that is not intended. I think that the use of tbe word "" proportionately "" confuses the meaning if sub-clause (1) is meant to apply to ad valorem duties. and learned member think that the word "" part"" is going beyond the intention of the clause 1 that apprehension. I do nofc think that "" a part"" means. an ingredient, though I quite admit that ifc may be argued in thafc way. form part of a bicycle.

Ifc is difficult for the committee fco come to a right conclusion, [195] owing to the absolute impossibility of being definite on the point. In my opinion this is one of the matters that will have to be left to administration. I believe it is absolutely impossible to lay down a hardand-fasfc rule. has had experience of a similar clause. Mu. SALMON -Yes, in the Victorian Customs department. I am not in favour of Parliament relegating its duties to the Minister, but under the circumstances, I say, from my experience, that it will be impossible for us to lay clown a rule which can be followed in every case by the Minister who is acting on behalf of the State. The honourable ancl learned memThis seems to me to create a ber for Corinella has said that in his opinion every article not specifically charged with duty ought to be free. That is a matter of opinion. I recognise thafc when a Tariff is being framed ifc is impossible for every article which may be manufactured during the period of the operation of thafc Tariff to be taken into consideration by a Parliament. New articles are being placed on the market every day, and we must be governed largely by the preceding clause, which allows the Minister to exercise discretion as regards substitutes. That clause, is absolutely necessary in order that the revenue may be safeguarded, and also that the fiscal policy of the country-if it be a protective one-shal l be adequately protective in itself. If we say that every article which has not a duty placed opposite to ifc upon the Tariff list is to be free, then on the other hand there is nothing to prevent us from saying that those articles which are nofc specifically set down as free shall be charged a certain duty. Let us take any article that we choose, divide it into its component parts, and it will be found that a rate of duty will Por example, bicycle bearings would be chargeable on those parts. Some of those parts may carry no duty at all, but if we take the whole we shall find that in very few instances does the duty on the finished article agree with the aggregate of the duty charged upon each separate part. ThisI think that that refers shows the. difficulty that exists and that will continue to exist so long as we have these intricate matters to deal with. The provision in the clause is mandatory.

They will apply to all such Acts and will, I presume, override their provisions. I have nofc looked at this matter from a fiscal point of view, nor have I considered any of the provisions of tlie .Bill from thafc stand-point. But I say that if Parliament decides that certain duties shall be charged, fche Minister should not have power to act contrarily to thafc decision. The honourable and learned member for Corinella says thafc under the present Victorian Tariff bicycles are chargeable with duty, but imported parts of bicycles are nofc. Suppose the Pederal Parliament determines what in my opinion would nofc be a proper thing to determine, that parts of bicycles shall nofc be chargeable with dufcy, though completed bicycles shall be chargeable, this provision will allow the Minister to charge duty upon those parts, and thus act contrary to the determination of Parliament. have that effect, because the Tariff, being the later A.ct, would have the fuller force. regulations made under the clause would override any Tariff that we might pass. 3075 less objection tofcheclause, though I do not see why, if the spokes of a buggy were not chargeable witb duty, the Minister could not. under the clause malte them chargeableOne of. the suggestions which I made-that fche word "" pieces "" should be substituted for"" parts ""-ha s been answered by the debatewhich has taken place, find I am of opinion now that the word "" parts "" would not cover "" ingredients."" I still think, however, that tbe clause should be made fco more fully express what is desired by the Minister. ber for North Sydney is a little in error in thinking that the provisions of the clause would override any Tariff that might be passed by the Parliament. They could not do so. If any provision in this Bill clashes with fche provisions of a measure passed subsequently to ifc, the provisions of the subsequent measure will hold good. suggestion then that the parts shall be chargeable at the discretion of the Minister? words "" unless otherwise provided "" ; but, of course, whatever is provided subsequently and differs from this provision ""provides otherwise.""

That would place upon the Minister the responsibility of deciding whether the parts should or should not be charged with dufcy. AlthoughI am nofc in favour of allowing fche Minister to impose duties-thaf c being the business of Parliament-in cases like this it is absolutely necessary to leave matters to his discretion. visions of this clause should apply only to » parts of machines or vehicles j they could nofc apply to ingredients. intention of the clause is that parts of a machine which is chargeable with duty shall nofc be allowed to escape duty if imported separately.

The last speaker said he did not think this clause would apply to goods generally, but; I think it would apply to saddlery and harness, where dutiable parts are very often imported.

This Bill confers enormous power on the Minister to legislate in many respects, and clause 132 also gives thafc powerfcoan enormous extent. The present amendment seeks to do the same thing, and allows the Minister to say whether duty shall be chargeable or not. Some of these days a question will be raised under the Constitution, whether it is competent for us to delegate our power to anybody. The first section of the Constitution Act vests the legislative power of the Commonwealth in a Pederal Parliament, and But I . would ask how it will be under American decisions it may be found that some of the provisions we are now making to confer legislative power on the Minister are invalid. cisions the other way, such as on the question of the referendum 1 which the honourable member refers are of a different class altogether. In reference to Canada, I know the Privy Council bas decided thafc infcheDominion there are plenary powers of legislation, and that the Parliament may delegate powers; but the words of their Constitution are very different from the words of our Constitution. I only say this in order that the Minister may consider the matter in this and future legislation. ThisI think it will be rather is a question which cannot be easily decided at once, but is a very serious and important question; and it would be well for the Ministeri n future fco see that he gets as much"" power as he can provided in the Bill. The question will be raised sooner or later, and how ifc will be decided is a matter of conjecture, but the words of the Constitution are very strong. The judicial power is vested in the High Court, and the legislative power is vested in Parliament; and it is veiy doubtful whether these powers can be delegated. The usual power to make regulations to a limited extent may be given to the Minister, but here It will applyfcoharness or we give him the enormous power of saying whether or not a tax shall be put ou the people.

Thafc is an extraordinary power to give. It will give power to the Minister to make dutiable what has been declared by Parliament not to be dutiable. The only reason for ib is thafc a heavier dufcy may be collected where there is a dufcy on an article, or thafc a dufcy may be collected where there is no duty at all. When we were discussing clause 133, it was said that the Tariff Act would override these regulations. Thafc cannot be affirmed in connection with this clause, because the only reason for putting the clause here is fchafc an article which is not otherwise dutiable, or is . chargeable with a lesser duty, shall be charged with a duty or a higher duty.

Further than that, there is nothing to prevent similar articles being put up by another person within the State, and going into consumption without paying a farthing of duty. An enormous injustice might be done to tbe proprietors of the preparation in one aspect of the case, and in another aspect of the case great hardship would be inflicted if the dufcy were charged on the articles used, not only in making up these preparations, but for other purposes. This is a most unnecessary and undesirable provision, and ifc may very well be left out of fche Bill.

' Mr KI NGST ON I hope honourable -members will not be desirous of dispensing ""with this protection to the revenue. As I -pointed out, ifc is simply intended to meet the case of pills and perfumery. Those are two typical classes of medicinal and toilet preparations. The fact is that in the 'absence of provision of this kind-althoug h ifc is to be found in the Western Australian Act;-the practice has been with regard to pills, which, when made up and labelled, are of very considerable value, to practically mix up fche materials in bulk, and then bring them in without being made into pills, or without a label. When the proprietor's are brought up, they say as regards the mixture out of which their pills are' made, that ifc is worth nothing, and that is the sort of case we want to meet. W it h a little labour,fchismaterial is ver}' quickly manufactured into enough pills to supply the whole continent, and perfumery is similarly dealt with to a very large extent. If these pills were imported made up, we should get a very fair contribution fco the revenue,' but, as matters stand, the proprietors are ""able to avoid j>aymenfc of duty. The way in which fche manufacturers import their -goods afc present is simply a "" try o n "" to ;gefc a good deal the besfc of the revenue, and we think that the provision we make is quite fair. sent the Minister's imputation that I am -defending any crime, and 1 say that ifc is no crime to do what he describes. If it is a -crime, then he gives every opportunity fco other people to commit thafc crime-eve n with tbe clause in the B i ll as proposed. How canfcheMinister justifyfchisprovision which be says is intended to meet the case of people importingfchematerial for making up pills. Just fancy our putting a clause in : the Bill bo deal with pills only. It seems -ridiculous that the Federal Legislature should be asked to put a clause into the Customs 'Regulation Act to meet a trifling loss such as'inighfc be incurred through raw materials coming into the State for the manufacture of pills here, instead of the pills being brought in in a manufactured form. revenue from being pillaged. of this clause is like his defence of a good -many others in the B ill ; it never touched J i the provision in the Bill at all. The Minister practically says that ifc would be a crime to allow the proprietors of these pills to import the raw materials and then make the pills up here and sell them for a shilling a box and afc fche same time entirely escape dufcy. Buti t is a crime only for one man. It is not a crime on the part of others who may do i tfcoany extent. The article-if it is a Commonwealth pill-ca n be manufactured to any extent. There aie some large manufactures already within the Commonwealth. They can bring in fche raw materials free. If a proprietor chooses to put his workmen to that operation within the Commonwealth, then we invoke the provisions of a special clause, which has nofc been found necessary in any of fche larger countries, to deal with thafc manufacturer as if he were a criminal-as the Minister states -for -doing that which is done in every TariffA c t under which raw materials are admitted free and the manufactured articles are dutiable. brings in his Tariff that it will be all bitter pills. too much power to the Minister if we pass this provision. It deals with much more than pills--it deals with all medicinal and toilet preparations. for completing their manufacture. that. The clause, as I have already said, covers all medicinal and toilet preparations. If there is any reason why ifc should deal with all these things, tbe same reason will applyfcoother articles. The fact is simply that there has been a special object to get at the manufacturers-as the Minister puts it-of some pills. We are asked to give the Minister power to deal with every medicinal or toilet preparation, or with the ingredients which go fco make up these preparations. We are asked to allow him to ' deal with them in a way that is not proposed in the Tariff, although we may be interfering with other industries that consume the same articles fchafc are consumed in these preparations. Ifc is a very small matter, upon the Minister's own showing. Ifc has not been found necessary in other States, and I think it is highly undesirable to give to the Minister this great power to deal with such trifling importations as pills.",39,Edwards Proposed

The first portion of fche clause says thafc these provisions shall apply to all goods which the Tariff affects before they are delivered for home consumption. to point out a difficulty which may arise in that connection.

A Treasurer has fco keep his proposals secret. We know in fche States that when a Treasurer is going to make a financial statement there is a great deal of speculation whether or not there are going to be any duties, and the clause is intended for cases where the people have no It may be impossible to get notice of impending changes, and have no idea afc the time they make fche contracts fchafc the Tariff will be touched. tion does not give much credit to merchants for intelligence if he thinks they do nofc know what the financial position is. of business who have to be considered, but other people who may suffer seriously and who may nofc, perhaps, have keen lawyers to advise them.

The object aimed at by the clause is to protect traders generally.

I have seen quite enough instances of where that has been done. argument for having such a clause ?

I think the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney will meefc the only reasonable objection to the clause. This is not a matter affecting the Government or affecting the revenue, but it does affect traders. all the objections that have been raised to the clause will be removed by substituting the word ""entered"" for the word, ""delivered "" in the fourth line. . confine the operation of the clause to the goods before they are taken out of bond t to provide is that where there is an alteration in the Tariff as regards goods subject to a contract, and that alteration actually benefits or disadvantages the vendor, as I was very much imregards the benefit,fchepurchaser shall have ifc, wheieas the vendor shall be protected against fche disadvantage.

Two or three months usually elapse before the Tariff is actually passed into law, and it is during the interval that most forward contracts will probably be completed. Ifc is in connection with these that the most trouble will arise, and this clause, which seeks to protect both sellers and buyers against undue advantage in consequence of an alteration in the Tariff, will not apply in the great bulk of cases where fche operation of the alteration will actually take place. The clause should be alteredfcoprovide for any alteration that may be proposed or that may take place. of the law, the Tariff alteration does not take place until fche Governor General actually affixes his signature to the law approved of by both Houses, and the result will be that the great bulk of the transactions to which the clause ought to apply, if it is to apply afc all, will be transactions to which the clause will nofc apply because of the way ifc is framed.

Western Australia, for instance, might put a duty on confectionery and jams imported from outside the Commonwealth, and from the other States, and while the English and American article would have been made from sugar upon which no duty had been paid, the article manufactured in the other States might have been manufactured from sugar upon which a very high dufcy had been paid.

I am very glad that we shall not have this difficulty in regard to InterState trade, and that until the uniform Tariff is imposed the local laws relating to drawback will continue. Those who have manufactured goods there would still be able to take advantage of the local drawback regulations, and will carry on their trade as hitherto. I was glad to hear that, because I was very fearful, looking to the passing of fche Bill as a possible means of bringing about a state of deadlock in regard to several important industries. -Western Australia entered federation on the understanding that, because of her sparseness of population and her isolation, she was to get certain benefits. One benefit was that she could continue her present Tariff for five years after the uniform Tariff came into force, deducting 20 per cent, per annum B. EDWAKDS Not because during that period, and thus bringing her ultimately into line with tlie other States. AVestern Australia does not want any more than she is entitled to. I am sorry that the honourable member for South Sydney looks on Western Australia as a foreign State, merely because there is this difference in the Tariff. AVestern Australia is perfectly willing to abide by whatever is done in a fair spirit. Andfcheproposal of the Government is a just one. to put some facts of tlie case as they appear to me in the light of the clause under discussion, combined with fche last sub-section of section 95 of tbe Constitution Act. I will take imaginary figures, and ask honourable members to suppose that Western Australia increases her duties between now and the coming into operation of the Tariff, with the result that the duty on woollens is 40 per . cent, during the first year after the imposition of uniform duties, while the Commonwealth duty is 20 per cent. Under the last sub-section of section 95 of the Constitution Act, if the foreign maker of woollens sent his woollens direct he would have tb pay 40 per cent., in the same way as would the colonial makers. But suppose the foreign maker exported the woollens from abroad into Victoria, he would there pay Now, if those goods were shipped from Victoria to Western Australia, where is tlie power under either the Constitution or this clause to make the importer to the latter State pay a duty of 20 per cent. 1 goods into the Commonwealth. take his goods to Western Australia as freely as if they were taken from another town in Victoria? the colonial maker of woollens would under the circumstances, be paying 40 per cent, to get his goods into Western'Ausfcralia, wliile the foreign maker would only be paying 20 per cent. drawback.",48,Malcolm Mceachaen Wh Y Not Mr M C C Ay Corinella I Would

MrM c CAY thafca higher dufcy should be collected on goods when imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, applies only to goods going directly from abroad to Western Australia, and not to goods which get into the Commonwealth in any other State, and are then sent fco Western Australia. The words are ""imported into Western Australia from beyond fche limits of fche Commonwealth,"" which, I take it , would not refer to goods imported into Victoria, and then transported to Western Australia. I do not pretend to say that my interpretation of the clause is final, but afc present fchafc seems to be the result to which it leads, and I may say I am not the only member who thinks so. able member presupposes a certain condition of things with regard to woollens. He puts it that certain woollen goods manufactured in Europe are imported into Victoria, and that when they are sent fco Western Australia certain results follow. But tbe answer to the honourable member is thafc inasmuch as the Customs authorities require every entry outwards to be produced, special care, I believe, will be paid while this state of things exists in Western Australia, to see thafc the origin of every parcel of goods is accurately described before the goods are shipped. These goods being shipped to Western Australia, and described as being the produce of Great Britain or Germany, as fche case may be, will necessarily involve their paying a higher rate of duty whenfcheyentered Western Australia. member get that ? The Constitution says that goods which are to be subject to the special duties are to be made in the Commonwealth. -the local manufacturer will pay the dufcy, and the foreign manufacturer will escape. the honourable member for Corinella quoted [196] fche last sub-section of section 95 of the Constitution Act, which provides that in the event of the special duty imposed by the Western Australian Government being in excess of the duty on foreign goods, the duty on the latter has to be raised to the same rate. If these goods coming to Victoria from Great Britain are sent to Western Australia, they would, according to my readI think thatfcheprovision ing, have to pay 40 per cent. of section 95 of the Constitution Act was fco give Western Australia special power to levy duties for five years on Australian products. As to goods imported from parts beyond .the Commonwealth, fche ordinary Commonwealth law will operate, with the qualification that if the duty which, under the section, Western Australia levies on an* Australian product is higher than the Commonwealth duty on a similar article imported from beyond the seas, then according to the sectionIf afc any time during the five years the dufcy on any goods underfchissectionThat is, Australian goods. is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation of like goodsThat is, goods from beyond the seas, then such higher dutyThat is,fchedufcy on Australian-products, shall be collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyoud the limits of the Commonwealth. That is to say, Western Australia is not to be allowed to put a higher duty on Australian goods than is imposed for her benefit on foreign goods. The duties are, therefore, equalized. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (Soufch Sydney). -The leader of fche Opposition has accurately described the whole position, which, if he has been listened to, ought fco be pretty well understood. But the question, so far as I am concerned, is not at all touched by the question whether Western Australia will impose duties or nofc. I hold that if manufacturers in the other States have to pay the same duty in Western Australia as English goods, when the former have already paid duties on the material they use, they are handicapped out of the race.

The Minister proposes under it fco provide for all thafc he considers to be reasonable in what tlie honourable member suggests. ""Under fche clause ifc is provided that if fche Parliament of fche State of Western Australia, in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, imposes duties on goods passing into thafc State, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, drawback may be allowed in the Statei n which import duty has been paid. Now, no power is given to the Western Australian Government to levy duties on goods originally imported from beyond the' limits of the Commonwealth, and yet if import duty has beeu paid upon the goods, they must have come from beyond the Commonwealth. This clause, in fche first portion-and that governs the whole clause*-deal s only with goods that are nofc originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and yet the provision is thafc the drawback shall be granted, in respect of those goods, of the duty paid at fche time of importation. We have already decided under the Bill that "" import"" means an import from beyond tbe Commonwealth, so that here we have two opposing conditions-firs t of all, thafc the goods must not be goods thafc are originally imported from beyond fche limits of the Commonwealth; and secondly, thafc drawback shall be allowed only on goods thafc have been imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. ing to deal with the question of excise, because that has to be considered separately; but fche position is this. We are a Commonwealth, and free-trade exists subject to a qualification, and we say that our merchants are not entitled to a drawback as regards any dufcy they have paid on their goods in the Commonwealth when they export them from TasmaniafcoVictoria, or from Victoria to New South Wales or Queensland, and why 1 Because there is free-trade. We have, however, to make one qualification, and for what reason 1 That, although we are one Commonwealth with Inter-State free-trade, there is the one qualification that AVestern Australia-may charge a dufcy on Australian goods, subject to certain conditions. AVhafc we say is this, that as far as AVestern Australia does thafc she is a foreign country, and that goods affected byfcheimposition of imported duty-paid articles. The such duties shall be fche subject of drawbacks, and thoseonly. I think that is perfectly fair. An Honorable MEMBER -Except that itdoes not cover the special case mentioned by the honourable member for South Sydney.. ifc does cover the special case, but ifc covers the whole case as provided for under fche Constitution. We have free-trade throughout the Commonwealfeh', and sothere can be no drawback, from one end of fche Commonwealth tofcheother, withfcheoneexception thafc I have mentioned. to ask the Minister a question, as an affirmative answer may save a deal of discussion. I would ask if a colonial, manufacturer has to use some duty-paid article from abroad in his manufactures, and then sends his completed article to Western Australia during the five years' period, would nofc the Government return him as drawback any money he had paid by way of dufcy on that particular part of his manufactures that he had imported. Take the case of the jam manufacturers. Half their jam is sugar, on which perhaps they have paid duty as imported sugar. Thepeople of Western Australia with thensugar free of dufcy would have an advantage over the Australian manufacturer who has to pay duty on the sugar he uses in the production of the manufactured article. I would like to know whether the Government would be in favour of a refund of the dufcy paid on the sugar used in the manufacture of jam sent to Western Australia 1 MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I would like to have one misapprehension that seems to exist amongst honourable members cleared up.

REID (East Sydney) I am obliged to the Govei-ruiaent for their cburfcesy in arranging their business so that I may address a few observations to fche House with reference to the Inter-State Commission B ill and 'the Defence Bill, as I shall be unavoidably absent when tlie debate on these measures is resumed on a future occasion. I shall, however, condense my remarks so that bhe House may adjourn at its usual hour, because I feel that it would be unreasonable .to prolong the sitting. The Inter-State Commission B ill is one of those measures .which, call for, perhaps, even more careful treatment .than do some of the other Bills which we have had fco consider. In dealing with measures like fche Public ServiceB ill and the Defence Bill, we are dealing with measures affecting subjects upon which a large number of Acts have already been, passed by the 'States; but in dealing with fche regulation of Inter-State commerce, under the developments which w ill follow from the imposition, of a uniform Tariff and the establishment of free trade between fche States, there is practically no legislation which, from my point of view, can be a fitting guide to us.

Thus it was, I think, thafc the ' matter assumed so much importance in the Convention. ground which fche Minister for Home Affairs went over, I think afc undue length. gave us an enormous list of preferential rates which were in force on the Victorian railways to attract the commerce of New Soufch Wales, and gave some rates showing a desire on tlie part of New South Wales to retain trade within her borders. here is a little map which shows the areas over which this competition between New South Wales and Victoria has extended. BeforeI refer to that map, I should say thafc long before fche New South Wales railways were taken out to Hay, and on to Bourke, the battle was not between New South Wales and Victoria for the Darling trade, but between South Australia _ and Victoria. Soufch Australia had, I think, the advantage at first, owing to the river, but Victorian enterprise pushed communication up to different parts of fche Murray, and Victoria entered the lists for ""New South Wales trade nofc as against that State, but as against South Australia. time went on, the authorities in New South Wales, moved thereto by the inhabitants of those districts, sent railway communication into the back country, and then that State came on the scene. This little map, which I have some reason to believe is correct, represents Wales. covered blue, represents about .one-fourth of the State, and over that area there is a reduction, Murray termini of fche Victorian railways to Melbourne, of from 46 per cent, to 61 per cent, on the rates which tlie Victorian Government charge its own settlers. from fche very large block coloured yellow, Mr Beid. in matters which representing the heart of New South Wales, the reduction is from 61 per cent, to 66 per cent. Coming down fco the country about Jerilderie and Wagga, there is a narrow strip along tlie Murrumbidgee, from which the reduction in rates is about 38 per cent, to 43 per cent., and from fche wide strip But that victory, which was a shown onfchemap, near Victoria, the reduction is 46 per cent. Then, on the Murray, these inducements disappear. These, of really shifted away from course, are enormous reductions on the to fche establishment of an established fares and rates on the Victorian Ifc was a choice lines. But the Victorians in their enterParliament as an prise and self-sacrifice, seemed willing thafc the rates on goods of our producers should be allowed to neutralize the difficulties of distance in competition with Victorian I do not want to traverse' the settlers. The effect, no doubt, to the producer was that the enormous distance from He a seaport, which put; the people of New South Wales at a disadvantage, as compared with the people of Victoria, was neutralized to a large extent, and they practically got as near to the sea as the Victorians themselves. I return grateful thanks on behalf But of the settlers of this arid country of New South Wales to the people, and the Governments of Victoria, for helping our settlers in this direction. I have no element of bitterness at all in reference to that, and one of the aspects of the sort of competition to which ,1 have referred between State railways is, that whatever may have been the effects on the States, the effects on the people were decidedly beneficial. The result was not to make carriage difficult nor to add artificially to the expense of railway transit. On the contrary, the effect was, as 1 have said, to neutralize distance i u favour of fche persons whose goods were carried. So that really this competition, although ifc As may excite a feeling of irritation in the Railway departments, was a competition which had its good side. The railway authorities of New South Wales have naturally endeavoured to meet this attack and to retain their trade, and I believe they have been able to do so Avithout making such the State of New South enormous reductions as those to which I The very large portion have referred. The Avork of' settling any existing discrepancies, according to the enormous standard of the neAV order of things, is a from the work AvhichI think might Avell be left to a more conA-enienfc season. I should be better pleased if Ave allowed the State Governments, after Ave have passed our uniform Then Tariff and' haA-e settled doAvn to the neAV order of things, to come to some amicable agreement in reference to their respective lines. There have been a number of conferences, and on more than one occasion tbe railway authorities have agreed, though tlie Ministers of the day have differed. Under the new state of things I do not think it should be difficult for our railway authorities to come to some amicable agreement Avithout strife and Avithout litigation. If they can cpme to such an agreement I am sure it must be the feeling not only amongst ourselves, but throughout tbe whole of Australia, that there ought to be a settlement of thafc sort between two such mighty corporations. In Victoria, the railways are in the hands of the Government, Avhereas in NeAV South AVales they are under commissioners; but differences between those two mighty powers would be better settled amicably if possible than by means of litigation. tremely brief under the circumstances. The first general remark I wish to make is, that in my opinion this is a Bill Avhich is not called for in the pressure of public business afc the present time. AVe must have our public sendee organized ; we must have our defence force organized; Ave must have our Tariff established; and Ave must bring in Inter-State free-trade. matters of organization Avith reference to the Avorking of our great public departments, and the introduction of our fiscal measures seem to me to be the most pressing business. A measure of this sort, Avhich may be necessary, is in my opinion one of the reserve poAvers of the Constitution which should be used only when necessity calls for it . tire before they find the puncture. Mi'. BEID different way. No doubt there are "" punctures"" afc the present time. I should be very sorry to take up a position Avhich should be understood as a tolerant position towards anything of that sort. My first position is that an amicable arrangement amongst those who run the State railways Avould be infinitely preferable to a forced interference of a power as the result of litigation as the result of a contest before a court. What would be ten thousand times better Avould be an amicable arrangement, the result of Avhich Avould be that neither the great railwaj' department of Victoria nor the great railway department of New South AVales would drag the other before a' judicial tribunal. Many matters could be taken into consideration as betAveen the two great railway authorities, on give and take principles, which ifc Avould be impossible to give due Aveightfcoi f they were both brought to bay. As to the shipping and commercial elements in our Australian intercourse, there is absolutely no justification for the vexatious and inquisitorial provisions of this Bill. In fche light of experience there is absolutety no grieA-ance and no complaint, and the affairs of commerce-giA'e n the freedom and equality which the Constitu tion of Australia gives our commerce, Avithin a limited radius,' it is true, bufc still a radius Avide enough for the continent-ma y be conducted in such a manner as J;o enable us, for some time afc any rate, to regard our special control of them as no A'ery pressing matter. I I Avish to be exmusfc say that in fche midst of these large departments Ave are establishing and in the midst offchemany high appointments Ave are making we must have some regard for the question of a fitting timo. We shall have from the force of necessity to establish a large number of expensive tribunals, and this tribunal is one, I think, Avhich might Avell arise afc a somewhat later time. That These is the vieAv which I take generally Avith reference to this Bill. A t the same time. I Avishi t to be understood that if any part of Australia is deprived of an administration of Australian traffic Avhich is equal, Avhich is fair, and Avhich leaves no substantial grievance behind it , I am not the one to delay the operation of this correcting poAver; but Ave do not Avant to set a great piece, an intricate piece, of machinery in motion to crush small grieA'ances, to investigate trifling complaints, or to place upon the industrial I AA-ould rather put it in a energy of those engaged in commerce hindrances Avhichi t was, I thought, our glory to destroy. We may be separated on Tariff questions, but I think there is no one Avho is not as keenly alive as I am to the great advantages to Australia of making our commerce as free as Ave possibly can. I do not see the public necessity for this Bill, as far as the mercantile and shipping interests are concerned, and I think there Avill be no necessity for this Bill as far as tlie railway traffic of the different States is involved. Buti f , in reference to this railway traffic, any State finds that it is being treated in an unfair Avayi n a seriously unfair wayI quite admit the right Avhich that State hasfco come to",55,Inter State Commission Bill Second Reading
368,Mr Higgins,"They Avanfc to repair thea tribunal of this, sort to have .its grievances redressed. Bufc such grievances would be a thousand times better redressed by some voluntary arrangement. Jn America the arrangements as to railways are ;as different from ours as can possibly be. None of those railways are owned by the State. Nofc a single railway used in commerce, amongst their tens of thousands of miles, is a State-owned railway. As one can imagine, with the. power of capital located in all sorts of quarters remote from fche centres of actual traffic, and having its interests so distributed as to admit of all sorts of contrivances to depress the traffic of one State, or one line, or one part of a line, or to enhance the traffic of any State or line, or part of a line, or even a long series of lines, there is a myriad of temptations that have doubtless been fully availed of to make the conditions of commercial intercourse in the United States far from what the Constitution intended. . I am happy to say, however, that our commercial intercourse has not.been complicated in that way. Mr HuiiE COOK -No r by corrupt legislation. tween State-owned railways, managed as they are in Australia, and the private railways, managed as they are in Amecica, is very considerable, to say the least of it . I should like to refer to one or two of the provisions of this Bill, bufc first of all I would say a word with reference to the constitutional position of authority. Section 102 of the Constitution Act, looked at now as we can look at it , free from the heafcedmediaof the Convention debates, seems to wear asomewhafc singular complexion. The intention at first' was, .as I have said, to make Parliament the authority to prevent obnoxious railway rates. In its jiresent shape, But there are certain things which we canthe first part of tlie section, gives Parliament a limited -power, butfchevalue of that limited power is taken away in the latter part of the section. In fche first part of the section theParliamenfcmay by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by any State. Thafc is not a general power, but the general provision with regard to trade and commerce is, as honourable members know, contained in section 51. There is a general power in section 51, but this section gives Parliament a special power which in one-sense is a limitation. Ifc is .providedThe Parliament may by any law with respect; fco trade and commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if sueh preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State. Buti n the latter part of fche section it is providfedBut no preference or discrimination shall, within fche meaning offchissection, be takenfcobe undue and unreasonable, or unjust to uny State, unless so adjudged byfcheInter-State Commission. So that here we have a .most extraordinary spectacle .presented to us, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth is in one breath allowed to forbid certain things if they take a certain aspect, and then there is a proviso that t h a t power shall never be exercised by the Parliament unless an inferior tribunal has adjudged it to be that which Parliament is supposed to forbid. tribunal; it is, in one sense, a committee of experts. for Bland has very properly corrected me. In one sense the Inter-State Commission is an inferior tribunal, and in another -sense it is not inferiori t is practically a delegation from Parliament of a certain power.' But the inconsistency still remains, because in the first part of the sectionfcheParliament is given certainlegislative power, whilst in the second part it is to have that power only if another authority says it, shall exercise it, and that other authority is supposed to have power to do fche thing for itself. This provision has a limiting effect, and the B ill strangely enough does nofc recognise the force of these limitations. Por general purposes we are fully competent to pass a Bill clothing fche Inter-State Commission with certain powers. not do, and we cannot do that which the Government asks us to do in some of these clauses. Now, take clause 16 dealing with rates on State railways, which provides(1) Ifc shall not be lawful for any State or for any State railway authority to.give or make upon any railway the property offcheState in respect of external or Inter-State commerce, or so as to affect such commerce, any preference or discrimination which is -undue>and unreasonable or unjust to any State.

371,Mr Reid,"The honourable memberlawful, because as to State railways tlie Constitution says this Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by any State or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable or unjust to.any State. ClearlyI submit with great respect to any' one who may differ from me, that that is not an authority to forbid by general phraseolog}', bufc the legislation on this very point as fco the railways has the effect of pointing out what Parliament shall, asfcothe railways, have the power to forbid. If this had been left out the power of Parliament would have been infinitely greater, because the Constitution points out what fche Parliament shall do with reference to railway rates, whilst ifc says nothing as to the other rates regarding which Parliament has a general power. Regarding railway rates, however, the Act prescribes the special way in which Parliament shall act, and in expressing that special way the Constitution does nofc give as to railways a general right or a general power such as is exercised in other matters. You may put in the words of the Constitution if you. l i k e ; fchey are harmless; but if it is intended by the wording of clause 16 to maintain the position thafc Parliament can forbid at large by the mere use of the phrase, I maintain that Parliament can do no such thing. member mean fco say that there ought to be in the clause a statement that the InterState Commission shall first decide that the rates are unjust ? Inter-State Commission, but I am speaking of a section in the Constitution Act, and what I wish to point out is that there is a condition attached fco fche forbidding of a railway rate as unjust or unreasonable, if a certain thing exists in reference to that rate. How can that language imply the power to forbid wholesale without inquiring intofchecase of each particular rate as to whether it has the effect described or not. Recau self such preference or discrimation is undue, unreasonable, or unjust, that is a question to be investigated before Parliament can forbid. Thafc process is entirely foreign to the power' which this Bill is made to claim of forbidding i nfchewords of the' Statute. So far as they follow the -words of the Statute there is no harm done, because the Statute forbids fche same thing. And tine Statute can forbid. But the Statute says to Parliament"" Your power of forbidding must be a power exercised in particular cases after ca particular investigation, and only if you have come as to each of these things, tofcheconclusion that that preference or discrimination is as a matter of fact undue."" If it is undue, that involves an investigation of the facts, and ifc involves a process foreign to the power of writing a string of words and saying thafc a certain thing is forbidden, without inquiry, without investigation. Now as to tbe definition of external or Inter-State commerce, I am strongly in favourof striking out the words in chaise 2 which bring external coninierce within tlie scope of this Bill. The scope of tlie American Act had necessarily to be .much larger than it need be in our case. America had a long and artificial boundary line between herself and Canada-partl y a water line and partly a land line--a n enormous boundary line dividing it from Canada. All sorts of operations might have tlie effect of diverting trade through another country and into tlie ""United States again, and many provisions were necessary in the American Act which are absolutely inapplicable to the conditions of Australia. But I do not object to these words being retained in the B ill so as to enable us to follow commerce anywhere, if it comes back into the States again. 1"" think that the words are utterly idle in view of our .geographical position, bufc still I do not object to the power because it is Inter-State commerce after all, and if in that commerce there is any design to escape I am nofc talking about the from the law by means of a circuitous route, clearly, we can follow ifc when the traffic returns to the Stafces. Bufc that power is almost idle under our circumstances. I am thoroughly in favour of restricting the scope of the Bill to Inter-State commerce. I am opposed to any attempt to give this commission, if established afc once, the power which the Bill proposes to .give with reference fco fche whole of the commercial operations of these Australian seas. 1 thinkfchafctask is a gigantic one without the slightest warrant of necessity-w*ithou t the slightest list of abuses which would warrant such a gigantic enterprise. Clause4 provides that fche Governor General shall, as soou as conveniently practicable, appoint three persons to be commissioners. There is nothing in the Constitution",59,Inter State Commission Bill Second Reading
372,Mr Higgins,Does the right honourable,60,Inter State Commission Bill Second Reading
373,Mr Reid,"Act which compels ns to appoint three commissioners. There is notliing in the Constitution which compels us to make provision that the members shall be paid for the whole of their time. Bufc this Bill prohibits them from engaging in any Other employment, and therefore large salaries will have fco be paid. Yet the commissioners may be doing nothing. I think it is possible, at any rate in the early stages of this commission, that the commissioners will have very little to 'do. Of course, if there were half the grievances to be dealt with thafc this B ill aims at, we should require well as to the ships. The object of that a dozen commissioners, and nofc three. But from my ]joint of view, when once we get the railway systems of Australia into order, within the meaning of the Constitution, this commission will have very little to do. down we shall never depart from ib. I am not shutting my eyes to facts. It is a grand thing in ' regard to Australia that the great grievances which have caused this demand for an Inter-State Commission centre round our State railways and not round tbe management of our rivers, because, as honourable members know, New South Wales has spent a considerable sum of money in snagging her rivers without charging any toll. In that respect we have managed our rivers in a very fair and open spirit. There is no suggestion of any rights, in regard to those rivers of ours, to infcefere with the free play of Inter-State enterprise. The Minister for Home Affairs was astonished to find thafc the Railway Commissioners would come under the heading of "" common carriers."" According to the provisions of clause 15, we are made to prohibit every rate which is unreasonable or unjust. The Commonwealth Constitution says-""unreasonabl e and unjust."" That is a slip, I imagine. We cannot make the power wider thanfcheConstitution makes it . carrier is made to charge reasonable and just rates. power of this Parliament with reference to common carriers generally; but I am pointing out the effect of section 102 of the Constitution regarding State railways. I do nofc question any of the powers in this Bill, except that power to forbid as to the State railways in general language, without the investigation of the particular thing which is objected to as unreasonable and unjust."" In clause 18, this distinction, which I have drawn, seems to be recognised. The clause statesNo common carrier or State authority other than a State railway, shall, directly or indirectly, by any special rate, discount, or rebate, drawback, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, <fec. That is a provision which but for the Constitution Act it would be perfectly fair and proper to apply to the railways, as clause is exactly what this B ill is intended for. But fche draftsman there draws a distinction between other carriers and the State railway authorities. In that clause it seems to me that the provisions of section 102 of the Constitution are borne in mind. Then the expression in the subsequent clauses, "" any such carrier,"" would no doubt be read in conjunction with the same exception right through, namely, "" other than a"" State railway authority."" NowI come to the burden of proof, which is provided for in clause 20. That clause provides thatfche burden of proving that such lower rate or difference in treatment is not an undue or unreasonable preference' or advantage shall lie on the common canier or authority. Here again we are reversing all the ordinary rules of administering justice. There is a mania now apparently for invading rules which we still respect in matters of vital concern, in matters affecting, liberty and life. When a complaint is made by some authority constituted under fchis Bill, why should the burden of proof that a thing is not the offence complained of be on the person against whom the imputation is made? and (b), if proved, simply amount to primd facie evidence of undue or unreasonable preference, and that of itself would shift the burden of proof. things which are mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b) for an honest, sound, commercial I am not questioning the reason, which no Inter-State Commission should question, if upon investigation ifc is found to be genuine. I say that in no case should the burden of proof be on tbe person against whom' some rival in business makes a complaint. It is. shifting tbe onus in a way thafc I do not appreciate or believe in.

379,Mr Reid,"There might be all thoseare made prima"" facie evidence of undue preference, when there are a number of things which may answer to the wording of the clause, ancl yet be perfectly legitimate. I cannot express my feeling of curiosity upon this point. Whati n the name of common sense rendered it necessary to insert in clause 22 the provision for the free carriage of certain persons 1 Why, even Members of Parliament are picked out with paupers ancl destitute persons as individuals with respect to whom fche provisions of this Bill shall not apply. It is a tribute to the marvellous ingenuity of the draftsman in putting in every conceivable liability ancl every conceivable exemption. I think that he has managed both to perfection. Regarding clause 23 I wish to point out that a person requiring traffic to be forwarded can address a request to the carrier specifying the route by which he says that the carrier ought to take the goods. If the carrier does not take the goods by that route there may be a complaint. If within ten days after receiving that request, -or within a longer term, as the commission may prescribe, there is no written objection cither to the proposed route or rate, the route shall be deemed agreed to. But if either the route or the rate is objected to, the objection is to be stated. commission is then to have power to determine whether the route is a reasonable one-whethe r in fact a man who does nob belong to the company, or whether the company itself shall run its own business. An y person can under this clause prescribe to a company bhe route it shall follow in carrying ibs goods and the company is immediately subjected to an inquiry before the commission, which is to have power to decide. that the route suggested by the outsider shall be the roube followed by the carrier. This is a marvellous piece of legislation. AgainI admire tbe boldness of it . There are a number of other mabbers in connection wibh this Bill to which I could call atbention, bub I wish simply to take this opportunity of putting, as briefly and as broadly as I con, the views which have occurred to me in regard to it . I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have no lack of zeal for pubbing this Bill into operation when ifc is proved to be necessary-whe n our experience of the working of the Commonwealth under our new conditions shows that evils, if they exist at all, still continue, or thafc new mischiefs are developing themselves. There is no man who will then be prepared more readily than I to put that machinery in motion. May I say, as my deliberate opinion, which experience will test, that if there are any particular persons who ought to wish fchis law to be put in motion, either in Victoria or New South Wales, which form the two Stabes between which the biggest conflicts exist in regard to trade, those in New Soufch Wales have a great deal more reason to desire fchis B ill bo become operative than have our friends in Victoria, because it is not conceivable that you can charge on the Victorian railwaysfchepresent rates for bringing traffic from the Darling on the plea that you are developing your own property when you are charging your own people twice as much as you charge people 300 miles off. That will not help Victoria. The provisions in the Bill, therefore, will cut right against that State. There is not a Victorian rate designed to attract New Soubh Wales wool or goods traffic which will not stand condemned when tbe Inter-State Commission is established. point 1 view the mabter from another sfcand-poinfc. Honourable members know thab I have had opportunities of getting .pretty accurate data from fche railway authorities of New South Wales during the last few years, and I assure them that, in taking the position I am taking now, I am acting, not as a representative of New South Wales, but as an Australian.

384,Mr Reid,"Yes. I shall deal with fcheinfluence they possessed. That system has been a curse and a blot upon our forces-. To my mind one of tbe grave defects of tbe Bill is that whilst we are careful that there shall be no political patronage in regard to the clerks and tbe labourers in our public service, we allow political patronage to remain in connection with the most vital department of alla department where excellence and merit should be the only qualifications for appointment and promotion. The Minister for Defence spoke with ill concealed disgust of the main principle of the Public Service Bill, but I do not share his feeling. Tlie House emphasized unmistakably its determination that in connection with our clerical service there should be some sortof machinery which would make political influence in its thousand forms as difficult of success as possible. The Governor General and his Ministers cannot appoint a clerk under the Public Service Bill, but under the Defence Bill fche Minister can appoint every one in the forces. That is a position, of affairs which I do not appreciate. I cannot see why we should lay down oneprinciple in regard to the clerical drvision of the public service ancl in regard to the young military power whioh we are bringing into existence allow the old state of alfairsfcocontinue.

When I am asked "" What would you do ?"" I reply that the genius which was capable of doing something in the Public ServiceB ill might be capable of doing something in this Bill. That is my answer to the honourable and learned member. wiser. presenta flying answer. I do not mind at once committing myself to the opinion-although I do not say thafc ifc is a good onethat infinitely better than the uncontrolled power of a civilian and a colonial is the control of an imported military man. In these matters sometimes, the further you are bom from the place where the fellows want billets the better. Under these circumstancesthe Minister is absolutely the wrong man to settle our military system; because it must be borne in mindfchafcby our appointments and promotions we determine the character of thafc system. We can pass all the Acts and regulations in the world, but it is fche men who command and the spirit that runs through the lineof promotion that is the spinal marrow of the serviee, whioh is responsible for its good or evil. I would infinitely rather provide, as it has been provided in the Public Serviee Bill, thafc appointments shall be made on the recommendation of the commissioner; that not a single appointment or promotion shall be made except on the recommendation of the general officer commanding. By thafc arrangement we have fche benefit of Ministerial control, whatever ifc may happen fco be worth, in military matters, and we have tlie benefit; of fche control of the general officer commanding. It may be asked, "" What Minister will appoint without the recommendation of the general officer commanding 1"" Buti f you bring an officer from EnglandI do nofc care how disfcinguished he is-and place the power of appointment in the hands of fche Minister, making it his business, it is astonishing how many appointments will be made which the general officer commanding will not oppose, although he may have some doubts about; the expediency of them. If you put tlie responsibility on him directly if Parliament in organizing the military system puts on the officer the obligation of being the recommending authority, and Parliament looks to him as a man sharing authority with the Minister, I do not at all fear but that any officer appointed will faithfully perform his dufcy. But the general officer is placed in a false position if we expect him practically to appoint, and put the power of appointment entirely independent of him. I am afraid that I am noappointments be left to the general officer, very few Australians will get a show, especially if the officer be a British officer. again. I do nofc leave the appointment to the general officer I do nofc propose any1 thing of the sort. This is where we get some benefit from the two authorities working together.

390,Mr Beid,"Then the Minister comes i nthe Public Service Bill, cannot appoint a single man to the service without the approval of the Governor-Generali n Council. So, in this case, we have the Minister who will look after abuses of this sort, and we want tbe other man to look after the local abuses. If we have a Minister to keep the foreigners out, and a general officer to see that colonials do not get too big a show -fro m circumstances quite apart from military achievement-the n between the two I hope we will get a much sounder state of affairs than we should have with the uncontrolled authority of either.

402,Mr Beid,"The kilb is a noble uniform,shine out of the great reviews afc Aldershofc. There is another thing I am pleased to see in the Bill. There is a provision which, it seems fco me, will help us to avoid -what will perhaps be the greatest evil of all. Thafc is the continuance in responsible military positions, calling for active attributes, of men who ""have become old and infirm. Afc our review in Sydney tlie other day before tbe Duke of York there were some grand men, but there were also a lot of venerable relics present, hardly able to keep on their horses. These men had rendered grand service in their d w , remember. No doubt some of these old gentlemen had been pillars of fche volunteer movement in days gone by, bufc it is altogether wrong thafc such men should be. relied on in matters of life and death-it is altogether wrong thafc tbe lives of men should be put into the hands of those who are utterly unfit, even physically, to go through the fatigues of an ordinary clay's parade. I say thafc in this young Australian army of ours I appreciate the principle which Ministers have included in the Bil l thafc men shall not vegetate in positions of responsibility. I believe that the provision under which the occupancy of any one position is limited to a period of five years is applied to the volunteers as well as to tbe other branches of the force. It certainly is a principle that should apply all round. We must set about this work as if it really is what ifc professes once to perform is to provide for the internal to be, and the recent events in SouthA f rica have shown us that if we have the right sort of material, ifc is astonishing how soon we can trainfchafcmaterial to fight. With reference to that remarkable struggle, that painful struggle-becaus e Britishers as we are, and loyal as we are, there is a grandeur about the courage which animates these Boers which no man can affect to disparage -cin e of the great lessons they have taught Great Britaina lesson sadly needed-is that the whole genius of the administration of the British army must be changed. There is no doubt the officers are all brave -splendidl y brave men, but there is something wanting. There was a good deal wanting about our own officers, but it was not their fault. bravery. either officers or men-fche y have proved their bravery; but there is something better almost than bravery, and that is the skill and discretion which avoid slaughter ancl defeat, ancl even those of us who cannot presume fco judge military men, know well enough-becaus e the lesson is written in characters too plain for any one to misunderstand-thaf c the old style of tactics, which took masses of heroic men to slaughter, must be changed. Bravery is counting for less and less, mere human impact is counting for less and less. It isfchafcmysterious conflict of genius, as expressed in the implements and munitions of warfare and in the brains of great generals ; it is thafc mysterious conflict of forces which will now determine the fate of armies ancl empires, ancl we who glory in fche tough valour whidh carried Britain through so many glorious difficulties, had better be warned in time. We had better remember that we are but a handful of people, who are claiming the richest and largest part of fche surface of the earth. We must remember thafc if there is a community of communities which clown to its furthest extremity should be alive to the wants of to-day, ifc is that wonderful series of communities which form this British Empire. I here again say that this is a Bill over which no sense of party spirit should ever come. iWe must feel that, small as our population is to-day, ifc is confronted with mighty risks. We may feel proud of the mighty strength of the British Empire, butfchetask we have now afc defence of this Commonwealth. Thirty years ago, when the councils of littleEngland prevailed, .

Of course while we talk about the necessity of founding these systems of defence, let ns neverforget that war is a horror; let us never forget that with all the glitter and glory of deeds of heroism on the field all these are black, dark chapters in the progress of humanity.
