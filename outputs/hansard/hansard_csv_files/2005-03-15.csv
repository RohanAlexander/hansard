Anti-Vehicle Land Mines (Question No. 442) (1) What representations has the Government recently made at an international level in respect of the banning of anti-vehicle land mines. (2) Does Australia intend to participate in the development of international measures to ban antivehicle land mines; if so, what will be the nature of Australia’s involvement in that campaign. (1) None. (2) There are no international measures involving states currently under development to ban antivehicle mines (AVMs). The majority of countries do not support a complete ban on AVMs. Australia strongly supports efforts by states parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) to build a consensus that would allow the commencement of negotiations for a protocol to the CCW restricting the use of AVMs. Australia is a co-sponsor of the “30-nation proposal”, proposed at CCW meetings, which aims to make all AVMs detectable and ensure that all remotelydelivered mines self-destruct/self-neutralise and self-deactivate.
