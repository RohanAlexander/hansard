0,"Since The Inquiry I Ask For Would Not Involve A Very Great Expenditure, And The Infor","mation obtained would .be of invaluable assistance to us in dealing with-as we shall have to do-the amendment of the existing electoral law. Wherever a member sits, he must be interested in obtaining electoral machinery which will work as economically as possible, and will secure the fairest and fullest expression of public opinion possible. The Act under which our elections are now carried out was introduced by its author, the honourable member for Hume, as the most up-todate measure in the world, but it has signally failed to maintain that reputation. I admit that in the first operation of an Electoral Act covering so large an area as Australia, and varying the electoral practices of the States of the Union, a certain amount of trouble and friction was almost inevitable; and no doubt many of the difficulties and much of the annoyance which has been experienced can be obviated by remedial legislation. As such legislation is so obviously necessary, I have taken an early opportunity to submit this motion, so that in our consideration of an amending Bill, we may be guided by the experience of other countries, and know the most recent modern improvements for the conduct of elections. which I wish to secure has not only to do with mechanical instruments for the registration and counting of votes, but also with the obtaining of information which may lead to the introduction of other methods to secure economy, celerity, and efficiency in the conduct of elections. House that it is impossible for any honourable member to speak to the question when' conversations so many and so loud are proceeding within the Chamber. I must ask honourable members to give attention to the honourable member addressing the Chamber. Mr G. B. EDWARDSI am afraid that the motion is being discussed at rather an inopportune time. cussion at this juncture has been given to suit the convenience of honourable members opposite. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -A t the same time, the subject is one which should re-' ceive consideration. There is another motion on the notice-paper which deals with the same subject, and might be held to be wider in its scope than is this motion,' but I still think that it would be wise to adopt the course I propose, because of the very valuable assistance which the suggested inquiry would give in the future consideration of the reform of our electoral law. During the recent elections the utmost friction and difficulty occurred, not only in those cases where the decisions were subsequently challenged in the High Court but in every electorate throughout the Commonwealth, and, to a great extent, the failure to obtain a sufficiently full expression of opinion from the people to be regarded as a national verdict was caused by the inadequacy of the machinery provided for the enrolment of electors ancl for the collection of votes. In city and country alike, numerous difficulties were encountered by the officers intrusted with the administration of the Act. Every one of those with whom I have spoken-intelligen t and picked officials-hav e admitted to me that they have found difficulty in interpreting the Act, or in discovering instruments for carrying out its evident intention. The postal voting provisions caused many serious difficulties, and I am_of the opinion now, as I was when the Electoral Bill was before us, that, without greater safeguards, the postal voting system provided for is open to the grossest abuse. I do not say that it was. greatly abused during the recent The information elections, but our experience then is sufficient to show that it may be largely abused during subsequent elections. Difficulties also arose in regard to the application of Form Q, and many of the other forms provided for in the Act. In regard to those provisions, too, there is great danger of. abuse. The provision, for example, for limiting the amount to be expended by candidates in contesting elections is notoriously insufficient to carry out the end we had in view. It is, in fact, inoperative in every respect. For my part, I made a return of my expenses in accordance with the requirements of the Act, but I am given to understand that many honourable members have made no returns whatever, and I am further informed that if they fail in this respect, or if, upon their furnishing particulars, it is found that their expenses were in excess of the maximum allowed by the Act, there is no power to punish them or to declare their seats vacant. When we were discussing the BillI pointed out that if we could not enforce such a provision it should not be embodied in the measure. The Bill was recommended to us by the honourable member for Hume as the most perfect piece of legislation of its character",14,Setup

2,Mr Fisher,"An opportunity for its disever introduced into any Parliament. The honourable member resisted all efforts made by myself and others to safeguard the postal voting provision, and stated that the matter had received such careful consideration that it was quite unnecessary to adopt additional precautions against abuses. YetI should think that the honourable member himself must now admit that the Act requires amendment. If this be granted, and if a Select Committee be necessary, the inquiry would be made in view of the actual operation of the Act during the recent general election. We should, however, go further, and issue a commission to some one to visit other countries where they have had as great or even greater experience than our own in regard to the secret ballot system. Such a Commissioner could bring back to us such information as would enable us to consider how far we could make use of the' modern improvements adopted in other parts of the world. It would be impossible for me to indicate the nature of these improvements in detail, but with regard to the forms adopted for preventing undue influence and bribery, for precluding candidates from incurring undue expense, for recording votes, and for insuring as large a vote as possible, it may be taken for granted that the ""United States, Germany, Belgium, and even Great Britain itself would, as the result of their experience, be able to give us practical assistance. ber propose to allow the Gommission to travel to the countries mentioned? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Certainly , but I do not for a moment suggest that any undue expense should be incurred. Next to the late Treasurer, I am probably one of the most economical members of this House. surer. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -And the present Treasurer. I do not wish the Government to incur any unnecessary expense. My suggestion is that some intelligent official whose experience in electoral matters may be regarded as qualifying him for the work should be selected as the sole Commissioner to obtain this information. I am' not prepared at this stage to say who should be appointed, but I believe that a f u l ly competent officer could be found. It would not be necessary to appoint more than one Commissioner. It may be urged that such information as I have indicated could readily be secured by means of written communications with the Governments of the countries referred to, but such particulars as could be obtained by that means might be derived from the books in our library, and would be of very little assistance to us. What we require is that a qualified officer should visit the countries mentioned, and interrogate the officials there with regard to the working of their electoral systems, and should, if possible, see an election in progress. Many of the States of America, have, amongst other things, adopted mechanical contrivances, which not only register the votes recorded, but enable the declaration of the .poll to be made almost simultaneously with the closing of the doors to the public. Just as we, in some' of our public institutions have turnstiles for registering the number of visitors, and for indicating immediately the doors are closed the number of persons who have passed through during the day, so, in the case of the voting machines to which I have referred, when the last man has passed through and the.doors are closed, the indices can be unlocked, and the officials can at once see how many votes have been cast for Brown, Jones, or Robinson, and who has been elected. ' This is not a chimerical idea. Such, machines are in use, and, according to writers in the magazines, have made a saving equivalent to their whole cost in the course of three elections. If that be so, we should, as common-sense individuals, consider whether it would not be desirable to introduce similar machines into the Commonwealth. These contrivances have one important point in their favour. They entirely do away with disputed and informal votes, because once a vote is registered by the machine it cannot be recalled. The moment the voter manipulates the machine he records his vote, and no question can be raised as to the way in which he has exercised his right. This may, at first sight, appear to be a disadvantage, but honourable members will, upon reflection, recognise that the reverse is the case. The worse that can be said about informal votes, is that, according to the law of averages, they are likely to inflict as great a hardship upon one candidate as upon the other. Therefore, by eliminating them altogether in the way suggested we should do no harm, but save ourselves a great deal of trouble.

This is almost the sole mark a little at variance with what is preWith regard to The polling is concluded at 6 As contrasted with a distinct advantage, which would compensate us for the expense incurred in procuring the machines for use in at least the large city and suburban electorates. Apart from this, there are many other points which we shall be bound to consider as time goes on. is the question of compulsory voting. The members of this Parliament, as well as the citizens generally, are dissatisfied to find that so few electors take the trouble to record their votes. This apathy on the part of the electors is largely due to the diflSculties that are placed in the way of many of those who desire to become enrolled, and to record their votes; with the result that they become disheartened and take no further interest in the elections. On these grounds I think that the appointment of a skilled and intelligent Commissioner, who would visit various countries and obtain valuable information that would assist us in framing machinery which would lead to the enrolment of the greatest number of voters, and afford the fullest facility for electors to vote, would be of much -advantage. I do not say that I am in favour of compulsory voting; but I certainly think that something should be done to induce electors to record their votes. The compulsory system has been adopted in Belgium, with the result that the number of non-voters has been reduced to 6 per cent. There a man who fails to go to the poll is mulcted in a small fine unless he is able to give some reasonable excuse for his neglecting to vote. As we all know, the percentage of voters who . absent themselves from the some of the States is something like 60 per cent., instead of 6 per cent. Such a state of affairs is deplorable. In a country professedly democratic from east to west, and north to south, it is most regrettable to find persons who have the freest and most democratic Constitution in the world displaying so little interest in it that they do not trouble to record their votes at a general election; and the House will, sooner or later, have to consider whether it is not desirable to adopt some system of compulsion or inducement in order that we may secure a clearer expression of opinion on the part of the electors' than we now obtain. able member say should be followed? Mr G. B . ' ED WARDS -The honourable gentleman must bear in mind that I am seeking the appointment of a Commissioner, in order that we may ascertain the best lines to adopt. If we could devise any system that would reduce the number of non-voters in the Commonwealth to 6 per cent., we should secure a great national advantage. The Commissioner would obtain valuable For instance, there information, not only in this direction, but in many other ways that we have not yet considered, and would be able to place before us a report that would show in a practical way the amendments which are necessary, in our electoral law. The appointment would not involve any large expenditure. An outlay of about _£i,ooo would be sufficient, and, if for that expenditure we could obtain this information direct from a skilful official, who had witnessed the working of various systems in other lands, we should accomplish a great work at a very moderate cost. It was once suggested in this House that, in the interests of economy, an effort should be made to obtain, by means of a conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States, a uniform franchise, and a uniform relation between the States and Federal constituencies, so that the cost of compiling the rolls, and. to a great extent, the cost of printing them would be materially reduced. If such a scheme could be devised, the one set of expenses would cover everything, and we should secure simplicity in the mechanism necessary for conducting a general election. I do not know of anv direction in which larger savings could be effected than by the adoption of some general system which would render it necessary to print only one set of rolls, and require only polling places in one set of applications to remedy defects in them. The proposition is so simple that, it is surprising that intelligent Ministers have not taken action to ascertain whether it is not possible to induce the States to f a l l into line, and to adopt coterminous electorates, so that by the addition of three or four States electorates, a Federal district could be formed. Mr O'MALLEY -That would suit both the States and Commonwealth. MrG B. EDWARDS -Yes. : of rolls for the States and the Commonwealth. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We should thus have to incur but the one expense.

With that I am quite prepared to agree. The two motions on the notice-paper dealing with the subject 'of elections refer to clear and distinct issues. The motion now before the House proposes the appointment of a Commissioner to inquire into the conduct of elections outside of Australia. The subsequent motion on the paper deals with the conduct of elections in Australia, and particularly of the last general electjon. With regard to the conduct of elections outside of Australia, we have established here an elaborate Electoral Department, with a permanent head and inspectors. Parliament has not been parsimonious in its establishment, and the question naturally arises whether, when we require the information suggested in this motion, it is necessary that w'e should incur extra expense by the appointment of Select Committees or Royal Commissions to secure it. not the case If the Electoral Department is to serve any purpose whatever it may surely be expected to be able to inform the Minister in charge of what is being done, not only in the Commonwealth, but elsewhere, in connection with electoral matters ? What is proposed in the motion is merely the transference of responsibility for the supply of this information from the Minister or his Department to a Select Committee or Royal Commission. I have been pleased to hear the Minister in charge of the Department accept the f u l l responsibility, and assert his confidence that the Department with the resources at its disposal can secure the information asked I do not propose to for, bring it up-to-date, and keep it up-todate. If the Department is not competent to perform that function we are entitled to know what it is doing, and why it should continue in existence. I have been pleased to hear the Minister explain that the responsibility will be rightly placed, and that he will insist upon the Department getting such information as will enable him to keep us abreast of the world in electoral matters. cur in the general terms of the motion pro? posed by the honourable member for South Sydney, and also with the view expressed that it is to be hoped that it will not result in the appointment of an expensive roving Commission. I agree with the last speaker, that the Electoral Department should have power within itself to collect all the necessary^ information. I believe that one or two mechanical contrivances were submitted to the late Minister for Home Affairs, and I shall be glad to have the assurance of the present Minister that an opportunity will be given to examine the merits of these contrivances. I would ask the honourable gentleman to secure the permission of Mr Speaker to have one of these machines exhibited in some part of the House. I think it would be found worthy of consideration.

It is clear, therefore, that there must be some methods in existence which are a great improvement on the absurd methods adopted here.

The honorable member proposes that the. question of compulsory voting shall be looked into, and also the method of getting names on and off the electoral roll, which, in my opinion, is a matter of equal importance. It ' has been our experience in South Australia that the names of persons who have been dead ten vears are still on the rolls in that State,'and the returning officers state that until they are notified by the Registrar of Births and Deaths they have no power In some of the States to remove them. A more serious matter is that in South Australia a certain organization has been in the habit of striking off the rolls the names of many persons who have continued to reside in the same district, and even in the same house. It is highly necessary that something should be done to prevent that procedure. Another matter to which I might direct attention is that persons who have been in the habit of putting names on the roll have left electoral claims to be filled up, and in my own experience I have found that the represenI tative of a certain conservative institution",20,Setup

I have known certain persons to have had their claims sent in, but the claims of persons likely to vote for progressive candidates, as against conservative candidates, have been destroyed. We should do something to prevent this kind of thing. Mr O'MALLEY -They should be sent to gaol. I should have been only too glad to prosecute the persons responsible if I could have obtained the necessary evidence. It is very dimcult, however, to get sufficient proof. I could give the name of one individual who is doing this thing, and could prove that the papers were collected, but I could not prove that they had not been handed in. The returning officer could say that he did not receive them, and I could not show that this ""person was responsible. In my opinion, an inquiry should be made into the matter. If we .introduce counting and registering machines we need not incur the expenditure suggested by the Minister for Home Affairs, because, at'the beginning, at all events, it would be quite sufficient to use them only in the largely populated centres. The present system, if properly administered, will be quite sufficient for districts where there are only a few persons on the roll. Compulsory voting prevails not only in Belgium, but in many of the Swiss cantons, and there has been no attempt to abolish it I think it is deplorable that so few of our electors record their votes, and the fact mentioned by the honourable member for South Sydney, that only 6 per cent, do not record their votes in Belgium, should convince the Government of the need to do something in the matter. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion. general terms of the motion. As a Commission is likely to be appointed to inquire into the matters with wbich it deals there is no objection to the appointment of a Commission. quiry should be made, and that it should be extended beyond the scope suggested by the honourable member for South Sydney. We sbould, at an early date, take into consideration sought for, because the Electoral Detion the adoption of some system of effective voting which will prevent candidates for whom a minority of the votes polled' have been cast being returned. Under present conditions not only is such a thing possible, but it actually takes place in many cases where there are several candidates. I am sure that some system could be found which would make it impossible, no matter how many candidates presented themselves, for any one for whom a minority of the votes polled had been cast to be returned; and the adoption of such a system would make it unnecessary to limit the choice of electors, because as many candidates as chose to do so could come forward, and the electors could freely discriminate between them. Therefore, I suggest that the scope of the inquiry be widened to include the investigation of proposed methods of effective voting. the greatest sympathy with the objects of the mover of the motion, but I object to any expenditure-being incurred for an inquiry when we have already in existence a costly Electoral' Department which ought to be able to do this work for us without additional expense. The Department is now so large that the Government should be able to obtain from it all possible information upon methods of voting. As a rule a general election will take place only once every three years, though, of course, more frequent dissolutions will occasionally occur; and in the interim a good live Electoral Department will keep itself posted in all information relating to elections. Not only is it the duty of the Department to do so, but the Minister at the head of it should see that it is in a position to supply him with any information that mav be required as to the voting systems of the world. Such information can be easily and simply obtained. We know that some alteration of our present electoral system is necessary. For instance, there should be a change in the method of collecting our rolls. In many of the States the franchise for the House of Assembly is the same as that for the Federal Parliament, one adult one vote, and I see no reason why an arrangement could not be come to between the Governments pf such States and this Government for using the same sets of rolls. Such an arrangement would be simple, and would effect a decided saving.

I am further opposed to the motion because I think that we cannot be too careful about committing ourselves to expenditure.

In many cases officers were appointed who had had no previous experience in the conduct of electionsI n my district a Commonwealth officer was at the head of affairs who had never before had to do with the conduct of elections, but he posted himself up in the provisions of the Act, and took others into his confidence, and was thus able to carry through the election without a hitch. I think that when the next general election occurs, the officers will have become acquainted with their duties, and we shall be satisfied with the manner in which the Act is administered. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). I am pleased that the Minister has not objected to the motion. He is in sympathy with it, though he is not prepared to send a Commissioner abroad to obtain information. The motion, however, expressly declares that the information may be secured by a Commissioner "" or otherwise."" But although the sending of an officer abroad to make inquiries is not insisted upon, a great deal is to be said in favour of that course, since it is not so easy to obtain the necessary information through the medium The proposal is of the post-office. Often one writes for information, and obtains what purports to be a f u l l reply, but the answer given is not always f u l l , and one being ignorant of what there is to be known on the subject, is often left almost in a worse position than he would have been in without any information at all. It is only from a man who has seen machinery in operation that one is able to obtain f u l l information regarding it. I am fortified in this attitude by a remark of Professpr Sidgewick, who has written largely on political science. He has studied more than most writers the operation of the Constitutions of the various European countries, both by investigating those Constitutions where they are written, and by devoting himself to the study of their, historical development. His book upon the Development of European PolityI n Tasmania the House has been published since his death, but it was his intention to proceed to the various countries of which he writes, and to live in' each of them for a lengthy period, in order to obtain a thorough grasp of the operation of their Constitutions at the present day. He said truly, that it is not in A good deal of blame has the written document of a Constitution, or in the history of its development which is to be gained from the books in libraries that you can obtain a true grip of its real operation to-day. If that is true of facts in regard to which most of us think the fullest information is to be obtained from the books inour libraries, it is still more true of the operation of intricate and complicated mechanical appliances and administrative forms for the conduct of an election. There is always an outcry against expenditure, but there may be truer economy in spending money in a wise, undertaking than in objecting to such expenditure. The inquiry which I suggest can be conducted by a capable officer for a few hundred's of pounds, in addition to his ordinary salary, and the money would be well spent. However, I am prepared to stand by the motion, and to leave it to the Government to say whether they will send a Commissioner abroad. A private business man, if he wished to obtain reliable information updn the working of any machinery or system connected with an office or factory, would not content himself with writing abroad for",22,Setup
41,Mr Storrer (Bass),"I shall opposea description, however f u l l and elaborate; he would adopt the more sensible plan of picking out a man, and sending him abroad to make inquiries on the spot, so that upon his return he could learn every detail. It has been said that we should be able to obtain all needful information from our electoral oflicers. That is an absurd objection to my proposal. If the present electoral system is not working well, it is not to those in charge of it that Ave should apply for methods of improvement. Officials are always inclined to become case-hardened, and to move in a rut. I.t is natural for them to take the view that the methods in existence are under all circumstances the best possible. I do not say that the Minister could not obtain a smart, up-to-date, official, who would satisfactorily act as a Commissioner to make inquiry abroad, but if he relies wholly on his Department for information and advice in regard to necessary or desirable reforms, he will be relying If we rely exclusively upon those who areworking in the Department to keep everything up to date, our system will probably become thoroughly rotten, and develop all the diseases of bureaucracy. The best course to adopt is to select an intelligent man who canHnquire into the whole question, and make recommendations as to the best methods to adopt. Question resolved in the affirmative. 1. That, in view of the unsatisfactory manner in which the last general elections were conducted throughout the Commonwealth, a Select Committee be appointed to investigate and report upon the administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and to report results of such investigation to this House. 2. That such Select Committee consist of Mr allowed to continue there will be a much Batchelor, Mr Fowler, Mr Groom, Mr Mauger, Sydney Smith, Mr Storrer, Mr Dugald Thomson, Mr Maloney, and the mover. 3. That such Committee have power to send for persons, papers, and records, and that four be the quorum of such Committee. I think that honourable members will agree with me that it is very desirable to secure efficient administration of cur Electoral Act. We have placed upon our statute-book one of the most liberal and democratic measures, and our desire is that every adult Jn the Commonwealth should not only have the right to vote, but also possess every facility for exercising that right. If our object is to be attained, .the legislative enactment must be accompanied by efficient administration. I am willing to admit that the Electoral Department has had considerable difficulties to overcome. They had to apply a new system, and to contend against the misunderstanding which necessarily attended the introduction of conditions differing from those with which the electors of the various States were previously familiar. In other words, they had to educate the people to the point of enabling tliem to take f u l l advantage of the facilities provided. Further, there were inexplicable delays in connection with the redistribution of the electoral divisions, and the preparation of the rolls, and these deprived the officers of the Electoral Department of that ample time which was necessary to enable them to make perfect arrangements for carrving out the election. Then the Government, for reasons which have been strongly condemned, decided not to proceed with the work of redistributing the electorates in upon a very weak reed. Victoria and New South Wales, and therefore a large amount of work performed by the Department proved to be absolutely useless. Whilst making every allowance for these difficulties, however, my observations have led me 'to the conclusion that the Department was lamentably lacking inits administrative work. It is because of this, and because of the vital importance of having an efficient Department to administer matters relating to the exercise of the Commonwealth franchise, that I feel impelled to ask for an investigation. I do not wish to say too much with regard to matters of detail. It will be sufficient to point out that, as the outcome of the defective administration of the Department, two elections have been declared void on technical grounds; and we may fairly assume that if present conditions are larger number of appeals to the High Court engage the .serious attention of the House. I was in the very fortunate position of not being called upon to contest an election, but I could plainly see from the way in which the arrangements were carried out that there would have been ample room for anv one who wished to move in the direction of having an election declared invalid. For instance, it is provided in the schedule of the Act that a candidate shall be nominated by at least six electors whose names, polling places, places of residence, and numbers on the roll shall be given. I postponed my visit to my electorate for the purpose of",23,Setup

This Is A Matter Which Should","nomination until the very latest date, and, upon calling upon the returning officer, found that he was not in a position to supply me with the numbers on the roll opposite the names of the electors who had signed my ---nomination paper. The roll was still in the hands of the Government Printer, and was incomplete, and it was only by making a special arrangement that I was able to obtain the particulars necessary to comply with the requirements of the Act. If I had been a country candidate, and unable to bring myself into close touch with the Government Printer in Sydney, the probabilities are that I should have been unable to furnish all the information required, and that my nomination might have been declared informal , on that account. again, when it transpired that there would be no contest in my district, far ""as the House of Representatives was concerned, Officer seemed to overlook the fact that a poll would have to be taken for the purposes of the Senate election, and issued instructions to the returning officers to the effect that all should be applied. their expenses should be reduced by about 50 per cent. The result was that, in common with many other honourable members, I have been put to a great deal of trouble in my attempts to secure the payment of the fees due to the officers employed in connection with the election. Although months ago I was told by the Minister for Home Affairs that all payments had been made, and was also assured by the officers of the Department that everything had been settled, I discovered weeks afterwards that nothing had been done. Upon making a closer investigation, I was informed that some small hitch had occurred, and that if upon investigation everything was found to be in order paynients would be made within two or three days. A month afterwards, however, I was told that theaccountswerestill unsettled. Some of these accounts still remain in the same unsatisfactory condition, a fact that displays a lamentable want of competency on the part of some one in the Department. I know that from the very outset it was the intention of the Department to select officers for this work from the Public Service of the Commonwealth. It was felt at the time that the duties could be discharged by officials of the Postal, Customs, and other Departments who were under the direct control of the Government of the Commonwealth; but I pointed out to the Minister in charge of the Department, as well as to the House, that great difficulties would arise if the. Government insisted upon giving immediate effect to their proposal. I drew attention to the fact that the officers of the service, however competent they might be, had not the experience necessary to fit them for so .complicated and extensive a work, and I strongly recommended the Department to utilize the services of the old State officials, at least to the extent necessary to secure efficiency at the then approaching elections. That suggestion was, to some extent, adopted; but as the result of a recent visit to my electorate I do not hesitate to say that State officials who were engaged in connection with the elections are so greatly dissatisfied with their treatment, that unless the DeThen, partment is prepared to keep faith with them to a greater extent than was the case so in connection with the last elections, their services will not be at the disposal of the the Chief Electoral Government at the next. These are important matters which call for strict investigation, and if , upon inquiry, the charges made can be substantiated, the remedy I have, so far, dealt only with the administrative machinery of the Electoral Office, and when we come to consider the position of the electors themselves-the people who are vitally affected -w e discover that their grievances are intense. In the first place, as the result, apparently, of the outcry that persons had removed from country districts to various cities only to return to their old homes as the result of the breaking of the drought, it was taken for granted that these changes had occurred on a larger scale than was actually the case. The result was that, in dealing with the revision of the rolls. relating to all the cities, the Department endeavoured to strike off as many names as it could, and apparently paid no regard to the equally important duty of ascertaining whether those who were qualified to vote were duly enrolled. came under my notice in which persons who had shifted from one street to another in the same electorate were struck off the rolls, and were not afforded an opportunity to rectify this blunder. A great many of those who inspected the rolls as originally compiled, and found that their names had been duly enrolled, went to the booths on polling day satisfied that, as they had not received any notice of objection, they were qualified to record their votes.

It must, I think, be apparent to us all, as it is to the general public, that a great deal of friction, at least, arose in connection with the last general election. In my own electorate quite a number of people, apparently through no fault of their own, were disfranchised. Even if the proposed inquiry should not disclose any fault on the part of the officials, it may result in the collection of information which will enable us more easily to correct defects in the law, thus preventing similar friction, inconvenience, and disfranchisement in the future. From that poini of view, the Government have no objection to offer to the motion. ded the motion fro forma, I should like, if it is permissible for me so to do, to make a reservation with respect to the second paragraph, because T think that possibly, in1 may, perhaps, be stead of selecting the gentlemen whose names-are mentioned therein, it might be considered advisable to select the members of the proposed Committee by ballot.

In my own electorate the residents of whole streets, including some of the main business thoroughfares, were left off the rolls, and people who had been resident voters in the district for forty years were deprived of the franchise. It also happened in many instances that members of the same family, living in the same house, found themselves distributed over eight different polling-places in various parts of the electorate. In some instances they had to pass three polling booths on the way to the one for which they had been set down in the Hsts. This was due to a new arrangement whereby voters were compelled to vote at a particular booth. scheme of the Act. administration one would naturally suppose speaking upon these ""matters, I have no that the members of one family, living in desire to cast any reflection upon the returnthe same house, would be allotted to one polling officers, presiding officers, and poll ing booth.

It is a scandalous state of things, and the fact that it existed calls at least for inquiry. There is also this to be complained about, that, so far . as Sydney is concerned, up to the date of the election, it was almost impossible for electors to obtain information which should be open to them. The most absolute secrecy was observed in connection with matters which were of public concern, and it was impossible to obtain information from officers connected with the Sydney Electoral Office. Persons who sought informatipn from them were curtly refused, or were referred to the Melbourne office, a circumlocutory method which will not, I trust, find sympathy with many members of this House.

They will be corrected by the Revision Courts, as is necessary. Every endeavour is being made to examine the rolls so as to have names struck off by the Revision Courts, in the case of persons who have left the districts for which they are enrolled,, or who have died. be put on ? Sir JOHN FORREST exactly what the machinery is, but there are means by which every one can put himself on the roll, and can be put on. registrars attend to that matter, and there is no difficulty in getting on. Every endeavour is being made to make the rolls as complete and as accurate as they should be. t believe that the honourable' member for Melbourne will agree with me that there are on the Melbourne roll some thousands of names of persons who were not to be found at the last election. sons who voted at the last Melbourne election was the tenth in the list of proportions recorded throughout Australia. Sir JOHN FORREST I am not referring to those who voted, but to those who were on the rolls, and were not to be found by the canvassers. There were, so I was informed, a great number of such cases. There is, of course, considerable room for care in having the rolls brought up to date. [ think that one of the things that gave most annoyance at the last general election was the new system by which persons were required-it was not compulsory, but still it was intended-to vote at certain polling places. Many persons did not know the name of the polling place to which they had to go. They had not taken the trouble to look. They went to the polling place where they thought they had to vote, and were told to go to"" another one. They were not told that they could vote under form Q as absent voters. great many persons exercised the franchise under form Q when there would have been no occasion to do so if they had known the polling place at which they ought to have voted. people frequently found that they were not enrolled. difficulty, a system was proposed which would, however, entail a large expenditure, even from the point of view of postage. It was proposed that every person throughout Australia should be informed of the name of the polling place at which he was enrolled, and at which he should vote, There is no other way in which the difficulty can be overcome. I believe that in South Australia there is an excellent plan by which, when the census is taken, the officials also' circulate slips to show electors the polling place at which they are entitled to vote. That system of course I do not know gets over the difficulty. But every elector ought to know before a general election takes place at which polling place he The is enrolled and where he should record his vote. He ought to be able to go there and vote quickly, and without any trouble. I cannot help saying that notwithstanding the complaints which are made in regard to persons not being upon the rolls, not a very large proportion of those who were enrolled took the trouble to exercise the franchise. I hear very little about that point. I do not suppose that honourable members are inclined to quarrel with the voting. They are inclined to think that it w.as not a bad system that returned them to this House. Most of us, perhaps, are not inclined to condemn altogether a system which has proved so satisfactory to ourselves individually. But the fact remains that not a large proportion of those who were on the rolls took the trouble to vote. We hear a great deal about certain prominent persons, whose names have been upon the electoral rolls for the States for a good many years past, going to exercise their vote, and finding that their names were not on the Federal roll. Perhaps there is some reason for the omission in many cases. When such complaints are made, it is placarded in the newspapers that a certain prominent man found that he was disfranchised. My reply is"" Why did he not take the trouble to look during the month that the rolls were exhibited ?

I can see no harm whatever that can be done by the proposed investigation; indeed, the more the matter is investigated, the better for all of us. I believe,' however, that when the investigation is completed it will not be possible to say that there has been any want of zeal, application, or determination on the part of those intrusted with the management of the Electoral Branch in any endeavour to achieve the best and most satisfactory results. Sydney) WhilstI quite admit that an inquiry of the sort suggested' may not be as needful now as it was at an earlier stage, I have no objection whatever to such a Committee being appointed, for the purpose of giving what information can be gathered for our future guidance in the conduct of electoral matters. AllI have to say on the motion may be expressed in very few words. The constitution of this Committee-whic h will have to deal with matters affecting all members of the House-if it had any party complexion previously, has no party complexion to-day. might have been held responsible by such a Committee does not now occupy his seat on the Treasury benches; and under the circumstances, I think the representation on the Committee ought to be as equally as possible divided throughout the House. As we have three practically equal sections in the Chamber, the Committee ought to be divided into three parts. speaking from a personal point of view, because, although my name appears amongst those proposed as members of the Committee. I have requested the mover to remove it, as. I anticipate claims on my time which would interfere with my attendance. the composition of the Committee, because I thought that the honourable member for Canobolas was anxious to give the different States representation, members of the Committee in order to secure State representation, without any reference learn that the motion is to be altered in the to party. think that the honourable member was right, and that the different States ought to be represented on the Committee. But we have also to remember the fact that circumstances have changed since the. proposed Committee was first nominated; and I believe it will be in the interests of the House generally to have upon it an equal representation of all sections. I say that with the desire that some other honourable member should take my place, as I should prefer, for reasons which I have given, not to be on the Committee. There has been a list p pared, which, fairly representing as it does the various sections of the House, may do away with the necessity for a ballota mode of selection which I do not recognise as the best possible in this case. at this motion, I noticed two things: first of all how necessary it was, and how in accord with the feeling of the whole House, an investigation such as that proposed would be; and, secondly, that the investigation is proposed to be carried out by practically one party ,in.the House. I do not think that that party would wish to gain complete control over the investigation of electoral' matters. I am quite sure that they do not wish to get the conduct of electoral matters completely into their own hands, consequently, I anticipate that they will not object to having the three parties in the House properly The Minister who represented. that.

110,Mr Kelly,"I am only too glad tostanding the various complaints which have been made. I fail to see the necessity for the appointment of a Select Committee to make an investigation at the present time. It appears to me to involve purely a-waste of time, and to be another effort to shift the responsibility. I do not think that a single objection may be made in regard to administration or incidents under the Electoral Act which has not been called attention to in their report by the electoral officers. If a Select Committee is appointed the probability is that the amendment of the Act may be deferred for a very considerable time-perhap s its recommendations may not be given effect to before another election is held. have been made about the Electoral Act, I think the whole position is summed up in the statement of the honourable member for Swan. They are to be attributed to the fact that the conditions and circumstances were entirely new. The first great trouble -was due to the delay in the publication of the rolls as they were compiled. Honourable members who sat in the last House are fully aware of the reason why the publication' was delayed. that an attempt might be made-owing , to objections raised in the House-to get the rolls made more complete. It was felt that a very considerable number of names had been omitted. drawn to that fact, the late Minister for Home Affair's' stated that he would have further inquiries made, and this delayed the publication of the rolls. Then, when the rolls were compiled, the time between the date of their exhibition to the public and the date of the holding of the Revision Courts was very short, and although an instruction was issued that applications from those whose names had not appeared on the rolls some six or eight days before the meeting of the Revision Courts in . order that they might have a chance of being placed on the supplementary rolls, it was found impossible to have such names returned to the Revision Courts in order that they might be dealt with, or any inquiry might be made. Consequently, it was a scratch business from beginning to end. Although the Electoral Act clearly provides that all applications and claims submitted to certain authorities before the issue of the writ must be considered, and qualified persons be enrolled and allowed to vote on election day, still, it was known to the Department, and even to honourable members, that it was absolutely impossible to do so. That is a reasonable ground for complaint. It is within the knowledge of honourable members that the conditions were such as I have described, and therefore what good can be gained by holding an inquiry in that direction ? We are as fully seized of all these facts as are the officers of the Department. In the case of my own districta district not far removed from a central office, and well supplied with postal facilities-the applications of some persons were lodged on the eve of the issue of the writs; and yet, owing to the time required for holding an inquiry, it was found absolutely impossible to get that information, As regards the complaints which and to have the names enrolled, and the amended rolls returned to the officers by election day. great many cases where it was possible-where the names of many thousands of persons were not placed on the roll. stances where, to all outward appearances, it should have been possible. An apIt was done in order plicant was within a day's postal communication from the central office, and half a day's postal communication from the divisional returning officer; and yet, owing to the time which would have been occupied When his attention was in sending his name to the central office, and, inquiry by the proper authorities as to the validity or otherwise of theapplication, it was found absolutely! impossible to have the names placed upon the roll. When that state of affairs prevails under the conditions I have stated, although so many facilities ar-j provided, what possible chance of being enrolled would a person have in the remote districts of New South'. Wales or Queensland? It is in that direction that attention should be lodged must be given. Again, a great many electors, owing to the conditions being novel, did not know whom they should apply to; and it was practically not until nomination day that electoral registrars were appointed throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I know that in many instancesI could cite a few cases in my own district-thes e officers were not provided -.with the necessary forms with which to meet the requirements of such applicants as might appeal to them within the specified time. Is it necessary now to appoint a Select Committee to waste more time ?",33,Elector Al Administration

113,Mr Kennedy,"I am quoting into pursue an investigation which is absolutely imperative. these complaints voiced on the floor of the House, and if the Electoral Department has any justification for its existence, it should consist in. the fact that it possesses this information, and is in a position to cope with the difficulties which have been presented through the operation of the Act. Again, with regard to voting, we know that in some States-in Victoria for instancethe method of recording votes was a departure from that which had prevailed for many years. I have heard many electors throughout this State express the opinion that the new plan of an elector marking a cross opposite the name of tbe candidate for'whom he wishes to vote, is preferable to the old method of scoring through the name of the candidate for whom he did not wish to vote. the cross led to a number of complications in the recent test case. it was a new departure, but how few informal votes were recorded in South Australia, where this system has been in operation for a considerable number of years. All the electors to whom I have spoken on the subject admit that it is preferable to the booth within a few miles of their residence"" old Victorian system, particularly when the ballot-paper contains twenty or twenty-five names, and the elector has to vote for only four candidates. In the case of the first general elections to this Parliament, the old plan of scoring through the names of the candidates caused more informal votes than did anything else. I think that experience has shown that the Federal system is a great improvement on the old Victorian method. . With regard to the right of electorsto,vote at any polling place within their constituency, and the grouping of electors on the roll,a great deal of annoyance and inconvenience was caused to electors, owing to the fact that, in the-first instance, the police, instead of being told to compile the rolls and group the electors according to their residence or location round the polling booths, received no instruction except to send the roll. It might be possible that rolls in the names in batches, the grouping being attempted to be done in the central office. In the case of my electorate the name of every person in one district was sent in to the central office in batches, yet when the rolls were published the names of as many as 100 persons-al l the residents in one parish, in which there had been a polling booth for twenty-five years-ha d been omitted from the polling list.

I know a nummarking of ber of instances in the Mansfield district where the names of the members of a family, consisting of six or seven persons, should, owing to their location, have appeared on the same polling list, but were placed on no less than four polling lists. They were expected to go a distance of perhaps thirty or forty miles, right across a watershed, when there was a polling All that people required to do was to satisfy themselves that their names appeared on some roll, but unfortunately they could see only the list pertaining to their own polling booth. They had not an opportunity of seeing the list pertaining to a polling place perhaps forty or .fifty miles distant m the same division. Consequently they thought that their names had been struck off the rolls. Again, some persons who knew that their names were on the roll were not aware that they could vote at any polling booth within their constituency, and, worse than that, a stupid provision was put inform Q I believe by the House. provision about putting in the number on had been in existence for a considerable time, but the rolls used at the last general elections were, as the honourable member for Swan said, only published in portions of New South Wales a few days before that event.

Of course, it is not possible that I should have heard every complaint that had been made, but every complaint that I have heard, both inside and outside the House, is dealt with here. The experience of honourable members, and their knowledge of what has actually occurred in the administration of the Act, and its effect upon those engaged in various occupations throughout the Commonwealth, is surely sumcient to put us in a position to deal with the situation straight away. Would it have been reasonable to expect the Act to prove perfect in its first operation? Knowing the circumstances under which the general election was carried out, and the arrangements for conducting it were made, it is a matter for surprise that the results were so good. The rolls had to be prepared, very hurriedly, and the electors were not well acquainted with the provisions of the Act. Voting by post was a new departure in some of the States, though it had been in existence in Victoria for a little while, and the electors did not fully realize that the privilege was necessarily hedged round by safeguards against abuse. I know that in Riverina many persons thought that all that was necessary to enable one to vote by post was to go to the nearest returning officer the I do not agree with the last speaker that day before the election and ask him for a postal ballot-paper, to be afterwards filled in and posted. But the electors will gradually become educated in regard to these and the other provisions of the Act. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the system adopted in regard to the remuneration of returning. officers. I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that uniformity is desirable where possible. But it does not seem reasonable or just to pay one man whose duties have caused him four or five days of work at exactly the same rate as another man who has been called upon to give up only one 'day. difficulty in fixing a scale. kind is one to which I would not refer if I were not forced to do so. I regard it as necessary to refer to it now, because injustice has heen done to very competent men, who have spared no time or trouble in the efficient discharge of their duties, but who, when they have made only what to my mind was a fair and reasonable charge, have had the pen run through their accounts, and the sum of £ 2 2 s. paid to them, without any inquiry as to the merits of their claim or the nature of the work performed. I trust that the Minister will give his attention to this matter. If the House is determined to appoint a Committee, I do not care how it is selected. I am not afraid that the members of the Committee will be influenced by party feelings; I am sure that those who are chosen will consider only the interest of the electors of Australia. But I do. not think it desirable to have an unwieldly Committee. If four or five members only are appointed, and they get to work straight away, and adopt business methods, they can submit the result of their' investigations to the House within a fortnight or three weeks. My experience elsewhere has been that the reports of Committees and Commissions are often so long delayed that it becomes doubtful whether the day of Judgment or the presentation of a report will occur first. I hope that such delay will not occur in connection with any Committee appointed by this House. While I throw out these suggestions, I do not depart from my original position that the appointment of a Committee is unnecessary, seeing that we have all requisite informationat hand. the appointment of a Committee is unnecessary. I think that the experience of honourable members generally points to theneed for a searching investigation of thepast administration of the Electoral Department, with a view to the suggestion of such reforms as will make the machinery of that Department work more satisfactorily in the future. No doubt legislative actionis necessary to bring about a better state of things. But, apart from that, inquiry into the working of the Department isneedful. I speak on this subject wjthout the slightest personal feeling, though perhaps the case has been prejudiced hithertoby the personalities which have been introduced from time to time. I am very gratified at the complete change of front shown by the right honourable member for Swan. When he sat upon the Ministerial' side of the Chamber he stoutly defended' the administration of the Electoral Department, and resisted to the uttermost all proposals for an inquiry such as is now sought for. However, a change of position appears to have brought about some modification of his opinions, and we have heard"" him say this afternoon that he considers^ the appointment of the proposed Commit-",35,Elector Al Administration

I understand that Ministers are favorable to an investigation by a Com-, mittee; but I wish to say a word or two as a guide to those who may be chosen to serve upon it, because, no doubt, they will read the. report of our debates upon electoral administration in order to gather up matter for an investigation. One subject which I would suggest is this-When the proposed re-distribution of seats was being fiercely discussed in this Chamber, the Minister then in charge of the Electoral Department brought down a new set of figures almost every day, and at the bottom of them were some mysterious initials which none of us recognised. I challenged him time and again to give us figures certified to by the Chief Electoral Officer, and countersigned by the electoral officer in Sydney who was responsible for their collection. I could not get suchfigures,though under any proper system of administration the two officers would work harmoniously, and it would be possible to get figures for which both of them would be ready to vouch, and as to which there could be no cavilling. The Committee might therefore find out what are the relations between the State office and the head office in Melbourne. It should be the duty of the State office to collect the rolls, and of the Federal office to make them up for Federal purposes. for a Commonwealth Statistical. Department a Department will in time be brought into existence, but it is impossible now. So long as the State officials collect our rolls there should be the most complete harmony between them and the Federal officials. The present administration of the Department, as of all the -Departments, is being 'hampered and fettered by the centralization which obtains. One cannot get sixpence spent anywhere within the Commonwealth without first receiving the authority of an officer'in Melbourne. Such a system is absurd. We might as well do without branch Offices in the Statesi f the officials there are to have no power, because they serve no practical purpose. At the present time if we go to them for information we cannot obtain it. In this connection I should again like' to refer to a case which I mentioned yesterday. A man erected polling booths at Windsor and Richmond, in my electorate, and he has not yet been paid for' his work, although his claim has been certified to as correct'by the presiding officer for the electorate. The whole matter has been hung up in Melbourne for months past. I saw the Chief Electoral Officer two months ago about it, and he told me in a letter which I afterwards received from him that authority for payment would be sent immediately. I thought that everything was settled, until later on I received a letter from the man himself, saying that he had not been paid his money. ThenI saw the Minister, but nothing was done for another three weeks. NowI learn that the case is settled, and that authority has been sent to Sydney for the payment of the money. My first impulse was to go to the Sydney office for information, but the officials there looked blankly at me, and said that they knew nothing about these matters. I might mention that the authority to pay is directed to the cashier at the General Post Office in Sydney. What he has to do with the matter I do not know, though the arrangement which makes him paymaster may be a wise one. All these matters, however, should filter through the Sydney Electoral Office, and should be dealt with on the spot by responsible officers. The Committee will do well to inquire whether the present system of centralization cannot be changed for a direct and' more efficient control. I do not propose to say anything with regard to the actual conduct of the elections, because I should probably have to repeat what has been already said by others. I shall content myself by proposing to alter the personnel of the Committee. The honourable member for Canobolas has, in perfect good faith, proposed names of honourable members whom he thought would fairly represent all the States, and any one knowing the honourable member will acquit him of any intention to. appoint a partisan Committee. There is no reason, however, why the usual course should not be followed, and why States and parties also should not be fairly represented. I move That the names of Mr Povnton, Mr Dugald Thomson, and Mr Maloney be. omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the names of Sir Cameron. ber for Melbourne has seen mej and has in-' dicated that/ he wishes to withdraw his. amendment.

I do not care what amount is fixed. It should be not only illegal to exceed the maximum, but the successful candidate who did so should lose his seat. Either this penalty should be provided for, or the section should be struck out. If the provision for the limitation of expenses is to be operative, its violation should result in a member losing his seat. A number of offences are dealt with in sections 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, and 180, for which no real penalty is provided. In England, where the Corrupt Practices Act is of a most stringent character, and is drawn in a very skilful and workmanlike fashion, the heaviest penalty is inflicted for a breach of the Act, namely, the loss of a seat.

I do not say that we should go so far as that; but that principle has been adopted in the interests of the people, and accepted without question in a country in which the experience in electoral matters is much wider than our own. I hope that the Committee will have power to deal with these matters; that it will not be limited to a consideration of the mere question of the want of administrative ability shown by the Department; but that it will also direct its attention to the largely farcical nature of the Act, and the necessity for amending it on a proper and common-sense basis. the honourable member who has just resumed to the Act itself",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear

136,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"I agree withthan to any failing on their part. One of the evils which became very manifest during the contest in my electorate was the want of proper grouping, a matter to which reference has already been made. One would imagine that in a .. suburban electorate, such as that which I represent, the mere fact that a polling booth was not very conveniently situated would not prevent a large number of persons recording their votes; but my experience teaches me that the inconvenient situation of polling booths very seriously reduced the number of those who exercised the franchise at the last elecfor the preparation of the rolls, and I feel tion. In addition to the want of proper grouping there was a failure, in selecting the booths, to recognise that many voters -had to travel by rail to record their votes. It was certainly desirable that the polling places should be as near as possible to railwe exist. It is a disgrace to the community way stations, in order that those who had to go to the city might be able to record their votes with as little inconvenience as possible. In one or two cases in my own electorate, however, the polling booths were most inconveniently situated. I hope that the Committee will consider it within its province to deal with matters of this kind, and to suggest the framing of regulations under tlie Act that will obviate the recurrence of such defects. The point as-to the desirableness of securing a thoroughly representative Committee has already been dealt with, and I am satisfied that it is the wish of the honourable member for Canobolas that the Committee shall be one that will be able to deal effectively with every phase pf the question. I trust that it will supplement the able report that has been issued by the Chief Electoral Officer by placing the House in possession of the results of its investigations before we are called upon to deal with that absolute necessity, the amendment of the Electoral Act. Reference has been made during the debate to the difficulties which were experienced by manv electors in ascertaining whether their names appeared on the rolls. To my mind those difficulties were due to tlie haste with which the arrangements had to be carried out, and to the novelty of the whole procedure; but many of those who had to administer the Act considered that the facilities offered for the inspection of the rolls were insufficient. I am aware of a number of cases in which electors who desired to. record their votes found, on attending for that purpose at the polling booth, that their names were not on the rolls. from Geraidton to Melbourne; every elector I heartily agree with the motion, but the Mr Knox. difficulties which were encountered in administering what was really a new piece of legislation should not be forgotten when we are dealing with the manner in which the last general election was caried out. It seems to me that it would be advisable to require the head of every household to fill up a form-o n the lines of the papers used in the collection of the Census returns -settin g forth the names of all the occupants of his dwelling. To my own knowledge a number of occupants of dwellinghouses were not included in the lists supplied satisfied that if the proposal I have made were carried out it would be attended with useful results. If we do not secure a complete and perfect roll we shall defeat the aims and objects of the laws under which that so many persons should fail to record their votes, and I would suggest the desirableness of the Minister or the Committee considering whether it would not be wise to provide for the infliction of a small penalty on those who persistently neglect to exercise their right of citizenship. for Home Affairs) -The tone of the debate and the reasonable attitude adopted by honourable members in urging that an inquiry should be made into the conduct of the last general election disarms any opposition on the part of a representative of the Department. No accusation has been made against any of the officers, but the request that an inquiry into the whole matter should ' take place has been preferred in the most reasonable terms. The motion, as amended, certainly contains nothing to which exception can be taken, and the personnel of the proposed Select Committee apparently gives satisfaction to the House. I was pleased to see the right honourable member for Swan rise to support this motion, because I certainly should have felt some diffidence in agreeing to a proposition that might otherwise have been regarded as a reflection on his administration. It is undoubtedly well that in criticising the Department, we should recognise the immense difficulties which confronted the officers and the very short period within whichthey had to organize a scheme for conducting the elections on a uniform system throughout the whole of Australia, They had to make arrangements so that practically from Cape York to Cape Leeuwin, and on the roll should be able on the same",39,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If the Select Committee find in the Electoral Department business-like data collected in a business-like way justifying the statements made by the late Minister for Home Affairs, Sir William Lyne, in connection with the matters which I am talking about, I should almost look upon that as a sufficient answer to everything I have said. member, I hope? It is a mere question of the existence of documents or information in the office at the time. The honourable gentleman who was in charge of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill made certain statements as to population and inequalities, which justified members of this House in doing something which I am sure would have been considered contrary to their principles if the information upon which they acted could have been shown to be wrong. This is the only request I make. If it is discovered by the Select Committee that there is business-like data, such as any business man would have to enable him to settle a question involving ^50, I shall be prepared to withdraw almost everything I have ever said against the Department. some points have .not yet been touched upon in this debate. The right honourable member for Swan has said that electors who fail to take the trouble to see that their names are on the roll deserve to have them left off. I said that they should bear half the blame. returning officers having been appointed to able gentleman's correction. It seems to districts and polling booths themselves, me that the difficulty arises from the condeputed the work to deputy returning ofstruction of the roll itself. Instead of one ficers, ' who, ' consequently,' did a large alphabetical list, there are a number, and amount of work which should have been in some cases one has to look through about done by the chief returning' officersThey 200 alphabetical lists before he can be have been used to doing that work in the sure that a particular name is not on the roll. In the face of that fact there is whether his name is oh the roll or not. I know that I have personally wasted a tremendous amount of time in looking through alphabetical lists to ascertain whether some name appeared on the roll; but strange to say' the person was on the roll for another electorate. He was living on the border line of two electorates, and was placed on the roll for the electorate in which he was supposed to reside, although he had applied to be placed on the roll for the electorate in which he actually resided. When the election took place, as his name appeared on two rolls, he' took his choice as to the electorate in which he should vote. question, ""Which of these candidates am I most anxious to see returned ?"" and voted for him. the members of the Ministry. It is clear that an alteration should be made in the method of compiling the rolls. They should all be compiled on one alphabetical basis. Much trouble would be saved by that plan. It is said that we ought to get the States to act in conjunction with the Federal authorities in the compilation of rolls. But we know very well that some of the States are terribly behind the times in not having a fairly liberal franchise. Until there is a reform in that direction it is of no use talking about compiling the States rolls and the Federal.rolls on a uniform basis. That reform cannot be accomplished until the laws of the States with regard to the franchise are brought into harmony with the Federal law. There is one other matter which I should like to mention in regard to this subject, and that is the complaint I have heard made as to the want of payment by the authorities in connection with the recent elections.

190,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat),"The sentencespeakers. It did not fall within the province of my honourable friend to call attention to the correlative accompaniment of the programme, which, to my mind, is perhaps of profounder importance. WhatI feel we are called on-and at no distant dateto deal with is not simply a programme with which we are familiar, but a situation with which we are familiar. With your permission, sir, I shall trespass on the attention of the House for a few moments by referring to the circumstances out of which that situation has arisen, because it commenced at the very inception of the Commonwealth, and arose almost naturally out of that occasion. The Government who took office at the outset were drawn together by general considerations, and required, for the most part, to frame their programme after they took office. They were returned to this House in a majority upon the main issue submitted-that was the fiscal issue-and their first and deepest duty to the country lay in their endeavour to deal with it in accordance with their principles. The issue had a twofold importance, which caused it to overshadow every other interest of the Commonwealth at that time. In the first place, under the Constitution, the States were left dependent on this Parliament for the revenues which they should receive from the Customs duties, hitherto wholly appropriated by them according to each of their Tariffs. The States were granted three-fourths of the sum to be raised by the Commonwealth from this source; but, as there was no requirement as to the sum, that meant three-fourths of x. Consequently, the study how to meet the demands, and even the necessities, of the States, without plunging them into the direst proposals which were contrary to my judgfinancial difficulty, was one overruling conment, because I believed them to be either sideration in dealing with the Tariff. The other consideration was the task which we believed allotted to us, not of extending proin a Ministry formed as ours was, a diftection-as many of us would have desired -but of preserving all industries already in existence in Australia. deep division of opinion existed, which made the passage of the Tariff a matter of the greatest difficulty and oeril. But, for my own part the obligation which rested on members always appeared to exist independently of our responsibility as protectionists. It seemed to me-though I unhappily proved erroneous in my forecast -that even those who differed from us on the fiscal question might well have united in conceding to the existing industries of the Commonwealth a few years Mr Deakin. within which to adjust themselves to the new conditions created by Inter-State free trade. I mention these facts briefly, to remind us why we felt that to the passing of this Tariff all other interests must be subordinated. In whatever form it might be shaped^ no beginning was possible for the Commonwealth, and no security was possible for the States in their financial relations, until the Tariff became law. During its passage, which occupied the whole of the first and longest session, we were, as a Government, in the position of men with a charge on them from which it was impossible to escape. We were tied, so to speak, to the post, and, at whatever cost and whatever sacrifice, it was our duty to live until we had passed the Tariff. That forced us to face the fact that, even at that early stage, there were three parties in the Chamber. Our fiscal party, which was in a majority, included a number of members who belonged to the Labour Party, and who, on other questions, adopted an entirely independent or hostile attitude. Consequently, except on the fiscal question, the Government had no consistent majority in the Chamber. Under these circumstances, the Government carried on their legislation and administration-unde r these circumstances, some of the members of the Government were called on to submit to what they felt to be sacrifices almost of principle. I belonged to the wing of the Cabinet which felt no such compulsion, and made no such sacrifices. I was happily not called on to consent to anything repugnant to my opinions and principles, though I was called on to assent to some in anticipation or in excess of what was necessary at the time. But, of course, ferent measure of sacrifice was demanded, from different members; and there is no On that head a doubt that many of us felt that even if their principles were imperilled, they were bound to remain at their posts and submit to extremely irritating reverses. That was because the Labour Party at that time, though not in its present strength, held the balance of power, which it used. I may say, without fear, and certain!v without' favour or affection either to the Government or to the Op-' position. To the members of the Labour Party who shared our fiscal faith we wereindebted for continuous support of varying degrees; but never, so far as I can recall,. did the party, as a party, on any critical occasion cast its vote in favour of the Government. confidence motion -and having regard to statements that have question. labour question. on that. on the motion of the honourable member for Parramatta, as I know, because I voted with the minority -^on no occasion did they, so far as I rememory; but I believe that, in all such cases, members were voting for the Labour platform, and not for ours. those fiscally associated with us strained points in our favour, and several times those who were not fiscally attached to us cast votes in our favour; but that was all because, at those times, a White Australia, or some similar matter, affecting their programme, was before the House. WhatI mean is, that never at any time did the Labour members vote against anything in their programme, or for anything which was not immediately associated with it. That is what I mean when I say they used the balance of power without fear, favour, or affection. ment in the present Government, at all events. have acknowledged, and I am prepared to acknowledge, as I have said, our indebtedness tothose who shared our fiscal House.

205,Mr Deakin,"The Government, forfriends on the other side of the House. We told the country that, in our opinion, the extension of the awards of the Arbitration Court so as to embrace the public servants of the States was not authorized by the Constitution, was contrary to its spirit, and in any event at this juncture was injudicious. On that doctrine, such as our strength was, we were returned, and honourable members opposite-so far as I know without exception-were returned on an exactly opposite proposal in that regard. Then the fiscal question, which loomed very large at that election in more than, one shape, at least, was successfully disposed of, because the effect of the return of honourable members was that it became evident that no re-opening of the Tariff war would be possible in this Parliament. desired by my right honourable and learned friend; it. I got a licking, and I admit it. what at a loss to understand on what ground we are now informed that a proposal submitted yesterday that the actually existing Tariff truce should become open and avowed for the duration of this Parliament is in some mysterious manner a sacrifice of protectionist interests. The Protectionist Party went to the country proposing that fiscal peace should obtain for this Parliament. On that one proposal they succeeded by a great majority, and, having secured that, they are bound in loyalty and honour to observe it. I hear, therefore, with considerable amazement some suggestions that to make an open avowal of what is the obvious fact-expresse d in the living presence of honourable members in this House, distributed as they are -on this question is a surrender in some mysterious manner of the protectionist interest. It appears to me that the statement which was submitted yesterday to a meeting of the party with which I am associated puts the situation in unimpeachable terms when, referring to a coalition, it saysThe fiscal question is the one insuperable obstacle, and a truce upon that question is imand with the Labour Party organized on perative. It is accordingly agreed that, during principles which make it a party in a sense the natural term of the present Parliament, a truce shall be observed undisturbed by a premature dissolution. united party shall be deemed to have forfeited his f u l l .liberty of action at the expiration, by effluxion of time, of the present Parliament. That is a statement which might have been made, or which might be made, just as much in regard to my honourable friends opposite as to honourable members sitting on this side. So far as the whole House is concerned, that simply puts into plain words the facts of the present situation. Beyond that, comment on differences is, to my mind, unnecessary from me, because I hope to focus attention on the situation. I ought not, however, to pass from the question of the inclusion of public servants within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill without a further reference, because, during the consideration of that measure, the Prime Minister, as he reminded us last night, in September last, and on occasions since I think, at all events in conversation, had communicated his view that the issue as to whether Pederal control could or ought to be extended to them was not, in his opinion, a question of principle, or, at all events, ought not to be made a matter of confidence, or no confidence in the then Government. the views of the honourable gentleman, but they were the views of a number of other honourable members, mostly on his own side, who took sufficient interest in the fortunes of the Government that met the House to endeavour to arrange some device by which that particular difficulty could have been' surmounted without sacrifice of principle. A great deal of time and thought was very kindly spent in that regard, which was much appreciated by myself, though I took next to no part in it, because, in the first place, to me it appeared to be a question of vital principle. It seemed to me that it was a touchstone between what I called the Federal and the Unitary parties in this House. But any other touchstone would perhaps have served as well to remind us that in this House the three party position continued in an exaggerated, or, as some would term it, an aggravated form. The Labour Party, instead of merely holding the balance of power as between the two sides, had itself become one of the powers of this House. It seemed to me therefore inevitable that with the House divided in that particular, differing from that which pertains to honorBut no member of the able members on this side-it seemed to me immediately after the election that any",47,Ministerial Statement Paper

Until that normal condition of constitutional government was restored, it was vain to seek by any device or expedient to postpone the inevitable. in the policies now; we can go on. cussion a little later. At the present mo-, ment it appears to me that it is the duty of the House-and at all events, erroneously or not, I have conceived it to be my duty-to expedite the solution of that condition of affairs as early as possible. It seems to me 'that no party in this House can satisfy itself or its constituents while that condition remains, and that, in the interests of each and every member, and in the interests of the country which we all serve, it became the crux of the situation how to restore the normal conditions, as I have termed them, of constitutional government. Honourable members will perhaps recall some remarks addressed to the Australian Natives' Association nearly four months ago, in which as clearly as possible I called attention to ' this state of affairs. Censure followed from some quarters, because on that occasion I carefully and deliberately refrained from indicating which of the two parties were to unite. I did that of set purpose, partly because I thought that a condition of things had occurred in which it was possible for members of all parties to practically unite in a patriotic endeavour to restore the necessary conditions of constitutional government, while, if that were not possible, I wished to make it perfectly plain that, so far as the Ministry was concerned, there was ho party movement on foot for its own interest. We were at that time under the disability of having it supposed that the proposition submitted was made with a view to our own retention of office, since as we were the Ministry of the Commonwealth, any party approaching us would do so on the basis Nothing short of that, it. seemed to of finding us in possession, and of leaving at all events some of our representatives in possession. We were under that disability, and for that reason, too, I endeavoured to make it perfectly clear, and thought I had sucNo other condition of things could ceeded, that, while the situation imperatively must be resolved .by the re-establishment of majority rule, I was following a policy which has been sometimes referred to in another country as the policy of the open door. There were two doors, one on each side of us, and we left both open. Honourable members will see that the party to which I have the honour to belong had a peculiar right to take that course without being accused of any attempt to curry favour, because it had a wing which touched the Labour Party so closely as to be almost indistinguishable from it, and another wing which touched their opponents in this House almost as closely. Constituted as the Liberal Partv -always has been of those who stand between the Labour Party and the so-termed Conservatives, it was perfectly natural for us to open the doors in both directions, and to indicate that proposals ' which . were in accordance with our programme and were open and above board, involving no secret compact, could be made either to us, or, if it pleased them, between the two other parties in the House apart from us. The essential was the restoration of majority rule. The particular; combination for that purpose was left to honourable members themselves to determine, bound as they are by their declarations to their constituents and to the country at large. Those remarks were the prelude to much interesting private discussion, but no public overture followed. I hope that it prepared the public mind, and directed the attention of the members of this and the other Chamber to the emergencies of this Parliament.

If the overture had come from members opposite there would have been equally serious questions of organization.

233,Mr Deakin,"Although those queswhich stares the country in the face, is that honourable members opposite have no such majority. That is the majority to which I have just been referring. The two parties who hold opinions differing from them and from each other are necessarily, by the circumstances of the situation, ranked on this side of the House in overwhelming numbers. The position of instability which existed when I spoke two or three months ago exists to-day, in an emphasized manner. Ministry lived, it was possible for honourable members to group themselves upon a question which took honourable members opposite outside their own direct programme, outside their strict party union. The disappearance of the fiscal question from the arena, at present, has recast the main issue, and brought about the transformation which we witness to-day. I am sure that the country will see in this grouping of honourable members-necessitate d by the very circumstances of the case-n o indication of any individual changes of opinion, but unmistakable signs of a new development. The situation was bound to develop; the situation could not remain as it was, and I venture to think cannot remain long as it is. It is for my honourable friends who now hold the reins of government to realize, as I believe they soon must, that there rests upon them to-day, with clearer perception than perhaps most of them have hitherto enjoyed, a conviction of the necessity for the constitutional rule of a majority in this House, and the necessity of acquiring that majority, if they are to do justice to themselves and the measures of legislation which they propose to introduce. which we have made up our minds. At the present moment the part numerically played by the Opposition or Oppositions in the business of the country will be actually greater than the part played by the Government. I do not think that any one will suppose that such a condition of things can be maintained. I think that we must all agree that it can only be maintained even temporarily by that honourable granting of fair plav to which I have already alluded, by that extension of consideration from one side of the House to the other which enables us to discharge our common duties to the public. The reference to legislation was repeated a little later on. It will be noticed that the fact that I spoke from the opposite side of the table did not in any respect alter the attitude which I had previously assumed. Both doors were still wide open, and the necessary-the inevitable-coalitio n might have taken place between my honourable friends opposite and the followers of the right honourable member for East Sydney, or between ourselves and either of the other parties. When I spoke in this House three weeks ago the doors were also wide open, and I do not think my honourable friends on the opposite benches can complain that I did not point Out to them with suflicient clearness that the immediate obligation rested upon them to secure a majority, if they had not one already. Since, then they have taken the question into consideration, and only two days ago, as I understand, they arrived at the conclusion that on their part no coalition is desirable. It appears to me that so far as the maintenance of majority rule is concerned, they do not at While the late present intend to achieve it. They hope for a majority in favour of each of the proposals which they submit to this House, to be drawn from either one flank or the other of the parties on this side of the House. At any rate, they have not yet realized the necessity, which I took the liberty of pressing upon them, of acquiring a majority which should sit and vote with them on the main articles of their programme, and also with regard to the character of tbeir administration. I regret that they have not taken any steps beyond the purely negative course which appears to have been adopted. I ' do not think that when honourable members look at the document submitted to both parties on this side of the House yesterday they can take exception to the. statement of the situation therein contained. My right honourable friend and myself agreed to state it in this fashionUnder-the extraordinary circumstances at present obtaining, it might be said that all parties in Parliament could have been invited to unite, so far as their principles would allow, for the purpose of carrying on the Government. Unfortunately the party now in office, quite apart from any questions relating to its programme, maintains a control of its minority by its majority, and an antagonism to all who do not submit themselves to its organization and decisions, which seems to make it hopeless to approach its members upon any terms of equality, even under the present exceptional conditions. drawn up at a time when the honourable and learned member still hoped to coalesce with the Labour Party. the attitude of the Labour Party was definitely known. Whatever my honourable friend may have thought, I had the best reasons for believing, from what I had heard before the document was drawn up, that no offer would result from the meeting of honourable members opposite. Under these circumstances honourable members will realize that the position occupied by the party to which I have the honour to belong was a critical one-in my eyes more serious and more critical than it possibly seems, or",50,Ministerial Statement Paper

As I have could not but foresee that if this majority often stated, I believed such an agreement were obtained by a combination with honorwas a great necessity in the interests of the able members opposite, there was a section country, and.I had a further motive, to of the party associated with me that would which I am about to allude, in the conviction be likely to be compelled, sooner or laterthat it would be in the interests of the party and probably at once-to sit in opposition to for whch I was commissioned to act. Now, that coalition, and to me, if I were a unfortunately, I have to depart from the member of that Government. On the practice which I always endeavoured to folother hand, I recognized that if low as far as possible, namely, of excluding the combination were made with my personal considerations or statements as to right honourable friend the member for my personality when dealing with questions East Sydney, and those associated with him, before this House. So far as'I can judge, there was another section of the party which that course, which I would infinitely prefer would probably feel called upon imto follow, is not possible for me to-night. I mediately to sit in opposition to me. must necessarily occupy a few minutes in had further to face the fact that speaking in regard to my own position and colleagues of my own-mor e loyal colaction at greater length than I have any Mr Deakin. But, as the parallel as an exact one, because it differs understanding that he himI leagues no man ever had-were divided in the same manner, and that I was to be asked to form or to join a Government which some of my old colleagues would be forced to oppose. In these circumstances, what might appear an unusual action will surely begin to be clear to honorduced to join, and no injury to its interest able members. for a party which it appeared certain must be divided and rent asunder soon in any case by events or by the effect of a combination, that would call upon me to take office at a time when old . colleagues were out of office and old supporters were in opposition. I admit and accept my full responsibility for endeavouring to bring about a coalition of some kind in the public interest, and although I did not shrink in the least degree from the responsibility thar thus devolves upon me-and must remainI feel that in the circumstances I have discharged my duty. I have assisted to the best of my ability in the task of restoring responsible government by a majority, and should have proved my sincerity by sitting behind whatever Government might have been formed by my party. It was my intention to support it loyally and honestly, and so accept the full responsibility of my action, but I considered that I was not called upon to undergo the personal trial of separation from old colleagues and supporters. disgust that I discuss myself, but in this instance it seems unavoidable that I should do so. No man is indispensable. What is more, I venture to think-as I submitted to those of my own party who have in the most generous manner criticised my actions-that , my own usefulness would not be impaired by my standing out of office. When I speak of office,' I include even the highest. I had made up my mind that whatever coalition might be formed-wit h whatever party the combination might be madeI should'take no office, not eyen the highest; that my usefulness would not be impaired by my remaining outside the Government, and that the fact that I did not take office would be another guarantee to those of my party, which, probably as divided, would be the weaker of the two in either combination, that there would not be any sacrifice of our principles or of the programme on which we were elected. I felt that the coalition would be called upon to honestly and faithfully state its programme before the public, and I was prepared to follow and support it. I believed that if my party joined either one side or the other it would, if divided, be the weaker of the two, and that if, whilst being loyal to the coalition, I stood out of the Government, it would be a further guarantee-althoug h a guarantee of fair terms was not required-that no danger or peril to the party I had inI was called upon to act would follow as the result of the coalition. As a member of the Government I . should have had the ordinary ties which bind the members of a Cabinet. I must have been loyal to them, and could not have broken away even to prevent what I thought might become a danger. As an ordinary supporter I should have had an honest duty, to perform; but if at any time. I by any chance was led to believe that danger would arise to the principles which my party professed-and1 do not think that any danger would have arisenI should have, been perfectly free and vigilant in tbeir defence. I felt also that I was justified in the view of my Victorian friends in taking up this stand, because I had acted in a like manner on a previous occasion. My political,co-mate and brother in office, the right honourable member for Balaclava, knows how anxious he was to stand aside for me when he formed his first State Government, which did so much for Victoria; He knows, too, that I felt at the time that my public duty lay, not beside him, where It is with it otherwise would have gladly been, but in giving him my support. For five years he never relied upon me in vain. AlthoughI was not a member of his Government, we worked loyally and faithfully together. He was the man in whom I relied-and I relv upon him now-as the representative of Victoria and of our party to take a position which all would willingly accord him, with the confidence that he had earned it by his long and honourable career. The fact that I had acted in this way on a previous occasion led me to feel that I might satisfy my Victorian friends and allies who are so zealous at present for my undesiredadvancement, 'that any Government which relied upon my support would have no reason to fear that my support covered any ulterior motives. There is another personal incident to which I venture to allude, and happily it is the last. The secret history of Cabinets is not written, or to be written; but once in my lifetime I made the fatal mistake-and it was in connection with a State coalition Government-of failing to insist on the acceptance of the resignation I had tendered. I saw plainly enough that what I believed to be mistakes in policy were about to be made. I was entirely opposed to the particular policy then suggested, but allowed myself to be persuaded that consideration for my party and my colleagues, in which I hope I have never failed, demanded that I should sacrifice my own views to those of others. I did sacrifice my own strong views to those of others. I did so on that occasion, but shall not do so again. HappilyI can now. pass from individual considerations, feeling that I can legitimately say that it is no failure of duty, it is no shrinking from responsibility, and it is no evasion of obligation, when I ask my party to allow me to stand aside and support the Government which is to be formed, instead of taking any active part in its administration. considering made to us by mv right honourable friend the member for East Sydney, we had after all only to determine a programme. Great minds agree.

That, I submit, is a detail, because I have had quite suflicient evidence in times past of the honourable gentleman's ingenuity and foresight to believe that when he framed his programme he was really reading the programme we were going to frame, in advance. site say that for the present session we are agreed practically upon a programme, and they ask what need there is for any further agreement. at election time, and have heard it ,put in very different words. dates whose policy was indistinguishable from that of my honourable friends opposite, candidates who were practically labour members in every proposal they submitted, have said, "" Why oppose us, precisely the same as yours?"" has been the reply of my honourable friends opposite ? were prepared to accept the f u l l responsibility and ties of the organization to which they belonged, their programme went for nothing.'

Unless they are prepared to throw open their doors to a free influx of the Liberals of the community, and to accept the joint burden of responsibility with them, there can be no hope for their retaining, even though they momentarily gain, a majority In this Chamber. I am not without hope in this regard, because, so far as I can judge, there are symptoms of relenting on their part already. We deeply regret that to-night we have not with us the right honourable member for Adelaide, who sat yesterday in the Ministerial corner, happily in very much improved health, and whom we hope to welcome back before long. That right honourable member, so far as I am aware, is not, strictly speaking, and never has been, a member of the Labour Party. member was never opposed by the party in South Australia. treated, so far as his election was concerned, as if he had been a member of the party.

304,Mr Deakin,"I do not think it was;but the Prime Minister will admit that there was a strong tendency in its first years-and I am afraid the tendency exists still to some extent-to constitute it a merely class organization. That phase, however, is becoming less-it is passing away, as honourable members will agree it is desirable that ' every tendency of that kind which exists should pass away. Representation, when it was that of the landed class only, was injurious io the country; that class looking uncommonly well after themselves, and only in a very secondary sort of way after other interests. And in the same manner as the representation of the landed class passed away, so should pass away the representation of class interests of every kind. We have no ground of complaint if honourable members opposite look after the interests of manual labour; on the contrary, they will only be following the example of the class previously in power. But as we have grown out of one domination, we hope to grow out of the other, and>see honourable members in this House derive their representative power from all classes of the community. While my friends are free to term themselves a Labour Party, they, I hope and believe, do not by that claim an exclusive representation of labour. ters, doctors, lawyers, and so on ? on the common ground that we each of us appeal to all classes of the community, claim to study the interests of all classes of the community, and that we each of us alike enter this House pledged to give due regard to the interests of all classes of the community, we have taken the first step to meet on the common platform which properly belongs to us. But there are other steps which it is necessary to take. Honourable members will require to see that the man who represents all classes of the community does not himself belong to an exclusive class in Parliament, to an organization which imposes shibboleths and restrictions on his action, but leaves him, as between his pledges and his constituents, to the verdict of those constituents! and the criticisms of his fellow members and associates-whic h does not seek to ostracise those who hold similar opinions, nor to represent one class of the community, nor insist that they should be marked with a particular mark, or .branded with a special brand. arid learned member drive every free trader out of politics if he had the power ? a good working majority. I am not anxious to drive any section out of politics. In the next place, may I submit that my honourable friends opposite scarcely lay enough stress on more than the first function of a Legislature. The first function of a Legislature is necessarily legislation; but under our system of government there is indissolubly associated with that the work of administration, which is as fundamental and important, as my honourable friends are rapidly learning.' Executive power which now rests upon them they feel that the charge of the administration bulks as large in their every-day thoughts as the task of legislation, that without administration legislation can be rendered of little effect. In that democratic country, the United States of America, the Executive, although absolutely without legislative authority, represents even more than the Legislature-it s great national ideal. Under these circumstances, it is scarcely sufficient to say that the programme which we suggest is the programme of all parties in the House. They require to give guarantees as to administration. there is such general conversion tb Our programme. offices, anyhow. the most harm. master-General does not think that I insinuated anything to the contrary, because that was the last thing in my thoughts. supposed to ""attend to our work, anyhow. honourable gentleman think that I had any suspicion of the contrary in my mind ? honourable and learned member's remarks, has been'to the effect that we are not taking enough care about administration. one's observations are being received.

Chamber as simply ' a parallel to the American 'House of Representatives. We have to recall that its task is not simply legislation, but to control the Executive by means of that responsible government which we believe keeps both administration and legislation in closer touch with public opinion than any other form of government yet devised. Now, responsible government depends on a consistent majority being found behind the Government.' Perhaps honourable members will find after all that the position I have been putting incessantly for the last four months of the necessity for two parties only-of the absolute necessity for majority rule-is bound up with the existence and exercise of the powers of responsible government, with thedue control of administration as well as with the passage of proper legislation. Our system of government, unless it be seriously and, to my mind, fatally altered, demands for its preservation and continuation .the existence of a majority behind the Government.

He implies that he wishes us to protect him against himself. We cannot look on this sufficient time in which to arrange and collect my thoughts, and partly owing to the queries with which I have been met, I am afraid that I have been straying from the line of argument that I intended to follow. I was about to approach more closely the immediate situation, and to l.eave the general considerations with which, perhaps, I have dallied too long. Good work as we did in the first Parliament-marvellou s work, I believe, the people of future times will say-w e necessarily were engaged in the preliminary task of clearing the timber, not ""for the Federal Capital, but to permit of the necessary organization which has followed. That time has passed away. The fiscal question for the time being is> buried. With the fiscal question the cardinal difference that separated honourable members has also disappeared, and, consequently, the situation by which we are faced to-day is one which never occurred during the last Parliament, which is peculiar to the present Parliament, and which must, therefore, naturally, and by the necessity of the case, lead to new groupings of honourable members.

Under these circumstances, is it not time that whatever course be followed, in this House at all events, as much as possible of the inneeded a good deal of pressure to bring toseparable excrescences of strife should now be laid aside? We have seen the differences of separate States in the Commonwealth unhappily forced upon us by tha fact that-a t all events in the two most populous-diametricall y opposite fiscal polithis House, circumstances will be. too strong cies have found favour. We are now upon a ground which offers a means of avoiding the discord which has been occasioned by that separation. After the sweeping away of the fiscal barrier, if only for a time, there will be the possibility of better relathe party system, speaking of it in a parliations between the States of New South Wales and Victoria. In the other States the division has been far less acute, but even in them an opportunity is now afforded to thoughtful men to reconsider the new situation without continuous reference to their old ties. May I suggest, with bated breath, that the time has come when the personal bitternesses which have arisen out of prolonged fiscal and other strife may well be laid aside, let us hope for ever? When ""the fiscal strife revives, if it ever does, it may generate similar warmth of feeling, which will lead to similar exaggerated expressions, but at the present time we surely have no need to resort to those personal weapons, to bring back those unhappy recollections, to re""-open those ancient sores. That enables us to face the new situation as we should face it, with open and free minds. I have found, in the course of the informal discussions between some honourable members opposite and myself, a disposition to look more frankly at the future, and more openly upon their difficulties, than I have ever known before. I must confess that, in the course of the discussions which have led to the preparation of this document, notwithstanding the warnings which I have received as to the astuteness of my right honourable friend comic man. caution that, under his gay exterior, he veils ent majority sat behind the Government of the most dangerous and subtle designs, he and I , though he has been by no means We easy to move, and possesses sufficient Scotch blood to prevent him from giving anything away, have met in a perfectly fair spirit, and I am, therefore, prepared to find that the attitude which members generally have adopted towards each other may need to be reconsidered. It is the situation which forces this reconsideration upon us. It gether my right honourable friend, and myself to consider these documents; and it needed a good deal of pressure to induce my honourable friends opposite to enlarge their boundaries. But we must realize that, in for the wishes p f many of us. The pressure must become responsible. For my own part-and I should have said it in its proper place had not a diversion led me astraywith responsible government as we know it, mentary way, requires to be carefully preserved. With the existence of a majority and a minority comes the condition that the members of the majority shall be united on all their main principles,' and shall govern, while the minority act in opposition to them. I hold so strongly to the party system that I contend for it that we must always be prepared to make reasonable sacrifices, representing that fair consideration for the difficulties of others which we expect for our own. I hope to be loyal, so long as may be possible, to all the members with whom I have been associated in past years. Nothing but circumstances of the extremest urgencv shall lead me to consent to a severance of our relations. What we have to face in this House is the possibility, arising from beyond and outsWe ourselves, of circumstances that require us definitely to take one side Or the other. It was not under a perfectly clear sky and without any pressure of necessity that my right honourable friend and myself met together to endeavour to. consider a common platform, and that my party threw open its doors in the endeavour to obtain a majority favorable to our political principles. It was because any one who considers the state of this Parliament must realize its utter instability, the constant temptation which its present condition affords, both to those in Opposition who that we may at any moment, and without warning, be confronted by crises which",59,Ministerial Statement Paper

Legislation must be more or less perilous, It is only in that and our administration ineffective, because uncertain, until this condition of affairs is brought about. It therefore lies with honourable members to consider the situation as well as the programme submitted by the Government. We can no longer shut our eyes to the dangers by which the present position is surrounded, and the assaults which may be sprung upon us as surprises. It was in order that there might be timely consideration beforehand that the proposals to which I have referred were laid before the two A number of seats, equal at least parties.

It was probably expected that owing to his recent experience the honourable and learned member would come here to curse us, but instead of that, like a certain prophet of old, he has remained to bless. the prophet had interviews and conferences by the way with a certain animal. I understand that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had the advantage of conferenceswith the right honourable member for East Sydney. I am speaking only by way of analogy, and not with any offensive intent, so far as the right honourable gentleman ""is concerned. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in waiting for overtures from the representatives of the two other parties, reminds me very much of the young lady to whom he referred at the A.N.A. banquet. If I might press the comparison further, I would suggest that he is like one of the characters in A Midsummer Night's Dream, which was very admirably presented to us last year. There Demetrius is pursued by Helena, and he pursues Hermia. right honourable member for East Sydney is Helena, and is pursuing Demetrius, ivi the person of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, who in his turn is pursuing Hermia, in the shape of the Labour Party. I really think that my honourable friend makes too much altogether of the three parties bogy. that there is a great deal in what he has said, but he must not forget that, although it may be very convenient and nice for a Government to have a majority, a number of Governments have been carried on without majorities. I do not allude to the German Parliament, where the Ministry never had a majority, because it may be urged there are differences between the Constitution of that country and our own. It will be found, however, that in England when the Corn Laws were repealed by Sir Robert Peel, in 1845, the Government were in a minority, whilst the Great Reform Law was carried in 1867 by Mr Disraeli, when his Government were in a minority. Again, in the initial stages of the working of the Federal Constitution some of the greatest and most far-reaching measures that any Parliament has ever passed were introduced by a Government who were in a minority from first to last. the right honourable member for East Sydwith us on the last occasion will, if they Mr Higgins. ney in New South Wales was in a minority in the Parliament of 1898. right honourable gentleman carried on his Government for five years upon lines of which he could f u l l y approve, whilst he was deI t is quite true that pendent on an alliance with the Labour Party. against both the other parties at the beginning. ter of External Affairs not to interject across the table. It is very disorderly. the last few years heard more than enough of the domestic quarrels of New South Wales, and perhaps I ought not to have digressed to the extent I have done. Three weeks ago the honourable and learned member for Ballarat promised us fair play, and said that he would wait for our programme. He always keeps his word, and now that our programme has been disclosed he finds I venture to suggest that the that our measures are exactly those which, of his own accord, he 'thought fit to present to the people of Australia. In the programme put forward, not only by the honourable and learned member, but by the right honourable member for East Sydney, there is not one proposal which has not been included among those of the Ministry. ThereI know fore, I suggest, with all respect, that until my honourable and learned friend is in a position to judge as to the manner in which the Government will administer the affairs of the country, his proper place is on this side of the House. We know that the honourable and learned member's sympathy is, and always has been, with progressive legislation, and therefore there is no one in the House we should more warmly -welcome as an ally and a guide. There is only the one point in dispute between usthe point on which he thought fit to stake the life of his Government. I refer to the proposal to include railway and other public servants within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. honourable and learned member for Ballarat appeals for government by majority, and I would remind him that so far as that point is concerned, we certainly have a majority.

As soon as we pass from that matter we have the honourable and learned member's full approval of our programmeIt is, of course, very convenient for Governments to feel that they have only one party with which to deal"", or, in other words, to know that they have a majority; but it is not always convenient for the country. My experience and reading are that Governments are best held in check and controlled when they feel that they have tocommend their principles not merely to the party supporting them, but to the majority of the House, and some of the best measures that have been passed into law have been framed by Governments at a time when they felt that they had to please a certain number of honourable members of the Opposition. fighting platform ! question is really not one of two parties. Having regard to the fact that the honourable and learned members who lead the two branches of' the Opposition have joined in proposing to the Commonwealth the same programme that we have put forward, I submit that the Ministry is in the happy position of being able to feel that there is now only one party in the country-on e party supporting old-age pensions, one party supporting all the minor measures, and one party evidently supporting the building of the Federal Capital and the transcontinental railway. honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He says that we have at present three parties, and that we require but two. I assert that we need only one. May I also say that but for a very peculiar development during the last general elections, we should have had only two parties-eve n nominal parties-in this House. In what I am about to say I have no desire to attribute blame to honourable members. simply .wish to state the fact that in New South Wales it was determined that the fight should be based' upon an issue which had really been abandoned for. the time being in all the other States-the issue of free-trade or protection. The question had been discussed in the first Parliament, but recently we witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of the' representatives of one of the six States, with the exception of the members of the Labour Party, basing all the essential voting upon the issue of free-trade or protection, although the issue was dead, and of no practical purpose; The result of the attitude taken up in New South Wales at the last general elections was that in Victoria the Ministry was forced to a large extent to see that protectionists were returned. But for that peculiar development one State going to the poll upon an issue different from that which was taken up by all the others-w e should have had' only two parties, and they would have been what we are going to have in the course of a very short time-the parties of progress and of reaction.' There are going to be two parties, but, with all respect to my honourable and learned friends opposite, they are not going to be the parties of Mr Deakin, or of Mr Reid, or of Mr Watson. . We shall settle down in a very short time to the old time-honoured cleavage which history has shown' to be universal, the distinction between those who are for progress and those who, if we may put it in a mild form, are for caution. Although, as the honourable and learned member has said, I am not a pledged member of the Labour Party, I view with a great deal of indignation-and I can speak more freely than can those who are pledged-the statement that the Labour Party is a class party. . That misrepresentation Has been sedulously fostered in newspapers, on public platforms, and, I am sorry to say, even in Parliament. No doubt the Labour Party has rightly endeavoured to strike at the root pf the evils that exist, at the lowest part of the tree, but at the same time its members avow their intention to do I shall go one better than the their bestfor the whole community. If there is one thing more than another which has driven me and a number of men into sympathy with the Labour Party, it is the gross and cruel injustice to which they have been subjected. , Mr O'MALLEY --We are martyrs. always spoils my periods In my opinion, the outcome of this crisis must be very I beneficial to the whole community. I do not put it as being beneficial to any party; but for years past I have watched with concern a party growing in influence, in numbers, and in power, yet never facing responsibility.
