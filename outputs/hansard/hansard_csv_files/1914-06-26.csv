Prime Minister if he has noticed this in one of the leading Fusion newspapers of Tasmania; ber is not in order in founding a question on a newspaper statement. the right honourable gentleman if he has noticed that Mr Pullen, a member of the Tasmanian Legislature, in a speech delivered on the 23rd of this month, declared that 1,250 names had been struck off the Darwin roll, 600 being names of persons enrolled for the Zeehan subdivision, and that he hoped that they would now find a man to oust this "" Yankee."" If this gentleman, who is licensed to preach, and dispenses fire and damnation once a week, glories in striking names off the roll, what does the Prime Minister think will happen with bigoted persons who are out for gore on both sides) such a question does not seek information on any matter within the control or cognisance of the Prime Minister. The question is out of order. to reply to what the honourable member has said. not in order, a reply would also -be out of order. to-day's Argus, it is stated that when the Labour party abolished postal voting it provided for the lodging of 6s. with every objection. As the Prime Minister was in Parliament in. 1901, I ask him whether this provision was not in the Act passed in 1901, when only one-fifth of the House was composed of Labour members, and in the Act passed in 1905, when only one-third of the House was composed of Labour members. Does he not think that action should be taken iri regard to the vile, wilful misrepresentations of papers like the ArgusJ .. action to suppress vilification, where am I to begin ? to clean the Augean stable that the honourable member referred to yesterday. Whatever party provided for.the-lodging of 5s. with each objection, the provision has been a dead letter. What does it matter I ask the when it was passed? us adulterated news every day? member will find plenty of adulterated news in the Hansard reports of the speeches that have been pouring out from honourable members opposite this week. Read Brother Catts. The honourable member can put more misrepresentation into a few words than any other man in the House. that questions to Ministers must have reference to matters of which the Ministers have cognisance, or must relate to business of which they have charge, or to Departments oyer which .they have control. I have but a few minutes, since ruled out of order, as I have done on many previous occasions, questions framed on newspaper articles. It is certainly not proper for honourable members to continue the practice of asking such questions. External Affairs yet in a position to lay on tlie table a copy of the agreement entered into between the Government, and English capitalists relating tp the freezing works at Port Darwin ?",11,Setup

16,Mr Thomas,"I s the Minister.ofcopies of the agreement, as accepted by me, prepared, but until I have been apprized that the contract has been signed by the attorneys of Sir ""William Vesty, I cannot lay them on the table. I expect to hear at any moment that the contract has been signed. many dairy cattle Have been purchased by the Minister for the establishment of dairy farms in the Northern Territory) In what part of Australia were they purchased ; what was the average price paid for, and what was the average age of, come under my notice during the last few days, but I think that about 500 cattle wore purchased in Queensland. I cannot give the prices paid, as the classes were not then determined, but I shall get the information for the honourable member, and let him have it within a few days. answer to a question, stated the other day that Mr Ryland's appointment was made after the Queensland election. As his language seemed to reflect on that gentleman, I ask him whether he will be good enough to say if he thought that the result of the election had anything to do with the appointment? offer an opinion on the point. I cannot for a moment recollect the date of the appointment, but there was an association in what was said of the date of the appointment and the date of the election. I have made no reflection on Mr Ryland, who, from what I have seen of him, I consider an upright, straightforward man. Personally, I am sorry, as I said to him, that my official duty necessitated retrenchmentthat may have proved more or less harsh to individuals. establishment of dairy farms in the Northern Territory, has the Minister of External Affairs made any provision for cool storage in connection with the manufacture of butter? If not, does he propose to do so) butter is one of the chief mings for which we have established the dairy. All necessaiy provision for a proper.dairy, including cool storage, has been made. . External Affairs delay the consideration .of an agreement with the Union Cool Storage Company for the establishment of freezing works in the Northern Territory until after the Royal Commission which is now inquiring into the meat industry has furnished a report? Further, _ will the Minister consider the advisability of not leasing any more land to this company until that report has been issued) suspicion that entering into a contract with Vesty Brothers would in any wayraise the question to which the honourable member has referred-that is the matter referred to the Royal CommissionI would not have negotiated with them; but wo have had plenty of inquiries into the project, and all the evidence is in their favour, and it is stated that they are strong opponents of the Beef Trust. In my opinion the arrangement with them has been one of the beat steps yet taken in regard to the development of the Northern Territory; and it is not only my opinion, but it is also the opinion expressed by men who are competent to give a judgment on the matter. The arrangement will mean the expenditure by Vesty Brothers of about £200,000, and not merely the minimum of £100,000, as pro' vided for in the agreement. The conditions of the agreement are fair to the Commonwealth, and we have nothing to lose by entering into it at once.. I do not propose to delay the matter, as the honourable member suggests. In fact the agreement has already been sent on for the signature of Sir William Vesty, and, in all probability it has already been signed. capacity of the works? do at least 30,000 head of cattle in the season.

I think that he was in Australia altogether for about two years; and when such a period as that has elapsed, and the pugilists' ordinary contracts have expired, they are expected to leave our shores. They come into Australia, as I say, under exemption, which covers, in some cases, more than six months; but, while in some instances they are engaged for a particular bout, in other cases they are here for a series of contests, and everything depends on the circumstances.

Before Dr. Wade came out I went into the matter with Mr Grebin, the oil expert in the Department, who explained the whole subject to me, and I was somewhat seized of the significance of the appointment.

Another party is engaged, on the other side of the Vailala River, in putting down a second bore, under the direction of Dr. Wade. The third party, working under Dr. Wade himself, is carrying out a geological survey.

The confinement of the cadets is not solitary confinement in the ordinary sense of the term. gentleman means that it is not like the solitary confinement undergone by prisoners in gaols. The cadets are confined in fortresses. himself in a room undergoes solitary confinement. fending what has been done; I merely suggest that the punishment has not been so bad as might be thought from the ordinary acceptation of the term ""solitary confinement."" The lads have been fed well, and well looked after. I have ascertained that the Defence Act provides for the detention of cadets in some place of their drill, and for the purpose of. punishing them, and the late Government selected the fortresses as suitable places. premises in which cadets have been confined. certain cases have been confined in cells. propose, with the I do not wish to understate the punishment-and have been detained in solitary confinement. There is before me a list of four cases which were dealt with before this Government took office. Cadets Green and Fells were committed on the 9th June, 1913, for one day only. They belonged to the Fourth Military District. Cadet Philipson was committed on the same date for two days, and at some time earlier a boy named Yeo was committed at BrokenH ill . All these cases occurred before we took office. We have carried on the system that was already in operation. As I said this morning, I do not wish to make political capital out of this matter, and honourable members ought not to try to do so. In my opinion, a wrong course has been taken, but mistakes will occur in the best regulated establishments, and the only thing we can do is to discover them, and remedy them. We are having the whole system inquired into. It must be remembered that something must be done with recalcitrant boys, because discipline must be maintained. If one lad is allowed to do as he pleases, it is not likely that eighty or ninety other full-blooded boys will submit to discipline, knowing that the authorities may be defied with impunity. That has to be provided against. But the harsh treatment of the boys should cease. Honourable members may take my word for it that there will be no more solitary confinement for cadets. We have come now to the end of this Parliament, which is unique in many ways. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the whole Parliament is to be dissolved, and to make an appeal to the country with every interest and every issue thrown into the scale.

There will be hard hitting-that is inseparable from any conflict of the kind-bu t I hope that we shall be able to shape the issues and keep them before the people in such a way that an intelligent verdict may be recorded concerning them. That is much more important than some may imagine. Our Constitution is on its trial. General are on their trial, too. growl about the umpire! say is that, in my opinion, honourable members would do very much better if , in respect to all these matters that have been raised, they would put the entire blame on my shoulders; that is the place where blame must rest, if blame there be. The more we keep the Governor General out of these controversies the better I think it will be for all concerned. It would seem as though it were not possible to utter a sentence without getting on somebody's nerves; and it evidently is time we had a breath of the free ambrosial air of the mountains, away from all this keen partisanship. campaign it is just possible there are some who may be slain, as, indeed, is always the case; and one cannot but regret those personal happenings. Those of us, however, who come through the battle will, I hope, meet again with our personal respect for each other unimpaired, and our spirits even less embittered than they are to-day. In the meantime, before we take ourselves to this controversy, it is due to appropriately recognise the magnificent services rendered by all the officials of Parliament. Mr Speaker has had, perhaps, a more trying time than any of his predecessors. The circumstances have been peculiar, and I think all will agree that that gentleman has made a magnificent effort to be fair and square in all his dealings. that there is this laugh about the matter. Speaker had done very well. moment I am paying Mr Speaker what, I hope, is proper courtesy in making due acknowledgment of the strenuous, able, Whatever may happen in the comand impartial services which I believe him to have rendered to this Parliament. I challenge contradiction to the statement that, if any man has been held strictly to account throughout the whole of this Parliament by Mr Speaker, it is the individual who is now addressing the House. times. and, whatever happens, no one will be able to say that the Prime Minister ever received any concession from the present Speakera tribute to his strict impartiality in his high office. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on such a record, and make my due and warm acknowledgment of your bearing and conduct in these days. The same thing must be said of the Chairman of Committees, who, I think, has been scrupulous in the observation of the rules and customs of the House, meting out fairness and justice to both sides. In tbe peculiar circumstances of this Par1 liament, both Mr Speaker and the Chairman of Committees have had to perform duties which, I know, must have been disagreeable to them. Behind these gentlemen there are the everlasting ones of Parliament, who In the coming go not out with us, and come not in with us, but are part of tlie institution, and who, with rare fidelity and great ability, assist the proceedings of the House from year to year and session to session. I refer to the Clerks of the Chamber, to whom we are indebted for a multitude of courtesies and assistance rendered freely to every member who, at any time, may call upon them. Indeed, these officers do much more than we sometimes think in keeping the proceedings going in the proper way. I have also to pay my tribute to the valuable services rendered by the messengers, who, somehow, are never absent from my mind. In all the little ways which come within their duty they make life pleasant to us here in many forms, which, otherwise, would not be possible.

I also hope that honourable members will go out to the fight filled with the milk of human kindness, and ready to give their opponents credit for the best of motives. human kindness "" has vanished in some cases. our differences of opinion ought not to interfere with our personal relationship.

There is another matter on which, perhaps, I ought to say a word. I know that a good many honourable members on both sides feel a dissolution and an election to be a very serious financial burden; and there is no disputing the fact. Men devote their whole lives to the performance of their parliamentary duties, and the position has serious bearagree with the Prime Minister that the ings for many, especially those coming here from other States. There has been an anomaly ever since Federation began, in that the members of one House receive f u ll salary up to the end of the year, while the members of the other House have their emoluments suddenly cut off by the dissolution proclamation. I am not able to say anything definite in this connection except that my own personal -feeling at the moment is that the matter should be considered when the House resumes after the election. At present I content myself by expressing my deep obligation to all who help in the conduct of the business of the Chamber, and movingThat the House do now adjourn. I have listened with pleasure to the valedictory remarks of the Prime Minister. He has spoken of this Parliament as an eventful one, as a remarkable one, and as one that has made history, and will have great constitutional consequences. In my opinion, it will be distinguished for other reasons. For instance, there have been barren sessions. However, it is not my intention to intervene with a jarring note of that kind. We are soon to appear in another place, inviting the free and independent electors of Australia to express their opinions, not only on our actions in this Parliament, but also upon our actions from an individual point of view outside it. From the point of view of our party having lost by death two members within a month, the Parliament has been a tragic one, and remarkable in other respects. I hope that no honourable member, no matter how long his serness another like it. I have not been able, to agree with Mr Speaker on many occasions, but I have always cheerfully admitted that he has endeavoured to do his best. I have felt it necessary to take dutiful action to preserve the rights of members, but I have always recognised the honest efforts of Mr Speaker to do his duty. It matters not what honourable member is elevated to the position of Speaker, he must occupy an honoured position,, and have due respect paid to him. The same remarks apply to the Chairman of Committees and other officers who have guided the deliberations of this Chamber. I officers of the House know no party, and know no individuals, but I think the right honourable gentleman indulged in a little romance when he said that Mr Speaker was more severe on him than on any other honourable memberO wad some power the giftic gie us, To see oursels as others see us!

It should always be remembered that they are not the Standing Orders of the Speaker, but the Standing Orders of the House, and can be at any time altered by the House if it so desires. I would like to say a few words, if honourable members will bear with me for a moment or two, about motions of dissent on the notice-paper from rulings I have given. I regret, perhaps more than anybody else, that an opportunity has not been given for the discussion of these motions, which would have enabled me to quote supporting authorities; but I take this opportunity of saying that I have ample authority to justify every ruling I have given. Before giving a ruling, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to acquaint myself with, not only our own Standing Orders and the procedure of the House, but also with the practice of the House of Commons. My rulings have not been given in a haphazard way, but have been the result of careful thought and study of the authorities at my command. to thank the officers, one and all, and the attendants-every one connected with the work of the House-for the faithful and loyal service which they have at all times rendered to honourable members generally and to myself as Speaker, and to express my warm appreciation of their loyalty and their fidelity to their duty, and particularly my warm appreciation of the assistance I have received from the Clerks at the table. Perhaps the Chairman of Committees might like to say a few words after I have finished, and before the motion is submitted to the House; but before sitting down, I wish to express the hope that honourable members will enter the coming political campaign bitterness towards one another, or towards myself. feelings of warm personal friendship for many honourable members whose political views do not coincide with my own, and to all I cherish no feeling other than of personal goodwill. I wish honourable members to know, and to feel, that, as Speaker, it has been my desire to be a friend to each and every one -of them. So far as the campaign and the election ahead of us are -concerned, it is always to me a Mr Speaker. matter of extreme personal regret that these contests have the result of severing us from association with members with whom we have been accustomed to mingle in friendly personal relationships; it takes us a very considerable time to accustom ourselves to seeing new faces in the places which have been previously occupied by others. That is one of the sad features about an election. I am afraid that I cannot honestly express the hope that every one of us will be returned again; the present fight is to prevent such a result, but at the same time. I cannot contemplate the coming election without a feeling of sorrow prompted by the thought that we shall perhaps miss many faces which have become familiar to us, and many identities for whom we have had a warm personal regard. have endeavoured to perform my duties as Chairman of Committees in accordance with the high, standard set by my prede-r cessors, and if I have in some degree achieved that object in the opinion of my fellow-members, I am thoroughly satisfied. Like Oliver Twist, I want more. With reference to the first notice of motion on the business-paper for to-day, I had hoped that the Prime Minister could have given me an answer, but he was called out of the chamber. There is another notice of motion to which I would like to draw his attention, and which is No. 19, in the name of the honourable member for Barrier. As we are parting good friends, I think this is the psychological moment to suggest to the Prime Minister that the House might be given an opportunity to pass, on the voices, what I know would be a very acceptable resolution to the honourable member for Barrier, myself, and others -. free from all personal The motion to which . I refer readsThat the resolution of this House of tbe Por my part, I entertain 11th November, 1913"" That the honourable member for Ballarat be suspended from the service of this House for the remainder of the session, unless he sooner unreservedly retracts the words uttered by him at Ballarat, on Sunday, the 9th November, and reflecting on Mr Speaker, and apologizes to the House ""-be expunged from the Journals of this House, as being subversive of the right of an honourable member to freely address his constituents.

169,Mr Fowler (Perth) [5.57],I,24,Inter State Commission Evidence
170,I Desire Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.58],"of course, I know no friendships. The motion to which I refer might, I think, well be decided at once on the voices, and I make the suggestion to the Prime Minister in perfect good faith. On the business-paper there are a good many propositions which we certainly should have had an opportunity to deal with. Whether the honourable member for Parramatta has the honour of leading the House or the Opposition in the next Parliament-the two highest posts in the House to which a. member can aspireI ask him to consider whether it is not worthwhile to set aside one night for private members' business, so that an honourable member may be enabled at least to get a division taken on a motion. From twenty to twenty-five motions could in that way be dealt with in a night. It is very rarely, indeed, that the eloquence of an honourable member in the House, or the facts he has adduced, have changed the opinions and vote of another honourable member. Regarding the other proposals on the notice-paper, I feel sure that the House would carry the motion in favour of the Constitution being amended to empower this Parliament to grant pensions to young widows with children dependent on them. Again, there is the motion on the great question of Home Rule in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Australians are gifted with the greatest franchise which has ever been given to a continent, and therefore I think that we in this House should have been afforded the opportunity of showing by our vote how many of us are prepared to see extended to another part of the world that which we ourselves enjoy. There is also on the notice-paper a splendid notice of motion by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who desired that the old-age pensions should be increased to the extent of 2s. 6d. a week. I do not suppose that we should have been able to induce the Treasurer to agree to that proposal. member would not hesitate to borrow money for the purchase of ironclads, which, ten years hence, would be on the scrap-heap, but he would never dream of borrowing to enable the Commonwealth to help a human being, whether it was an old-age pensioner, a widow, or a child. I regret, also, that we have not had an opportunity to deal with the notice of motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Gippsland in favour of the initiative and referendum. That proposal, I tell the Government, will soon be carried into effect, and the people will then control the Parliament all the year round. When the people are dominant they will not allow the time of Parliament to be wasted as it has been since we met in April last by the discussion of ridiculous measures. Finally, I desire to say that I am, and always have been, a Protectionist. I do not say thatf Protection will ever remove poverty or misery, but it will give every country that adopts it an educated body of workers, who can be taken into municipal, State, or Commonwealth workshops when the wisdom of those governing bodies leads them to establish such institutions. The honourable member for Robertson will agree with me that when you build a locomotive in your own country, you will still have the money in the country when that locomotive is worn out and has to be replaced; but that if you obtain it from abroad, when it is worn out you will have neither the locomotive nor the money which was spent upon it. The honourable member for Wimmera will have, to lean towards the policy of Protection and the introduction of the initiative and the referendum if he does not desire his big majority to be reduced. I am satisfied that in the next Parliament we shall have a majority favorable to the immediate revision of the Tariff on protective lines, and to the principle of the initiative and referendum. We shall do next session far more than has been done during the last two sessions. I wish, in conclusion, to give my meed of praise to our brothers of the Hansard staff, who, during our all-night sittings, are sweated in an infamous way. We should follow the example of the Parliament of the school-house of Europe, and meet in the day-time. To the officers of the HouseI must also plead guilty, with The right honourable others, for having kept them here at night. I ask them, however, not to blame us, but to blame the absurd system under which Parliament is carried on. We should meet in the day-time, and a sitting of eight hours per day should be long enough to enable us to do all that we require. Such a reform, I am satisfied, will be welcomed by the officers of the House, who are loyal and true, and who, even when their brains and eyes are weary with, long hours of labour, never complain. Ministries ? the system for eighteen years, and still believe in it. The three proposals I have named are going to carry the country. I hope that the next Parliament will be gifted with more wisdom, and that soon after we meet there will be introduced a Bil l to enable the people, by means of the initiative and i""eferendum, to control us to a greater extent than they can at the present time. is the last opportunity which I shall have during the present session to deliver a speech on the question of the Beef Trust, but I do not propose to avail myself of it. I desire merely to sympathize with those who are not coming back, and to say that after the next general election I shall return to this Parliament bringing with me for further discussion the question of the Beef Trust. I hope that before we meet again the Government will endeavour to give effect Commonwealth of Australia to wit R. M . FERGUSON, Governor General. the Commonwealth of Australia. other things enacted that the Governor General might appoint such times for holding the Sessions of the Parliament as he thinks fit, and also from time to time by Proclamation, or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament: Now therefore I , the said Sir Ronald Oraufurd Munro Ferguson, in exercise of the power conferred by the said Constitution, do by this my Proclamation prorogue the said Parliament until Wednesday, the fifth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and fourteen.

(L.S.) GOD SAVE THE KING ! to the notice of motion standing in my nameThat, in the opinion of this House, full reports of the evidence and proceedings before the Inter-State Commission should be presented to this House from time to time. If the Minister has any power over that Commission I hope he will see that ample evidence is available for the House when we are asked to deal with the Tariff. I also trust that, in the meantime, any report issued by the Commission will be distributed amongst honourable members. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to submit my motion, because I believe that I had a sufficient backing to make the Inter-State Commission recede from the position taken up ""by it in regard to the taking of a f u l l report of the evidence given before it. The practice of taking only a summary of the evidence landed it quite recently in a certain amount of trouble. A mere summary of the evidence is not sufficient to enable us to frame a Tariff on truly scientific lines, and I hope that we shall have passed such a Tariff before next session closes.
