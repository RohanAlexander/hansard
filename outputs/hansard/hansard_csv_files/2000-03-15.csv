Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14816 15 March 2000 Port Adelaide Electorate: Gillman Highway $18 .5 million in funding under the Roads of National Importance Program towards the cost of constructing the Gillman Highway in my electorate of Port Adelaide. The state government in South Australia will also contribute $18.5 million to this highway and have indicated their support for a privately built and operated bridge across the Port River. This will connect the Gillman Highway with Victoria Road, the main arterial road on the Le Fevre Peninsula leading to the Outer Harbour shipping terminals. It will result in significant savings, particularly for South Australia's booming export industries. The Gillman Highway and Port River Bridge are vital for the economic development of South Australia. This can be demonstrated by the fact that this is the first project funded by the federal government's Roads of National Importance Program which has gone to a Labor area. There is not the usual pork-barrelling of marginal seats which we have all become used to. This project is the final jigsaw piece of the transport network in the north and north-west of Adelaide and will build on the great work already completed by the previous Labor government. This includes the duplication of the national highway from Adelaide to Port Wakefield, the Montague Road realignment, the South Road interconnector and the Salisbury Highway extension with a bridge which spans over Highway 1. The final piece of the jigsaw may also help expedite the redevelopment of the Port Adelaide area as a thriving residential, cultural and commercial centre. What does concern me, though, is not the funding commitment of the Commonwealth nor the state government's good intention to complete this project. It is the incompetence of senior management in the South Australian government departments that concerns me. I would have to question whether the current senior officers of the Department of Industry and Trade, the Land Management Corporation, state Treasury and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Aboriginal Affairs have the capability to implement such a project without creating considerable delays of their own making. I hope I am wrong, yet the evidence so far suggests I will not be. Take, for example, the Gillman land capability study. I understand it is long overdue and is now reaching the fourth draft report. It has not yet been seen by the Minister for Industry and Trade, the minister responsible for initiating the report in the first place. Another example is the Lipson Street wharf development, a major riverfront residential developr.1ent, which was seen as a litmus test for future success or otherwise of rejuvenating the Port Adelaide area. After all government agencies had agreed and signed off on the fine details, the project was held up for months as the developers could not get new deeJs of title for the land division from the bureaucracy. Unless the state government acts now and streamlines the administrative processes within the bureaucracy in South Australia, the bridge and Gillman Highway could be delayed longer than potential developers of the Port Adelaide area are prepared to wait. Investors are already frustrated with their inability to negotiate with the Public Service in South Australia. Any more delays may just as well be a window of opportunity lost for another 10 years or so. Paralympic Games with great anticipation to the Olympic Games in Sydney in just six months time.

Just as our athletes around the nation are building their training regimes to peak for the Olympics, so too are our paralympians doing so. I was delighted and proud to catch up last week with one of my local constituents who is training for the Paralympics. Reg Wilkinson is a very inspirational man. He is a successful businessman owning and operating Palm Beach Automotive Repairs. He and his wife Karen have four beautiful daughters. He is an amputee and a paracycling champion. Although Reg has only been training and competing professionally for less than six months, he won both the 4,000and !,OOO-metre track events in the paracycling division at the Queensland cycling championship in Townsville earlier this year. He is now training and fund raising for the opportunity to compete against the world in Sydney in October. I wish Reg well and urge McPherson residents to join me in supporting Reg's efforts to raise enough funds to be able to represent us at the Paralympics. We are huge sports fans on the Gold Coast, with our city playing host to a plethora of national and international sporting events. We are also a pretty generous bunch, so I hope we all get behind Reg. He is a truly inspirational man. I congratulate him on his success to date and wish him the best for October and the future. I also want to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am to be part of the Parliamentarians for the Paralympics. The aim of our group is to raise awareness and support within the Australian community for the Paralympic Games and to encourage attendance as spectators. I am very proud to be patron of the table tennis event at the Paralympics. I will take this opportunity to remind honourable members and others listening of the major fundraising event, Quilts 2000, taking place next month in Parliament House. The quilting fraternity of Australia has joined to create some historic quilts highlighting the Australian landscape and culture and promoting the Paralympics. These quilts are for sale and will be on display from Wednesday, 12 April in the Presiding Officers exhibition area here in Parliament House and ultimately will be displayed in the athletes village during both the Olympics and Paralympics. I urge everyone's support for Quilts 2000 and I encourage people from around the nation to lend their support and join in the excitement and inspiration that will be the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games from 18 to 29 October. Mandatory Sentencing Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney)-In the 1700s Edmund Burke said, 'Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays you instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.' The Prime Minister has said that he is opposed to mandatory sentencing, yet instead of showing leadership on this issue he is prepared to allow a young man to die in jail for stealing a few pencils. Last week Alan Bond was released from jail where he spent about one day for every million dollars he stole fropl his shareholders, and this week the Prime Minister has confirmed he will not allow his party to have a conscience vote on whether to overturn mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Mandatory sentencing costs lives and so qualifies absolutely for the usual tests applied when deciding whether a conscience vote is called for. The real hypocrisy here lies in the fact that the Prime Minister was quite happy to intervene in the Northern Territory's laws on voluntary euthanasia. There was no states' rights argument impeding his interference then, yet when it comes to sending children to jail-or for that matter, sending adults to jail for minor crimes-it is a 'hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil' approach. Mandatory sentencing of juveniles is contrary to our international obligations. It breaches article 37(b) and 37( c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by arbitrarily depriving children of their liberty, failing 14818 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 to use detention as a last resort, and failing to take the needs of the particular child into account. It is also in conflict with article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 40(2)(v) of the Convention of the Rights of the Child which require that sentences should be reviewable by a higher appellate court. Mandatory sentencing is poor law. It does not distinguish serious crime from petty crime and so undermines completely judicial discretion. That is why so many senior judges have condemned it. Mandatory sentencing is poor economics also. According to the Northern Territory Department of Correctional Services annual report for 1997-98, it cost $56,669.90 to incarcerate a person for a year. How much more effective would that money be spent on childhood education, health care, housing or employment programs? If the Northern Territory government are really interested in addressing crime rates they could spend the millions of dollars given to them by the taxpayers of other states on positive not punitive measures. The United States has recently incarcerated its two millionth citizen. Most Americans in jail are jailed for drug related offences, yet the drug usage in the community continues to rise. In Australia we must now decide whether we are any better than the United States and whether we are prepared to allow children to die in jail for stealing pencils or biscuits. Petrie Electorate: Redcliffe City Council Ms GAMBARO (Petrie)-In the short time. I have available for me today, I would like to correct some dreadful and misleading information that has been peddled around the Redcliffe City Council elections. Currently, I have seen some brochures that say that a vote for the Boulton-led council is a vote for John Howard and the GST and that every resident will pay an additional $1,600 on their rates. Not only is that misleading; it is just plain wrong. One of the most important things that needs to be remembered in all of this is that local governments will be great beneficiaries of the goods and services tax. They will also be able to claim back embedded taxes on all the services they use. Communication services will be cheaper for them by about four per cent; repair services will be six per cent cheaper; business services 2.5 per cent cheaper; and a lot of their services, such as marketing and accounting, will also be cheaper. They can also claim back full input tax credits should their costs fall by about 2.5 per cent. There will also be no GST on water, sewerage or waste, and they will be able to deliver those services at a low cost. When I became the member for Petrie in 1996 the Redcliffe area was a very depressed area, and a lot of credit needs to be given to Mayor Boulton and his team for the subsequent turnaround. Many of my colleagues and friends wished me well. Redcliffe was called a number of things, including 'Deadcliffe', which was not terribly complimentary. It was also called 'Inala by the Sea', and as Inala is a very tough area of Brisbane, that certainly was not a complimentary name. But now we have people coming back to the city of Redcliffe. The mayor and the council have reduced the crime rate in the area; they have developed the foreshore; they have upgraded and built a new jetty; and they have a vision business advisory group that has produced its own as encouraging people to visit the Redcliffe Peninsula. We have reintroduced the Sun Girls, and last week some 20,000 people came to a concert with Marcia Hines. There are export forums, new businesses are opening, and development is occurring on the Redcliffe Peninsula. People no longer say to me, 'Gee, it is a tough area, I wish you well.' They are now saying, 'Look, I would not mind coming down to Redcliffe and having lunch at one of those wonderful seafood restaurants.' What has been the reason for that? The area was depressed, no businesses were investing, it had a terrible attitude problem, and the residents themselves were depressed. I remember attending a forum in parliament for senior students where one of the students who attended the forum came from Redcliffe. I asked her what she was going to do Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14819 after she finished school and she said to me, 'I am looking forward to leaving Redcliffe.' Well, that is not the case any more. ,. This council should be judged on its merit's. It should be judged on the success that it has had over the last few years and not judged on things that are external. If it is judged on its merits, it deserves to be reinstated. I want to congratulate Councillor Boulton, his deputy Councillor Sutherland, and all of the councillors of Redcliffe City Council for the wonderful work that they put into the development of Redcliffe. Aviation: Essendon Airport ately reject applications by Impulse and Virgin to use large passenger aircraft at Essendon Airport, including the 100-passenger 717s proposed by Impulse, and the 150-passenger 737s proposed by Virgin. Mr O'Connor-What about Avalon? Impulse seriously proposes to use Essendon as a base for Boeing 717-200s. It is even more alarming that transport minister Anderson has still not replied to my letter to him of 12 January on this issue. I call on him to publicly rule out the reintroduction of large passenger jets to Essendon. I assure him and anybody else who is interested that if any attempt is made to do this there will be hundreds of people lying on the tarmac, just as hundreds of people attended protest rallies concerning this issue called by state member Judy Maddigan and myself earlier this year. Secondly, I call on the federal government, through the Airports Corporation, to re-examine the airport curfew and to ensure that residents can get a decent night's sleep. I have had a reply from the Essendon Airport general manager to a letter I wrote to him after receiving complaints from local residents that planes were landing and taking off at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. In it he confirms that planes are indeed taking off at 3 a.m. in a regular freight operation. He also states that the majority of propeller driven aircraft are not subject to the curfew. This is just not good enough. If the justification for allowing planes to land or take off at that time is that they are quiet or meet the noise requirements, then why are they waking up Strathmore and Essendon residents? Clearly, the curfew is inadequate and ineffective, and it needs to be toughened up and properly enforced. Finally, I want to congratulate the state Labor government on not offering local residents as a sacrificial lamb in its bid to secure the Virgin headquarters for Melbourne. I heard the Liberal opposition leader in Victoria, Denis Napthine, saying on radio that this would not have happened under the previous Premier, Jeff Kennett. Apart from noting that he did not say that it would not have happened under him, my response is this: perhaps Jeff Kennett would have told Virgin, 'Yes, you can fly 150-seat passenger aircraft out of Essendon.' He showed absolute contempt for the people of Niddrie over the quarry; he showed absolute contempt for the people of Werribee in relation to the toxic dump site; and he showed absolute contempt for the people of the north-western suburbs of Melbourne by imposing a toll on the Tullamarine Freeway. But we now have a state government which does not trample on local communities like that and, surely, after seven years we are entitled to a few years of a government which does not trample on local communities. I am proud to be a Labor representative when we have a state government that respects local communities, and I give Victoria's Acting Premier in January, John Thwaites, 10 out of 10 for the way he handled the Virgin issue.

The Townsville Croes have had a remarkable year. They have finished the regular season in second place behind the Adelaide 36ers. The statistics speak for themselves: a 22 to 6 win-loss record throughout the season, equal to that of Adelaide and the Perth Wildcats. Two Croes players, Sam Mackinnon and Robert Rose, are in the running for the NBL's Most Valuable Player award. Another Croc, Mike Kelly, has been nominated as Best Defensive Player. Townsville strong man Andrew Goodwin has been nominated for Most Improved Player and Ben Knight is in the running for the NBL's Best Sixth Man award. The Townsville Croes go into the play-offs having won their last seven games on the trot, including strong victories over Melbourne and Adelaide. The basketball-mad community ofTownsville and Thuringowa fans are behind them 100 per cent. I remember reflecting in this place on the Townsville Crocodiles when I made my first speech as the federal member for Herbert. In that year, the then Suns finished in the league at the bottom of the competition table, but that did not stop Townsville's legion of basketball fans turning out week after week, filling the entertainment centre with some 5,000 or 6,000 people in support of the Croes. So breaking into the elite ranks of the game was always going to be a long haul, but this year it has been the coming of age for the Townsville Croes. As one news story reported the other day: Townsville will go down in the books as the most potent, all-round offensive unit in NBL history after becoming the first team to finish the season atop the rankings in points scored per game, field goal percentage and three point percentage. Quite an achievement, don't you agree, Mr Deputy Speaker? The Townsville Croes chairman, David Carmichael, the other day reflected perfectly the pride with which Townsville holds his team when he said: We're the second smallest city in the NBL but we've got one of the best teams. It's been a great effort for everyone involved with the club and we've got a great group offans. In fact, we have got such a great group of fans that there is just not going to be enough room at the 5,257-seat Townsville entertainment centre for everyone who wants to see the Croes win in the coming NBL play-offs. The last home season game against Adelaide was sold out many days in advance of the game itself. Yesterday they put 1,300 tickets on sale for the playoffs and they were sold out in three hours-a wonderful response of the Townsville community. I certainly wish the Croes well and I reckon they have got the get-up-and-go to grab the championship title. the time for members' statements has concluded.

The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999, amends the Fisheries Management Act l991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 by introducing new measures for monitoring· and control of foreign and domestic fishing operations. It also proposes some changes to the way in which the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, operates. These measures are meant to complement the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Act 1999 and the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill (No. l) 1999, which both provide for combating illegal foreign fishing in the Australian fishing zone and the implementation of Australia's international obligations under the Fish Stocks Agreement. Those were two pieces of legislation on which the opposition supported the government. It was a Labor government that signed Australia up to those international obligations under the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and we were pleased to see that the legislation gave effect to the intent of the Labor government at that time. For the benefit of the Main Committee I will run through some of the main provisions of this bill. One provision is to place observers on foreign fishing vessels operating in interna. tional waters, where such observers are authorised -y a .treaty or agreement to which Australia is a party. It is very important for the verification of the obligations of international fishers that we exercise our rights, under treaties or agreements to which we are a party, to place observers on foreign fishing vessels. We have a particular problem with illegal fishing inside the Australian fishing zone and the overfishing of straddling stocks outside the Australian fishing zone in international waters. This provision is very important to the monitoring task that Australia must undertake if it wants to protect fisheries which may be low volume fisheries by world standards but which are certainly high value fisheries in the Australian and international context. Another provision is to extend the definition of foreign fishing boats to include support vessels and vessels not originally designed for fishing but subsequently equipped to fish. This will allow the government to deny port access to such vessels. In the past, vessels have been converted and used as mother ships to support fishing activities that sometimes are illegal. We need to deny those vessels port access in Australia, to make it even more difficult for them to carry out their illegal activities, both within the zone and outside the zone. The legislation provides for an increase id the penalty for providing false or misleading information about fish taken, processed or carried under a fishing concession from $6,600 to $27,500. It also allows a court to tailor a period for which a fishing concession may be suspended following a breach of conditions. This would allow a court to suspend a fisher's concession for a period coinciding with the fishing season in which the person normally operates. The objective of these two provisions is to increase the penalty burden, be it financial or a denial to that fisher of access to the fishery for the period of the season. These are good, sensible amendments and we are supporting them. The legislation requires fishers to collect data on bycatch of both fish and non-fish species, including sea birds, and it requires AFMA to include in management plans provisions directed at minimising incidental catch. The provision relating to the collection of data on bycatch of both fish and non-fish species is an important one. This is a very contentious area of policy but it is very important, not only for the industry but also for government in its monitoring of the environmental consequences of fishing and in addressing the sustainability issues, that these provisions are put in place. Australian fisheries are well managed. Internationally speaking, we have a very good reputation for the way in which we manage our fisheries. That is not to say that, historically, things have not occurred which governments have not agreed with. The fishing industry has in the past had a reputation for activities that have put the sustainability of many of our fisheries in jeopardy. 14822 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 Gradually, with the regional fishing management plans being put in place, and increasing sensitivity within the industry that they need to address these sustainability issues if they are going to have a real future, understanding is coming through. The sorts of provisions in this legislation certainly assist the monitoring process and protect these fisheries in a sustainable way. It is not only the industry that relies on this particular resource but many coastal regions and towns are very dependent on the processing and value adding activities of the fishing industry. It is incumbent on government to make sure that the resource is sustainable and that illegal fishing activities that deplete the resource and affect the sustainability of the resource are addressed as well. This particular legislation also allows AFMA to manage and carry out adjustments, restructuring and exploratory and feasibility programs devised by other agencies or within the government, and it makes AFMA liable to pay fringe benefits tax. Those are more minor amendments to the legislation that we are discussing here today. I want to make some comment on this particular industry because it does offer Australia real potential not only for employment growth but also for export growth. We have seen production volumes increase in value from $1.6 billion in 1995-96 to $1.8 billion in 1998-99. Export value over that particular time has increased dramatically from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a substantial industry and contributor to Australia's national exporting effort. Indeed, if we do protect the sustainability of this resource we can look forward to future discoveries as far as fisheries are concerned. If the management practices are put in place and the industry handles the sustainability issue carefully, we can look forward to sustained growth over time in both the volume of production and the value of that production. In 1998-99 the value of production of sectors within the fishing industry was as follows: rock lobsters $385 million; prawns $310 million; pearls $238 million; abalone $184 million and tuna $121 million. We are dealing here with very high value fish stocks. Because they are high value they are sought after and become the target for illegal fishers. The legislation that we are debating here today is an ongoing and evolving process of strengthening Australia's legislation in this area to protect this very valuable resource, not only to the national economy but to many coastal and regional economies as well. It is time that industry and government seriously addressed the sustainability issue. We have been making gains in that area over the last I Oto 15 years. In the legislation that has been brought down by the government and supported by the opposition on the floor of the parliament, there are measures to ensure that illegal activity, both within the Australian fishing zone and outside of it, in violation of regional agreements that have been struck, have appropriate penalties. We ought to have no hesitation at all in seizing vessels that we know are violating those regional agreements and illegally fishing in our zone or outside of it. Statistics on illegal boats caught operating in our zones show that 285 foreign vessels were apprehended in the Australian fishing zone between 1 March 1996 and 31 December 1999. A lot of those were what we call type II and type III fishing vessels. That refers to the different styles of Indonesian fishing boats that have been apprehended inside the Australian fishing zone. But the more ominous development is the 'other' category. These are flags of convenience or Chinese Taipei flagged ships which are operating illegally outside our fishing zone. Over the period 1996-98, we have seen what you would call a significant increase in the number of ships of this category. From1 March to 31 December 1996, three vessels were in violation of our fishing zone or fishing illegally. From1 January 1996 to 31 December 1997, that number increased to 11. From l January 1998 to 31 December 1998, nine vessels were in that category. It is a very important issue to the industry. It is a very important economic issue at the end of the day when the activities of these illegal fishers threaten the sustainability of the Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14823 fish resource and, in the long term, the sustainability of many coastal and regional communities. The opposition will not be opposing this legislation. We believe this is an area that requires some substantial tightening. The tightening of the legislation really provides an opportunity for Australia to insist on its legal international rights and clamp down on illegal fishing in our zone and in adjacent international waters. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.12 a.m.)-In rising to speak to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999, I would like to echo some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Corio, Mr O'Connor. Without a doubt, the fishing industry has been touched by the need to preserve stocks and manage its industry in an ecologically sustainable way. In my electorate of Petrie, fishing is one of the prime sources of employment. It has a thriving seafood industry in many aspects-from processing to the fishing vessels that go out into Moreton Bay-and a large number of operators who are only too aware of the need to preserve this very valuable commodity and industry for future generations. I do not know if many of you have visited ,t.he R€dcliffe Peninsula, but it is probably one of the most scenically beautiful parts of the outer Brisbane area. The member for Forde has some scenic parts in her electorate, but I am ble§sed with 35 kilometres of peninsula. My office overlooks Moreton Bay, and I can see out over the sandy straits to Moreton Island. It is not a bad position to be in. It is wonderful to be able to walk down the streets of my electorate and look across to the breathtaking view of the bay and everything it has to offer. The bay is full of some wonderful things, and it would be remiss of me not to mention some of its wonderful products. We have, of course, our famous Moreton Bay bugs; we have mud crabs; we have brown, tiger and banana prawns; and we have whiting. They are just a few of the wonderful delicacies of the Redcliffe Peninsula. Mr Sercombe interjectingcies. There are far too many wonderful creatures in Moreton Bay for me to mention in this speech, but I do agree that we have some wonderful fish stocks in Queensland. Fishing is also a favourite recreational activity in Petrie with thousands of locals and day trippers casting a line every weekend. I recently took my son out fishing. I have never caught a fish in my life, but he was able, in the space of a couple of short hours, to catch 16 whiting, which gives him the wonderful record of being the only person in a fish family to have actually caught a fish and not sell the end product as we do. In terms of the industry, the demand for quality seafood is always increasing and will continue to increase even more so. It is therefore important that members of the industry and the government work their very hardest to protect these activities. Currently, the total gross value of production for the Australian fishing industry is some $2 billion, according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics. The amendments contained in this bill are designed to refine Australian fish management practices, and that is a very good thing indeed. Under the legislation, Australia's enforcement and management controls will be strengthened in terms of both foreign and domestic boats. One of the existing issues in fisheries management is the narrowness of the definition of a 'foreign' fishing boat. I believe that in some cases foreign support boats have been fitted with fishing equipment, which means that, to all intents and purposes, those support vessels have had the ability to catch as many fish as the original vessel which was originally designed for fishing. This bill will allow for control over port access for these converted vessels as well as for foreign fishing boats. Since denial of port access is used to deter fishing that may affect agreed regional conservation measures, this is a very important management control.",122,Representatives Main Committee
326,Ms Gambaro,"Yes, whiting is very good-and bream and a number of other fish spe14824 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 Additionally, these measures assist by reducing illegal foreign fishing in the Australian fishing zone. Most Australians are aware of the disputes that have involved southern bluefin tuna, where Japanese long-line boats have been catching tuna outside the agreed management areas. It is important to note the importance of international agreements, particularly when it comes to fish species. Australia is going to be one of the beneficiaries of an international fishing agreement which was ratified only recently by 30 countries. Twenty-five countries have already ratified the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, which will allow better management of migratory fish stocks and associated marine environments. At present, all countries have the right to fish the high seas, which puts regulation of such fishing beyond the power of any individual country. However, some of these fish stocks live within the national fishing boundaries and adjacent high seas-and I refer to a report that was just recently put out by Minister Truss in Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry Australia which goes into some of the great developments in agriculture and fishing. But, most importantly for Australia, it means that some of these fish species such as orange roughy, tuna and billfish are distributed beyond the limits of the Australian fishing zone or migrate through it. The Australian government has looked at this in great detail. It has examined the environmental, economic, social and cultural effects of the agreement on different groups through a regulation impact statement and a national interest analysis. The government is also passing laws that will enable Australia to meet its obligations under the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, and it is important to note that our commercial and recreational fishing industries, environmental industry, the Australian community and regional economies will all stand to benefit from this. Ratifying this agreement will mean Australia will be able to sustain manageable fish stocks and will also control those associated independent species through regulating high seas fishing. Some compliance measures have been brought in-new management enforcement powers-and I will speak about those in a little while, but they deal with the problems that I have already mentioned of illegal, unregulated or unreported foreign fishing activities in our areas of interest. In this agreement, there is a common promotion of monitoring, data collection and sharing of international information, which will help in the decision making of the management of fish. It will also provide employment, food and income for future generations and will ensure that that sustainability will be maintained through fish stocks. So it is to be commended. The parties to that agreement need to be congratulated for their fine work and incredible efforts towards ensuring that this agreement was ratified, and I want to congratulate them on the great progress that they have made in that respect. One of the things which I spoke about earlier was the denial of port access, which has been a very important aspect, particularly with respect to tuna long-line boats. It will ensure that these boats will not be resupplied. The amendments in this bill allow the placement of observers on foreign boats outside the Australian fishing zone. The placement of observers will ensure that scientific research can be conducted in addition to the monitoring of compliance. It will mean that the amendments in the long run will contribute to the sustainability and management of the resource. Tough new deterrence measures are also included in this bill. There will be a penalty for providing false or misleading information about fish catches. The penalty will be raised from $6,600 to $27,500 on conviction. It is important that commercial operators provide accurate information to ensure that scientific assessment of fish stocks can be carried out correctly. In a move that further protects the Australian fisheries ecosystem, the amendments allow for data to be gathered on fishing bycatch that is caught incidentally during a fishing operation. By monitoring the bycatch, the Fisheries Management Authority will be able to develop systems for minimising waste and protecting the marine environment. Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14825 Mr Martin Ferguson-I thought you just sold them to us to eat. Ms GAMBAR0-1 am very passionate absmt fish, as the member opposite can see. Administratively, this bill will add to the efficiency of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by allowing for minor misdemeanours to be dealt with through means other than prosecution. Lastly, I would like to mention some other amendments. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 will amend the present tax exemptions of the authority. In conjunction with other measures already taken by this government, this bill will ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has the tools to be able to continue to manage and sustain Australia's valuable marine resource. I know that a number of fishermen and operators in my electorate and in other areas may not always agree with the management authority; they may have differing views. But it is there to provide some sort of guidelines. I think that generally and overall, it does have the best interests of fish stocks, resources and sustainability in mind when it does that. These amendments complement other legislation that has been passed through this parliament in relation to the monitoring of foreign fisheries in Australian waters. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Act (No. l) and the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 both deal with issues such as enforcement, forfeiture, detention and allowing the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to have greater control over vessels fishing in the Australian fishing zone. The task undertaken by the authority is quite considerable, as I have already mentioned. With Australia's fishing zone rated as the third largest fishing zone in the world, the problems will not diminish; they will only increase. It is important that Australia has the means to monitor compliance in its region by allowing the authority to manage both domestic and foreign fishing in the region. There is a greater possibility of Australia meeting its regional conservation management commitments. I have seen the flow-on effects in my own electorate of a successful commercial fishing industry and I support these amendments. I would also, in the context of speaking to this bill, like to mention some other areas in relation to fish management in order to ensure that they are not overlooked, because a lot goes into the management of these resources. One of the things I would like to mention is the great work that is being done at the moment by tire Australian Institute of Marine Science. Regularly they put out a research plan of the areas in which they are working. They deal with a number of areas, particularly the ocean environment, marine diversity, marine living resources, ecologically sustainable development and technological innovation. I would like to highlight the ocean environment because I think we take for granted, when we see a lovely piece of fish on our dinner table, that it has got there because a fisherman has gone out and caught it. The technology and research that go into the industry are absolutely phenomenal, as marine resources must be sustained and managed. They are based in Townsville at the moment and I have to commend them on the fine work that they been doing. Their professionalism, their teamwork and their respect for their staff and the outcomes are very important. At the moment they also are looking at changes to refishing coral and algae communities, environmental impacts on the ecosystem, and natural versus human induced changes to marine communities. It is important to note the great work that the Australian Institute of Marine Science does in this area. I would like to comment also on the environmental work that is being done in my particular region dealing with fishing and its consequences. I think it is important-and everyone will agree-to have a healthy marine ecosystem sustaining present and future generations, and pleasure and nutritional needs, with commercial fishermen harvesting quality products for the public. I have to commend the work that is done by the 2020 Ecovision report that I received recently covering areas such as Bribie Island and Moreton Bay. I congratulate them on look14826 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 ing at things such as input controls, permanent closures and restrictions, natural forces, the depth of the water, the physical nature of the seabed, rocks, snags, tides, weather and algae type blooms. They have also done work with free will decisions-fishermen make decisions constantly about ecological sustainability of the marine system, usually without realising that they are doing that in their normal day-to-day activities-and species-specific harvesting and bycatch which is very important particularly in the Moreton Bay area where you have to look at mesh, crab and haul fisheries and ensure that those things are taken into account. I would like to conclude by saying that I fully support this bill. I have seen the first-hand effects and the flow-ons of a successful commercial fishing industry in my electorate and throughout Australia. I fully support the amendments that have been made in the good management and interest of the Australian fishing industry. May I thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate and particularly the member who has just spoken. She has always taken a very keen interest in fishing industry issues-I think it could be fair to say from the sea to the plate-and her knowledgeable contributions to fishing industry debates are very appreciated. This bill contains a collection of amendments to fisheries legislation. The amendments flow from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's experience in administration of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 199 l. Fisheries management occurs in a dynamic environment and, as a result, there is a need to introduce new provisions to address the evolution of fisheries management. Also, there are requirements to refine various provisions including addressing anomalies which have been identified by AFMA since its establishment in 1992. Fisheries management is changing to have much more emphasis on ecosystem management and the need to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment. The Australian fishing industry is embracing ecosystem based management and, if not initiating, certainly working with Commonwealth agencies on appropriate gear technology and new fishing practices. Bycatch action plans are also being implemented across Commonwealth fisheries. This bill aids these current practical measures by requiring fisheries management plans to address incidental catches and the collections of bycatch data. The flexibility to manage high migratory species and straddling stocks is increasingly important in fisheries management regimes around the world. Several provisions in the bill relating to fishing by foreign fishing boats on the high seas adjacent to the Australian fishing zone are key elements of the legislation. The proposed measures provide agencies with the capacity to place observers on foreign fishing boats on the high seas to collect data. The bill also amends the definition of a foreign fishing boat for the purposes of port access regulation. Several fisheries have moved from management involving limits on numbers of boats and fishing equipment used to controls on outputs in the form of individual transferable quotas. Where ITQs can be implemented, they are a preferred approach, providing for reasons of economic efficiency and management flexibility. Amendments are proposed in two areas to embrace enforcement of quota management that relies on accurate reporting and recording of catches. Firstly, the types of offences for which a penalty infringement notice, an on-the-spot fine, can be issued is widened to allow an alternative to prosecution for minor transgressions. This may be a more efficient use of enforcement resources to secure compliance. Secondly, recognising that misreporting of catches is for the purpose of fishing without quota, it is proposed to increase the penalties for providing false and misleading information. The amendment increases fines from $6,600 to $27,500 so that this offence is comparable with unlicensed fishing by a domestic boat. If convicted, the",125,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.27 a.m.)Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14827 amendments enable a court to order forfeiture of a boat and the equipment, catch or proceeds of sale of a catch. The fishing industry is an increasingly important contributor to economic growth. Recent figures show an eight per cent increase to over $2 billion in the gross value of Australian fisheries production, with exports valued at close to $1.6 billion. The proposed legislation is intended to strengthen enforcement provisions and contribute to better management of Australian fisheries, which will have benefits for the ongoing viability and sustainability of the Australian fishing industry and the marine environment that supports it. May I thank again members who have contributed to this debate. The fishing industry is one of Australia's major industries with significant potential also for the future. These amendments will help in its management and help guarantee its future prosperity. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House withoufamendment. ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by Mr Anderson: That the bill be now read a second time. opposition that we support these three bills, the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000 and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000. They form part of a system of nationally consistent road transport laws. The first bill, the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, updates the annual heavy vehicle registration charges for the ACT and provides a model for consistent national charges by amending the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993. The 1993 act gave effect to the national charges in the ACT from 1 July 1995 and set the model, I am pleased to say, for other jurisdictions. The Victorian and Northern Territory governments referenced the charging regime in the 1993 act in their own legislation. Other states and the Commonwealth reproduced the system and level of charges in their own legislation. The act also makes some minor changes to definitional issues going to charging purposes. , I now deal with the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000. This bill implements the updated annual heavy vehicle registration charges for federally registered vehicles by amending the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. That 1985 act applies the existing national charges to vehicles registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. This scheme, as the House would understand, is administered under the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 by the states and territories on the Commonwealth's behalf. New charges for the federally registered vehicles are intended to come into effect on 1 July 2000, and states and territories, I am also pleased to note, are targeting this date. It ensures that federally registered vehicles continue to pay the same charges as state and territory registered vehicles, which I very firmly believe is appropriate. Finally, the Interstate Road Transport",128,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.33 A.m.),"I am pleased to say on behalf of the14828 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 Amendment Bill 2000 is part of implementing the new charges for federally registered heavy vehicles. It amends definitions in the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 referred to by the other act. Clearly, it is appropriate that the three bills be handled together. It is also pertinent to remind the House that the previous Labor government initiated a national approach to road transport reform in 1991. reminds me, was an issue of some contention, especially with respect to registrations for a long period. The road reform therefore got the teeth it needed with the intergovernmental heavy vehicles agreement 1991 and then the light vehicles agreement in 1992, and also through the formation in 1991 of the National Road Transport Commission and the valuable work that they do to drive reform and keep the industry informed and consulted. The Labor opposition retains a commitment to achieving a consistent national regulatory framework aimed at improving transport efficiency, improving road transport safety and reducing the compliance costs of regulation. The current charges were calculated by the NRTC back in 1992 and were put in place between 1995 and 1996 in the various jurisdictions. The updated charges contained in the bill are the first increases in charges since that date. It appears there is fairly consistent support for these changes across the states and the transport industry, which is pleasing. I think that is in no small part a result of the consultations undertaken by the NRTC and, importantly, an acknowledgment by the heavy vehicle industry of the impact of their vehicles and a preparedness to take responsibility for that damage. What we see in the road transport industry associations is some leadership on some of the hard issues-environment, accessible transport and road user charges. It is a pity, however, that the minister for transport is not reciprocating on the leadership front. In his second reading speechA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.37 a.m. to 10.50 a.m. Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the fact that the minister raised the issue of the Diesel Fuel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme in his second reading speech. This grants scheme arose out of that dirty little deal with the Democrats on the tax package. I went into some detail late last year about the shortcomings of that scheme resulting from the lack of detail and thought about how it would operate in practice. I also referred to the lack of definition about where the metropolitan conurbation boundaries would begin and end. The minister, as usual, handballed these issues to someone else rather than make a decision-in this instance, to the Commissioner of Taxation. I would like to note that here we are, five months after the administration and compliance aspects for the scheme were tabled in the House, and almost 10 months after the government did the original dirty deal with the Democrats on this scheme, and the industry is still uncertain about how the scheme will operate and what the boundaries are. But that is only the start of the difficulties. The industry will also have to contend with the new role of the Taxation Office's dipstick police, as they are known around the industry. I want to inform the chamber that the industry are quite rightly aggrieved by the shoddy way the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has introduced the change in what they regard as his lack of integrity and principle in dealing with these issues which should come with the authority and responsibility of the office. He has no right to herald the scheme as a great benefit to the industry. Those who operate in industry know better. I therefore would argue",129,Representatives Main Committee
329,Mr Snowdon,Don't I know it!,130,Representatives Main Committee
330,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Road transport, as the member for the Northern TerritoryWednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14829 that it is time that the minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, showed more leadership and took responsibility for these concerns. In closing today, I want to touch on another issue, one which I think is exceptionally important and which also requires some leadership and action by the minister. I would firstly like to compliment the Australian Local Government Association and those associated with the organisation of the successful Moree National Roads Congress. I think that, like me, you would appreciate-as does the member for the Northern Territory, because of the nature of his electorate-that in some instances, unfortunately, our rural road network is on the verge of collapse because of neglect for a variety of reasons. But I do not separate the issue of the difficulties on the road front with a variety of other infrastructure requirements confronting Australia at the moment. I refer, for example, to the infrastructure report released late last year by the professional engineers, who not only raised the question of roads infrastructure but also referred, correctly, to the issue of bridges, questions of access to technology, the matter of the quality of water and sewerage and also the capacity for some local authorities to improve their sewerage works. It is for us, as a nation, to decide whether or not we actually should establrsh ari independent infrastructure council free of government interference and the pork-barrelling that has occurred in recent times with respect to a number of grants that ought to be used for the public good rather than for election prospects, as was the case with the Natural Heritage Fund in the lead-up to the last election. I would clearly say that, from the Labor Party's point of view, we are actually prepared to debate and consider whether or not there ought to be an independent infrastructure council at arm's length to government to determine priorities and to consult with organisations such as the Australian Local Government Association on what our infrastructure requirements and priorities are. I think it is fair to say that politicians do not always get it right. Often they put aside the national good for short-term political means and pork-barrelling for the purposes of an immediate election in a marginal seat. I therefore think it is appropriate that we not only note but also have an open mind about the potential recommendations coming out of the Moree National Roads Congress. I hope these recommendations are taken seriously on both sides of the House. I welcome, for example, the establishment, by that important meeting of a range of local government associations around: Australia, of a steering committee to be convened by the Australian Local Government Association to develop a network to consider all the options available for repair and replacement of rural and regional roads. I also note-and I think the parliament should note-that this committee will develop a register of strategically important local roads that need immediate action and examine the funding sources available to repair and replace them. More importantly, I am pleased to note that this communique, which was issued on 7 March this year at Moree, correctly accepts that not all these infrastructure requirements can be provided by government. The demand for improvements in our infrastructure is bigger than that which can be provided by government at the moment, be it the federal government or a combination of state, local and federal governments. It acknowled_ges that, in trying to come to terms with these immediate infrastructure requirements, we as a community have to debate and examine considerable alternative funding sources in the private sector to achieve the required infrastructure road investment. I compliment the Australian Local Government Association and all those in attendance. Rather than just pointing the finger at federal, state and local governments, they have accepted that it is a community issue and that leadership actually requires people to face up to their responsibilities, to try to develop alternative sources of funds and alternative mechanisms to come to terms with the infrastructure requirements of this huge nation. 14830 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 The committee will also therefore develop a mechanism to identify all regional transport infrastructure requirements as part of the work of that steering committee. It will develop the necessary data and statistical base to support this approach and in doing so, in a constructive way, seek to work with federal and state ministers to develop proposals to achieve the repair and replacement of Australia's strategically important local roads. I think we are starting to actually make progress when we get constructive communiques such as the one we received from the national Rural Roads Congress, which was held on 7 March 2000 in Moree. I told those responsible for organising this meeting, prior to it occurring, that I think it is accepted in Canberra-and also at a state and local government level all around Australia-that we have a huge problem and that, if they want to be taken seriously as players in this debate, they should not just point out the problem but actually try to put on the table some proposals for us to consider and debate in a proper, constructive way in a forum such as this. I firmly believe that the organisers-the Australian Local Government Association-and all those associated with them have taken on that challenge and brought forward a constructive, reasonable communique which actually challenges members of this House. I thank the ALGA for that and urge them to continue their meaningful discussions with a view to coming forward with even more constructive proposals as to how we should be able to make progress on the demanding issue of trying to improve rural and regional roads in the foreseeable future. With those comments, I merely reiterate what I said at the outset-that the Labor opposition supports the bills before the parliament. These bills build on work initiated by the Labor government in the early 1990s, and I am pleased to say that it has been continued by the Howard government since 1996. Mr ST CLAIR (New England) (10.58 a.m.)I rise to support the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000 and related bills. The purpose of the amendment bill is to amend the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 to implement updated nationally consistent heavy vehicle registration charges that have been agreed by the Australian Transport Council, comprising the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers responsible for transport. The amendment also updates definitions to align them with definitions in more recent national road transport legislation. The bill forms part of a system of nationally consistent road transport laws envisaged under the intergovernmental agreements on road transport, signed by heads of government in 1991-as the member for Batman mentioned, the heavy vehicles agreement and in 1992 the light vehicles agreement-which are scheduled to the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991. Nationally consistent heavy vehicle charges are, as we are aware, an essential component of the road transport law reform being put in place by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and by the National Road Transport Commission under the intergovernmental heavy and light vehicles agreements. A major difference in charges between states and territories really has put a straightjacket on efficiency and competitiveness within the road transport industry-a vital sector of the economy-and it was one of the key issues that the government recognised needed to be fixed through a cooperative reform process. In accordance with the agreements, it is intended that the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000 will amend the substantive law of the Australian Capital Territory in respect of heavy vehicle registration charging. Victoria and the Northern Territory intend to adopt the bill unchanged as the law in their respective jurisdictions. The remaining states and the Commonwealth will adopt the substance of the bill in their own legislation. This bill has been developed by the National Road Transport Commission through an extensive process beginning in 1998, in consultation with state and territory registration Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14831 authorities and transport agencies, the Commonwealth, the transport industry and other interested parties. Road transport charges were last calculated fo 1992 and put in place by the government and all states and territories in 1995 and 1996, pursuant to intergovernmental agreements. Since then the National Road Transport Commission estimates that costs of heavy vehicle road use have increased from an annualised $1.05 million to a current figure of $1,280 million, and the current charges underrecover these amounts. However, the National Road Transport Commission considers that two-thirds of heavy vehicle road costs are to be recovered through a nominal component of existing Commonwealth diesel excise. Registration charges will recover an estimated $424 million, up from $399 million from current charges, an increase of 5.5 per cent. It is important to note that the charges do not increase for over 80 per cent of the 335,000 heavy vehicles over 412 tonnes. Where increases do occur, they are moderate and mostly for the heaviest vehicles that cause most road wear. It is also important to note that the industry broadly supports and accepts the updated charges. The updated charges are proposed to be implemented by all jurisdictions, including the ·Commonwealth for federally registered vehicles, from 1 July 2000. Some of the states may not meet this target. However, they will implement them as soon as possible after July 2000. The bill will allow the ACT government to recover an additional $115,000 from heavy vehicles in the Territory. However, the associated increases in charges represent a very small change in the costs of operating vehicles, typically less than one per cent of total operating costs flowing from the government's taxation reforms. In conclusion, I will take up the matter which the member for Batman raised. All of us, particularly in rural Australia, are very much aware of the state of our rural roads, both local and regional. I make the point that it is much easier to be able to put infrastructure funding and road funding in place when you are operating in a surplus than it is to try to bring funds to account when you are operating in a deficit. I mention that because I think it is important that we now look collectively with local, state and federal government at a way of putting infrastructure on to our roads to make sure that our road networks satisfy the requirements of communities at large. This amendment bill has widespread support and I commend it to the House bills that are before the House: the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000 and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000. It is not my intention to go through the nature and purpose of these pieces of legislation because that has been done adequately by previous speakers. However, I want to concentrate on a couple of aspects of the discussion in relation to road transport. A number of people who have already contributed to this debate have talked about the heavy vehicle agreement of 1991 and the light vehicle agreement of 1992. I have intimate knowledge of these agreements because I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications in the early,nineties. I can remember the difficult gestation and ultimate birth of these two agreements. The difficulty arose out of a great deal of contention within the road transport industry, particularly with heavy vehicles, in relation to applying national road user charges. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you may or may not be aware that there were elements within the coalition parties who opposed the proposals at the time. I am sure you are surprised at that; I am sure you would not have been opposing them at the time. The Northern Territory government, for example, was vociferous in its opposition, claiming that the world would all but end if we did not do this thing differently. Therefore, it is with some pleasure that I note that the changes initiated by the then Labor government, of which I was part, have been carried through by this",130,Representatives Main Committee
331,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (11.04 A.m.),"-lt is my pleasure to speak on the three14832 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 current government with the agreement of all states and territories, and that is a sign to me of -ome maturing in the relationship between governments over this very difficult and vexed issue. It also says a lot about the role that the National Road Transport Commission has played in that process, and I want to commend those people involved for the valuable work they do in bringing these important issues about road transport to the government and ultimately to the parliament through the form of this legislation. But I want to concentrate on highlighting the issues which were touched on by my friend the member for Batman, the shadow minister in this area. He talked about the conference in Moree, the National Rural Roads Congress, and the importance of addressing the needs of regional infrastructure in terms of regional and remote Australia. I have not read the documents from that meeting but I have some concern that they do not properly comprehend the issues involved in remote Australia. I am one of the few people in this parliament who have any experience of living in these regions or who have involvement with the road transport industry in these regions. It may appear trite to say that the difficulties confronted by these transport operators and, indeed, the communities around northern Australia in particular are very different from the difficulties that confront their cousins who live in Sydney and Melbourne or along the eastern seaboard. They bear special consideration. You will be aware of the recent heavy rains and cyclones which have traversed the top of Australia and which have had implications right down through the centre. I was advised this morning-and I want to refer to one particular road-that the Tanami Road has been unable to have heavy transport on it for over a month and it is still impassable. This has important implications because the Tanami Road is a wealth producer. It not only links very important Aboriginal communities but it is also extremely important in the production of gold. You would be aware of the Granites and Tanami goldmines, both very important producers and contributors to the Northern Territory economy. Along with others in the region, they are ultimately very important to our national wealth. That road also provides access for travellers to and from remote Aboriginal communities such as Yuendumu, in particular, but also other communities beyond such as Papunya and a whole range of communities north-west of Alice Springs. The road between Alice Springs and the Granites is around 550 kilometres in length. Of those 550 kilometres, about 150 kilometres is bituminised. Under normal travel circumstances, without the floods, it takes approximately 12 hours for a heavy vehicle, a road train, transporting fuel from Alice Springs, to get to the Tanami, to the Granites goldmine. That is a significant amount of time, bearing in mind that 150 kilometres of this road are bituminised. I am informed this morning that the Granites goldmine has only three days of diesel left. It is quite possible that in the near future it will have to close, or at least shut down until it can get additional supplies. That will impose a tremendous cost on the people who run the goldmine, and also the community. What it highlights is the importance of roads as essential infrastructure to all of regional Australia. In particular, it highlights the way in which these roads are affected by climatic conditions. The reason I mention this particular road is that it provides a very good example. I am advised that the cost of running a road train across this road is roughly twice the cost of running a road train up and down the Stuart Highway. The prime movers of these road trains cost about $350,000 a piece. You do not have to be Einstein to work it out, but if you halve the life-double the cost-you will be up for an enormous amount of money on a continuing basis to provide transport in and out of these communities. I am aware of communities in the Northern Territory where road transport operators in the past have actually refused to carry goods because of the state of the roads. Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14833 Whilst we are talking about uniform charges across roads across Australia, I think we need to comprehend that those people who live in ,regional and remote areas are not being well serviced in terms of infrastructure developments in those regions. The Granites is one example. It provides important economic gains to the Northern Territory economy. It is an important transport route for gold producing companies. It is an important transport link for tourist operators who travel between Alice Springs, Halls Creek and the Kimberley. It is therefore not just any old country road. The difficulty is that it is not being given the attention that it should be getting in terms of its use and its importance to the local economy. An observation which is perhaps worth making is that the Northern Territory government has committed itself to around $150 million of its own resources for the development of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, a proposal which has my strong support. But it is worth noting that the Northern Territory government has not put significant amounts of money into these regional roads, although I must say that it has some difficulties in this area at present. As a result of the recent rains, it has had to contribute at least $5 million to the repair of roads which have been damaged in the southern part ofthe_Northern Territory. I note the member for Grey is sitting in tlie chamber. He will understand this. There are many areas in the north-west of his electorate which will be weeks, if not months, without road access as a result of heavy rains. I know of communities in my own electorate, apart from the ones up and down the Tanami Road, that will be without access to road transport for at least six weeks to two months as a result of heavy rains. This imposes an enormous burden on the communities that these roads serve. It is an enormous burden which is beyond the comprehension of people in this chamber; an enormous burden which is beyond the comprehension of the policy makers and planners in this government; an enormous burden which is beyond the experience of all but a handful of members of the parliament; an enormous burden which should demonstrate to the people of Australia why it is so important to understand the nature and the needs of infrastructure for the bush. Road transport is important. Communications generally are important. If you cannot provide proper telecommunications and you cannot provide proper road transport links for these communities, then you are cutting off the lifeblood of these communities in terms of their ongoing existence and their ongoing participation in the economy and our community. It is my view, my very strong view, that we as a nation have to do far more in recognising the needs of regional and remote Australia, but particularly in this instance of remote Australia, and particularly in terms of infrastructure. I note the support which has been implicitly given by the shadow minister, the member for Batman, for an infrastructure council. But I question, I have to say, whether it is within the realms of the experience of those people who would be on that council to understand the nature of the infrastructure needs of people living in rural and remote Australia. In fact, without the input from people in the Northern Territory government and people involved in the Northern Territory road transport industry, I do not think they can have that experience; nor can they have that experience without input from the Northern Territory communities that are affected. What we need to comprehend, apart from the issues which I have raised, is the impact that is being felt in these regional communities, a long way from capital cities, of the current cost of diesel. The operating costs of cattle road trains, triple-bogie road trains, have increased by 30 per cent as a result of the change in the diesel fuel price from 64c a litre to around 85c a litre in the Northern Territory. If you increase the operating costs of a road train by 30 per cent, that has a significant impact upon the costs which are borne by the local community not only in terms of services they receive but also in terms of the cost to industry-in this case, in terms of the cattle industry, in getting their beasts to market. 14834 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 I am told this morning that this is the most urgent issue confronting the road transport industry in regional Australia. While I note that there is discussion, and I heard the contribution from the member for Batman who spoke about the proposed changes to diesel costs and made reference to dipstick police which we all comprehend, the bottom line is that people who live in regional and remote areas are confronted by huge fuel prices. Whether or not it is diesel or petrol, at the moment in the north-east of Arnhem Land you will be charged $1.30 a litre for unleaded fuel, and in Alice Springs you are paying $1.02 a litre. There would be a revolt if you were paying $1.30 a litre in Sydney or Melbourne. Motorists would be barricading petrol stations. Motorists would be confronting the Prime Minister and saying, 'Bring down fuel prices.' Yet nothing is being done for these people living in regional and remote communities. This is an urgent issue which needs to be confronted by the government and addressed properly. At the moment it has not been, and I do not see any sign of it being done. Another issue which is of concern to the road transport industry in Northern Australia is the way in which the eastern seaboard road transport operators and governments deal with issues like safety and driver hours. I do not need to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we need to acknowledge these differences in attitude, in experience, in performance that confront us across the nation. Yet because of the way this nation is structured, because of the geography and demography of the place, because the bulk of the population lives up and down the eastern seaboard, the people with the swing, with the power in terms of making these determinations, are weighted on the eastern seaboard. So the considerations which people in remote Australia want to have taken into account in determining what is appropriate in terms of road safety and, in particular, road driving hours, are not properly taken into account. It is my very strong view that this needs to be done. If you look at the experience of the road transport industry and road train operators in Northern Australia, you will see that their safety record is second to none. Whilst there might well be legitimate arguments for the way in which you deal with driver fatigue, there also needs to be an understanding of the nature of the operations of these road transport companies in regional and remote Australia. There is a real issue about how these things might in fact compromise safety instead of assisting it. It is not my intention to traverse other issues about the road transport industry but I do want to make sure that what I am talking about here is understood. Governments-that is governments in the plural, of any political persuasion-need to understand the nature of remote Australia, the difficulties that the residents of those communities in remote Australia confront in terms of the transport infrastructure, the roads, they are provided with, the costs that are imposed upon them because of the nature of the road infrastructure and the costs they experience as a result of living in those communities. Until this nation comes to terms with those things we are not going to be able to properly address this nation's primary objective. That is to make sure that we all participate as equals: that there is some sort of equity in the development of policy and that we understand that the needs of these people are being properly addressed. When the Labor Party was defeated in 1996 there was a regional roads program operating in the Northern Territory at $15 million over three years. One of the first things done by the Howard government when it came into power in 1996 was to close off the program. That program was identified as improving the road infrastructure for regional communities, outside of the major metropolitan areas in the Northern Territory, yet it was cut-just abolished-by the Howard government. That has meant that the people I have been referring to here have suffered increased costs resulting from the failure to upgrade and maintain those roads properly. I commend the legislation to the House. Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14835 tory has spoken about the attitude of companie-_on the eastern seaboard to driver hours and things like that. I remember years ago when the attitude in the Northern Territory to travelling any distance was that it was a 'carton trip' to Katherine and 'two cartons' to Alice Springsthat sort of thing. I must admit that attitudes up there have gone a long way since those days. Certainly they are very progressive on drink driving and those sorts of things these days. In Australia there are 11,737,923 vehicles, according to the motor vehicle census on 31 October 1998. That presents a massive administrative problem for the Commonwealth government and for all governments, and the proposed legislation goes to a very important part of the administrative structure that we need to ensure that our road network and the vehicles using that road network are dealt with in an efficient and effective manner. I have given the total figure for motor vehicle use in the whole of Australia; let us now look at trucks in particular. In Queensland we have 11,775 registered articulated trucks, 68,885 rigid trucks and 339,925 light commercial vehicles. The distance travelled in Australia every year by light commercial vehicles is 24,958 million kilometres; by rigid trucks it is 6,015 million kilometres every year; and by articulated trucks, 4,921 ·million kilometres. That is a total for Australia, for all vehicles, of 173,317 million kilometres travelled every year. That puts a massive burden on our road network and it is the responsibility of the government to bring down legislation that reflects the impact of those vehicles on our community in terms of the cost of running them and also of providing infrastructure to support them. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000 and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000 implement updated, nationally consistent heavy vehicle registration charges that have been agreed by the Australian Transport Council, comprising the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers for transport. The legislation contains provisions that relate to revisions to definitions of classes of heavy vehicles for charging purposes and the levels of heavy vehicle registration charges to be levied from 2000 to 2001. The current national charges were calculated in 1992 and implemented nationally in 1995-96. They no longer reflect the road use costs of heavy vehicles. · By way of background, I need to go back to 1992 and 1993. In 1993 the Commonwealth parliament passed the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 setting registration charges for the ACT, including Jervis Bay, from July 1995. Parliaments in other jurisdictions subsequently adopted the same charges, although some of them did not come into force for a number of years after that. Under previous arrangements, each state government had its own set of charges and regulations for heavy vehicles. That was changed at the Special Premiers Conference in 1991 and the Commonwealth and state governments agreed to set up a national approach to regulation of heavy vehicles. To that end, the National Road Transport Commission was established. I think everyone would agree that, when it comes to national road transport, it is important we deal with these things on a national level. The old system of having states administer their own sets of circumstances obviously led to all kinds of difficulties. The National Road Transport Commission takes into account, in relation to heavy vehicle charges, the following objectives: to achieve full cost recovery; to achieve a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity; to improve the link between pricing and investment decisions and minimise the incentive for people to 'shop around' for lower registration charges; to adopt a common methodology based on the pay-as-you-go principle; and to minimise the incentive for operators to 'shop around' among different states and territories for lower charges, as no doubt they certainly did under the previous state based operation.",133,Representatives Main Committee
332,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (11.22 A.rn.),"The member for the Northern Terri14836 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 The National Road Transport Commission has had several issues to consider. It has the legal responsibility to regularly review the level of charges. It is required to apply the guidelines I referred to a minute ago and to assess whether charges are at the right levels. How are these charges calculated? There are two parts to national heavy vehicle charges: a fuel charge, which is part of the diesel excise, and a fixed annual registration charge. The charges are set to ensure that the road transport industry pays its way for the costs it causes-for maintenance and other problems relating to roads and bridges. This is done by recovering the share of road spending which can be reasonably allocated to heavy vehicles. Since 1992, when the first determination of charges was established, it is calculated that road spending has increased considerably-by 17 per cent for arterial roads-and costs attributed to heavy vehicles have increased by 25 per cent; the typical cost of roadwork has also increased by 10 per cent; and the use of roads by heavy vehicles has changed: there is less use by rigid trucks and more use by articulated trucks. I think any bystander, no matter what footpath they were standing on, would have noted the arrival of B-doubles and that type of transport. Articulated road transport types are certainly more popular and, I think, more cost-efficient for the people operating those trucks. Changes to the pattern of road spending and other factors mean that, at a total level, road spending related to heavy vehicles has increased by approximately 25 per cent, or $280 million, since 1992. This compares with a 10 per cent increase in the general cost of living during that time. Higher registration charges reflect trends such as increased road use by the heaviest vehicles; changes in the pattern of road expenditure; underrecovery of costs for heavy vehicles when it was assessed against that first determination, which I spoke about earlier; and some overrecovery of costs for lighter vehicles. The people with lighter vehicles are copping it in the neck and the people operating the increasing number of B-doubles on the road are basically getting away with a position that we would prefer not to see. There have been other initiatives during this time. I should refer in passing to a recent vote by the ministers on the Transport Council to allow the indexation of heavy vehicle registration charges based on increases in the consumer price index. Under that proposal, ministers would make an annual decision on whether to apply indexation. The proposal would not affect the update of charges from 2000 but would allow indexation from 1 July 2001. There are two zones that relate to these activities. The cost of providing roads certainly is not going backwards and it is appropriate that we face up to reality and focus our attention on growing expenditure on roads over time. However, there was insufficient support from ministers for indexation to apply nationally in all states. Ministers have agreed to reconsider the issue of indexation at the next ATC meeting. One of the things that people immediately fire up about when we talk about trucks using our roftds is the alleged threat that they pose to road safety. It is timely in the context of this debate that we consider what is happening in relation to that view. In looking at the statistics on fatal crashes involving articulated trucks in the period from 1981 to 1998, it is interesting to see just what has happened. In every case, no matter which state you go to, the number of fatal crashes in that period involving articulated trucks has declined overall. For example, in New South Wales over that 1981 to 1998 period, the highest number of fatal crashes actually occurred in 1988, with 120. There was a peak also in Victoria in 1989 of 57. In Queensland, the number of fatal crashes involving articulated vehicles basically tapered down from 4 7 in 1981 and a peak of 53 in 1982 to 28 in 1998. That has been apparent to people who have followed concerns in the community about this issue over that time. It is good to see that happening, but we must remain vigilant and continue to promote improved road safety outcomes. The decline is also reflected in the number of fatalities. No matter which state you go to, the number of actual fatalities in that period involving articulated trucks declined overall, with Wednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14837 peaks of 151 fatalities in New South Wales in 1988, 68 fatalities in Victoria in 1989 and 1990, 60 in Queensland in 1989 and 31 in South Ausn;alia in 1989. The most recent peak amongst all the states occurred in Western Australia, which recorded 26 fatalities in 1997. If we look at the impact of speed zones, we can see again that truck safety is improving overall. For example, in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-where there were a number of crashes to talk about; the numbers tended to drop off in other states-the number of crashes in low-speed zones involving articulated trucks again tapered off. In New South Wales it went from 38 in 1990 down to 22 in 1998; in Victoria it went from 17 down to eight over that same period; and in Queensland it went from 12 down to seven over that period, with a peak of 15 in 1994. In high-speed zones, we have a good record to talk about and I will not dwell on that too much. One thing that is of concern is another statistic I dragged up in relation to hospitalisation. It seems that, while we do have improved safety in terms of deaths on our roads, there is concern about hospitalisation. If we take the period referred to here-and it may be a blip but I think it is something we should consider-the numb.er of crashes between 1996-1997 and 1997-98 involving articulated trucks where hospftalisation occurred as a result rose by 27 per cent from 444 to 568. SoI think that is something that needs to be looked at, and maybe some of the in-cabin elements of safety or whatever' in these vehicles need to be looked at more carefully. We have seen the advent of airbags in cars, and there may well be initiatives that we need to look at again in relation to trucks. In the time available to me, I would like to talk a little about freight comparisons. When we look at the costs of running trucks along the roads and the impact that they have on them we also have to consider other freight comparisons. Doing the rounds at the moment is the comparison between trucks on the roads and trains on the tracks; there is a lot of talk about that. The Bureau of Transport Economics' working paper No. 40, 'Competitive neutrality between road and rail', talks about what is happening. It says: Under the current road user charging system, trucks overall are undercharged for their use of the road systemWe have heard that alreadyMoreover, larger, more heavily laden vehicles and those travelling longer distances are charged the least (per tonne kilometre) while smaller, Jess heavily laden vehicles and those travelling shorter distances cross-subsidise them. If both road and rail paid more competitively neutral charges, including charges for externalities, in a system designed to fully recover costs from users, both road and rail freight rates would fall by 5 per cent relative to current freight rates. With no shift in relative freight rates, and in the absence of other changes, the historical decline in rail's share of intercity freight transport is likely to continue. When we talk about the cost of running road transport this is something that we are going to have to address. RecentlyI was with members of the Harvest Trail Working Committee which has been looking into fruit picking, and we were staying at Gundagai where we were going to do some picking. We were in a caravan park adjacent to the Hume Highway, and it was very difficult to get a good night's sleep. I am not appealing just on behalf of fruit pickers, but when you hear the noise and observe the energy that is being generated by the trucks, and think about the impact that that has on the roads, you can just hear the dollars being burnt up while you are lying there awake at night. So it is important that we look at the issue of rail as an alternative. Of course, the classic issue being raised at the moment is the Melbourne to Darwin railway line, and I will speak briefly about the component of that line that goes from Melbourne to Brisbane. That railway line seeks to do for rail transport what the Newell Highway has done for truck transport. Everybody knows that the Newell really has been revolutionary in the way 14838 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 trucks can cover the distance between Brisbane and Melbourne. It means that freight that follows such a route does not have to go through the great snarl of traffic around Sydney, so of course there is a much cleaner processing of freight. The railway line proposal, which follows basically a similar kind of plan, is well thought out because it provides the same advantages in the saving of time which otherwise would be lost. It ensures a much cleaner flow of freight and a greater opportunity for people who are producers in the western areas of the state to access an efficient rail system. Of course, I think they will choose it above the road and, as a consequence, the cost that is being added to produce out of that area will be reduced significantly. The railway line proposal needs to be considered. It is something that would provide an advantage to people in my electorate of Blair, although we are not right out there in the western part of New South Wales-we are actually on the very end of the Melbourne to Brisbane component of this proposal. But just in that area alone there are many advantages that can flow. At present there is no doubt that people in the Lockyer Valley, out to Toowoomba, are in many respects being cut off from the economic advantages of their location in south-eastern Queensland by the fact that they do not have a decent rail network. In the time that it takes to hop onto an old diesel engine and travel from Toowoomba to Brisbane-because you can only get on an old diesel train to travel that distance-you could have travelled to Bundaberg by tilt train from Brisbane. It is incredible that, with respect to passenger services on a rail line that is not very long-in fact it equates roughly in length to the line between Brisbane and Gympie-we are missing out because we do not have the opportunity to have passenger services over that distance. Bundaberg but, as I say, people in the Lockyer Valley and Toowoomba are missing out on access to this great powerhouse, the economic powerhouse that is south-east Queensland, because we do not have access to those sorts of rail services. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to commend the vision involved in that project. It is going to involve a lot of work for people to get it off the ground, but I think it will mean a lot, not just to me and to people in my electorate, but to people in electorates all over the southeast of Queensland. It is a way in which we can balance some of the incredible expenditure that is currently needed to support the road transport industry and make not only the rail network but also the road network more efficient, because trains carrying freight over a long distance will still need trucks to be available at the other end to be able to process that freight. cific Highway. The national highway cuts across the corner of it and passes through the centre of the biggest city in the electorate, the city of Maitland, with 45,000 people. The recently completed Thunderbolts Way goes from New England down through Gloucester and on to Bucketts Way. SoI could not let this piece of legislation pass without saying a few words about it. I recognise the statistics that have just been given by the previous speaker, the member for Blair, Mr Cameron Thompson. Those of us who live near highways do recognise that the nature of trucks is changing. I compliment most trucking companies, because there is no doubt that the trucks we see on the road today are in very good order; they are very high powered. Undoubtedly, the reason that there are fewer accidents is because of their very advanced mechanical nature-in particular, their ability to stop. Their braking systems are a tribute to modern engineering.",137,Representatives Main Committee

335,Mr Horne (Paterson) (11.42 A.m.},"I represent an electorate which is bisected by the PaWednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14839 What we are doing by building bigger trucks and having more trucks on the road is passing the buck. We are passing the buck to local government areas which, there is no doubt in my mind, are underfinanced to blazes. When I think'of small shires in my electorate such as Dungog and Gloucester, which have large areas of arterial roads but which have a total budget in the order of $4 million, I know that they do not have the resources to maintain a road to a standard that is acceptable for use by these trucks. So while it is all right to come in here and talk about legislation that is going to provide uniform charges for trucking companies, I feel that while we are addressing the trucking industry we should be looking at the real cause of some of the problems. I particularly remember that in 1995-Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, you would remember this, too-the Hon. Laurie Brereton, the then minister for transport, and the Hon. Michael Knight, the minister for road transport in New South Wales, went to Raymond Terrace and announced the upgrade of the Pacific Highway-a fantastic feat. I also recall the reaction of the opposition at the time; it said that $2 billion was not enough, that $4 billion was needed. We see now that the contribution by the government is down to $600 million. It is not enough money for that piece of infrastructure. It is a major piece of infrastructure that is not only making it safer for these trucks to travel on the roads; it is also making it safer for the people who live in the small towns and villages along that highway to travel on the roads. While we are addressing the truck issue, I think it behoves all ofus to put pressure on every minister for transport, regardless of his politics, that if Australia is going to accept that trucks are the lifeblood of the transport industry-and industry will determine if they are going to take over from rail-to ensure that the road network is there to make transport safe. I would also point out quickly that some of the decisions taken by other ministers also affect the nature of transport. For example, last year an abattoir closed in the Hunter Valley at Aberdeen with a loss of 400 jobs. Essentially it closed because of industrial relations legislation. That tragedy is something else that we should not debate here, but it did not mean that the amount of cattle that were slaughtered at Aberdeen simply stopped being produced. The beef and cattle producers of the Hunter Valley are still there and they are still producing a top product. It just means that now well over 100 double-deckers of cattle are going from the Hunter Valley to Dinmore at Ipswich every week. That is the sort of result when a decision to close a meat works is taken. That decision was made by Australian Meat Holdings because it wanted to improve its economic output. Where does the cost go? The cost comes back to the road users because the increase in transport cost is then passed on to the consumer. It is passed on to the council where those trucks travel. We need to broaden our spectrum considerably when we talk about road transport. We need to identify where the real costs are. I had a visit by the Deputy Prime Minister recently-he did not come to see me, I can assure you. He was introduced by the state National Party member but I thought I would go along for the ride. He came along to announce a total of $410,000 for the Bucketts Way to upgrade an intersection to remove an area where there had been a number of fatalities in the Gloucester area. That is a road that has been identified by the four local government areas that have ownership and jurisdiction of that road as needing $10 million over the next four years to upgrade it. It is a road that has eight to l O timber bridges and they will not be replaced by the $10 million. I support road transport. I have a lot of people who make their living out of road transport in my electorate. They are hard workers and I know how productive they are and how necessary they are for our community, but we need a government that identifies the real problem with transport and that is building a road network that is suitable to take the vehicles. shunted about so much that I thought that I was on a very rough truck there for a while, going backwards and forwards.

336,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (11.48 A.m.),"1 had to wait so long to speak on these bills and was14840 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 15 March 2000 Not surprisingly I support this legislation, the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000, and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000, as indeed does the opposition support it. This is an ongoing process of trying to bring uniformity into transport throughout Australia. It has been going for some time. We have now got the interstate licences, registration and a whole host of things like that It has been very interesting listening to what some of my colleagues have said and there has been latitude given in the wide ranging debate on the legislation. For instance, my friend and colleague the member for the Northern Territory was talking about fatigue in truck drivers. It was quite interesting. I am delighted that the chair of the Communications, Transport and the Arts Committee, the member for Hinkler, is with us. That committee has been carrying out an inquiry into fatigue in transport. Of course, I cannot reveal what will be in the report yet but I have a point to make. The honourable member for the Northern Territory talked about fatigue and how people could learn from the drivers in the Northern Territory and from the transport industry in the Northern Territory. We are always happy to learn, and it would help our learning process if the Northern Territory trucking industry or transport industry had bothered to put in a submission to our inquiry. We were quite surprised that we did not get any submissions from the Northern Territory because, as the member rightly identified, with the huge road trains there, their submissions would have been interesting. The member for Hinkler and I spoke in Queensland and we had a discussion there on logbooks. It was put to us how sometimes the rules are foolish. For example, you may have driven for a certain number of hours and therefore have to stop. But you may have a truckload of cattle and be only 100 kilometres from where your journey ends and so those cattle might have to stay there in hot weather and various things like that. There is an argument there about more flexibility. Most people who know anything about the transport industry accept that logbooks are a little bit of a joke, that it depends on how many logbooks you have in the truck at any one time. I am not sure that I would go the whole way with the honourable member for the Northern Territory, though, about fatigue. Anyone who has studied the issue of fatigue in transport knows it is not only the number of driving hours in the truck or the road conditions; it is also the type of rest, whether it is complete rest or else social activities and then jumping in a truck and driving. Yesterday, at one of our committee hearings-and I am not revealing committee secrets-there was a test conducted by a psychologist. One of the members of parliament who did that test was told he would have to have a fouror five-hour sleep before he would be allowed to drive to Darwin. I did not bother doing the test because I would have had to have had six or seven hours of sleep. able member for the Northern Territory, and it might be possible for our committee to go to the Northern Territory, or have someone come down here and talk to us about it. I do not think that because people drive these huge road trains that they should be exempted from the normal requirements. And it is not only those driving those road trains-and they do a very good job-but there are those people who try and pass them. Anyone who has ever tried to pass one of those road trains, or have one go past them, knows what a god-fearing exercise that is. And if the road train driver has been on the road for 18 or 20 hours, and maybe has taken certain stimulants to stay awake, then the god fearing nature of you passing him might become even more god-fearing. What always worries me is that when we start talking about any form of transport in this place we get into a competition between rail and road.

I might have a discussion with the honourWednesday, 15 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14841 everything as fine with roads, and those who advocate rail argue that far too much money has gone into roads and that rail has suffered as a consequence. We never met the challenge in the party I belong to when we were in governrrfent, and the present government has not met the challenge. We want an integrated transport program for Australia. When I was in Britain last year I brought back a green paper outlining the integrated transport network in the United Kingdom. They are doing everything from cyclists through to cars, buses, trucks and trains. I have shown that report to the member for Hinkler. Interestingly, in this debate people are talking about transport and having an argument about road and rail, but no-one has mentioned shipping. The cheapest way to move cargo around Australia over long distances is by ship. We may well have to do something with our ports. Trucks are good to take it from one area to the other. However, at certain times, as everyone knows, it is appropriate to go by rail, it is appropriate to go by road, or it is appropriate to go by ship, but we are not constantly in competition one with the other. We have got to have an integrated transport policy, which we have not had. I was a little concerned when some of the sp,_eakers were saying that weight is always on the eastern states with regulations in the transport industry. Let us face reality: that is where most of the transport is. You drive from here to Sydney, as I do, and have a look at the number of trucks that are on the road. Once you come to the junction just outside Goulburn, it is almost bumper to bumper with trucks. I was talking about how we should have an integrated transport network. We have also got to have integrated transport planning, and that would cover the roads. The minister might care to check this out, but I believe that you can go over to Yass and there is a roundabout there that is not designed for trucks. It is on the highway and it is not designed for trucks! There is another place up in Sydney where you have got to back into a warehouse and you have got to back across two lines of transport. So we have to have an integrated approach not only to all the modes of transport but also covering the roads as well. It is a great pity that the member for New England is not here-and unfortunately, I could not be here for all his contribution-but a point I want to make is that what we have to have too are a few truck friendly towns. Everyonstarts talking about how noisy trucks are and how they wake people up. At Guyra, they nave put in a decent truck stop and they promote themselves as a truck friendly town. They want the trucks to come in there-it is not in the middle of the town, it is on the outskirts of the town. They have got all the facilities there where the truckies can go and have a shower, a decent meal, things like that. I hear that Nambucca Heads, which I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, is in your electorate-keep the trucks out of Nambucca Heads, and maybe it is because of roads and things like that. Contrast that with Guyra in the electorate of the honourable member for New England, which is a truck friendly town, where they try and encourage the truckies to come in there, spend their moneythem all living in one place or another, they will have the people living there so that the journeys can start there and they can finish their journeys there. that and make Nambucca Heads a little more truck friendly.",142,Representatives Main Committee

I hope that one day I will see some government in this country take up the challenge of having an integrated transport policy covering all areas, be it shipping, be it roads, be it rail, even cycles and things like that. We can have this piecemeal legislation, and it is good, but until we have an integrated policy, quite frankly, we are not going to face up to the challenges and the realities of transporting goods around Australia. I commend the legislation. On behalf of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, I am very pleased to sum up the debate on the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000 and to thank those who have contributed to the discussions. The transport task in Australia is significant and will become even more significant as the economy grows in the years ahead. I note with interest the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Throsby, Mr Hollis, about an integrated transport plan, whether it be for Nambucca Heads or for Guyra or some other place, and his proposal obviously has some merit. It would be important, though, that such a plan not be an academic document. It would be possible to spend millions and millions of dollars preparing such a strategy, but if there were to be no commitment to actually implement such an integrated strategy and to deal with the practicalities of the many issues that are raised, then it would really just be a useless academic exercise. We have perhaps done a lot of plans in this country that gather dust and it is important that we actually have action plans that deliver positive outcomes. I thank the members who have contributed to the debate. Transport is an issue which touches us all, almost every day, and the full range of transport issues always evokes a lively debate in this House. This legislation deals with road transport and charges. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000 and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000 ensure that ACT and federally registered heavy vehicles pay the same charges as all heavy vehicles across Australia, no matter where they are registered. The passage of the ACT bill will also ensure that other jurisdictions can pick up the national uniform charges and definitions, using this bill as a model. This is an important step forward in the national road transport law reforms being put in place by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments under the intergovernmental agreements. The new national charges reflect the increased road spending since the 1992 calculations, with the revenue increase flowing to the states and territories. The majority of vehicles will see no increase in registration charges, and heavier classes will be paying a more appropriate charge from 1 July. The increases in charges represent only a small change in the costs of operating vehicles and are small compared to the anticipated reductions in operating costs flowing from the government's taxation reforms. All members would be aware that the transport industry is one of the major beneficiaries of the government's new taxation system. I thank the NRTC, the state and territory ministers for transport and the road transport industry for their contribution and support. On behalf of Minister Anderson, I commend the bills to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.
