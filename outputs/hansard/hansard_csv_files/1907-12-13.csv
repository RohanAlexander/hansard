It has missed the mail for Sydney, and will not reach him until to-morrow morning.

That correspondence has been conducted thfloughout with the greatest courtesy, and I think we have shown that we appreciate the manner in which the case has been submitted to us. I believe that our reply to the Premier of New S.outh Wales will be satisfactory to that honourable gentleman. thirty or more members indicated their desire to pay a visit of inspection to the Tooma site; and, in view of the fact that beforeParliment arrived at a decision in regard to the Federal Capital, very inadequate (provision was made for the members of both Houses to visit this particular site, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is willing to afford the necessary facilities now ? of course, practically bound by the Act already on the statute-book, in which a previous Parliament made its choice of a site.

When? we understand the feeling of members of both Houses, the Government will consider the most economical and expeditious way' of enabling any that really deserve further examination to be visited. That can only be promised, of course, in respect to members who haye not already inspected the sites, and also, in the most severely economical manner. desirable that honourable members should pay visits of inspection, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister will arrange that they be paid during the Christmas adjournment, so that we may be able to deal with the whole question as soon* as the House re-assembles will be impossible during the Christmas season; ancl except in regard to the site mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir, no application has been made.

Personally, I think it has been a rare old scramble. . I admit that I have done my fair share in the scrambling for my electorate, and for New South Wales.

It existed in 1902, and it existed again in 1907. I was very pleased to hear the deputy leader of the Opposition compliment the Treasurer as he did. The honourable gentleman deserved it. He has done remarkably well, from his own particular stand-point.

It is inevitable that in the heat of 'party strife a chance majority is taken f u l l advantage of by one side or other. But the result of that mixing up of interest and feeling is that we have to-day, as we got on the last occasion, a Tariff which is not harmonious, which is unnecessarily complex as regards rates of duties on somewhat similar articles, and which, in its interpretation, in connection with the scheme' of new prowill, so far as I can see, involve a great tection will eventually, if not at once, asdeal of trouble to the Trade and Customs sume that complexion.

Apart from that, 1 do not know that anything more need be said at this stage. I , for one, am very glad that the Tariffis about to pass out of our hands, at any rate for a time. matter of personal explanation, and it is to explain my failure to refer to the labours of the Tariff Commission in the few remarks I made. It was not due to the fact that I had overlooked its work, but to a singular misapprehension on my part. Until this moment I have been under the impression that the Bill had to go through a further stage when an opportunity would be presented to me to make further remarks. I had forgotten that the custom does not obtain in this Parliament of moving "" That this Bill do now pass."" I had it in my mind to speak perhaps in more detail than I did when I spoke just now, so far as the Tariff Commission is concerned. My feeling is that it has done an invaluable work for Australia as much in its negative as in its positive aspect in showing us clearly what our duty is to the industries of Australia in the direction of avoiding extremes, as well as in correcting anomalies and abuses. I regard the negative aspect of that investigation as being perhaps as valuable as its positive one. That, I take it, was the intention when the Commission was first appointed, and that is why its neutral characterI mean so far as fiscal decision was concernedwas established in its personnel. ThereinI think a very wise thing was done, and now that the Commission passes into the realms of history and its reports become, may I say, a fiscal classic, as I believe they will, I think that the value of its contected industries is going to be largely exstitution will become more and more apparent as time rolls ori. But I make willing mention, as I have done many times during our deliberations, of the fare skill and ability of its Chairman. Even when I have differed from him, I have always been ready to pay to him the compliment which is due to the enormous work which he did on the Commission, and the rare skill with which the inquiry was conducted. I say the same with regard to other members of the Commission. The Commonwealth will be under a lasting debt of gratitude to these gentlemen who, at so much inconvenience and cost to themselves, gave their time, their industry, and ability so freely and cheerfully to the service of their country. I think that we may all congratulate ourselves upon the conclusion of our labours on the Tariff, although with a number of the decisions arrived at by the HouseI am not in agreement. WhilstI do not deny the great work done by the Tariff Commission, which has presented to the House a mass of useful information, it appears to me that a manufacturer had only to appeal to it for an increase of duty to secure immediately a recommendation in support of his request. I have no doubt that the Chairman of the Commission, as a protectionist, felt that He was justified in making such recommendations, but as the result of many of them, the framing of the Tariff, in many cases, has been discussed and fought on the basis, not of free-trade versus protection, but of protection versus prohibition. my view. Mr W. H . IRVINE -According to that view, nearly every honourable member would feel it necessary .to make a personal explanation. orable member desires to make a personal explanation, I shall not object; but I think that I am justified in expressing my own views. I hope that before we are . called upon to deal with the requests of another place, we shall have received from the Ministry an indication-as the result of their action with regard to the Excise duties now collectable-that will satisfy us that the protection of employees in protended.

While the Tariff was in Committee I , on many occasions, was greatly assisted by the good offices of the honourable member for South Sydney in trying to bring together the two opposing sections. Reference has been made to the advisability of appointing a Grand Committee. The matter was discussed in the New South Wales Parliament some years ago on. more than one occasion. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that something should be done to relieve Committees of the Whole of questions of detail and arrangement.

Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [12.24]. I do not know whether honourable members have recently had their minds directed to the provisions of this Bill. is highly improbable, that they have. I should like to say that, although the measure deals only with giving additional powers to the Court created for carrying out the provisions of the Excise Tariff Act, it really involves the consideration of the whole question which lies at the bottom of. the policy of what is known as the new protection. sorry, at this stage of the session, to invite honourable' members on this Bill to enter into a general discussion of the principles of the new protection, but I should like the attention of the Prime Minister while I deal with what I conceive ought to be our attitude with regard to this particular measure. man has, as we all know, outlined the new protection policy, which is to be bi ought in, as I understand, at an early period after the Christmas adjournment. I hoped that the Prime Minister would have seen thewisdom of permitting the consideration of this very large extension of the powers of the Court which has been created, to stand over until the House had an opportunity to deal with the principles on which, the measure is based. The fact that the President of the Court desires to have these powers for the. purpose' of enabling, .him more efficiently to carry out his duties, while of great importance,, is of small importance compared with the duty which we shall, have to perform in dealing with the acceptance or rejection of the whole principle of the new protection:. I should have desired that before we discussed even this Bill, we should have had some more definite and explicit statement by the Prime Minister of what the new protection really means. A statement has been circulated amongst honourable members, in which the honourable gentlemaji has exhibited his powers as ""a cloud artist. If I may say so, he possesses in a greater degree than any man in this Parliament, or perhaps in any other Parliament, the power of creating an atmosphere for a new idea,, by involving it in a kind of golden haze of generalities, making it appear extremely attractive. On this subject we have had. our criticism, and I think we ought not to attempt to criticise the proposal until 1 it is put before us in some concrete form. We have been told that under the new protection the worker will be assured' I think it a higher wage, that the employer will be assured the possession of his profits as before, and that notwithstanding; that' both of these are to have their positions relatively and comparatively improved, we are to have the happy consumer (Agricultural Machinery) standing by and smiling upon the scene because he is not to be asked to pay a penny piece more for the goods which he requires. I should' say that there never was I should be very a vision of the millennium to be compared"" to this since the prophet Isaiah depicted the time when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and a little child shall lead them. WhatI want to point out is that the millennium which the Prime Min^ ister intends to usher in under the The honourable gentlename of the new protection is to. be effected not by means of, or accompanied by,, a spiritual regeneration of the race, but by the simple expedient of an Act. of Parliament and a Board of Trade. We shall await with the very greatest interest tlie steps which are to betaken which will induce this new condition; of humanity, and I am sure that if it can» be brought about, it will be welcomed by honourable members on both sides-certainl y by none more than by myself. I propose to say nothing more about the general merits of the policy, on which we must delay criticism until it is before us in some concrete shape. But there is anoilher aspect of the matter which I think should be brought forward with some degree of prominence at the present time, and that is the constitutional foundation for the whole of the new kind of industrial legislation this Parliament has' been passing. Until the High Court has definitely pronounced an opinion' one way or the other, I should be very sorry to pronounce on this question a categorical or positive opinion. B.ut I do think that the Government ought to take intovery serious consideration the very grave doubts which have been expressed, and the ground, for those grave doubts, as to whether this Parliament has any power at all' ""to deal with matters of this kind in this way. We seem to have been proceeding in the Federal Parliament since its inauguration very much upon the advice given by the (Lord Chancellor in the play of lolanthe. When some character in the play seeks his advice, in his various capacities, he gives various advice, and finally says: "" As your family solicitor, I advise you to chance it . "" sumed to anticipate a decision of the HighI think that that is the advice upon which legislation has been passed in this Parliament-that if we do not know whether we have the power to do a certain thing, we should chance it. That is not what I conceive to be an attitude likely to advance either the power or dignity of this Parliament. I feel convinced that the attitude adopted towards legislation of trying one thing after another on the ground that we might chance it, entering upon what probably are' very considerable trespasses upon the domain of the powers of the States without previously having any definite rule eiven lis by the Court should remember that only in one section know, with regard to the constitutionality of one Act has it been held that we have of the whole of this intricate method of regone beyond our powers, and that that was gulating industrial matters by means of passed in defiance of the law advisers of the imposition of duties of Excise with a the day. Mr W. H . IRVINE I quite admit by the people affected with certain rules. that the leader of the Government deserves As I understand the argument used in every credit in connection with that parfavour of this class of legislation, it is ticular piece of legislation, since not only that, as we have the power to impose djd he warn the House that it was not duties of Excise, we consequently have within the power of this Parliament, but power to impose them subject to any conhe declined to carry on the Government beditions, and may make their imposition cause the provision was carried against him. subject to the condition that, if men pav a There is no doubt that he took every step certain rate of wages to their employees, to prevent this Parliament on that occasion the Excise will not apply, or will be regoing beyond its legitimate powers the only case of the kind. Mr W. H.

Mr W. H . IRVINE The Customs Act was not one of the measures on which there was a decision. question of our constitutional powers was raised by that Act. Mr W. H . IRVINE I should be very sorry to say anything which might be asCourt on any of the measures which we have already passed. Several of them are coming up for review, and no doubt in due time, and I hope before very long, the High Court will be enabled to give us, not only a decision in these cases, but one which will lay down some guiding principles by which we can ride our conduct in the future. On this measure, however, I think it is not only my right, but my duty, to bring forward reasons for doubting whether we should proceed further with this legislation until the High. Court has given us a decision on the point involved. I should like very shortly to state the grounds for the very grave doubts which have arisen in remittance of the Excise upon compliance mitted, to them. I would point out first that there is no special or expressed power cise at all. Our power to impose duties do not think of Excise, as well as of Customs, arises 51.

137,Mr Speaker,"If the honourable memCases, where very much the same class of indirect effect was urged, thatThe true nature and character of the legisla. tion in particular under discussion must always be determined, in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs. A very good example of this principle is given in the case of The Attorney-General for Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Company, 3 Appeal Cases. That is a very apt illustration, because there was in that case an Act of the Provincial Legislature of Quebec, imposing a tax on certain policies of insurance. It was contended that that was not authorized by the Canadian Constitution. The Legislature of the Province was authorized by the Constitution to make laws in relation to shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licences. It purported to make a law, within the particular terms of that authority', relating to licences, but it was urged that, although that was the particular form in which the law was brought forward, and although it appeared on its face to be within the terms under which the legislative power had been granted, yet in reality and . effect that was not the real scope or aim of the Act, which, consequently, was ultra vires. Tht' Master of the Rolls, Mr Justice Jessel, than whom there could be no higher authority, saidThe Statute in question purports to be on the of the States than they have to infringe face of it in exercise of that powerJust as the legislation now before us (purports, on the face of it, to be in exercise of the taxing power-the power of imposing duties of Excise-in our ConstitutionI t enacts that every assurer, except people carrying on marine insurance, shall be bound to take out a licence, before the ist day of May in better collection of Provincial taxes from each year, with the revenue officer of the district, and lo remain continually under license. He says finally that, although the Aet purported to be a Licence Act, when the real purpose and effect of it were examined, it was found to be, not a Licence Act at all, but a Stamp Act, and that, therefore, although in form the Legislature purported to be exercising one of its powers, it w<as not really exercising that power in that particular Act, which therefore was void. The Court held that the Legislature had exceeded its powers, although it purported to be exercising them, just as we are here purporting to exercise our taxing power, whilst we are really using this machinery for the enforcement of certain social obligations. My whole argument, according to those decisions, is that you have to look, not af the face or form of the legislation, but at the real object fo be attained as appears from the Act itself. The case of Regina v. Wason, 4 Cartwright, p. 478, is another case in point. In the Court below, Chief Justice Armour, of the Canadian Court, referred to the primary object of the Actas being a guiding principle in ascertaining whether the Act fell within the power given by the Constitution or not. Although his judgment was reversed on appeal, the Judges of Appeal did not reverse his decision on that ground, but maintained the same principle as he had advocated. A striking illustration of the application of the principle is given in the case of Toi Sing v. McGidre, which comes very near the present case. The Parliament had made an Act to provide for the better collection of Provincial taxes from Chinese. That was undoubtedly a matter which lay within the powers of the Provincial Parliament. It was expressly provided by the Constitution that they should have power to do what they purported to do in that' ( case. Colonel FOXTON -That was a Provincial Parliament Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. But, as the honourable member knows, we have no more right eiiher by implication or by direct trespass to infringe upon the rights upon ours. We have no paramount authority to break the Constitution, any more than they have, so that any argument that will hold one way holds equally well the other. The Act in question, in that case, was entitled an Act to provide for the Chinese. In its preamble it professed to prevent the evasion of payment by Chinese of taxes-whic h was also a matter entirely within the power of the Provincial Parliament-and to enact its provisions as a more simple method for the collection of those taxes. The enforcement of Provincial taxation was clearly a matter within the Legislative capacity of the Province. The Court held that, if the form of the Act were the substance of the Act, if its real aim was as shown in the title and preamble, and if the Court had been bound to look only at its form, and not into its real nature, the passing of the measure would have been clearlv within the power of the Provincial Parliament but' The Court held, on examination of the enacting clauses, that its real'object was not tp collect revenue, but to drive the Chinese from the country, purely within the jurisdiction of the the responsibility, but merely pointing out national Parliament. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Precisely thus interfering at once with the in my opinion, it would be well on the part iiuthority reserved to the Dominion Parliament of the Government not to press this measure m io tlie regulation of trade and commerce, the rights of Chinese, and the treaties of the Emnow. It would be wiser on their part to take pire. The Act was held to be ultra vires.

As I understand it , this is a B ill which is intended to clothe the President of the Arbitration Court with the powers requisite to enable him to f u l l y discharge the very onerous duties which have been intrusted to him, and as such I shall leave the whole responsibility of it with the Government. The measure contains some very drastic provisions-provision s which are of a very far-reaching character, and some of which raise an entirely new position so far as our legal procedure is concerned. the primary object of the measure is to enable the President of the Arbitration Court to obtain f u l l information concerning th© cases upon which he is asked to adjudicate, and to protect absolutely the individuals who furnish that information. I understand that the President of the Court has himself impressed upon the Ministry the necessity for clothing him with the f u l l and ample powers which it is proposed to confer upon him under this B ill . I cannot help making a passing reference to the interesting memorandum which has been submitted to us by the Prime Minister on the subject of the new protection. I confess that I was very disappointed with that memorandum in one respect. nothing millennial about it. that is millennial about it, but very little that is practical.

Sydney) [2.30] -Lik e the honourable member for Parramatta, I recognise that at this stage, the Bill before us can neither receive the attention which it deserves, nor can we anticipate being able to do anything with it, by way of amendment, to reduce-as I should like to reduce-the severity of its provisions. I am afraid that we are embarked on a course of which this, and the other measures of a similar character that we have passed, ?are the preliminaries, and which is altogether different from the standard British people, in consequence of the experience of the past, have set up. We -are giving such unrestricted powers that, if they were used to their f u l l extent ancl were not controlled by very high princioles on the part of those exercising them, they would bring us back to the old Star Chamber system of British jurisprudence. It was the very excesses resulting from unrestricted powers being given to British Judges, that led the British people to adopt the principle-and a very sound principle I think it is-that every Briton should be deemed to be innocent until proved to be guilty. Mr W. H .

Until we have them it would be impossible to discuss that matter with any intelligence. I should have liked, as I have said, to move some amendments upon this B ill , because I think it would be unfortunate if we confirmed such legislation without proper safeguards to the Rarties concerned, whoever those parties may be. If we continue this class of legislation we shall reach a stage when some uniformed officer will be able to go up to a man in the street and say, ""You are guilty of an offence;"" and on the man's declaring, "" I am not guilty,"" the responsibility of proving his innocence will be thrown upon him. It is exceedingly difficult, in some circumstances, for a man to prove that he is not guiltv. though there -may be circumstances when it may be easy to prove innocence. It would be a most unfortunate, thing, which might be worthy of an autocracy, but certainly not of a democracy, to extend that class of legislation. We ought to examine and consider very carefully all proposals which contain such drastic conditions. However, I quite recognise that the majority of honourable members are in favour of this B ill. I rethat English Judges ancl cognise that, if any amendment were made in it , the Bill would be hung up, inasmuch as the Senate is not sitting. Consequently, knowing that no amendment would be accepted, and that there is a majority in favour of the B ill passing into law, I shall, with these protests, simply allow the Government to pass the measure, throwing the responsibility 011 them, as the honourable member for Parramatta has done.

185,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [2.45].,"found that the Act is not quite operative without some machinery provisions which, I think, have been suggested by the President of the Arbitration Court. It is not true that the Bill creates any penal offence, as .a matter of substance, against employers and manufacturers. I do not think that any one can successfully contend that the Federal Parliament or Government has a direct mandatory power to determine rates of. wages or hours of labour. I can find no direct power of that kind within the four corners bf the Constitution : I can find no direct coercive is not paid they will be sent to gaol. Under power over employers and manufacturers. That has led to the current contention that this legislation is ultra vires, and therefore unconstitutional. singular that that view was not presented when the legislation was submitted to the Parliament, and passed, I believe almost unanimously. There was a general concurrence of view that if it did grant an . increased advantage of a substantial character to employers and manufacturers, that grant ought to be .coupled with conditions. The difficulty' was how to impose these conditions successfully in the absence of direct coercive power. The Tariff Commission considered' that matter, and we could find no means or method of exercising a power over employers and manufacturers, except by holding over their heads a threat that unless they granted good wages and working conditions the two Houses would be asked to withdraw the increased protection. It was thought that that was a roundabout, ineffective method of operating upon employers and manufacturers, and the ingenious idea occurred to the honourable member for Wide Bay that it might be so embodied or found in the taxing power; in other words, that as Parliament had the power over Excise it might impose an Excise duty upon certain manufacturers, coupled with the condition that those who granted fair and reasonable wages to their workers should be exempt therefrom. There can be no doubt that it has a perfect right to exempt goods or persons from Excise duty. I do not wish to pronounce any final opinion on the constitutional question, because that is quite unnecessary as well as unsafe, but, as at present advised, I see no reason why Parliament should not -grant an exemption from Excise duty, coupled with the condition that the grantees shall do certain things. . Sir John Quick. persons. a class of persons, I see no reason why we should not exempt a class of goods such as a class of goods produced under fair and reasonable working conditions. That is not creating an offence. It is not imposing a statutory duty on those people. It is not telling them, as employers are told in the Victorian factories that if they do not do a certain thing they will be liable to a penalty, and that if that our Factories Act employers are liable to be fined or sent to goal if they do not grant good wages. Under the Federal Act, It seems however, the employers are not so liable. No punishment is attached to the withholding of good wages, but an advantage is held out to them who pay good wages in the shape of an exemption from Excise dnty. Suppose it were found that we could not grant an exemption, it would be very easy then to exercise the bounty granting power. Parliaiment could easily grant a bounty for certain goods, or to the manufacturers of certain goods which are produced under fair and reasonable working conditions, ancl withhold the bounty in other cases. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is not at all certain. already done that in connection with the sugar bounty. That is not creating an offence on che part of those sugar-growers who abstain from granting good wages. It is optional. They have, so to speak, an inducement held out to them in the shape of a bounty. In the same way, under the Harvester Excise Act, those employers who grant good wages have an inducement held out to them in the shape of an exemption from Excise duty. It will be seen that there is something to be said on both sides of the question. I am not going to pronounce a final opinion, but it is fairly arguable that Parliament, having imposed an Excise duty coupled with an exemption, must do all it can to effectuate that legislation in the shape of the' procedure provisions which have been suggested by the Court. It has been stated that if persons are charged with an offence under this Act, they will be called upon to prove themselves innocent.

193,Mr Dugald Thomson,"What wouldintend to say more than a few words, because I recognise that it is desirable that, before the train hour arrives, honourable members should have a chance of dealing with the Bill in Committee. After having carefully looked through its provisions, and compared them with the provisions of the Arbitration Act, I can see no substantial difference between them. There is just a difference in one or two sections, to which I will draw attention; but there is no substantial difference between the provisions of the two measures. The time, then, seems to have gone by for an attack pn this class of legislation, on the ground of its being too drastic, because what this Bill proposes to do is to give the President of the Arbitration Court, in one capacity, and for a similar purpose, powers which he, under the Act of 1904, had exercised in' another capacity. sion "" for a similar purpose"" because, whether he sits as President of the Arbitration Court, under the Act of 1904, or as the person designated in the Act of 1906, his inquiries are still into the question of the fairness of the remuneration of labour. That settles the other 'important question of whether the. powers ought to be granted. The President of the Court says that he cannot get on properly with his inquiries without additional powers. I wish to draw attention to just one alteration. It is only the alteration of a word, but that does sometimes make a difference in substance. It occurs in clause 5, in which the question of the representation of parties by counsel or solicitor is dealt with. In the Act of 1904, it is provided that the parties may be represented by counsel or solicitor, either by an agreement between themselves or by the permission of the President. are cumulative. It is necessary to get, not only an agreement between the parties, but also the consent of the President of the Court. I do not think that it makes much difference, but I wish to draw attention to the fact. The provisions of this Bill are practically identical with the provisions of the Act of 1904. As regards the Excise duty, this is not.the time to discuss either its policy or its constitutionality. I have always followed the wholesome rule that if it is. advisable to do a certain thing, ther it is probable or not is a matter that although the power may be doubtful, we ought not to stultify ourselves by refusing to do what is right, simply because the constitutionality of our legislation may be challenged. That rule wasapplied when the case under the Act of. 1906 was brought on; because although a few words were then uttered as to the inefficacy of its provisions, there was no elaborate argument on the question, and perhaps had one occurred it would have been futile, except as an aid to the lawyers outside in finding their authority. As the matter has been mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders, with his usual ability and clearness, I propose to give one or two references to authorities that may perhaps tend to strengthen the light that he hasthrown upon the question. It seems to me that the reason the Act of 1906 has not been tested up to the present is, first of all, that there was, I understand, an attempt, by means of an arrangement between the Government and I use the expresthe manufacturers, to obviate the necessity, if it existed, of going to the High Court for an opinion upon the question. Another reason is that some manufacturers have also thought that even if they succeeded in showing that the Act was bad they would still have to pay the Excise-that , in other words, they would get rid of the condition regarding wages, but not of the obligation to pay Excise. Al l I can say is that that is possible. It may be probable, but whether it is or not depends upon the effect of what the High Court says as to the Act being opposed to section 55 of the Constitution. That section provides that laws relating to taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and it may or may not be that this Bill deals with some other matter of policy. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It might also follow from the decision of the Court that the real' scope of the Act was beyond the In this Bill, the two things Legislature, and the Excise as well as the conditions would therefore go. troubling the manufacturers is that they might obtain a decision that the Act was bad as an attempt to usurp the powers of the State in dictating rates of wages, but. that it was not bad as an exercise of the power to impose Excise. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is possible. we need not now discuss. This is not the time to consider the question of our power generally to lay down conditions in imposing Excise duties, but I should like to give one or two references to authorities. It",40,Groom

Some of tbe Judges in that case -said, however, that they had never known in the history ©f Tariff legislation in America a case in which the rate of duty was made to depend upon the person or -corporation called upon to pay it. That goes to the root of the question now before us. The point was not decided, but it -certainly touches the question under consideration. I shall come a little nearer to the problem now before us by a reference to some decisions given in the Federal Power over Carriers and Corf orations, by Prentice, one pf the chief writers on the commerce laws under the American Constitution. He says, at page 54The. Supreme Court has often held, in passing -upon the validity of State lavs, that the Courts will look into the operation and effect of a statute to discern its purpose, and that if laws purporting to be enacted in the exercise of ipowers belonging to the State have no. real or substantial relation to the objects of those powers, it is the duty of the Court so to adjudge and thereby give effect to the Constitution. Upon that point he refers to several cases; I might add another: that of McCulloch v. Maryland, the celebrated case referred to in connection with the income tax decisions in which Chief Justice Marshall in similar words states an identical conclusion. To quote from another authority, this writer says that if Congressmay use a power granted for one purpose .for the accomplishment of another and very different purpose, it is easy to show that a Constitution on parchment is worth nothing. Mr W. H . IRVINE -If we exercised such a power we could usurp every legislative function of the States by imposing some form of taxation-sa y a poll tax -couple d with an exemption providing the person to whom it was applied would comply with certain conditions. additional authority laid down in the Federalist as to what was intended by the framers of the American Constitution. Hamilton saysThe propriety of a law in a constitutional light must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppose by some forced construction of its authority That touches the point (which, indeed, cannot easily be imagined), the -Federal Legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State, would it not be evident that, in making such an attempt, it had exceeded its jurisdiction, and infringed upon that of the State? Suppose again that upon the pretence of an interference with its revenues, it should undertake to abrogate a land tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which the Constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State Governments ? In dealing with this matter in the House, one does not wish to be an advocate of one side or the other; one's desire is rather to throw out suggestions; but it is interesting to glance for a moment at other authorities. One of them, Tiedeman, on State and Federal Control of Persons and Proferty, has a very elaborate dissertation upon the .unconstitutionality of protection in America. He practically says that it is not open to question that protection is against .the Constitution. If that be so,' all. I can. say is that we ought not to rely too much upon authority, because -the first Federal Tariff has existed since 1789, and the policy is still pretty active and alive in America. There are other authorities that I might cite, such as the American distillery cases, in which it is laid down that a distinction cannot be made between the tax which shall be imposed on one distillery, and that which shall be imposed on another. That approaches fairly closely to the 'Excise (Spirits) Act of 1906. The sooner this question is raised by some outside person the better. Mr W. H . IRVINE -We have the dual power of taxation of commerce, as far as protection is concerned. has the American Congress. One could elaborate the question as regards protection in America. As a matter of fact, one of the grounds of secession was that the southern States ineffectually challenged the right of the northern States to impose protective duties. When the Federal Constitution was framed, they negatived the whole protectionist policy, declaring it to be opposed to the principles of the Constitution.

Question resolved in the affirmative. External Affairs) [4.5] I wish to submit a motion without notice. to a novel proposal which has been in my mind during the past week or two though I have only received two days ago a letter from Professor David, of Sydney, a well known scientific man, who is about to accompany the expedition under Lieutenant Shackleton to the South Pole. The cost of that expedition, to the extent of ^24,900, has been subscribed by Lieutenant ShackleIon ancl his private friends. Bui? owing to losses sustained by others who had tentatively promised to contribute, the. expedition is short by ^5,000 of the amount necessary to enable it to obtain a f u l l supply of stores and . equipment for its stay in the antarctic regions, probably, for three years. Professor David, who is accompanying the expedition, without remuneration-as a number of other scientific men are doing has written to point out, that although the scientific information to be obtained is of universal value, yet it has a special value to Australia, because of thegreater knowledge of meteorology which it promises, and because, if there are any economic possibilities in these antarctic lands, Australia will probably be the country which will most directly benefit. Under these As a matter of fact. I circumstances, since the expedition has awakened world-wide mterest, and will be I am one of the best equipped ever despatched, on a mission of danger of this kind, I venture to ask honourable members to give the Government authority to advance a sum not exceeding -£5,000 for the purpose of completely equipping it. Lieutenant Shackleton has already left for New Zealand. Professor David and others leave in a week. The sum of .£5,000, although considerable to us, is, after all,, not a large g if t from the revenue of Australia: No similar demand is likely to be made for many years. The men who are risking their lives in the expedition have already promised to give a considerable share of the scientific specimens-the flora and fauna-whic h they may gather, to the museums of Australia. Under the circumstances, I have submitted this proposal to as many honourable members as were within my reach. I consider that by adopting it we shall be taking a course which will be worthy of Australia, will do us .credit abroad, and advance the cause of science -whic h is the cause of humanity-withou t making any undue demand upon us. I therefore desire to move That this House authorizes tlie Government to It relates advance a sum not exceeding ,£5,000 for the purpose of supplying the necessary equipment to the antarctic expedition about to proceed to the South Pole. the House that the Prime Minister have leave to move the motion without notice? pression of opinion from the House upon the proposal.

[4.8] I am glad that a way has been found to permit of the House expressing its opinion upon the proposal outlined by the Prime Minister. I only wish to say one word in regard to it , and that is a 1 word of cordial approval of his suggestion. I hope that he will carry it out, and that he will not stint the expedition so far as a few pounds are concerned, in the prosecution of this very necessary work. I think that an opportunity now presents itself which should be seized by the Government -a n opportunity which may not recur for many years. We owe a duty to ourselves and to posterity to explore the antarctic regions. From a scientific, and indeed -from every point of view, it is our obligation to do vvhat we can to make known all that lies hidden in that mysterious land. Believing that the expedition is to be thoroughly equipped intellectually, scientifically, and in every other way, I support the motion most cordially. that the expedition may prove an abundant and abiding success. is not a proposal fo assist an expedition which is bent upon money making. It is a scientific, exploratory, and dangerous enterprise, and we ought to feel pleased that men who are specially trained are prepared to devote alike their time and their intellect to the investigation of this comparatively unknown portion of our planet. An appeal has been made by a scientific Australian for assistance to enable Lieutenant Shackleton's expedition to carry out its work thoroughly, when once it has reached the antarctic regions. It is not an appeal to begin a thing, but. one to enable a project which is well under way to be carried out. We are asked to provide less' than 20 per cent, of the amount necessary to thoroughly eauip the expedition. I think that it is the duty of this Parliament to provide the requisite funds, especially as it has been appealed to by Professor David. We could not refuse such an appeal unless we were perfectly callous about such matters. Ours is the only nation in the Southern, Hemisphere to which an appeal can be made for support by such an expedition. ment to provide the £5,000 now asked for. although it is for something that is not in my electorate ! not in a position to speak on behalf of any party collectively, but I think I may say for those honourable members who sit ir* this corner that they will heartily support the Prime Minister in the suggestion he has made, and do everything they can to. assist in the voting of the money asked for. I need only add that, in my opinion, the proposal is a wise one, and that we alt wish God-speed to the expedition. must say that I have absolutely no sympathy with the method adopted by the Government in springing this question upon the House at this particular time. I. have no doubt that if Parliament had been consulted at a proper time, the money would have been granted. But before we are asked to participate in the equipment of such an expedition as is contemplated, I sincerely hope proper notice should be given. The fact that the expedition was to start has been before the country, and before the world, for a considerable time. But not one word has been said in this Parliament as to the vote of a grant. When, however, we arriveat the stage of being within a few hoursof an adjournment for some months,' r proposition is suddenly submitted for thegrant of £5,000, without any opportunity being afforded for its consideration. We had an experience this morning of an entirely different description, when a suggestion was made to pay gratuities to the widows and children of some of the employees who have died in the service of the Commonwealth.

Joseph Clarke, inland mail clerk at the General Post Office in Sydney. He had been in the service for about forty-four years, and was on the eve of retiring on a pension. He would have been away on leave had he not been kept back specially by the Department to deal with the year's mail tenders. ing night and day over the mail tenders, and he practically dropped, dead at his work. he did not die from natural causes. he did die from natural causes. work. that the natural causes in that case were sheer over-work. A t any rate it is a very hard case. He was just going out on twelve months' leave. I understand that the compensation which the Government propose to make to the widow simply covers the twelve months' leave and three months' accumulated leave which was clue to him, and which he would have taken in the ordinary course of events. That is the only case in the list that I know of ; ancl if the others are on the same footing the Committee will only do a simple act of rudimentary justice in voting these small I know that a grant was amounts to the widows of the unfortunate men.

294,Mr Austin Chapman,"I believecontributed to his death, although it was not legally responsible. We gave his widow some little assistance by appointing her to the charge of a semi-official post office. She was left with several little children, and I thought I should' be justified in recommending that a grant be made to her to enable her to educate them. Owing to the employment of temporary hands who did not thoroughly understand their work, the Department, to my mind, contributed, to a certain extent, to Wilson's death. in this Bill? sum of £200 is provided. The cases of Clarke, Wilson, and others, have been very carefully considered, and the payments proposed to be made are based upon a general principle. Many cases of hardship have been brought forward, and it seems to me that, in voting these amounts, we shall lay down the rule that we are entitled to consider deserving cases. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall make certain provision which will render it unnecessary for the widows and children of Commonwealth officers who have died at their posts to come cap in hand to us. scheme. so. These are not the only cases that have been brought under our notice; we have had to weed them out, remembering that regard must be had to the state of our finances. I would ask Parliament to deal generously with the widows and relatives of officers of the service who have either died or have been killed whilst at their posts. the first Parliament, I raised the point that we should lay down some definite principle as to the granting of compensation to the surviving relatives of employees of the Commonwealth who died at their posts. a Workmen's Compensation Act. some of the States the surviving relatives -of public servants who die at their posts are entitled to compensation under Workmen's Compensation Acts, we have practically no power, except with the consent of the States Treasurers to grant compensation in such cases It seems to me, however, that this is a haphazard scheme. tice. been able to select only a few cases, leaving a large number untouched. The only point in favour of this Bill is that it seems to be a recognition of the fact that we ought to pay some compensation to the relatives of those who are killed whilst on duty. I could cite the case of a postmaster who, although in the service for 35 years,, never had a holiday, and who within a month of his retirement on a pension died. No provision is made in this Bill for the payment of compensation to his relatives. It is only natural that difficulties should arise in attempting to deal with questions of this kind in a hurried and haphazard fashion. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to grant the surviving relatives of officers who die whilst in service compensation equal to at least twelve months' salary. salary in most cases. They get what they deserve. who had 35 years' service would be entitled to compensation equal to 35 months' pav. torian system. I think that the Victorian Government grant compensation equal to one month's salary for every year of service. case of the man Martin who died from plague in Brisbane. Colonel FOXTON -Plagu e contracted whilst on the premises of the Department. that of a man who contracted pneumonia owing to the faulty way in which repairs to the postal buildings which he was obliged to occupy were being carried out. Colonel FOXTON -In the other case the contagion was in the office. whether the cause of death is plague contracted owing to the insanitary condition of departmental premises or pneumonia due to the clumsy way in which repairs were being made to the Commonwealth building occupied by the officer; in either case the right to compensation would be the same. I hold that we ought not to tinker with a matter of this kind. The only way in which we can deal out even-handed justice is to lay down some general principle and stand by. it.

309,Mr Fisher,"It matters very littlefriends, who will take care that the Government are well informed of their situation, are likely to secure compensation whilst those whose cases are equally deserving, but who rely solely upon their .rights, absolutely fail. I am not going to oppose the Bill, but I urge this Government, as I have urged other Administrations-, to lay down a general principle on which compensation in cases of this kind shall be granted. I do not wish to say anything against some of the cases for which provision is made, because, so far as one is able to ascertain the facts, it appears to be quite justifiable to grant the proposed compensation. of all the case of Mr Wilson to which reference has been made. Undoubtedly something is due to the widow of a man who was killed on duty. Owing to some extraordinary circumstances Wilson was practically electrocuted whilst working on a telegraph pole, and his widow is certainly entitled to consideration. trouble in regard to a number of these cases is that no particulars have been furnished to the House. I have gathered that some _of them relate to officers who have died from natural causes whilst in the service. ticulars. give compensation to the widows of officers who while in the service died from natural causes a very wide field will be opened up, and it seems to me that no case of that sort should be dealt with in what are practically the dying hours of the session. have been made on the Estimates for all of them. surer saw' that some time must necessarily elapse before we should be able to deal with the Estimates and thought! it was necessary to take immediate action. But the honourable member should not ask the House on the eve qf a long adjournment-whe n every honourable member is anxious to get away, arid there is no possibility of a detailed discussion-to grant compensation to the relatives, not of officers who have been killed whilst on service, but of those who have died from natural causes whilst in the employ of the Commonwealth. arise in connection with the death of public servants from overwork, tion which it would be very hard to prove. If it is once admitted that such cakes deserve compensation, and claims are afterwards made on behalf of the relatives of others of whom it is alleged that they died through overwork, they will be equally hard to resist. I do not think that cases other than those which have been clearly shown to be accidents, or tlie results of accidents, 'should be dealt with as emergency cases. we can draw any hard-and-fast line like that. problematic whether we are justified in making any grant at all.

If it can be shown later that the easels are special, we should be justified in making* similar grants. Wilson's case is undoubtedly a special one.

When he died he had worked 235 hours overtime, for which he had not received payment. overtime because of the shekels attaching to it. this case. Mr Clarke's doctor warned him time after time that he should not continue at his work, and gave him certificates to the effect that it injured him to do so. But Mr Clarke was induced, in the interests of the Department, to remain at his task until the thread snapped. He practically died at his post. After he had appealed to his superior officer for relief from the duty which was killing him, he fell unconscious on the floor of' the office, was carried to the hospital, and died the following day. The doctor attending him stated that it was nothing else than a case of murder. No fine distinction can be drawn between death the result of an accident and a case like that of Mr Clarke. However, I am glad that the Treasurer proposes to do some amount of justice to the relatives of worthy men who did their best for the service in which they were employed, and I ask him to say whether the money will be paid before Parliament re-assembles? will be paid almost immediately. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.47] I am in complete sympathy with the proposal of the Government, but I should Ji'ke some information regarding the basis on which the various amounts were assessed, and the relation which they bear to each other. Department w'e had to assess each case on its merits very largely. Colonel FOXTON I understand that no rule has been laid down to the effect that the compensation must bear a direct relation to the amount, qf salary. thought that Mrs. Clarke ought to receive £5°°Colonel FOXTON -Having had"" some experience in niatters of this sort, I recogat the end of each session with the necesnise the difficulty of laying down a hardand-fast rule; but I ask, to what extent The amount it is any rule has been followed, because I notice that of two of the beneficiaries, both widows of Commandants, one is to receive something over £ 4 0 0 , and the other something over £100 ? reported on by a B'oard. It having been proved that his death was consequent upon his South African service, the Board assessed the amount which should be paid to his widow. Colonel Ricardo died suddenly, leaving his wife impoverished, and as he was at the time entitledto two months' leave, it was decided that, instead of allowing the Department to profit thereby, Parliament should be asked to grant the money to his widow. Colonel FOXTON -Then the two amounts were calculated on different bases. Colonel FOXTON The case of Colonel Bayly affords the basis for one means of assessment of compensation. He lost his life practically in the service of his country, as the result of disease contracted in that service. The adoption of this measure will undoubtedly, as the honourable member for South Sydney has pointed out, lead to a crop of similar applications for compensation, so long as Parliament shirks the duty, which I think is thrust upon it, of making provision of some sort for those who retire from the service of the Commonwealth, and for the widows and children of those who die in that service. If it is voted it Colonel FOXTON -It ought to be done. I think that such a measure might well have been given precedence of a great deal of Commonwealth legislation that I could name. the kind was brought before the first Parliament and rejected. Colonel FOXTON -This Parliament will certainly learn, as other Parliaments have done, that it is absolutely necessary to make some provision of the sort if we are not in every session to have to deal with a crop of applications from the widows of those who have died in the service of the Commonwealth.

351,Sir William Lyne (Hume,"TreaButI wish now to make a short statement in reference to this matter, and to announce mv intentions in respect to it. Unless exception is taken to the course which I propose I shall follow it. The Postal Department has made very large demands upon me because of the unexpected expansion of business-a n expansion which was unforeseen and was not provided for in the Works and Buildings Estimates. This Department alone has asked for more than -£100,000. The Postmaster-General has made urgent appeals to me for additional funds for the following purposes:-Ordi nary telephone extensions in New South Wales, £34,000; construction of special trunk telephone lines from Sydney to Wollongong, Sydney to Katoomba, and Sydney to Gosford, £ 6 , 5 9 8; construction of the Sydney-Tenterfield copper telegraph wire, to meetthe wire being erected in Queensland to provide for the Inter-State and international business, £11,960; or a total of £52,558. The Department states that unless this expenditure is incurred it will be impossible to complete essential works in New South Wales. An appeal has also been made for £33,240 to be expended in Victoria in providing cables for underground telephone extensions, conduits for same, new junction lines, copper wire, &c. The telephone extensions required in Queensland are estimated to cost £ s , 5 ^ The Department has also asked for £11,094 for cables for undergrounding the telephone system in South Australia, to make ready for the introduction of the electric tramway system. It represents that this work is extremely urgent, and that unless it is carried out before the electric tramway system in Adelaide is introduced there will be a serious interference with the telephone system. The Department of Home Affairs asks for an amount of £7,679, including £5,000 for an additional story required in connection with the extension of the General Post Office, Melbourne. I would point out that tenders were accepted for the erection of two stories of this post office, and that they are approaching completion. It is necessary that a roof shall be put on the building. to ask for sufficient money to erect the extra story, so that the roof mav be put on, and any claim for double payment obviated. There is no doubt that many of the works asked for are of a very urgent nature,, and it is desirable that they should be undertaken during fhe present financial year. Parliament has placed at my disposal the amount of £200,000 under the Treasurer's advance, of which the expenditure of £85,000 has been already authorized. About £36,000 ot this amount will be removed when the Appropriation Bill has been passed, leaving £49,000 to be included in the Supplementary Estimates, 1907-8. There remains a balance, of £n.vOoo, a part of which could be used for the most urgent works required. I should have preferred to introduce additional Estimates fornew works and buildings before the Christmas vacation, in order that parliamentary authority for the expenditure might have been granted, but as it was imperatively necessary that the Committee of Ways ancl Means should not be interrupted while the Tariff was under discussion, I shall not have an opportunity of introducing these estimates until later in the session.. I make this statement now in order that Parliament may understand the situation, and so that honourable members may not be surprised if additional estimates for new works and buildings to the amount of about £120,000 are introduced. In the meantime, unless very strong objection is taken, I shall anticipate the approval of Parliament by authorizing such works as appear to me to be of the most urgent character. I -wish further to say that I have 2 not sufficient funds to pay everything within the next three months. But I cam select the most urgent works, and ascertain what expenditure will be required upon them until Parliament re-assembles. I shall thus be in a position to enable them to proceed without crippling the Treasurer's advance, and without disturbing the ordinary routine of the Treasury. If no objection be urged to the course which I have outlined. I intend to pursue it in order to prevent the stoppage of works which are now in progress. week to consider the works which have been outlined. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I take it for granted that I am to do the best that I can in this connection. I am very anxious to I intend be able to come to this House ancl sa.y.

CATTS -What does the Treasurer propose in regard to granting extra assistance in the postal service ? whatever temporary assistance may be required ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I cannot reply to that question, 'because I do not know how far I should commit myself. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Treasurer knew the amount the other day. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I have my own opinion about the alleged sweating and the overtime. When a demand for the appointment of i,ooo new hands was made to me before I delivered my Budget Speech, I hesitated before I would sanction the making of so many appointments. In my Budget SpeechI said that I would find money for new appointments up to the extent of £400 for permanent and such temporary hands as were absolutely necessary before the matter was dealt with by Parliament, but I would certainly not find the money for all that I was asked to do. I conclude by movingThat the paper be printed. have listened with care and interest to the statement made by the Treasurer, who, in my opinion, has not absolved himself in any degree from his responsibilities as Treasurer by the statement which he has made. I should like it to be clearly understood that, in my opinion, what he is principally responsible for is the carrying out of the undertakings given in his Budget Speech and the careful administration of the finances of the Commonwealth. Extraordinary statements, such as we have heard this afternoon, must not be taken as absolvliament has been very generous towards ing the Minister from the obligation of carrying out the policy laid down when he was expounding his Budget a few months ago. think the honourable member will admit that I have been bantered considerably over these matters. I have to ward off attacks. the Treasurer of the Commonwealth is to protect the public revenue. I have been more than surprised lately to find Cabinet Ministers bantering each other on matters of expenditure. The sooner that 'kind of thing is brought to an end the better will it be for the cause of good government. the honourable member is referring to. Cabinet Minister say that he would do soand-so if another Minister would give him the money to do it with. Such a condition of affairs does not bespeak good government. That is all that I have to say on that point. The Treasurer is bound to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth from a financial point of view. No Treasurer has ever held office who has not had demands made upon him for at least twice the amount of expenditure that he was prepared to authorize. A Treasurer is not to be sympathized with simply because more requests are made to him than he can comply with. But it is only just that, having said so much, I should add that a Department like that of the Postmaster General is an extremely far-reaching Department, and, in many respects, a paying one. Expenditure in connection with it is not like expenditure on Defence, as to which the money might often as well be thrown into the river. Indeed, it might better be thrown into the river, because then there would be a chance of fishing it out again. ,. But when we spend money on Defence, we have no guarantee that the experts will not tell us that the money we spent last year would have been better unspent. Much of the money spent in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department is really revenue-producing, and that fact should be kept in mind by the Treasurer. He, of course, must take the (responsibility of granting these advances where he thinks that the services that will be rendered,, or the income that will follow as a result, will afford a sufficient justification for them to Parliament. I consider that this Parevery Treasurer who has taken the responsibility of expending money for the expansion of the services of the Commonwealth. By that I mean, not adding to these actual services by authorizing the appointment of new officers, but providing for public works of a remunerative character Parliament has always looked very leniently on the actions of a Treasurer who has taken the responsibility of expenditure in such directions. My sympathies will be with the Treasurer if he can see his way to assist in easing off the pressure upon the Post and Telegraph Department.

WhatI complain about is that, although the Treasurer can find a way to provide huge sums for those purposes, yet he is It was not represented to blocking reforms which are said by the postal officials to be necessary to put their Department into proper working order, so that the public may obtain value for their money, and public omcers receive decent remuneration for their services, instead of being sweated.

This Parliament has already unduly showered favours on the larger centres of population. For over-sea mail service, which is incurred, chiie'flv 'in the interests of the commercial classes, is twice as much as the return, and yet if I apply for the establishment of' a mail service between two country towns I am often met with the answer, "" It will not pay."" I experience great difficulty in securing the institution of a mail service for a country district even where I am able to show that it would result in only a small loss, whereas every one seems to be I believe that the Post prepared to agree cheerfully to an annual loss of between £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 and £70^000 on the over-sea mail service. We recently agreed to fhe construction of a telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney at a cost of something like £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 , and, although a very considerable loss is sustained upon it , no one complains. returns it is paying 9 per cent. of construction. return, and have no hesitation in asserting I am very pleased to that the line will not pay working expenses plus interest on the cost of construction. It is certainly not a very graphic purposes. its earnings a considerable sum in respect of the loss of telegraphic revenue consequent upon the construction of the line. I would urge upon the Postmaster-GeneralI f , howthe absolute necessity of giving a little more attention to the requirements of rural districts. As a case in point, I would remind the honourable member that the telegraph line on the west coast of Western Australia is so close to the ocean that breakdowns frequently occur. remedy the trouble. four days elapsed before a break between Hamelin Pool and Roeburne was made good. If a delay of four hours, not to say days, occurred in the delivery of a city mail, or a telephone subscriber in one of our big towns were kept waiting for four minutes by the Exchange,, we should have letters of complaint in the press next morning. But the cutting off of a community of pioneers from the outside world excites no' outcry whatever. Out of the enormous sum which the Treasurer is finding for the Post and Telegraph Department provision should be made for a more instance, our expenditure upon the generous country policy, more particularly in those States where the population is constantly expanding into new settlements.

I have always held that the Postal Department ought to be an auxiliary to the development of the country. I admit that from a strictly departmental point of view that is not considered sound policy. The Department is a purely commercial one, but the Government themselves, in connection with the oversea mail service, have made an important departure in principle,, and are sacrificing something like £70,000 per annum. should not view too critically requests for small services in outlyingi parts of the Commonwealth. There are places in my electorate which have only a fortnightly or monthly mail, and although I admit that it would not pay to run a weekly service I think that the Government should at least give some consideration to the wants of the people in such districts. In some parts of Australia men have to travel 200 or 300 miles to reach a telegraph office. I suppose that it is impossible for us to bridge at once such enormous distances, but if the Government can afford to construct a costly telephone line for the special convenience of the merchants of Melbourne and Sydney, they may well be expected to do something for the pioneers who are opening up the back country and making it possible for our city traders to prosper. I do not wish to labour this question. It is one to which I have often referred in the House; and in view of the fact that the Government contemplate this large expenditure, chiefly in respect of city services, I. thought it desirable of a reasonable expenditure to help those to reiterate my views on the subject. Let me. in conclusion, impress on them that it is not a healthy policy to gorge the people in the cities with postal facilities and to starve those in the country. rise simply to emphasize the point that the mere fact that the Treasurer at this late hour has seen fit to bring down this statement of (proposed expenditure, and that we may admit that some of it is urgently necessary, must not be considered to do away with the right of honourable members to criticise at length at some other time the contemplated outlay. The Treasurer must take the full responsibility for it. I simply wish to make it clearly understood that our action on this occasion must not be interpreted as preventing us from scrutinizing, and. if necessary, criticising at some future time the expenditure for which the Treasurer has provided. master-General) [5.57] -In reply to the honourable member Jor Coolgardie I may say that I have recognised for some time that there is very grave reason for complaint regarding, tlie breakdowns on the telegraph line io which he has referred, and that I have already taken steps to remove what is undoubtedly a grievance. I have also tried to some small extent to make concessions to country districts, and The Minister therefore it is certainly my personal desire to help them in every way. My honourable friend has administered the Post and Telegraph Department, and I need hardly remind him that its revenue-earning branches are undoubtedly in the large centres of population. without the country districts. they would be.

External Affairs) [6.2] -In pursuance of an undertaking given more than once this session, that the, policy of^ the Government in relation to Defence would"" be sub-' mitted to the House before the Christmas adjournment, I take this opportunity to lay our scheme before honourable members. The fact that there is necessarily a small attendance in this last hour of our session this year imposes no disability, because the remarks I desire to offer will consist largely of quotations and figures, rapidly summarized, and,-, therefore, best studied in print. While it is physically impossible to deal with the whole defence questhreat of foreign offence. An obligation is tion as it deserves, I shall endeavour to touch, however lightly, upon those many aspects which cannot be omitted without prejudice to a general outline. One of the chief reasons for the union of our States was the need of a common defence; but, until now, we have been content to take the course of expediency, and although there has been combination and re-construction, the land and sea forces of the Commonwealth, are still little more than the collective forces of the States. We now propose a new organization for the defence of Australia. Therefore, we are about to initiate a departure, contemplated -at the inception of Federation, and intended to lay the foundation of our defence upon a basis as wide as the Commonwealth, without distinctionof -States. This House has just completed its task of dealing fiscally with ihe industrial conditions of the country as a whole, and it is deal nationally with its defence. I am, to a certain extent, in sympathy with the interjection, inferentially deplored expenditure on warlike preparations. It is not because we admire, or desire, offensive warfare that great proposals are now to be submitted for the consideration of Parliament. That we should require to take thought for the morrow in this regard is, to the thoughtful, occasion for inappeasable regret. The enormous annual expenditure of modern nations, severally jealous of each other's possessions and privileges, foreseeing the contingency that they may become involved in deadly conflict, though unhappily an evident necessity, presents humanity in a stage of its evolutionwhich cannot be regarded with pride or satisfaction. To-day the civilized world, and the uncivilized, too, consists of armed nations. Its leading nations are arming with more feverish 'haste than ever before, and, unhappily, the pace set by the foremost is that with which every people, desiring to protect itself from loss and. aggression, must attempt to keep step. This has been termed cut-throat competition ; and it is accurately so described. But as no one will suspect Great Britain, or still less one of her dependencies, of seeking to quarrel with her neighbours, or of harboring bellicose designs, we shall be believed when we say that our military preparation is strictly for defence, and with no cast upon us to protect the ""Territory with which we have been intrusted, and the fortunes of our kindred who share its responsibilities with us; as our territory is part of the Empire, we are in a measure responsible to all its units across the seas to become to them a source of strength and not of weakness. There was a time, not long since, when it was confidently maintained that Australia was outside the area of the world's conflicts, and might regard in comparative quietude any hostile movements in other parts of the globe. -That comfortable outlook has long since passed away.

398,"Toj£I.200,000,000. Mr Deakin","W h e n we do go in wemilitary training ancl discipline. The former is much more specialized on shipboard, and even naval militia demand far more training to reach a modern standard of efficiency. Still we have every reason to believe that the national instinct of the sea lives in our section of the race as much as in any other. Certainly every report we obtain, and every evidence we acquire, proves the success of our sailors in the Australian Squadron, and in the examinations and tests with, men of the Royal Navy in the Mother Country. All go to show that they are maintaining the reputation of this country , standing 1 well above the average standard achieved . even in the finest navy the world possesses. But when asking you to make a far larger provision for naval development than has ever been attempted here, we require to recollect at the very outset that we.owe to naval power and to the British flag our freedecadence may be discovered by critics dom in and ownership of this territory, the power to retain it, the whole of our political liberties and social standards. The Commonwealth is governed by a policy appropriately termed that of a "" White Australia"" because the ""white ensign"" flies all round our coast. Withdraw that, and peril would be instant. The Mother Country, though still "" Mistress of the Seas,"" submits to have some of the fleets of battleships by which her coasts are guarded, occasionally distant from that base. But still those remaining afford her a measure of protection only to be obtained in our case by what would be distinctly termed coastal defence. The squadron in these seas may at any time be removed to the China or Indian Seas. When a parallelis sought to be drawn between her circumstances and ours, this contrast requires to be taken into account. area means a long coast-line, and, therefore, the protection of Australian shores, quite apart from any attempt to share in operations upon the high seas, implies a great burden of responsibility. We are often taunted with paying no adequate share of the cost of, and with taking no part in naval defence on the high seas by. battle-ships. But, 'although since 1887 I have been engaged, with others, in considering various methods for the measurement of the responsibilities of the several portions of the Empire in regard to the maintenance of its flag upon the worlds' oceans. I have never regard to what that Navy may mean to us yet, either by one standard or by any combination of standards, been able to arrive at, or find any one else who has arrived at, a plan which is ripe for practical consideration. I propose, therefore, to pass by that part of the subject. It is not because we deny the main tenets of the "" blue water"" school. We admit that fhe sea is one all the world over, and that, therefore, the navy on the high seas must also be one, in direction and command, all the world over. But what we point to is that our problem of naval defence, putting aside the question of our share in the defence of the high seas, is a special problem to be viewed in the light of our special circumstances. This will be a (principal element in shaping the local naval proposals which I shall presently disclose. Let me merely say, in passing, that any personal knowledge I have gained, either by reading or observation, encourages me to believe that, whatever signs of in the Mother Country or in any of her departments, the Navy stands out as an exception. It is a distinctly up-to-date force, constantly adjusting itself to fresh conditions, whose officers and men prove on every occasion of trial that they retain, with the dauntless courage of the race, its natural adaptability, not only to the ancient wooden ships of the line, but to the curiously deformed modern structures of enormous interior complexity and deadly power constituting the Navy of to-day. No spectacle in England was, or could be, more impressive either to her own people or to those of us from overseas than that which was lately witnessed at Portsmouth. There in the Channel one saw the "" fleets in being "" gathered together, realizing by aid of the eye what their potency actually is. Dreadful thunders were locked within those iron Needless to say, our immense hulls, fitted and finished within almost as delicately as a watch, containing every modern improvement, the latest developments of telegraph and telephone, every agency that can protect the crew or destroy a foe, all apparently in perfect condition and under absolute command. The British Navy is a proud and progressive service, not content to rely upon its past laurels, unequalled as they are, but pushing insistently forward,, keeping in its iron grip the priority it has held for centuries. Such considerations as these will explain something I have yet to sav in due time with hereafter. We have also to be reminded that the latest vessels of war-battle ships, armoured cruisers, submarines or submersibles-fro m their greatest to their more diminutive sizes, make to-day far heavier and far more general demands on brain, nerve, and hardihood than were ever made in "" the brave days of o l d . "" The intricacy and variety of their many mechanisms, enormous powers of speed, weight of projectiles and rapidity of firing with the immense range of their weapons of war-requir e such expert knowledge and training, such readiness of decision and promptitude of action, that they impose a strain upon their crews which would be simply inconceivable to our fighting forefathers who won the splendid sea fights at the beginning of the last century. To-day the Navy-alway s a service for young men, and consisting, except in positions of the highest forty years of age, above it-is to a still greater degree in the smaller craft with their more delicate pieces of ing into the hands of young men. Submarines or torpedo destroyers owing to their fragility and high speed, f u l f i l their regular functions under Circumstances of danger, which, in war, when every pulse of the men and the mechanism is at high tension, would be immensely increased. The pressure upon the nerve, courage, and capacity of each unit and upon every man in the British marine is fa r higher now than it has ever been, and still tends fo increase with every one of the marvellous advances which science is making. To preserve naval efficiency under novel conditions such as these imposes much more arduous obligations than at any period in the world's history. Sitting suspended from 6.2/ to 7.4.5 p.m. fence, as seen from Australia, falls naturally into three parts. lates to the command of the high seas, the next to the protection of our coasts, and the Jast, to our power to hold our own territory against invaders. we rely on the Imperial Navy, with its battleships and heavy cruisers, the radius of whose operations, and artillery, is being extended year by year. Our second line of coastal defence has had hitherto & varying history; and as to the land defences which must repel invasion, I.shall speak presently. On ""what may be termed the Imperial line of defence on the high seas, as I have pointed out, our share of responsibility must be estimated hereafter. At the very outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Minis t e r of Great Britain met us with the frank avowal that the British Government preferred no claim for .money in relation .to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together. If honourable members appreciate the force of that .axiom, they will see that it implies much -both now and in the future. It implies that for the present, seeing that we have no voice in foreign affairs, we are not obliged to take any part in Imperial naval defence. It implies, also, with equal clearness, that when we do take a part in command, of men under naval defence, we shall be entitled to a or very ' little share in the direction of foreign affairs. But, in regard to the immediate situation, .nothing could be more explicit. As we mechanism, passare in every respect outside of the domain .of the foreign affairs of the Empire, and without any voice in the making of war or peace, so we remain for the present outside all responsibility for any naval defence on that score. But the question from our point of view cannot end with any such axiom. In order to mark the change which has come over the policy of British Governments in regard, first of all, to our political relations to the defence problem, and next in regard to the measure of defence which falls to our lot, allow me for a moment to refer to a few incidents in our own history. It was at a Conference in 1881 that the Premiers of the Australian Colonies put forward for the first time a definite doctrine of our mutual responsibilities. The whole naval defence, they said, should rest with the Imperial Government^ while the miliT h e question of detary defence of the land, including the forts for h/arbor protection; should rest The first rewith Australia. That, so far as I remember, was the first definite doctrine laid down as to the division of the task of defence. The Premiers of Australia, For the first, on laying down that doctrine, demanded that, as part of the Imperial naval defence, there should be a squadron of Imperial ships set apart for the defence of our coasts. The Admiralty replied, declining to admit that responsibility, unless Australia paid the whole expense of maintaining the Squadron, and even expressed a desire that we should pay the cost of building them. Nothing was done.",67,Defence Policy

That was a splendidly magnanimous attitude. It was in accordance with the axiom of the Prime Minister. As the logical outcome of that axiom His Majesty's Government frankly declared that, having the sole authority control of the affairs of the Empire, and restraint. the sole.decision of peace or war, the whole Upon page 130 he remarkedresponsibility for the defence of the EmSo long as the possession of unity of compire;-irrespectiv e of what-we might g i v emandand direction of the Fleet is maintained was their care. Upon page .1:30, Lord theyTweedmouth addedWe are quite ready to enter into any arrangement with the Colonies that may seem most suitable to them, and which may seem to bring advantage to the Navy, and advantage to the Colonies themselves. Upon page 482 , by way of interjection, he mined by strategical requirements, 1 summed up the Ministerial position very Admiralty is the judge. accurately in the statementWe shall be willing to take in kind what has been paid in the past in hard cash. That is to say, they are now prepared to accept the proposal that we previously submitted for a contribution by Australia in kinda contribution from her own men and her own resources, instead of from our purse. !

The consistency of these with the axiom of Again, he declaredthe head of the British Government is still to seek.

We are asked to take a and in the present Government, for the future "" leading part "" in making the naval defence safety of the country.

These three very important conditions were followed by the statement that the British Government were responsible for the defence of the Empire, that they wanted us to help them in that defence, but only on the terms mentioned. Again, he saidI want to claim first your help, and, second, to manage this great service without meaning the British Governmentare ready to consider a modification of the existing arrangements' to meet the views of the various Colonies. Once more he saidThe distribution pf the Fleet must be deterof which the On page 148 he urged. Then there is a point which has been alluded lo more than once by speakers, and that is the question of the distribution of ships. At this moment, no doubt we are under certain obligations with regard to Australia, as to the ships that are lo be on that particular station. It , in future, as 1 hope will be the case, there will be greater concentration of the ships, I want it to be very distinctly understood that I . do not believe that onr Dominions beyond the seas would suffer in any wa)' from such an arrangement. We want to consult with you as to the details this scheme. Of course, if each separate Colony is to be treated on a different footing, These quotations give a good idea of what of the Empire more complete. Upon page It would be of great assistance if the Colonial would undertake (1) to provide for against possible raids, or for co-operation with squadron, and also (2) to equip and maintain and fitting establishments which can be used by His Majesty's ships. It will further provided, and arrangements can be made for a supply of coal and naval stores, which otherwise would have to be sent out specially or purchased locally. The numbers inserted in the quotations, for acted upon all round the world. As honorconvenience, are my own. It wilt be noticed able members are aware, the old fleets of thar our small vessels are to serve "" in the the Empire in Europe and on the American Imperial Squadron."" Finally, on pages coast-they-hav e been withdrawn from the 330 and 1.3:1, he made some remarks which latter-hav e been massed. are worthy of special note. He suggested third rate ships have been discarded that I f the provision of the smaller craft which are f u l vessels of the old squadrons have been necessarily incident to the work of a great fleet brought together, in order, instead of of modern battleships could be made locally, it having a separate fleet in every ocean, and would be a very great help to the general work on almost every coast, to have fleets comof the Navy. You cannot take the small crafts, such as torpedo boats and submarines, manding great areas, consisting of the most across the ocean, and for warships to arrive in powerful vessels, expeditious, and heavily South Africa or in Australia or in New Zealand armed, which, when concentrated, are enor in Canada, and find ready to their hand well-trained men in vessels of this kind, would abled to operate at any particular point be an enormous advantage to them. be an enormous advantage to find ready lo their before.

Under these circumstances the don. After quoting what Lord TweedMr Deakin. It would, in If the three existing squadrons because of our insistence, and because of Thev ject to a very important and vital conIn addition, The plan of naval construction suggested My view in regard to the mouth had said about the value to the British Squadron of submersibles or submarines and destroyers in these waters, I went on to insist that these submersibles -and destroyers, built, manned, and maintained at the sole expense of the Commonwealth, must remain under the control of the Government. Their distribution and movements would be entirely subject to that Government at all times. That is one of the features to which I wish to call the attention of honourable members, because it is supplemented by a novel proposal for directly associating our naval forces with /those of the Mother Country. I ventured to press it then, ancl, as honourable members will see, am still pressing it upon the acceptance of the Admiralty. While feeling that for every constitutional reason any flotilla created and maintained by the Commonwealth must be under Commonwealth control; I have grown, more and more deeply to realize the risks of our attempting to create a small force solely of our own, in which the men and omcers would have no hope for experience or advancement except within its bounds. A small flotilla of that description would remain a thing .apart, not directly committed to the high standards of the Imperial Navy. In the Imperial Navy, as honourable members are aware, the men and the omcers on every station are changed at short periods. Elaborate provisions are made to prevent them becoming hide-bound, sit-at-ease, indifferent or mechanical. They are transferred from ship to ship. They are put regularly through fresh courses of training. They have to return periodically to learn the latest methods in their particular departments. The consequence is that the Royal Navy is a most progressive weapon, always kept up-to-date, its men constantly in practical training, and always stimulated by competition, by examination, and by every other means which can be applied, in addition to the always powerful incitements offered by frequent prospects of promotion to vacancies in the many Fleets of the Empire. I think that the more honourable members reflect upon it, the more they will see how different must be the condition of a little land-locked navy if one may so call it-of a small flotilla -cut off by itself, its officers aiid men removed from the possibilities of promotion or advancement, except by the slow and often unsatisfactory process of seniority, and with few opportunities for them to keep themselves abreast of the rapid advances made in their branches of the service. I contend, with the diffidence which must attach to a layman, though with some confidence, that the force of these criticisms will be made apparent if you take any country with a small flotilla or a few small sliips^ and compare these with the same class of ships and the same class of men engaged in. larger fleets with larger opportunities, and above all with those of the greatest of maritime powers, the British Navy. I ventured, therefore, to attempt to find a means by which we could get the whole benefit of connection with the Admiralty and the Imperial Fleet, sharing its standards, its training and its prizes, and yet maintain the Australian character of our flotilla, and so made fhe suggestion which I now summarize. Let our officers and men be engaged here, under the . same conditions as those of the Royal Navy, or be obtained after they have served in the Royal Navy. Let them serve on our local vessels for the usual term on this station, whatever it may be, and then pass into other ships of the Royal Navy, .to continue their training elsewhere. This would keep them, while here, up to a standard of efficiency equal, at least, to that required everywhere in the Royal Navy. They would remain members of that Navy in e\-ery sense, recruited and serving uncier its laws. Their services in our ships wouldcount in the same fashion as upon similar vessels in the Navy. They would be regularly inspected here by the Admiral or his deputies, and be subject to naval discipline and to all the penalties and privileges associatedwith 'such discipline. Australia would pay them, while they were on this station, at Australian rates of pay, though of course they would accept the usual deductions necessary to continue their title to share in the Royal NavyPensions Fund. Preference would be given wherever possible in our vessels to Australian officers and seamen at everv opportunity that occurred. Our ships would fly the White Ensign with the Southern Cross, and be altogether Australian in cost and in political control, as to their movements and stations. In everything else, they would be part of the British Navy, the officers and men being simply seconded for fixed terms for service under our general control; but in every other respect indistinguishable from the men in the Imperial Squadrons here or elsewhere. In time of .war, they would almost certainly be placed by the Commonwealth Government of the day directly under the Admiral commanding the Eastern Squadron, since he would be the highest naval authority in this part of the world. I doubted in London, and still continue, to doubt, if any conditions would be imposed upon this 1 transfer at .such a time, but it must be clearly understood. that the decision on these points must rest absolutely in the hands of the responsible Government of Australia when the emergency arises. We want the most effective ships and the most efficient men we can get here, with ample prospects of advancement to the latter when they merit it. We also want a flexible relation, as intimate as possible, between our Government and the Admiralty, which shall encourage the development of our local defence to the -fullest extent, and in such a form as to supplement' to the best the Imperial Navy in our hemisphere. I took the opportunity, on my own personal responsibility, of pressing that upon the Admiralty and upon the British Government as, at all events, one means by which our flotilla might be kept entirely up to date, its Australian character maintained, and the control of the Commonwealth Government asserted. Under this plan we should procure, by the expenditure of the same amount of money, a far more efficient, active, and progressive service than we could hope to do with a navy in a back watera service solely our own, and limited by our exchequer. It would then be practically a branch of the British Fleet, though under the Commonwealth, so far as political control was concerned. control in time of war. would be in the Commonwealth, but if in a time of danger it chose to place its flotilla under the command of the Admiral on this station-and in the event of operations here I should say that, in almost every circumstance, one can imagine, that would probably be the case-it would then pass wholly under his control for the time being. Colonel FOXTON -But if it did choose to do so? tain the whole control. Colonel FOXTON -We would have this anomaly, that there would be men and officers of the Royal Navy practically unable to serve therein. Because, instead of being taken from the Royal Navy, our squadron would be an addition to the Royal Navy, and would not take anything from that Royal Navy even if not added to it. It would, perhaps, be less effectively employed apart, but, whatever it did, would help the British Squadron and assist to protect this part of the Empire. The Royal Navy could lose nothing by the existence of a special force, created and maintained at our expense, and not at that of the British taxpayer. So far as one can judge, almost'under any conceivable conditions, the Government of the Commonwealth would feel that its safety was best served by placing those ships under the control of the highest naval expert in these seas. advantage Colonel FOXTON -Almost certainly, I should think. after all, a Government's responsibility is to their people, and the Government must be answerable only to them directly. To' part with its control altogether would be to part with the Australian character of this local flotilla, which is one of the elements that we hope to use for the development of the maritime spirit in this part of the world. By its means we can make a real addition to the British Navy. Our Squadron being an addition, although part of, the Royal Navy, could be employed with its ships to our mutual great advantage. come a recruiting ground for the Imperial Navy. same extent in no other way. squadron. squadron in the sense of being trained in exactly the same way as the Royal Navy, and, therefore, capable of acting with it as an auxiliary just as troops who are not drilled together can act together.

The particular purposes to which that money should be devoted should be discussed in detail between representatives of the various Colonies and the Admiralty, so that a thoroughly good scheme might be worked out in the end. The real question is one of control, though that only emerges gradually into view as the negotiations proceed. The problem before us is the association of our small naval strength with* the great organization of fleets of the Mother Country so as to. secure the highest efficiency and unity without sacrificing our right to the constitutional control of our own funds,, and of any flotilla built and maintained at our own cost. I have made numerous quotations because honourable members, when they come to read them, will see certain inconsistencies appearing to have beset Lord Tweedmouth's mind at that time-inevit able contradictions that have since become clear, but which only subsequent events enabled us to discover. members will see that on the part of the Admiralty there are to be no more demands on Australia-n o official claims for money. But there are conditions sought to be imposed though these differ in substance from the demands originally made on us. Of course honourable members will not forget that there are two branches of naval defence as it will be undertaken by the Commonwealth First there is the British Squadron for which we make a contribution in money. It is with that, ancl with that alone, that the Admiralty are dealing in the correspondence presently to be read. But quite apart from that, there is about to be created by ourselves, at an expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, a force, towards which the Admiralty will not contribute,' and over which they can claim no control except that which this Parliament may be pleased to give them. I ask honourable members to keep in their minds those two separate sets of proposals, because 'all the references made by the Admiralty relate only to our present contribution ancl their Squadron. We pay £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to that Squadron, and that contribution is often ridiculed overseas. I venture to say that by no comparative test can it be subjected to ridicule. It willcompare favourably with the £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a.year contributed by Cape Colony, with the £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year contributed by New Zealand, with the £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 [265]' a year contributed by Natal, and with the £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year contributed by Newfound landWhile the expenditure in Canada amounts to £ 1 8 5 , 0 00 a year, it is for the protection of her own fisheries, on docks which her vessels have to use, and on other matters from wKich direct local commercial benefits arise. contribute nothing to the British Navy? spends £1:85,000 on services which not only serve Canadian, but also Imperial ends, and are, therefore, counted by her as a contribution towards defence. I am not criticising that course, and .certainly am not objecting to it, but point out that we cannot measure that expendiiture of £r85 ,000, from which the Canadians get considerable local present commercial benefits, with our contribution of £'200,000, from which we get nothing of that kind. fact that they do not intend to pav a subsidy to the British Navy. Honourable' that fact; but I am not called upon to criticise them. Colonel FOXTON -D o not the Straits Settlements . contribute anything to the British Navy? tributed, but that is a Crown Colony, and I am dealing with self-governing Colonies. At the present time, the Admiralty havo consented to compound, so to speak, the contribution which has been made by Natal hitherto, and propose to compound that made by Cape Colony, accepting instead of cash a naval militia, drilled on a vessel which is to be provided by them, ancl also on certain submarines and destroyers, to be built and manned locally, at the expense of the Colonv. Uncier what control they are to be placed I am not informed. It is in pursuance of our proposal that we should contribute in kind, instead of in cash, for the further term which our Naval Agreement has to run, and that it should be amended to that end, that since returning -from London, having been in communication with the Admiralty, unofficially, since August last, and officially since Seorember last, about the 23rd September I sent the following cablegram<!

That is a proposal by which, in the opinion of this Government, w.e could make a contribution not open to .the objections raised to the present Agreement, for it would be a contribution of men instead of monev. In letting our contribution take that form,' we should be considering our own interests as well as those' of the Navy.

My Lord, I have ihe honour to request that Your ExcelTwo cruisers, "" P "" or superior, lency will communicate wilh the Secretary of State for the Colonies, inviting him to refer the Admiralty to my despatch of the 28th August, 1905, of which,"" for greater convenience, I enclose a copy. [Commonwealth Parliamentary Paper, Senate, No. 9S (1906).] This proposed 2. The subject therein dealt with has been fully and thoughtfully considered during the period which has elapsed since it was written, fortification not only by Ministers here, but also during the recent Conference in London, where I had the great advantage of personally discussing the -matter with Lord Tweedmouth and the heads of his Department. 3. Speaking generally, the further consideration which has been given strengthens the conclusions put forward in 1905, particularly those in which I dwelt upon the fact that at present none of our grant is applied to any distinctively Australian purpose, while our contribution would seem in part repaid if we were enabled to take a direct and active part in the protection of our shores and shipping. Our sole aim then, as. now, was that of uniting with the Mother Country in the necessary preparations for national defence, and the scheme I have lately submitted included a method of sharing in the duty of naval defences by means of a contribution of Australian seamen instead of money, which is allied to the provision for the selection and partial training of the crews engaged in the proposed steamer service as members of the Royal Navy Reserve, formerly submitted. 4. As the replies received to the despatch of 1905, which appear also on the paper enclosed, expressed disapproval of the special suggestion then put forward, the Government now invite reference to that part of the despatch of 23rd May in which the Lords of the Admiralty intimate that-other aspects of the matter might be viewed with favour. A specially suitable opportunity for discussing these was presented in connection with the London Conference, when the This contribution would develop whole question was generally reviewed as far as practicable, considering the limited time at our disposal. Lord Tweedmouth, speaking on behalf of the British Government, was most generous, and Ministers have confidence that the proposals now put forward by the Commonwealth in consonance with his suggestion will be adopted upon the advice of the Admiralty. 5. It was my intention, on returning, to take . immediate steps to give effect to the general understanding arrived at in London had not personal disabilities prevented me from giving it They have six offerinar for until, recently the close attention which its details demand.

To a subsequent inquiry by the Admiral as to whether any Australian "" Naval Reserve that might be kept up would be included in the Naval Militia, a reply was sent that it had been agreed in London that this Government, would take over the Naval Reserve in Australia. 7. The Parliament of the Commonwealth is now sitting, and members Anticipate that before they rise the proposals of the Government in regard to naval defence, or at least a complete outline of them, will be submitted for their consideration. The matter is therefore urgent, and it was hoped that some general indication of approval by the Admiralty of the principles of the proposal forwarded, perhaps coupled with criticisms of some portion of it, might have been given by cable. the same spirit as that which inspired the despatch of August, 1905, and were intended as a groundwork which might become the basis of a formal proposal to be conveyed by despatch. 8. I am writing this now expecting that it will reach England in lime to be considered in connection with the cable message from the Admiral, and for the purpose of supporting the proposals therein made. are now put forward in the belief that they will form a means of promoting and enlarging that national co-operation and fostering that stronger sense of mutual support alluded to in my former despatch. 9. That communication concluded with a statement that the very life of the Empire depends on the Navy, and pointed out the necessity for ' taking every step possible to increase our maritime strength to enable us to meet all emergencies that International difficulties may create.

New Zealand has been informed of the proposals, and will be again communicated with on recejpt of reply to this. That is the stage at which the negotiations at present stand. left upon my mind by my visit to London was that the proposals made by us, and roughly summarized in the notes from which Before any I recently read, would be accepted cordially. I wish it to be clearly understood, however, that this does not imply that the Admiralty itself, which is the authority now negotiating with us, speaking as the Admiralty, was met leading members of the Admiralty Commission ancl some of their leading officers, including most of the Intelligence Branch, and having discussed matters with them at great length and in detail, it appeared to me that the demand for control first put forward had been modified, and that we had every reason to expect a glad welcome to our offer. For that reason, amongst others, I proceeded deliberately and with confidence in the preliminary negotiations to which allusion has been made. I by no means despair of my proposition, and trust that While we are invited to take a the view now expressed by the Admiralty will not be maintained for any length of time. We had the great advantage, before submitting it. of receiving the kind assistance of His Excellency Sir Wilmot Fawkes. When our proposal is fully weighed and I replied in these terms considered, it should commend itself to the Admiralty as a whole, as I . know it did to some of its prominent Lords and their Ministers are unable to gather-(1 ) Asadvisers. Hoping to have met the House with a complete agreement, under the circumstances it appeared advisable to take honourable members entirely into our confidence, and I have therefore informed them of the whole of the official communications to date. This is one of the questions which will require to be carefully pondered before our reassembling, when we shall proceed to deal with the Ministerial proposal for a vote of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 towards building, maintaining and manning, a small flotilla of our own. The Admiralty is apparently endeavouring to insist upon exercising its authority in time of war to distriConbute its vessels where it pleases. I do not deny, that it might be a wise thing for our flotilla to be attached to the concentrated British Fleet on these seas, and even to proceed with it to a considerable distance from our coast to cope with _ the enemy. The modern naval doctrine appears to be Napoleonic-that you should always be in greater force than your enemy at the particular point of attack. I do not dispute that this might be the wisest tactic, and am far from doubting the fitness of the Admiral of the station to advise the Government of The impression the CommonweaUh in time of war upon the disposal of our vessels.",78,Defence Policy
418,Mr Fisher,That is impossible.,79,Defence Policy
419,Mr Deakin,"On the professional side, I offer no opinion. stitutional, not a naval, principle. Even a desirable thing loses much of its desirableness when an attempt is made to force it on a self-governing comniunity, having the right to choose its own path, and accept the consequences. dangerous for the Admiralty to insist on a supremacy which, if misadventure befel, would place the whole responsibility upon them. The Government of the Commonwealth, representing the' Australian people, is entitled in, this, as in every other matter, to speak and act for them. I have indicated how in my opinion it would act. Weighing its responsibilities, it must do what it believes test in the interests of the people. From this principle there can be no departure. I now turn to the proposals for expenditure on what I will term, for the sake of distinction, our local naval force. I had occasion in London to object, and wish now, to object, to the sense in which those words are often construed. I maintained at both Conferences, in 1887, when representing only ""Victoria, and in 1907, when I had the honour io represent the Commonwealth, that acceptingthe doctrine that the Empire is one-whic h is the only true foundation for Imperial sentiment-w e must recognise that all the means of defending any part of it are Im perial. Ships protecting the Australian coast are as much Imperial as any that are protecting the Mother Country, and the naval force under the Union Jack ancl Southern Cross that beats off a hostile power in the Australian seas is as much Imperial as. any under the Union Jack alone. Although ""loca l defence"" properly defines craft which cannot be sent long distances, and therefore operate always within a certain radius, to the f u l l extent of its efficiency, it is Imperial as well. In speaking of oiir local defence, I speak of vessels whose sphere is practically limited to Australian waters. will be engaged in the defence of the Empire just as much as if they fought at the mouth of the Thames. Those who hear mc will remember how Lord Tweedmouth alludes to the value of such a flotilla. It would be, he said, ""of great assistance,"" of "" m u c h help,"" of ""enormous advantage."" Local defence is Imperial defence at a particular spot, but none the less Imperial on that account. and presently, I hope, built by Australians, manned by Australians, trained and kept WhatI contend for is a conup to the Royal Navy standard, we shall be gratifying Australian aspirations, while making the most leal contribution to the defence of the Empire. In providing that part of our defence which will be absolutely under our own control, it apI t will be pears to me reasonable to proceedfrom the ports and the shores outwards. We should commence by furnishing the naval defence necessary or advisable to supplement 0111 shore defences, and having provided for the harbors, establish a zone round them which would permit free exit and entrance for vessels in times of war. Hereafter we shall also provide other ancl more powerful vessels for coastal defence. It seems a reasonable thing to begin at our centres. Most of our great cities are on or near the coast. We have a large ancl valuable commerce, Inter-State as well as oversea, which requires to be taken into consideration. Local naval defence demands vessels and men. After what I said at the outset, honourable members will sufficiently realize that those vessels, even though they may be small, carrying comparatively small crews, will be extremely complicated, and highly specialized, needing highly expert seamen. These will have to be picked as fhey are picked in the Imperial Navy. Men in their prime, chosen for their capacity, and subjected to thorough training will be required. In 1887, when returning from the first Conference which I had the honour to attend, I expressed the aspiration that 1 might live to see the day when, in place of subsidizing a Squadron, Australia would supply ships built, manned, and commanded by Australians -' That time is now arriving. But the conflict of opinion as to the best means of defence ancl the particular tvpe of vessel most advantageous uncier our circumstances is acute in the Mother Country, and echoed here. I am not competent to decide the Yet these question, but Lord Tweedmouth, speaking for the Admiralty at tlie Imperial Conference, strongly recommended submarines. They were, he said, the weapons of the future. They were directly suggested by him to Sir Joseph Ward as suitable for the New Zealand coast, and he expressed the opinion that before long they would supersede destroyers. He asserted that they were the best weaWith vessels built for, pons available. In these circumstances, liaving regard to his official advisers, it would be unwise for us to reject his counsel. high authority, that men well known to as and to the Empire as experts of very high standing, such as Sir George Sydenham Clarke, who, although a soldier, has made a. study of naval defence, also Admiral Cyprian Bridges, and some of our though the submarine may prove to be the most effective instrument in the future, its superiority has not been demonstrated as yet, our intention is to adopt this type of defence, if possible. So far as I could judge from the members of the Admiralty, from their officers, and from criticism in London, the main opinion of what might be terme'd the younger generation is almost entirely in ' its favour. cannot shut our eves to the fact that every powerful maritime nation to-day is largely adding to the number of its submarines. their experiments or reduced their numbers, though it may be admitted, and is perfectly true, that the submarine, as well, as other vessels, is by no means perfected, and is undergoing frequent alterations. Though authorities differ, the submarine is admitted to be a most potent form of weapon if it were only because of its moral ef.of the ordinary British seaman, take six fect upon an attacking squadron. Having had an opportunity at Portsmouth of seeing these curious, porpoise-like vessels, as they approached, gradually submerging until -nothing but the periscopes appeared above the surface, these, too, disappearing and leaving no trace of their movements, the spectacle was very convincing. Presently they returned to the surface. Now, seeing the facility with which they could cease to be visible, it became evident how demoralizing it must be to those in charge of . battle-ships or cruisers to know that im their vicinity -wher e they do not know and cannot discover-ther e are enemies of insidious approach, capable of doing immense damage. Consequently, after the best consideration we could give to the matter, in face of admitted differences of opinion, it seems to us that for Australian harbour defence, and even for spaces immediately surrounding a harbour's mouth, in which hostile vessels would require to lie if they endeavoured to bottle up our shipping, the submarine is probably the best weapon. We have referred to submersibles, which honourable members, no doubt, are aware are Mr Dealcin. larger vessels with two motive powers, one Even in face of the fact that using coal or oil when the vessel is on the surface, and the other using electricity, or possibly petrol, when the vessel is below the surface. Though not as favoured as submarines, it is possible that they may iprove to be evenbetter' suited to some of our ports, but that is a matter for own naval officers, consider that, detailed consideration. When I spoke recently of the strain to whicb seamen in modern vessels are always subjected, it. is to be recollected that this is especially true of submarines and submersibles. The youngest, most gallant, and ablest officers of the Navy are selected for this service; immensely proud they are of their task, ancl never in the slightest degree afraid of the risks that it involves. But it must be We recognised that the maintenance of submarines in an efficient condition means, as I have said, a change every three years or so in order to relieve the strain upon None of them have abandoned the crews and in order to improve their training. Consequently, if we have a land-locked navy, our submarines would possibly become unsuitable, because we could not rely upon the crews and officers being kept up to the highest state of efliciency. it is pointed out by Lord Tweedmouth that the higher ratings, even years to gain, and that all oflicers serve eight years before they reach even the rank of lieutenant. Those employed on submarines in particular require a specially long and severe training. Honourable members will now perceive the purpose of the remarks which I made at the outset. The smallest vessels, and perhaps these more than all others, require crews of great skill and capacity, high scientific training as \veU as very great courage and resource, and yet it is upon these apparently that Australians in the first instance should rely. The best submarines are those at present known as the C class. I have seen three classes, A, B, and C. TheC class will probably in a short time be surpassed by the D class, now in prospect. TheC class is at present the most modern submarine in Great Britain. We shall probably propose to the House, subject to a condition I will mention presently, that three of these should be purchased each year for three years, and that m addition to them two torpedo teat (coastal) destroyers, the most up to-date of their class should be built annually for three years. This would give us at the end of that period nine submarines and six torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers-fiftee n small vessels in commission after the three years' programme is completed. Of course,'these would be'outside the Naval Agreement, and remain solely under CommonweaUh control, although, as before stated, in my judgment they would be treated in the same way as any built under the new Agreement in time of war. The torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer is fitted with turbine engines, oil fuel, three torpedo tubes, and also carries two twelve-pounders. speed of twenty-six knots, and a complement of thirty-three men. TheC class of submarines, whose details, as I have said, maybe somewhat altered in theD class, would have an approximate speed on the surface of fourteen knots, with a speed when submerged of ten knots; two periscopes, and two propellers. sion would be by electricity or petrol, they would be provided with two torpedo tubes, and would have a crew of sixteen. The first cost of a first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer would be £42,000. Two therefore would cost £84,000, and there would be some expense connected with bringing them to Australia if they were brought from the other side of the world, about which I shall say something presently. A submarine costs £50,000, and £5,000 more to deliver in Australia. The total cost of each here would therefore be £55,000, and three would cost £165,000. The cost for the year for two first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers and three submarines would amount to £249,000, or almost exactly the sum we propose to vote, leaving £1,000 towardsthe expense of bringing the torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers out to Australia. The cost for the upkeep of these little vestype than is at present current, or, at least, sels may be far more than honourable members anticipate. stores, and repairs of a first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer would be £6,725. The wages for a complement of thirty-three men at naval rates, including a colonial allowance of 3s. a day, but withwould sometimes be rendered almost out victualling, would amount to £4,500, leaving the total charge for the upkeep of these vessels nearly £12,000 a year. The cost in' the case of submarines at naval rates of pay and our special allowance would be for each shore base of four men £-570. For each submarine, .double crews of sixteen each, £5,650, and for each small vessel or tug associated with them, with ten ments, which will remove some of the men, £ r , i 8 o , or a total of ,£7,500. Then repairs, sea stores, petrol, and victualling would take £3,600, making a total of over £11,000 a year. I need not enter into details with respect to clothing, pensions and so on'. The total charge for upkeep, without the charge for the tug, would amount to about £57,000 for five vessels for the first year. The expenditure would rise to £114,000 for the second year, and to £171,000 when the third year's operations were completed. These figures are, She would have a at all events, sufficiently near for present purposes. The complete scheme would give us two submarines for New South Wales, two for Victoria, two for Queensland, one perhaps at Thursday Island, and one each for South Australia, Western Australia', and Tasmania, and one torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer for The method of propulthe chief harbour of each State. The probable period of usefulness of these vessels is reckoned at fifteen' years, and allowing £""50.000 a year, whicli would be one-fifteenth cf the total cost, the annual outlay on completion of the present proposals would be £221,000, without including interest, say, £250,000 a year. Whether these precise vessels will be chosen will be determined partly by the association we are able to form with the Royal Navy through the Admiralty, and partly on the possibility that local advices may suggest some change. We do not feel that it would be judicious to endeavour even to look forward further than three years, but, following the principle to which I have already alluded, if after. the three years the protective force be considered insufficient, probably it would then be wisest for us to acquire a torpedo destroyer, of -a larger as large as the latest modern type, The cost of oil, fuel, and capable of ocean-going coastal service. It must, however, always be remembered that in the heavy seas which frequently occur along the Australian coast the largest torpedo boat destroyer that you could find powerless for rapid and effective action, and that, as the great security for its own safety, if confronted with a vessel carrying heavy metal, is speed, when that is lost the efficiency of even large coastal destroyers is much to be doubted. But probably by the time we are able to undertake them, there may be further developapprehensions entertained at present. Even they can only be taken as approximations as to ocean-going destroyers,, as they are in every case. called, there is also a division of opinion.

In that respect,",79,Defence Policy
420,Mr Wilks,Thos e are not your own,83,Defence Policy
421,Mr Deakin,"Heaven forbid! Aand naval possibilitiesI have already made reference to the forts-w e come to those who man the forts-the Militar-y Forces of the Commonwealth. Their outlook here differs very largely from that of the naval service, because land service is much less specialized and may be made much more generally disciplinary to our people as a whole, although it demands in most cases a smaller degree of organization and efficiency. But we cannot afford to speak lightly of our land force, first because of what it has achieved-and its record where it has been tested is admirable-and also because, although not preparing for any expeditionary adventures outside Australia, we must realize that while we remain a mere handful of people, clustered practically Ln one segment of the continent, any invasion attempted would probably be at a remote part. Military Forces would have to be prepared for acting one, two, or more thousands of miles away from the populated centres of the Commonwealth. Consequently that casts an additional burden on us,' since, until our population grows faster perhaps, seven or ten years afterwards may than it has been growing-and I hope we shall grow much faster-w e have the responsibility not only of protecing hearths ancl homes here, but of guarding the great unoccupied parts of this immense continent. As in the Navy we are making a new departure almost without a precedent, and new to all the Dominions of the Empire, so in connection with our land forces it appears to the Government that the time has arrived for making a new departure of an equally marked kind, and of a type equally unprecedented uncier the British flag. While I have no desire to find fault with our existing militia force,, which has every apthe position of the Commonwealth? About pearance of energy, yet there are consideraone schoolboy in seven is receiving some tions in respect to it which I think will weigh very seriously with the whole of this community. In the first place, numerically it is absurdly weak. It is. now 14 per cent, short of the officers it ought to have, is in some way or other connected with.the and 10 per cent, short of the numbers of those required in the ranks. The average training of the rank and file is only i i years, so frequent are the incomings and the outgoings. In fact, for acti-ve service to-morrow, probably we could not count on more than half of the 22,000 odd militia that we have. A force of 1,300 permanent men looks well, but on examination we discover that only about 700 belong to the fighting force. When the Permanent Force is reduced so much,' we can understand the deductions required in calculating the effective strength of the ordinary militia. Out of a population of nearly 1,000,000 men of military age, we have only 22,000 regularly drilled, and, as I have said, for only short periods, and for the most part on parades or in drill-rooms. Colonel FOXTON -But a vast number of those who have passed through the ranks are practically a reserve. ever, they are a reserve of only twelve months' experience, which, as the honourable meinber knows, rarely amounts to mucb, and often to very little. Colonel FOXTON -The average service is over twelve months. and a half for all, but many go out at the Our end of twelve months. Colonel FOXTON -But a great many do not leave until after the expiration of three years. be looked upon as a reserve. Colonel FOXTON -And a good reserve, too! are 40,000 others, of all ages and degrees of physical capacity, who practise more or less with the rifle, but who have no d r ill , no organization, and no officers. If we distinguish the volunteers from the militia, we find that even a smaller proportion of the former would be effective for immediate service in the field. In point of fact, the volunteers are also short of officers, and are Ibut partly drilled. What then is training as a cadet; about one youth in fifty-five, under nineteen years of age, has seen some service in the militia or the volunteers; and one man in fifty-two forces. That is to say, one male in every 112 is receiving some kind of drill and military experience for a short period; and, with our present arm's, ammunition, and equipment, we should be unable to maintain very few more than the actual number of our militia and volunteers. Yet on this tiny array we expend a sum which this year approaches £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In order, therefore, to have 100,000 men properly equipped, we should require, at the same ratio, to spend probably £1,500,000 more",83,Defence Policy

We must greatly enhance our forces, but we cannot afford to pay more than ,^2,000,000 a year to that end; and yet ""that is what the present system necessarily implies for that number. Numerically our force is too weak, and financially it is too expensive. It consists largely of married men, who ought to be in the second and not in the first line. It includes a number of men whOj though they can stand ordinary parade, are obviously unfit for campaigning; many of the members of the rifle clubs are grey beards. After our experience it is now plain that no system can meet our necessities except one that appeals to the people as a whole-that calls upon them in the name of citizenship. We are a free people, with political equality and sole authority in a country where all have the opportunity to possess homes of their own. Our position as free men in a free country casts on all the responsibility of undertaking our own defence. fhe withdrawal of men in the prime of life, at a time when they are engaged in vocations, and have families depending on them, would be a very serious matter; and the proposals of the Government take this into account. We propose a system of universal training, in order to form a National Guard of Defence, in which every young man in the Commonwealth shall be required to serve during his nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first years. This gives us a small fraction of his early manhood, when he is best capable of receiving the benefit and standing the strain of military training. Each young man will be called upon to spend an average of sixteen days per year, not.in drillthe eighth year, this will mean over 200,000 rooms or on parade-grounds, but in local camps, devoted wholly and solely to continufor arms, ammunition, and equipment for ous practical instruction.

In a country of great distances like our own, with whose Mr Deakin. characteristics they are familiar-and with which we shal'l shortly be thoroughly well informed upon probable points of attack-the y will be able to render a good account of themselves', and probably have an advantage over even fhe best trained troops of Europe, owing to tlie local conditions under which any conflicts are likely to be waged. be limited to forty-eight days in three years ? of training for infantrymen, but not for officers, artillery, orcavalry. Even on that basis, the cost will be crushing unless the trappings of war are replaced by a Spartan simplicity of uniform and habit, in harmony with the political principles on which our Government is' based and our social life is shaped. We have kept closely in mind throughout, the democratic system Of course, it is recognised that of military organization in Switzerland, very lucidly described this year by two of our officers, first in the Australian press by Lieut -Colonel Reay, and next fully reported upon officially . by Colonel Bridges. More lately it has been investigated by a Select Committee from the Mother Country. The testimony of all is highly favorable to the results attained by a similar system under absolutely different physical conditions and territorial limitations. The proposals of the Government will, it is calculated, give an establishment of at least 83,000, always in training, supplemented each year by about 30,000 men, an equal number passing into the reserve. In men available, with full provision field artillery and cavalry, organized for total cost of this is estimated at less than £250,000 more than is at present expended; whereas a Militia Force half as strong would, on our present basis, cost twice as much, if we could obtain the men. any dues which this Parliament, on consideration., might see fit to levy on those who for one reason or another do not serve assured that at their proper period, making exceptions, of course, of those who for physical or other reasons are unfit to be enrolled.

By this means we shall have a very considerable subsidiary force in the cadets and rifle clubs; I shall presently refer to the latter in another aspect. 1906, there were less than 7.000 cadets in the Commonwealth; whereas last year we made provision for nearly 28,000; and this year's Estimates represent a total of about 37..000. therefore, that the advance in this direction, since the present Government came into oflice, has been very great.

The waggons and limbers are now being successfully manufactured within the Commonwealth.

The British Government have gone to enormous expense to supply these ranges in the United Kingdom.

We want our soldiers for artillery. The gun carriages for the 6.7-in. guns are to be locally made. We attach great importance to the creation of the utmost power of resistance locally, both as to war materials ancl men. We are at the very beginning of a period of development which I trust will be as thorough and complete as that of Japan. to provide against the emergencies of war, it will be necessary to establish an ammunition factory. This means a cordite factory by way of basis. If we can obtain orders for the supply of the Imperial Squadron in Australian waters, it would be of material assistance to us. If we can dispose of an output of100 tons per year, we can save 3d. per lb. at present prices upon all the cordite that we use. On the other hand, if we can only sell 50 tons a year, we shall have to pay 5c!. per Ib. more for it. made in the same factory as the cordite. The manufacture of cases at a rolling mill is also under consideration. My colleague, Ihe Minister of Defence, has an elaborate proposal to lay before the House in this regard. I am sure that, from the inforMr Deakin. mation which has been supplied to us by Mr Hake, the very capable Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, who recently visited the Mother Country to put himself in touch with the latest developments of this industry, he will be able to satisfy honourable members that it is desirable to establish a cordite factory. I have great pleasure in laying upon the table of the House the report of the result of his investigations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and hope that it will prove interesting reading to honourable members. The Minister will be able to show that the establishment of a cordite factory ammunition, even with 200,000 men available for service, what could be expected of them ? I have shown how comparatively slight an increase there will be in the expenditure proposed under this great scheme, and I have also shown that a large portion of it will be expended in this country. Then we come to one of the most serious matters iin connection with this scheme. That is, the provision of a sufficient num* ber of well-trained officers. Because the theory of this' force is that the officers are to train their men. The clerical duties at present performed by officers are to be clone soldiers' service, not for indoor work. But in order to obtain efficient soldiers a staff of officers must first be efficiently trained ; and as we cannot pretend in this Commonwealth to establish a military college in every State, we propose to establish a school of permament expert instructors. This would In order consist of three specialists-on e whose subjects will be strategy, tactics, and military history; a second, whose subjects will be artillery, field and garrison, and macliine guns and theory of musketry; and a third, whose subjects will be engineering in all its branches and topography.

We hope to have our officers trained so that they, will be able to impart to those below them the practical knowledge which they have acquired. Tliey will be well instructed in peace, will lead in war, and fill all commands in the Australian Forces. Of course, it must be remembered that in addition to this we have proceeding, and propose to continue, the temporary exchanges of oflicers with the Mother Country, with India, with Canada, and with South Africa. prove of great value to us. We are taking every advantage of it . Last year my colleague the Minister of Defence sent seven officers and non-commissioned officers abroad for training. This year he-is sending eleven. We shall probably increase the number. We have applied to the Government of India for permission to send more officers there to participate in their military exercises, join their camps, and witness the thoroughly organized military machinery in operation under Lord Kitchener. We have now asked for permission to send militia officers as well as permanent men. right idea! The ruling idea is, while setting a high ideal of military training, to provide equal opportunities for all our citizens who will give their time and ability to the service of the Commonwealth in this direction. We 'hope to be able to send the best of them each year to actual schools of training, such as are provided in connection with the military manoeuvres in India and in the Mother Country. In this way our officers will be' brought into association and, in a sense, into competition with highly-trained officers in other parts of thc: Empire, whilst at the same time we shall be receiving officers from India, Canada, and the United Kingdom, who will criticise us and give us the benefit of their training. We shall learnfrom them, as we hope they will be able to learn something from -us. the status of the militia. ferring is devised for the purpose of raising the status of the militia. It is upon our citizen soldiery and our citizen officers that we must rely. We recognise that we ought not only to raise the status of our officer abroad, but that we must raise him in the estimation of those whom he commands, and of those with whom he is allied. We qualify him to achieve this end by putting him in training side by side with the best officers of the British Government in India and elsewhere. We hope in this way to establish a high standard to .which our citizens in arms inlay be encouraged to aspire. The object of these proposals is to give effect to that well-worn aphorism of Bonaparte, that every soldier should feel himself carrying a marshal's baton in his knapsack. In pursuance of the same end. That system is likelv to we propose to take certain steps which will remove the artificial distinctions occasionally created. We shall want for our officers the best men we can find-men with the capacity for command, with a taste' for military study ancl exercises, and with ability quite independently of the class in which they are found. We wish these men to have the opportunity of rising to the highest positions we can give them in our National Guard. anticipating my motion. aware that at present when any one points to a desirable standard as an ideal, one is at once accused of becoming millennial. It is better to take a high standard than a low one. Many of the heroes of history who have set the highest possible standard for themselves have expected least from their fellows. When we aim at setting a high national standard in this way we are not insinuating that, by the introduction of this scheme, we are going to transform the nature of the people of Australia. Speaking for myself, I am content to trust the Australian people. I believe that they are not only fitted to serve, but to command, and to rival in the arts of war, so f ar as these can be practised in times of peace, any of like experience against whom they may be pitted. When we have secured a National Guard without a distinction of class, wealth, or position, we hope that interest in our system of military training and the ambitionf o r proficiency in its several branches will, to some extent, take the place of those sports on which our young T h is system of transpeople look and speculate every Saturday without otherwise participating in them. In one of his most stirring sketches, Kipling dreams of 'a time when military training will be-regarded as the most fascinating of sports.

I am wellthan locking on at less educational forms of competition, we shall soon see our military and naval duties undertaken cheerfully and carried on under the same conditions' of popular interest and approbation as apply in the case of sports and games. I know of no spirit which has such an influence on the English race as this spirit of competition. The clippings from the English newspapers which come to me every week contain at present, in most cases, only about an inch of matter relating to important Australian occurrences, as compared with about a foot of cablegrams devoted to the cricket matches of the English team now in this country. That, I imagine, is largely because .of the element of competition, when batsmen and bowler are pitted against each other. There is no reason why we should not stimulate a similar interest in forms of military prowess, as is at present felt in regard to outdoor sports. gate money ! that of clubs or players, not of the thousands of spectators who pay, but do not receive. established, at which the interest of our officers will be stimulated as far as possible by the higher forms of teaching. Special attention is to be given to staff rides and local experience, the operations being in the nature of actual service in the field. What we desire to reduce is the slow shooting at fixed targets under conditions which never obtain in actual warfare. In the same way, we want to substitute for parade drill, marching and evolutions in difficult and broken country, so that our troops may know how to use its features, and so as to enable the higher officers to control together artillery, cavalry, and infantry over country known only by maps qr reconnaissance. our present officers have been tested in this way ? I know some of the best have been thoroughly disheartened for want of opportunities of the kind which they have long been seeking. We have already taken the fullest advantage of the lectures of Colonel Foster, Professor of Military Science in the University of Sydney. most admirable work, he is doing it still, and for his assistance we are most grateful. Arrangements are' being made for specially selected militia officers to take advantage of his course of lectures, ' and a special course has just been completed to meet the wishes of militia officers who were not able to participate in the previous classes. That shows how the spirit to which we wish to appeal-the spirit of individual interest, individual initiative and pride in the service of the countrymay be spread. One of the many important features of the Conference ire dane, as head of the British Army, laid before us, when he invited us to send our officers to the General Staff, there to be received as comrades, to be shown the whole of the operations of what is often termed the brain of the Army, to be tried by being placed in positions of command, and to have thrown open to them for their benefit everything that was being done. That was a most generous offer. In the same way, we hope to establish a General Staff of our own to which the British Government will send its officers to observe what we are doing, to learn something of operations in vast areas of sparsely The interest there is settled country which they cannot expect to find in Europe, and also to give us the benefit of their knowledge and advice. It Instructional schools are to be is by keeping in touch with the Army, as well as with the Navy, that we hope to keep up the standard, the spirit, and the efficiency to which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has been alluding. Their officers will inspect and report on us, our officers will inspect and report on the Canadian Force, the South African Force, and the Indian Force. By that means we hope to materially benefit. An Intelligence Corps has just been formed, which will prepare the plans, statistics and general information. required for operations in any part of the Commonwealth. They will utilize militia officers and citizens, such as surveyors and engineers, who will bring to the aid of the How many of Department the experience and knowledge gained in their ordinary vocations.

They will then feel that their knowledge is being utilized, and will be encouraged to extend it . It will create a better feeling between the various branches of the service, and will be valuable to militia officers, who can then learn the difficulties that surround central administration, of which at present they have least appreciation. serve is being established in which large additions will be made to those who are at present enrolled. In this regard many medical men, medical students, chemists, and citizens willing to be connected with the Ambulance Corps are ready to assist by undergoing the necessary training if an opportunity is given. These and similar opportunities will now be multiplied, to a larger extent, under our new system. When we have established a thoroughly citizen force, it will remain for Parliament to recognise the service rendered. We believe that after the system is fully in operation, both Commonwealth and the States may be fairly asked to give precedence to men who have clone service in the ranksall must do that-wh o have clone it well, with energy and ability.

All these things are possible when once we have created a citizen force in which every settlement and town, every family ancl class is interested, and from which no one is or can be excluded.
