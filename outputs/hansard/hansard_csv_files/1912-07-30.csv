These are some of the headings of the press reports: ""Military Mix Up,"" ""Military Muddle,"" ""Trouble at Sydney."" The matter has already engaged the attention of the House; and the honourable member for South Sydney and a senator have brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence the position of the Garrison Artillery. This branch of the service has. been under a militia officer, but is about to be put under a permanent officer. Together with these two gentlemen, I have endeavoured to get the Minister to delay action in the matter. ber is now going beyond a question. love of alliteration is greater than the desire for correctness on the part of the newspapers. With regard to the statements in this morning's newspapers, the Minister informs me that they are excessive and misleading. He has communicated with the authorities in Sydney, who say that there have been no resignations from the Garrison Artillery, as alleged; but a report has been called for, and will be made available at the earliest moment.' the Government to disband part .of the Australian Garrison Artillery; and, if so, will the Wollongong force be disbanded ? any intention to disband any part of the Australian Garrison Artillery. the table the Ordinance to which the Garrison Artillery have objected, and which has caused all the trouble? igi2.",14,Setup

Is the Commonwealth Government consulted by the Imperial Government in regard to such Empire matters as the foregoing? honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. In 1907 an agreement was made that the export of opium from India to China should be decreased by one-tenth annually subject jifter the year 1910, to proof that China was carrying out its share of the arrangement by which the manufacture of locally-produced opium was to be periodically reduced: In 1910 a further agreement was signed, confirming the previous arrangement for periodical reduction, and providing that Great Britain would stop the export of opium to China at iin earlier date, if it is shown that China has ceased producing native opium. 2. This Government has no knowledge regarding such appeals if they exist. 3. This Government have no advice on the subject, but inquiries are being made. 4. The Commonwealth Government were not consulted regarding the foregoing matters, but there is no reason to believe that the Imperial Government will f a i l to consult the Government of the Commonwealth in any cases where Commonwealth interests are concerned.

There is nothing to prevent a comparison of rolls being made at a later stage, and, as a matter of fact, a considerable number of selected rolls were compared after the 1906 and 1910 elections without disclosing any fraudulent voting of the character indicated. 2. It is considered that the comparison of certified rolls throughout the Commonwealth prior to the declaration of the polls, as suggested, would not be of any value, inasmuch as all electors are questioned at the booths; and it is would vote more than once in his own name or would select the name of a person who could himself vote.

If the honourable member will inform me of any case in which this rule is not observed instructions will be given to rectify the matter. General, upon notice1.

Is it true that, prior to Federation, postmasters had at their command all practical or skilled officials? 3. W ill the Postmaster-General endeavour to provide all post and telegraph offices with a f u l l staff? honourable member's questions are:1. Not as a general rule, but in some cases it is not possible to avoid the employment of unskilled or temporary hands. 2. I am not aware of ihe actual conditions in that respect prior to Federation, but I very much doubt that they were as suggested in this question. 3Yes. That the report be now adopted. looked through this Bill within the last hour, and should like to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to some points that have occurred to me. Although it has been amended, it is still a very drastic, severe and exceptional measure. It is O'MALLEY -Yes. to be regretted, in the first place, that the draftsman did not adhere to the same terminology when dealing with the same matters. We have, for instance, struck out of section 2 of the Act the words "" material IN MECHANICAL BRANCH : to the subject-matter of the inquiry."" ness to attend and produce books, as the clause would have stood without further amendment, a witness would have to attend on getting a summons, and could not plead that the books he was asked to produce were not material to the subject of the inquiry. We have amended that provision by increasing the penalty to ,£500, with an additional penalty of ,£500 for each repetition of the offence. In the proposed new section 4A providing that it shall be a defence to a charge under the section that the documents, books, or writings were not relevant to the subject of the inquiry, we have made an amendment striking out the word "" material,"" and inserting the word ""relevant"" in relation to the same matter. We have drawn a distinction clearly for the purpose of this Bill between the words "" material "" and "" relevant."" Again, when the word "" relevant "" occurs only in relation to the nonthe Postmasterproduction of documents, it does not qualify section 6 of this Act. Under section 6 of the Act a witness must answer a question whether it is relevant or not. He may under the amendment of section 5 to which I have referred refuse to produce documents which are not relevant to the inquiry. But the words used in section 6 of the Act as a protection to the witness are that the question put must touch "" the subject-matter of the inquiry."" It is rather a pity that we do not adhere to the same term. If "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry "" is synonymous with "" relevant,"" why is not the same",19,Electoral Divisions Queensland And Western Australia

68,Mr Glynn (Angas) [3.30],"I haveterm used in both cases? confusing to a Court when two attempts are made to clearly' express the legislative intent. two clauses we should use the same word to express it. That is not done in this Bill, and I should like the Attorney-General, if the same thing is not meant here, to tell us what is the shade of difference between "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry"" and ""relevant."" I note that later on the word "" material "" reappears.' In the proposed new section 6H it is provided that a witness who knowingly gives false testimony touching any matter "" material "" to an inquiry by a Royal Commission shall be guilty of an offence. I think the word "" material "" is the correct word to use in this case, because no man ought to. be convicted of perjury for evidence which, though relevant, is not also material to' an inquiry. case be some more substantial relation to the object of the inquiry than the word ""relevant"" would convey. this position : We have struck out the word "" material "" in one case, and have used the word "" relevant "" instead, contra-distinguishing the two words. Then we have used as evidently synonymous' the words "" touching the subject-matter of the inquiry "" in another proposed section, and later we go back again in proposed new section 6H to the use of the word "" material,"" in which case I think the word is correctly used. There is another matter which was suggested to me by an observation made by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and to which I should incidentally like to call attention. In the proposed new section 4A we provide that the defence of relevancy may be raised on an information being laid for the nonproduction of documents. But what about privilege? witness might be convicted, but it might also be privileged. In a Court of law the two things are considered quite different. understand that in my reading of this Bill we are giving far greater powers in the light of evidence, and in the light of contempt to this tribunal, a Royal Commission, than are vested in the High Court of Australia. gentleman say that penalties cannot be have to deal with the matter of arrest for imposed in the case of a witness who renot being in attendance. In the course fuses to answer relevant questions'? Mr Glynn. unless "" touching the subject-matter of an inquiry "" means"" the same thing as "" releI f we mean the same thing in vant,"" then a penalty could be imposed, though the question was not relevant. gentleman suppose that it means? not the draftsman! of the Bill. Why use different terms? Why put the Court in such a position ? If the terms used in one case, are comprehensive of one's meaning, and their denotation and connotation are clear and unequivocal, they should be adhered to. I do not wish to split hairs about the meaning of these terms. The point as regards privilege is this : I quote from Halsbury's Laws of .England, vol. XIII . , page 570A witness though compelled generally to give evidence may in certain cases claim priviThere should in such a lege as a ground for refusing to disclose matter which is relevant to the issue. In other words, it might be relevant, and We are in a man might be convicted; still in a Court of justice he could refuse to make certain disclosures. WhatI wish to know is whether that is preserved under this Bill. It should be preserved by sub-section 2 of section 7 of the Act, which saysEvery witness summoned to attend or appearing before the Commission shall have the same protection, and shall in addition to the penalties provided by this Act be subject to the same liabilities in any civil or criminal proceeding, as a witness in any case tried in the High Court. That may give a witness the privilege I speak of, but' I doubt it. ' The' doubt raised in my mind by the suggestion of Ihe honourable member for Darling Downs is that our amendment of this Bill may qualify that section. One privilege, for instance, is the privilege of the Crown. That was asserted in a Court of justice It might be relevant, and a only the other day in connection with the wireless telegraphy case. It has sometimes been held that the Crown, by merely the expression of a desire not to produce certain documents because they are public I wish honourable members to property, may refuse to produce them. That matter is still sub judice, but it was asserted in a Court of justice as one of the privileges of the Crown. If privilege is affected by this Bill the question, is, how far are the privileges of the Crown abrogated by it? I merely moot the question in order to give the honourable an opportunity to consider it. I now of the discussion in Committee we pointed",20,Leave Unskille D Men In In Connexion With The Summons To A Wit

72,Mr Glynn,"I do not know. I am.out that a witness ought to be protected by having his expenses tendered; and we urged that, if the expenses are not tendered, the Chairman ought not to be allowed to arbitrarily commit a man. magistrate ought not to be allowed, as he is uncier the B ill , to order the police to break into any place; not, be it remembered, the witness' residence, but any place where he may be. and everything have to give way before the policeman, who can go into any person's house and arrest a man whose offence is that though lie has not been tendered his expenses, he may not have a cent to carry him it may be 2 miles, not to speak of 200 miles, in order to attend a Royal Commission. to go to gaol, and remain there so long as the President or Chairman desires. The President or Chairman is the only person who can release a man so imprisoned, because, so far as I can see, there is no power to appoint a deputy. This is a matter of drafting, but it might prove to the man affected a matter of substance. .The rule of law in regard to witnesses is that if a witness in a civil case has been regularly served with a subpoena, and has had his expenses tendered to him, or has had them tendered within a reasonable time, and does not attend at the trial or proceeding, or attends and refuses to give evidence, he may be attached for the contempt, or an action will lie against him at the suit of the party concerned. it is provided that a man may not be arrested for contempt and punished unless the person asking him to attend tenders his expenses. There can be no harm in tendering the travelling expenses beforehand. Something might be said in favour of not tendering a witness his expenses for attendance ; and in this connection I drew a distinction when we were in Committee. It cannot be ascertained what the attendance expenses will amount to until the number of days is known, but we may know what fhe travelling expenses ought to be; and it would not be burdensome on the Crown, represented by the President or any part of the Commission, to tender tlie expenses. a witness to travel 200 miles without tendering the expenses? are many insane things done hy sane men; and I may say that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court does not, perhaps cannot, 'always act with perfect fairness in this connection. That Court, I know, is marked, not only by the ability, but by the great industry of its President; but I think witnesses, or persons summoned to A police conferences, are, or have been, summoned long distances without being tendered their expenses, and the only protective provision is a similar one to that contained in this B ill . After the event, the Locks, keys, bolts, payment of the expenses is very little satisfaction to a poor man, because, if he does not attend, he is arrested under a Royal warrant. wait for his expenses after the event? Such a witness may. have in cases, in the criminal Courts, men have to go cap in hand to ask for their expenses. As representatives of the public, we ought to have a very exalted idea of the dignity of the subject, no matter how humble his position may be. I do not even like the terminology of the clause. Perhaps because of the amendment-made, a witness has to report himself from time to time to the President, just as if he were on deket-of-leave. It ought to have been provided that the President might excuse a man for a particular time; but, as the Bill stands, a witness cannot be released from attendance by the President until he is done with altogether. This, again, is a matter of drafting, but to the man arraigned it may be a matter In other words, of substance. The clause dealing with contempt is very severe. It is aimed at criticism; it may be that of a writer in a newspaper. Any of our constituents may have a perfect right to challenge the actions of a Royal Commission, and any one. who exercises that right, either as a leader-writer or as an ordinary newspaper correspondent must, like every other citizen, take the risk of being sued for libel at the suit of the person whose character may be impugned, or as the Bill says, may be the subject of "" false and defamatory "" attack. poor man to get justice, especially when he comes against a wealthy corporation. does not always act with that ideal smoothness we should like, but it does not follow that we ought to make our laws unI n these matters, there just and harsh.

78,Mr Glynn,"I am sorry that justicebut it would be an extraordinary thing, if because a poor man, from his position, is denied justice, and because blind and arrogant capital may sometimes place diffidiction. In fact, County Courts in Engculties in his way, we should endeavour to i debar any section of citizens from obtaining I do not know whether is has been passed justice. This is a very drastic clause, and I believe an unnecessary one, seeing that there is the ordinary law as a protection to members of Royal Commissions. We shall, however, have to make the best of the Bill as we have it. I should like to know whether, seeing that we have made this contempt a penal offence punishable with a fine of £100 or three months' imprisonment, cumulative on repeated offences until the fines may run into many thousands of pounds, we have taken away the right of action from the person impugned. The Bill is not clear on this point; and some day or other, a member of a Royal Commission who has been virulently attacked and deprived of that which is the dearest to him in life, will wish to know whether he is to be satisfied with the penalties imposed under the Bill. I desire some information on the point, merely that the drafting may be made clear. The penalties are very severe, and in some cases it may be that they should be so. It is useless to impose a fine of £50 on a man who can command £6,000 or .£7,000 as readily as another person can command £1 ; and I can understand that the penalties might, to a large extent, and also, I believe, in Imperial patriothave some relation to the competence of a man to pay them. But under this Bill, no matter what the offence may Le, a pretty heavy penalty may be imposed. It may be said that it is only a maximum : but one thing we must avoid is disparity and inequality in treatment under similar circumstances. that one tribunal should have a lack of guidance from the Legislature-a lack of guidance to which the President of the Arb'tration Court very properly called attention, when, in administering the Excise Tariff Act, he said that he had not received with what was relevant. The case came any guidance from the Legislature, although, I think, on the whole, he struck a very healthy rule out of his own inner consciousness. We ought,. as far as possible, to help our tribunals. answer to the severity of the penalty to say that it is only a maximum one. In England they prescribe very carefully the rights of citizens in these matters. There a County Court has jurisdiction up to about £500, and has now,' I think, some equitMr Glynn. able jurisdiction too; in South Australia a County or Local Court has jurisdiction up to .£495, and a very large general jurisland, uncier the Bill of Lord Loreburnyet-bi d fair to supersede the Supreme Courts in certain cases, certainly on circuit, and, to a large extent, even in London, affording speedier, more convenient, and cheaper justice, a tendency in which we have, to some extent, set a good example, because I think that we preceded England in this respect, and in which I hope, subsequently, we may afford a still better lead. Here is the position in England in regard to the penalties taken from Phipson's last work on the Law of EvidenceFailure to attend, or refusal to give evidence or produce documents, in pursuance of a County Court summons, subjects the witness to such penalty, not exceeding £10Here it is £500as the Judge may think proper. Obedience to a magistrate's or justice's summons is enforceable by warrant; and if the witness refuses to be sworn, or to answer, he may be committed for not more than seven days. Here he may get a year, and the punishment is cumulative. I regret if that is to be our type of jurisprudence in this democracy, which ought to be a prototype to British communities, because we lead in many things in energy, spirit, and outlook, ism. I hope that ih these matters the punitive justice which marks the morale of a nation above all other things, we are not to retrograde. Coming to the principles of Royal Commissions, I remember that an article on Royal Commissions, and particularly on the case of Clough v. It is a great shame Leahy cited by the Attorney-General, was written in 1905 by Mr Pitt Cobbett, who is, I think, one of the leading constitutional writers in Australia. In Clough v. Leahy the High Court did not state what the prime facts were, because it only dealt before the High Court on an application for prohibition to prevent the enforcement of a penalty, of £ 2 0 on witnesses who refused to answer questions which they It is no thought were protected by the provisions of the Act of 1901, which, they said, were ignored by the Commission. To show honourable members that statutory protection may at times be futile, I will explain the case. There was a dispute between two unions, the Machine Shearers and Shed Employes Union and the Australian Workers Union, as to the registration under the State Arbitration Act of the Machine Shearers Union. Several attacks were made by the Australian Workers Union on the registration, but nell, the general secretary of the Australian Workers Union, was also a member of the Legislative Assembly, and, after he had failed in the Courts of Justice to displace a rival union, he moved for the appointment of a Select Committee, of which, I suppose, he was chairman, and whose other members were named by him. Let us see how far these ideas of Royal Commissions may lead us. We have a very drastic Act, and the only protection I can see outside its provisions, which are inadequate, is the class of men who are put on Royal Commissions,-the fact that we do not prostitute them for political purposes. The first thing in the case to which I refer was the appointment of a Select Committee, and as it was thought that the powers of scrutiny ancl inspection were not sufficient it was converted into a Royal Commission, of sident. Mr Pitt Cobbett wroteThe whole proceeding, however, was_ so clearly a violation of the principle that neither pointment of a Royal Commission. This ComIn a judicial, nor even in quasi-judicial proceeding, such as the present, ought a person to be made a judge in a cause in ' which he is interested, that in common decency this Commission was cancelled; and on the ist December, 1903, a new Commission was prepared. I think that three or four commissioners were appointed before they could settle down to appoint what they considered would be a proper Commission. I will go back and see what a dispassionate lawyer had to say on its appointmentIn the second place, it possesses an interest uf another kind, inasmuch as the facts before the Court reflect only too well certain phases f OUT political life , which are not altogether to our credit. I shall not trouble honourable members by dealing with the points of law which he raised, but he did to some extent question the decision of the High Court At all events, he regretted that they did not afford a sufficiently clear guidance as to what would be an interference with a judicial inquiry. That case shows honourable members that even the highest tribunal in the land may appear to fall short of giving that measure of protection to a witness which we here desire and acknowledge is necessary to protect him against this too [So] stringent Act. Mr Pitt Cobbett thought it was an interference with judicial inquiry, and he saidBut on the all important question of interference with the administration of justice, the judgment appears to us to be somewhat vague and inconclusive. It was said, for instance, to be impossible to draw any line beyond which such an inquiry might be unlawful;' whilst the Court refused even to contemplate the possibility of a Commission being issued having for its object an interference with justice. 1 will now give a summary of the whole business, because Mr Cobbett's words are perhaps clearer than mine would b'eFinally, on a review of the facts, it is somewhat difficult to resist the conclusion that there was in this case an attempt both on the part of those who procured the appointment of the Commission, and those who proposed to act under it, to interfere with the administration of justice., sufficient to bring it within the rule laid down by the High Court-that "" if any one purporting to act under such a Commission were to seek to interfere with the course of justice, such action would be preventible and punishable."" The facts which lead to this conclusion are these : One of two litigants, having failed, so far, in his proceedings in the Arbitration Court, but having not yet exhausted his remedies there, and it being still open to him to proceed in that Court, abandons them for the time being; and, having behind him the influence of a political party on which the Government in power was practically dependent for its continuance in office, procures the apmission was appointed nominally "" to inquire,"" but two of the questions submitted for inquiry were questions which had been-and might again come-befor e the Arbitration Court. Add to this the extraordinary powers of inspection and of visitation with which the Letters Patent purported to invest the Commission. Add to this the fact that those acting under the Commission actually took steps toward getting at evidence which would otherwise have been privileged from discovery; including confidential communications, which had passed between the other litigant and his legal advisers-evidenc e which it is submitted would not have been a proper subject of discovery even under the provisions of section 26, sub-section (M), of the Industrial Arbitration Act itself. Such evidence, however, if it had been obtained, might subsequently have been used as a new fact OT new ground of proceeding in the Arbitration Court. I shall not weary honourable members by reading to the end of the passage, because I have trespassed longer on their attention than I intended, but I shall finally call their attention to the dictum of an English Judge upon Commissions of Inquiry. I wish that we only had time to look up Macaulay and a few other writers on the arbitrary proceedings of Commissions before we proceed to put on our statute-book legislation of this kind. Such legislation is becoming too frequent. I honestly and sincerely commend the",22,Leave Unskille D Men In In Connexion With The Summons To A Wit

80,Which Mr Mcdonnell Was Made The Pre,"motives that inspired those who introduced the Bill, but I think that they are mistaken in some of their methods. Cobbett calls attention in the following note to the judgment of the Chief Justice in the Lower Court, where the decision was contrary to the opinion of the High CourtThe judgment of the Chief Justice presents in some respects a close analogy to the memorable judgment of Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington (19 St. Tr. 1030). There the question was as to the' legality of a general warrant issued by the Secretary of State for the seizure of the papers of the author of an alleged seditious libel. On the question of the legality of such warrant Lord Camden observed, "" This, though it is not the most difficult, is the most interesting question in the cause; because if this point should be determined in favour of the jurisdiction, the secret cabinets and bureaus about several changes. The Royal Comof every subject will be thrown open to the inspection of a messenger, whenever the Secretary of State shall think fit to charge or even to suspect a person to be the author, printer, dr publisher of a seditious libel."" In relation to the present case, and in view of the powers of inspection and visitation which the Letters Patent purported to bestow under the Act, one might perhaps predict a similar result ""whenever the exigencies of party politics are such as to induce a Government in power to issue a Commission of Inquiry."" That was said of an Act which is mild compared with this. VVe should hesitate about placing, this punitive legislation on the' statute-book. fo register my opinions concerning the measure before the adoption of the report. I realjze the strength'. of many of the statements of the Opposition, to the effect that the measure may beturned against labour organizations and' industrial movements, and that very great powers are being given .to men who may not have beenaccustomed to the exercise of such . powers; but, on the other hand, we are faced with the fiact that there are' growing up in .bur midst huge concerns which are apparently beyond the reach of the law, and defy all existing methods for bringing them into line with public opinion. Apparently they cannot be attacked by any ordinary process. that some special means of investigation be adopted, so that we may ascertain how we stand. allowed to live for. themselves alone. They live upon the community, but surely the rights of the community are greater than those of any corporation within it. I was interested to read this morning an article in the Age regarding the Melbourne Gas -Company-. Apparently there is no way of dealing with that concern except under special legislation. Either the functions Professor Pitt of government must be extended beyond the bounds of which I would approve, or what is now proposed must be done. VVe may be taking drastic measures, but they are necessary to cope with the corporations which ignore the public weal. I am prepared to experiment in the manner proposed by the Attorney-General. The. importance of the measure justifies a few remarks at this stage, with a view to influencing the Attorney-General to add to it yet further safeguards. At each stage the Opposition has pointed out the defects of the measure with a view to their amendment, and our criticism has brought missions Act of 1902 provides that the summons to produce books, documents, or writings must be limited to those material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. The Bill as introduced removed that limitation: It was pointed out that, as the result,the only limitation was by implication to be obtained from the scope of the Commission. VVe pointed out that there was adequate protection, and that under the Bill as introduced witnesses might be summoned to produce books, documents, and papers of every description, whethe* material to the inquiry or not. In deference to that criticism, the Attorney General inserted an amendment providing that I t shall be a defence to a prosecution under this section for failing without reasonable excuse to Droduce any documents, books, or writings if the defendant proves that the documents, books, dr writing were not relevant to the inquiry. That protects the witness to some extent, because it allows him to raise the defence, "" I did not produce the books asked for, because their contents were not relevant to the. inquiry."" .. The Attorney-General says that he has shifted the onus of proof, but he has certainly given some protection. Another objection taken was that witnesses It is clearly necessary, therefore, had np protection regarding the questions that might be asked of them. To meet that criticism, the Attorney-General has These concerns cannot be provided thatA statement or disclosure made by any witness in answer to any question put. to him by a Royal Commission, or any of the Commissioners, shall not.

Now, it is only when an information has been laid by a responsible member of the Government that the penalties under this clause ajjply. We pointed out that the Bill, as introduced, gave unlimited power to copy extracts from books, and the Attorney General subsequently accepted an amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton, providing that the copies must be of matters relevant to the inquiry. The Attorney-General also made a promise to do something in regard to the expenses of witnesses. Any person served with a summons to attend who fails without reasonable excuse to do so is liable to a penalty of £500, and the Attorney-General promised that in framing regulations dealing with expenses he would provide for the payment of expenses. He saidThe suggestion is that the payment shall be made in advance; and, while there are circumstances in which that might properly be done, it. would, in my opinion, be fatal to the usefultection, and shall. in addition to the penalties ness and effectiveness of the measure if it were compulsory in every case. I assure the honourable member that section 8 of thc Act will be given effect to; and that is as far as we ought to be asked to go. I take it that he will provide by regulation that in every case where a witness is summoned from a long distance expenses will be tendered to him to enable him to comply with the demand of the Commission.

Commissions control their own proceedings) but witnesses are bound to answer all questions under pain of such enormous penalties that the honourable gentleman should consider the advisability of providing for their protection by preventing the publication in newspapers of reports of matters which should not be published. It is a fair safeguard for the witness. power already. General to consider that point in accordance with his promise. I also wish to ask whether we have not under this Bill failed to provide those precautions which are granted to a witness when he appears in a Court of law. Section7 of the Principal Act provides thatEvery witness summoned to attend or appear before a Commission shall have the same proprovided by this Act be subject to the same liabilities in any civil or criminal proceeding, as a witness in any case tried in the High Court. Then this Bill provides that a witness shall answer every question put to him, but that a statement or disclosure made by him shall not be given in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings. That raises the question whether a witness is afforded proper protection under section 7. When a witness gives evidence in a Court of law, and a question is put to him, he may say, "" I decline to answer that question, because,if I do, my answer may subject me to criminal proceedings.""

Here, however, judging from the remarks of one or two honourable members opposite, it is intended that a Royal Commission shall be a body established for the purpose of instihonorable member for Darling Downs in tuting prosecutions, instead of pursuing, in regard to the position of witnesses were vestigations. be so. The object of an inquiry by a Royal Commission is that it shall investigate such matters as the effect of legislation or administration. liament wants to know. which Parliament wants to know, because, I am afraid that we may have very inquisitive Houses. A Royal Commission should investigate anything which Parliament wants to know relative to the due performance of functions intrusted to it. Royal Commissions might also investigate the operation of any law. If , for instance, it is found that there is something deficient in the administration of Customs, it would be justifiable to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the conduct of Customs officers. But I am afraid that honourable members opposite have it at the back of their minds that this measure is to be directed as an instrument against any persons in the community, and be used as an aid to criminal proceedings. If that is to be done, it will the Act as it now stands, a witness be opposed to the very purposes of a Royal Commission, and will set up small Starchamber tribunals, which are likely to do great harm to the welfare of Australia. neg-General) [4.28] -Honorabl e members opposite have, as it were, opened up the whole subject again. I do not propose to follow them, but one or two statements call for a reply. A point has been raised by the honourable member for Angas regarding the same intent being set forth in different words in various clauses. The subject-matter of the inquiry,"" "" material to the inquiry,"" and matters "" relevant to the inquiry "" are phrases used to connote the same meaning. I do not think' that the point is at all important. There can be no possible doubt as to what the words used in each case mean. However, I am< quite willing that the phrase "" relevant to the inquiry "" shall be used throughout. There cannot be the slightest objection to that, but it does not make any difference. "" Touching the subject-matter of the inquiry"" and ""material to the inquiry"" are exactly the same as "" relevant to the inquiry."" A number of statements made by the so completely foreign to the attitude taken so? up by him when he introduced the Parliamentary Witnesses Billa measure for which I can never sufficiently thank himthat I utterly fail to understand them. that Bill that any person who declined to answer questions, interrupted or disturbed a Committee, used insulting language towards a Committee, or did anything in contempt of a Committee, should be guilty of an offence, and thatA person convicted of an offence against this Act shall, if no higher penalty is provided, be punishable as follows :(a) If convicted on indictment, by imprison' ment not exceeding one year or by a penalty not exceeding Two hundred pounds : (*) If convicted by a court of summary jurisdiction, by imprisonment not exceeding six months or by a penalty not exceeding One hundred pounds When the principal Act and the honourable gentleman's Bill were before the House, there was not the slightest hint at any of these frightful difficulties with which a witness was going to find himself confronted. But what are the facts? Under finds himself in exactly the same position as a witness in a Court of law. He has to answer all questions put to him, or to put up with the consequences. The honourable member for Darling Downs objected when I read section 123 of the Crimes Act of Queensland, but he did not hesitate to read section 79 of the Justices Act of Queensland, relating to proceedings before a justice of the peace. A witness certainly needs all the protection he can get when before some justices of the peace, but the position of a witness before a Royal Commission of inquiry is altogether different.,",27,Leave Unskille D Men In In Connexion With The Summons To A Wit

Notwithstanding what the honourable member has said, the protection provided by section 7 of the Act is not taken away by any amendment made by this Bill. An interesting commentary on the attitude of our honourable friends opposite is furnished by reference to the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1909, which was introduced by the honourable member for Angas. Under that' Act, it is provided that any person who declines to answer any interrogatories put to him shall be guilty of an offence and punished. Any person who declines to answer any question put tb him under the Act, as amended by the honourable member, is liable to a penalty of £100. In that case, no limitation whatever to the scope of the question -that may be put is proposed.

Government after Government during the last ten years have tried to secure the passing of that Bill, but have-never been able to convince this House that it ought to be made the law of the land.

The Kalgoorlie electorate, represented by the Postmaster-General, under the arrangement proposed by the Commissioners, will have 3,640 electors above the quota. It is to have 34,031"" electors, but that number will still be 2,438 below the maximum allowed by law. In the period of two and a half years, which I take for comparison because it is that time since a previous report of this kind was submitted to this House, the electors of Western Australia have increased by 9,083. The number in the Perth division has increased by 5,564, in the Fremantle division by 2,986, and in the Swan division by 7,981, or a total increase in these three divisions of 16,471 electors. Coolgardie division has, in the same period, been reduced by 5,986, and in the Kalgoorlie division by 1,402, a total reduction of 7,388, leaving, as I have just said, a total increase in the number of electors in the State of 9,083. It is interesting from my point of view, though it . may not appear so to the honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, that there are two members of this House representing those electorates with a total of 44,432 electors, whilst I , as the member for Swan, with a total of 48,997 electors, have only one vote as against the two votes which may be recorded by the honourable members referred to. I represent 4,565 more electors than do the two honourable members to whom I have referred put together, and on the principle about which we hear a good deal from opposite, of one-vote-one-value, I should have, as much voting power in this House as both the honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie.

There are also the Swan River, the Avon, the Canning, the Moore, the Irwin, the Greenough, the Chapman, and the Murchison, all conmected with the early Swan River settle-ment.

Why should we not have a name associated with these places? I have several names I shall suggest to honourable ^members as suitable. First there is "" Leschenault,"" after the early naturalist.

Then there is ""Stirling,"" after the first Governor, and a name that has been given to one of the -finest ranges of hills in the country; """".Gregory,"" after the two early dis-tingui'shed explorers; and "" Australind,"" and "" Leeuwin."" -would be appropriate to the south-west -corner of Australia. We may be asked what is in a name, but when we are about the business we might as well have an appropriate one. that some of the native names are much too long for the purpose.

C. Kingston, in regard to the Parliament interfering with the work of Commissioners in arranging electoral divisions. August, J903, he said, at page 3734 of HansardI know the mischief which results when members of Parliament are called upon to apply themselves individually to questions of this kind. Naturally, to a great extent, they lose sight of the principle underlying them, and pay regard to how they themselves may.possibly be affected. On the next page he said to honourable membersKeep the Parliament free from this question as much as you can, and you will get better results from impartial officers. On the 18th August, 1903, the present Attorney-General saidThe Commissioners are placed in a position outside the arena of politics, and their duty is to distribute the electorates under such conditions as will enable politicians to fairly appeal on the part of the Legislature of giving to a l l to the country. It would be a lamentable thing if politicians were allowed to divide the State into electorates to suit themselves. I would ask the honourable member, if he were here, whether he will say this to his supporters, and especially to the honourable member for Coolgardie. Then we have the honourable member for Gwydir. I wish he was here, because he rather poses as be ng always right. I shall read what he ; said on the 23 rd November, 1909, in regard to the arrangement of electorates by Commissioners. Speaking in the fulness f his indignation-honorabl e members know how he does it arable member's time has expired. rather to be regretted that the honourable member for Swan should have thrown so much party feeling into this discussion, particularly when we remember wnat took place three years ago when the last redistribution scheme was before us. On that occasion the then Prime Minister put the position, to my mind, very clearly, as far as members of Parliament are concerned. He saidI rose to point out the fact that from the very first the Parliament has claimed a free hand in dealing with redistributions. It has left each decision to the individual conscience and judgment of honourable members. It has left each member to shoulder his own responsibility. On that occasion they decided to follow that course. The right honourable member for Swan, I think, took up the right position on that occasion. He saidI feel justified in saying that the arrangement of the electorates by the Commissioner, a man I respect, and have a regard for, does, not commend itself to my judgment. I do not Speaking on the 18th consider it is a good arrangement, and for that reason, if it goes to a division, I shall vote against it. That seems to be a matter of common sense. I have no personal or party interest to serve. My objection to the scheme is based on the reason which the Commissioners have given in their report. They sayThe Commissioners are of opinion that their first and foremost duty is to submit such recommendations as will secure in each of the proposed Divisions the nearest approach to .e >k, quota of enrolment at the time of the impending general elections in 1912. The Commissioners also consider themselves justifica in assuming that the provision contained in "" The Commonwealth Electoral Act "" for the creation of Divisions of equal electoral strength-o r as near thereto as circumstances will admit-in dicates an underlying principle and a desire votes, so far as possible, an equal value. Yet they set to work to divide the electorates according to what in their opinion will be their state in the impending general election in 1912. So far as 1 know there is not a general election impending in 1912; that is the first blunder that they made. If the Victorian Commissioners had been allowed to act on guess-work, this State would not have lost a member, her population at the present time entitling her to the full number given under the last distribution. The Victorian Commissioners, however, felt themselves bound to work with the figures obtained by the last collection of the census. Apparently, the Western Australian Commissioners did not consider themselves bound in the same way.",35,Electoral Divisions Western Australia

The difference between the populations of the proposed divisions is even greater than in Victoria, where the population is denser. I have already protested against the wiping out of two Victorian electorates.

Thus the difference tion by men who have ventured to be prophets is an infamy on the escutcheon of Australia.,and I shall, therefore, vote against the adoption of the report. tributions of electoral divisions have been before the House, there has been more or nounced dissatisfaction, but when it was anthat instead of one, we were to Commissioners, I , in common their report carefully will see in it eviperform their task thoroughly and impar-. tially.

They have proceeded absolutely in accordance with the law, and in no case have they ignored official facts and figures. the population of the States will be at a future date. ber gave the House to understand that the Commissioners assigned to one division a number largely in excess of the quota, while the others have assigned to them numbers much below. It is a fact that the "" D "" electorate has assigned to it a number 3,640 in excess of the quota, though that is little more than half the margin allowed by law. The Commissioners state their reasons for this allotment. They point out that the population of this electorate has been steadily decreasing, and that by the time the next election is held, the excess allotted to it will probably have disappeared. At the same time the population of the other divisions is increasing, the tendency being for the numbers allotted to them to increase to the quota. In all these cases the Commissioners have not gone beyond the limits allowed them by the law. They are instructed to get as near to the quota as possible. They have done so. They have given their reasons for making the redistribution in the way that has been indicated. A great deal has been made of a statement appearing on page 13 of the Commissioners' report as to "" the impending general elections in 1912."" It is quite obvious to any one that this phrase is either a printer's error or a slip of the pen. If the honourable member for Gippsland had looked at the top of page 13 instead of confining his attention to the bottom, he would have seen that the Commissioners point out there thatIt is considered probable that the .figures which will be available showing the actual enrolment for the forthcoming elections next year will proveand so forth. As this report was written in 1912, "" next year"" must mean 1913, and this passage shows that the statement lower down was a slip. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Gippsland, with that Pecksniffian air with which we in this House are now so familiar, should have gone to the foot of a page to detect what he regards as an error when there is at the top of the same page a line which, if he had observed it, would have put him quite right straight away. . right to consider the matter other than according to the law ? ber knows that the Commissioners have a perfect right to arrange, within the limits allowed by the law, for a levelling up of all the electorates at the time of the proposed election. fect right to do so within the limits allowed by the law is perfectly plain, and presents no difficulties at all. Duffy, K . C , to that of the honourable member for Perth. opinion of a gentleman in Melbourne who, I believe, is regarded as a constitutional authority, I have taken the opinion of other authorities who hold equally as high a position in constitutional matters as the gentleman referred to; and they inform me that there is absolutely nothing whatever in the contention that the Commissioners have gone beyond their powers.. The section dealing with the matter is so 0 plain that even an ordinary layman, may read it as he runsIn making any distribution of States into Divisions the Commissioner shall give due consideration to community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, existing boundaries of Divisions; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution, and the Commissioners may adopt a margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessary, but in no case shall such quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fourth more and of one-fourth less. On the first page of their report the Commissioners say that the total number of electors on the Commonwealth rolls of the State as for the. 19th December, 1911, was 151,953. They go on to show that the quota amounts to 30,391. According to the official return supplied by the Commonwealth Electoral Department the proposed subdivision D contained on the 19th December, 1911, 34,031 enrolled electors, or 3,640 in excess of the quota, while the margin allowed them by the Act is nearly double that amount. In what way, then, can they be said to have gone beyond the legal limits of the powers that they are supposed to exercise? They have given reasons why they have given this excess of 3,640, and any one who reads those reasons carefully will see that there is good ground for the case they have constructed.

If , as I understand, the Government propose to utilize machinery for that work, there will not be such a large number of men employed after all, and even the anticipation of the Commissioners will have been unduly optimistic. At any rate, I for one have no particular interest in this matter beyond the desire to secure for the next election a result that will be thoroughly representative, and will not ogive to one person who happens to be what in all probability will elected any undue preponderance of voters They will have to take the most over another.

231,Mr Chanter (Riverina) [5.58],"no hesitation in saying, that the Commissioners have adopted an absolutely dangerous principle, which this Parliament should not allow to be enforced, in anticipating the position in which electorates will be in regard to population years hence. Their instructions, in accordance with the law, are to subdivide the State into electorates upon the basis of the existing enrolment. Instead of that, they have anticipated what the condition of an electorate will be a -considerable time hence. I intend to move an amendment before I conclude my remarks, because I consider that the Commissioners have done wrong in taking into consideration what is likely to happen years ahead. honourable member for Perth that what the honourable member for Gippsland alluded to was no printer's error or slip of the pen on the part of the Commissioners when they spoke of elections taking place in 1912. If the honourable member will turn to paragraph 31 of the report, he will find another allusion to the year 1912. That paragraph appears on page 12 of the report. member account for the reference to next year at the top of page 13 of the report? ference to which the honourable member refers, but I would point out to him that, in paragraph 31, we have the statementAt the time when the new Commonwealth members to draw their own conclusions. rolls are likely to be put into practical use, They state, in the latter part of paragraph viz., about April, 1912. . . 3iIn other words, the redistribution was made on the basis, not of the existing enrolment, but of the probable enrolment when the new rolls are likely to be put into practical use. numbers will then be about even. to make such a prediction? within the margin. Commissioners clearly state that when the elections take place, in 1912-and if we assume that the elections will not take place until 1913, their case is very much worsethere is going to be a considerable population in a part of the State in wbich there is practically no population at present. In thus acting, in anticipation of a probable influx of population to a certain area, are they not introducing a dangerous principle? T am glad that the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out that had the Commissioners thus been allowed to proceed with their distribution, in anticipation of the population twelve months hence, Victoria would not have lost a representative. In that case, however, the division of the State into Federal electorates was made on the basis of actual statistics. distribution in the case of Western Australia is based on statistics as to population. the honourable member that the Commissioners in this case have acted on the basis of an anticipated enrolment. They state, in paragraph 30, of their reportThere are, of course, always some electors I would' point out to the who do not take advantage of the privilege of enrolling themselves, and, therefore, as will be seen, ""a slight discrepancy exists between the percentage of those eligible for enrolment and those who have actually enrolled themselves.

Experience tells us that if gold is found in any district a rush immediately sets in, and that if the find proves to be a good one, a large and permanent population is established there. I have no desire to repeat the arguments that have already been used, but I feel that an injustice has been done in this case, just as an injustice was done in connection with a redistribution of my own electorate, which did not have regard to community of interest. missioners have based their decision in this case, not upon the actual enrolment, but upon what they anticipate will be the enrolment twelve months or two years hence. not on facts, but upon imagination.

The honourable member for Coolgardie has already referred to the double journey that would have to be undertaken in certain cases by electors in the division of Dampier, and he and other honourable members from that State can deal, also, with the question of community of interest. contention is that the Commissioners have departed from the directions given them under the Act by basing their scheme of distribution upon an anticipated enrolment, instead of the actual enrolment at the time that the scheme was drawn up. I therefore move That all the words after "" T h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" in accordance with section 22 of the Electoral Act the redistribution be referred back tion of a certain division; judging by the to the Commissioners with an intimation that due consideration does not appear to have been given to the diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue and the other portions of the proposed division ' D.'

We should have a better argument than any we have yet heard for the 'amendment, because the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia did nothing but what they were entitled to do, and enjoined to do in the terms of their appointment and under the Electoral Act. They were given a margin under which to do the very thing they have done, and which honourable members opposite now condemn. I should willingly vote that any proposed scheme of redistribution should be sent back to the Electoral Commissioners if an obvious and flagrant wrong were proposed, but in this case it seems to me that the Electoral Commissioners for Western Australia have done what the law directed them to do, and we should be without any justifiable excuse if in the circumstances we sent their report back to them. feel that the procedure suggested is not in accordance with the spirit of the Electoral Act. The proper thing to do is to accept or reject the proposed redistribution. The object of having Electoral Commissioners was that they should inquire into the conditions of each electoral division. member not have the House tell them where it thinks they are in error ? the amendment would be equivalent to the House directing the Commissioners as to how they should perform their duties.

Individual members of this House have the right to object to the proposed scheme, and to give reasons for their objection, and the Electoral Commissioners would no doubt in the ordinary way pay attention to those objections, the same as they would to any other objections. in the way here proposed, I think we are asked to express an opinion without complete information. We are asked to reject the proposed scheme for Western Australia as though we each had a knowledge of fhe whole of the conditions of that State, and we are asked to set our knowledge against that of the Electoral Commissioners, whose duty it was to specially investigate those conditions. If a manifest injustice were proposed it would be the duty of the House to reject such a proposal ; but we are asked in this case to express an opinion upon the question of diversity of interest and the absence of means of communication between the districts of Mount Magnet and Cue.

Perhaps the honourable member who moved the amendment can tell me where Mount Magnet is. can see it on the map. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. spirit of the Electoral Act is that we shall appoint Commissioners, with the desire to, as far as possible, leave the question of the electoral divisions to an absolutely impartial body. on the old State principle of the Government forming a series of electoral boundaries and submitting these to the House for approval, by creating a body to deal with the matter judicially. perience has led us to the conclusion that it is better to have three Commissioners rather than one, and that these three Commissioners should consist of the Surveyor-General, who by virtue of his office and position necessarily knows a great deal of the country, and two other men of equal official position, such as, in some instances, District Court Judges or State electoral officers. The duty of the Commissioner* is to make a distribution of a State, to receive objections and give due weight to. them, and then lay their scheme before the House through the Minister. Of course, the object is not merely to lay the report But in dealing with the matter on the table, and do nothing more with it ; the Act seems to indicate that it is the duty of the Minister to submit the report; and here I may say that I am sorry the honourable gentleman did not give us any information, but simply laid.the document on the table and left the House to worry through it. Commissioners to supply the information. the Government's view is that this distribution is not a matter for us to interfere with, but one for the Commissioners whose duty it is to consider the whole question impartially. The section of the. Act contemplates our acceptance or rejection of any distribution; that, I submit, is the law. Of course, the action taken the other night in regard to the division of another State set a precedent which the honourable member for Riverina is now seeking to follow. That, in my opinion, is a very dangerous precedent, because the law is emphatic in requiring us to accept or reject; and, in the latter case, for the Minister tc direct a fresh distribution to be made. The amendment of the honourable member for Riverina practically supersedes the motion; the House is not asked to approve nor to reject, but to send the report back with a direction. That, I say, is not the spirit, even if it is within the letter, of the law. The scheme of the Electoral Act is not that the House shall direct the Commissioners as to what they shall do. If we are to take any action, it would be better to accept full and complete responsibility, and frame the divisions, rather than attempt to interfere with and try to supersede, the Commissioners Our idea was to improve in the way proposed. The amendment sets out that due consideration does not appear to have been given to diversity of interests and the question of communication with Mount Magnet and Cue, and the ExCommissioners are requested to make a distribution on the basis of the existing enrolment, so as to give each division, as nearly as practicable,, an equal number of electors.

If I did not believe the Commissioners to be above reproach, I should have thought The they had gone out of their way to make a nice comfortable seat for somebody they knew. I admit that that is a very harsh thing to say; but my opinion is supported by the facts of the case. It seems evident I that the Commissioners found it impossible to make a division having regard to complete community of interests. They seem The honourable member for Coolto have tried to keep as much of the mining interests of Western Australia as they could in one division; and, if that had been possible, I could have seen a reason why they thought it necessary to depart from the procedure always adopted in the But the honourable member has past in arranging electorates. It is evident, however, that they found this impossible of achievement, and thus we have their proposal now before us. They have departed altogether from the previous distribution, and have apparently gone out of their way to make the division under discussion a peculiar one from the point of view of community of interests. It has been The preceding said to-day that in the case of Victoria the report was referred back for somewhat similar reasons to those which have been laid before us to-day. I ' have never yet known, in the arrangements in a State, a country electorate to get more voters than a city or a suburban electorate. No doubt the Boulder and the Kalgoorlie electorates contain very large cities, but in the rest of this country. there are purely mining towns. Away down in the south, of course, there are varied industries or callings. What does seem to me peculiar is that the Commissioners departed altogether from the previous method in redistributing the State. They assumed that the population would decrease, and that to my mind was where they made a great blunder. They had no right, I contend, to assume that division D would lose enormously in population during the next few years. However, that point has been dilated upon, and I do not wish to traverse the same ground again. It has been pointed out that in this division will be concentrated the. whole of the work-whic h will be considerable, of course-associate d with the construction of the transcontinental railway.

They have officials to carry out certain work, and when it is completed they accept their recommendation. I do not think that a responsible Government should do a thing of that sort, because officials can make mistakes. I wish to draw a distinction between the attitude of the present Ministry and that of the Ministry which had to deal with the previous redistribution of seats in Western Australia.

I do not know whether he has his eye on the area of country indicated by a big red patch on the map. knowledge of the State, I should imagine that there is no other division which would suit him so well as that one would. He knows what he intends to do, but it certainly looks to me as if he had his eye on that electorate. At any rate, I suspect that there must have been some very nice gentlemen in Western Australia who, looking at the different divisions, said, "" It may be an accident, but here is a splendid opportunity for a politician of a certain bent of mind to get a really nice, safe seat."" At any rate, that is the view I take of the position. do you think? 1 certainly think it is, and I am strengthened in that view by the very fight which they are putting up for the adoption of this scheme. The Commissioners had no right to place.4,000 electors in an immense area like division D, which, according to the evidence we have, will increase in population.

This is a departure to which attention should be directed. this inherent in the House? posed is not contemplated by the Act. Its wisdom is doubtful, because of the partisanship which may be introduced. ber contend that the Electoral Act limits the ticular party would obtain any advantage power of the House? visions setting forth clearly the course to be followed. It contemplates no such interference as is proposed with the independence of the Commissioners. Commissioners should know our mind? do so, a perusal of the debate will make them acquainted with the views of each honourable member who speaks, and of the feeling of the House collectively. At all events, until the Act has been amended, I do not think that more is necessary or desirable. Again, section 22 prescribes that when either House passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution. We are not asked to disapprove of the proposed distribution, nor are we asked to negative a motion for its approval, though incidentally, as a consequence of passing this amendment, for whose terms there is no excuse or justification, we might be taken by indirect implication to have followed one of these courses. not, be serious at this juncture, but must be taken into account in any future amendment of the Act. do not know that I shall transgress the rules of debate if I reply to some remarks made this afternoon by the honourable member for Swan'by repeating what I have already said in this chamber, that I did not canvass anybody for a vote in support of the motion which I moved in reference to the Queensland distribution I give that assurance in absolute good conscience. told the Prime Minister that I would fight the proposal on the floor of the House, and only there, and so impressed were honourable members with the case that I made out that they voted with me. pressed with the idea that they ought to give the honourable member a vote. able member for the interjection, and am sorry that he did not give me his vote. I have suggested previously, and say again, that the best method of distributing the electoral divisions of a State would be for the representatives of that State to meet and settle the matter in conclave. No parby that method. Each member concerned would take care that the interests of the division which he represented were conserved, and whatever was done would result in no detriment to future candidates. The party opposite is now following the example of the Labour party in taking a plebiscite in regard to candidates. That is going on in Victoria to-day. ber must confine himself to the question. ing, sir, being one of the most submissive men in the House in that regard. The honourable member for Swan left it to be inferred that the honourable member for Coolgardie and myself have not studied the best, interests of the country. I say that we have, anJ for this reason : When a member who represents a majority of the electors who voted in his division speaks in this House in defence of their interests, he is consulting the interests of the country. There are on the other side a few members who were returned by minorities ber is not confining himself to the question. This irregularity may, or may member for Swan suggested that the honourable member for Coolgardie has taken up an attitude, and advocated a course, which is not in the interests of the country. I say that that is not so. When a minority of a minority says that such and such a thing should be done, the member representing the majority is within his rights in asserting that the interest of the majority should be studied; and the honourable member for Coolgardie is perfectly justified in saying that in the interest of the majority the electoral divisions of I Western Australia should be redistributed.",47,Electoral Divisions Western Australia

344,Mr Bamford,"The honorableWhatever the Leader of the Opposition says is said in the most courteous way, though on most occasions he takes the wrong position; but in the speech which he just made he was guilty of hair-splitting. He states that the course proposed is not in accordance with the Act; but he is not consistent, because on a previous occasion he voted for a course which was not in accordance with the Act. The honourable member for Darling Downs has also complained that the Act is not being followed, but on a previous occasion he was indifferent to that. a case, but presents at any one time only that side which it then suits it to present, and later puts forward with equal logic the other side. The position of the honourable member for Coolgardie is reasonable and justifiable. He is acting in the best interests of the country, because he is acting on behalf of a majority of the electors who voted in the division which he represents, and the party to which he belongs represents a majority of the electors of the whole country. will vote with him as they voted with me on another occasion. I am sorry that the honourable member for Herbert has taken exception to what I have said. feelings, but I cannot help knowing that this matter has been talked about. ber must confine himself to the amendment. able member for Herbert was allowed to refer to what I said. ber for Herbert spoke to the main question as well as to the amendment. Sir understand that I am not to refer to what he said. I submit that the House has no power to make suggestions to the Commissioners. The law is that if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may ask the Commissioners to propose a fresh, distribution. I cannot understand why an amendment should be proposed which is in. contravention 'of the Act. Honourable -members can see the inconvenience of this procedure. We could all make suggestions. I could move that such and such a State electorate should be left out or included; another honourable membercould move something else. But we should then each be attempting to dictate to the Commissioners as to how they should carry out their duties: I hope that no attempt of the sort will be made. Let us act up to the law in any case, and if we do not approve of the proposed distribution, let us negative the motion moved by the Minister, and let him take the course prescribed by the law. The law provides that in such an eventThe Commissioners shall, thereupon reconsider the matter, and forthwith propose a fresh The legal mind sees both sides of distribution. That is straightforward. I do not know why the honourable member for Coolgardie desires to take two State electorates out of the green-Kalgoorlie-and put them into the red-Dampier-are a on the map. As for community of interest, there is no doubt about it that Kalgoorlie, Mount Margaret, Lawlers, and all these mining districts to the south have community of interest with Cue and Mount Magnet. As for means of communication, the law does I hope that the House not prescribe that it must be railway communication. There is road and telegraphic communication, and therefore there are"", means of communication. I submit that in this matter the electoral law has been, properly 'complied with by the Commis-, I did not wish to hurt his sioners. I submit further that the arrange-^ ment"" which they propose is completely within the law. . The provision as to community of interest has been . adhered to as well as it can. be; whilst also the provision as to. means of. communication has been complied with, because there are roads and telegraphs between the places.

There are certainly no means of communication by rail between the Murchison electoral district, which is a mining and pastoral district, and the Gascoyne to the north. But there are means of communication by road between Cue and Mount Magnet and the northern parts of Western Australia.

Surely those remarks are applicable to this present case. The Prime Minister went on to sayI wish to say in the plainest possible language that the members of a Government who lend themselves to that kind of thing are unfit to occupy the positions they hold, because an attempt to manipulate electorates and to take the work of electoral distribution .out of the hands of the responsible officers appointed for the purpose is about the nearest approach to political corruption. I want to know whether the right honourable gentleman will say that in this House to-day to those who are not voting with him on the present occasion, but who generally support him.

He has set us such an example in this respect that, eminent though he is in so many spheres, I hesitate to imitate him. Whilst intending to confine my remarks as closely as possible to the amendment, I hope, Mr Speaker, that you will allow me, at least, by way of personal explanation, to make some reference to the charges which the right honourable member has made against me. Let me say, first of all, that the amendment to my mind is entirely relevant, since the people of Mount Magnet and Cue have distinctly asked that they should not be included in the "" D "" Division. He has They are the people who are affected by this proposed distribution, and from them the original protest came. That being so, I may be allowed to show why they should not be included in this division. In the first place, they are very remote from the electoral centre to which, under the scheme, they are to be united. They have always been associated, both in State and Federal politics, with the adjacent port of Geraldton, with which they have direct communication by rail. In none of the right honourable member's orations has he attempted to show that there was any community of interest between the people of Cue and Mount Magnet and those of the far distant city of Kalgoorlie. Nor has he attempted to deal with the important fact that if an elector in those districts wished' to visit the electoral centre, he would have to travel 1,900 miles, and to use not one, but three lines of railway. the people of Pilbarra have to travel in order to reach their electoral centre? member, in his interjection, is ignoring the important fact that, as Premier of the State To overcome that difficulty, I of Western Australia, he united with the adjacent port of Geraidton the two districts which he now wishes to join with Kalgoorlie. The interests of the people of those districts are identical with the interests of the people in another division, from which they have been separated by this distribution. They have no interest whatever, except that of common citizenship, with the people of Kalgoorlie; nor have they any direct connection by rail with that gold-field.

It is only after those paramount statutory requirements have been observed, and every other expedient exhausted, that the"" Commissioners are entitled to f a l l back upon the margin of allowance. attention of the legal members of the House to the subsidiary place occupied by the phrase ""margin of allowance"" in section 16, and which, I think, proves my contention. Act as if this provision as to margin of allowance were a general direction to be followed indiscriminately. This is shown by paragraph 2 of their report, where they refer to the ""margin of allowance"" and are silent regarding the more important statutory directions. The provision as to margin of allowance was plainly intended to provide for exceptional cases. The words are prohibitive as well as permissive. The Act virtually tells the Commissioners to partition the State of Western Australia into five divisions, containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of actually enrolled voters. says, in effect, to them, "" Consider first of all whether diepeople you group together have community of interest; secondly, whether they have direct means of communication with one another, and when you. are Satisfied on these points, consider the quota -The quota you will obtain by dividing the total number of electors actually enrolled by the number of members to -be returned. If some obstacle not foreseen by Parliament prevents strict adherence to the quota, ,you may vary it ; but you are not to vary it by more than one-fifth on either side."" That is the answer to the contention that the Commissioners have not erred so long as they have remained within the margin of allowance. The provision as to the margin of allowance is subject to all the other considerations set out in section 16; and it is not until those are all met, and every expedient exhausted, that the Commissioners are entitled to f a l l back upon it. Then, again, the provision as to margin of allowance is only to be used "" whenever necessary."" That is the literal instruction given in the Act. The onus of proving the "" necessity "" is on the Commissioners. tempted to show that it was necessary to use .the margin of allowance so as to include, nearly 5,000 more voters in one division than in any of the others, nor that arfy exceptional circumstances exist which call for such an enormous variation from the existing quota. This is the first time in my experience that Electoral Commissioners have claimed to form divisions by prophetic inspiration.

I find also-whic h is a matter that we should bear in mind in dealing with navigation-that in studying matters that required amendment in the British laws for the purpose of increasing the manning of the British Navy, the Board of Trade Committee, of 1903, saidWe think that an increase in the number of British seamen in the mercantile marine may be looked for rather in the improvement in their conditions than in the increase of facilities for training boys at sea. The ""improvement of conditions"" has been marked in the Act of 1906 in England, and, I believe, in the operation of it, with very great success. I am pleased to notice that this view is supported by some statistics published about eighteen months ago by an authority on commercial and naval matters in the Old Country. The fact is, and we must all be conscious of it, that there is a movement abroad, more likely, to my mind, to be successful than any sudden and angry revolution in industrial and social affairs, towards a recognition p f the necessity for a full realization of the proper proportion between effective effort and reward; and if that happens to place on a higher plane of comfort and competence the men who for many generations have made us, in our romantic imaginings, masters of the deep, the world will, in the long run, be all the better for the change. Coming to the Bill, I think the chief end aimed at includes a fair standard of wages and conditions for oflicers and men, and I acknowledge that this may necessitate, to some extent, the protection, if I may call it so, of our coastal trade. allow the happier conditions of the last two or three years to be interfered with from outside, if protection against that interference is really necessary. To take only two figures by way of comparison, I find that the wages of Australian able seamen are now £& per month, as against £ 4 5s. for seamen on ocean-going vessels; while Australian firemen receive £ 1 0 per month, as against £ \ ios. and £ 5 paid to ocean-going firemen. The only question with me is: What is the volume and character of the competing vessels, and to what extent is the protection that we are introducing necessary to maintain die local conditions? I merely state the position, because, owing to the limitation of time, I do not propose [5i] to elaborate on it. So far, then, as regards the men who are to be our chief consideration. At the same time, we ought not to unduly hamper Australian vessels. If we do so, we may, to a large extent, diminish the wages fund out of which the seamen's wages are paid, and also diminish the possibility of meeting the fair demands the limits of whicli at present have not been reached. We must progress as we go on. The Bill, to a certain extent, is challenged by some on the ground that there is an unnecessary hamperingI merely state this criticism, which has been levelled against the measure-of some of the shipowners by the provisions in relation, for instance, to greater accommodation, on which the honourable member for Kooyong dwelt, more frequent surveys, lower loadlines and whiter load-lines all the year round for both local and external commerce, manning ana other matters I need hot mention. Four points mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong had reference, I think, to manning, load-lines, survey, and wireless telegraphy; and these alone will involve, if carried into effect, an additional annual outlay for the ships covered by the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners Association of ^11:1,000. a kind .of insurance for the shipping companies ? am merely dealing with the conditions laid down in the Bill, which are much harder than the conditions under, for instance the United States Act. Subject to these prime conditions, which have one end in view, we ought to aim at Imperial uniformity in both law and operation. That was the object sought to be attained by the Navigation Conference of 1907; and We cannot I should like, if I may, to read the following from the despatch of the Honourable Alfred Lyttelton, dated 8th March, 1905, suggesting that Conference to considerThe legal and constitutional questions concerning the scope of the powers enjoyed by Colonial Legislatures under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894; and, secondly, the practical inconvenience arising from divergent legislation of the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and the Colonies. Those were two objects from the Imperial point of view. Three years afterwards.

430,Mr Glynn,"To some extent it is; INew Zealand, and which do not engage in the coasting trade of either colony, should be determined upon by mutual agreement between the Commonwealth, New Zealand, and His Majesty's Government, and should be passed by the Imperial Parliament. That was mutual agreement on what ought to be;-assumin g that we have fairly comprehensive powers for local purposes, as the Imperial Parliament has for Imperial purposes-the lines that both local and Imperial legislation ought to follow. The suggestion was that those lines should be embodied in an agreement to be passed by the Imperial Parliament, and capable of adoption or rejection by us. What does this mean to the Imperial Government ? I have looked up a few figures concerning our trade, and I shall put them before honourable members, again mentioning that Earl Crewe said in his September despatch of 1908But it will be apparent to your Ministers that His Majesty's Government's power qf negotiating will bedestroyed unless the self-governing Dominions and the United Kingdom have Ihe same standard for oversea shipping. And he points outI shall not quote the document at lengthForeign countries might retaliate by requiring different standards of equipment registered in the Dominioa. More recently, in connection with the Imperial Conference, fears of retaliation against the United Kingdom were also expressed and dwelt on. There is no doubt that if retaliation is ever induced by any legislation of ours, the commerce of the Empire affords a magnificent target. This was admitted by the Times in writing upon the subject of Imperial Tariff Reciprocity, towards the consideration of which discussion I contributed in 1904. The writer in the Times says that if foreign Governments desired to retaliate "" by hitting at our shipping industry, it must be confessed that it offers a noble target."" That is the qualification of a writer supporting Imperial preference if his doctrines were to become matters of legislation. I am merely asking honourable members in all cases to consider whether it is worthwhile to indulge in the remedy, and if the remedy is likely to be effective. Last year the carrying tonnage of the world was, I think, about 33,000,000 tons. The figures for the United Kingdom are 11,556,000 tons-a pretty big tonnage for that little centre of a mighty Empire. The Colonies and Dependencies have 1,806,000 tons, not very far short of tlie tonnage of that great Power, Germany, which has 2,903,000 tons; so that about Mr Glynn. 34.3 per cent, of the world's tonnage belongs to the United Kingdom. The British tonnage cleared at foreign ports is more than double that of the foreign tonnage cleared at British ports; 54 per cent, of the Atlantic tonnage, and 29 per cent, of the European tonnage, are British. The British tonnage engaged in the trade of India, as to which Mr Harcourt put in a special plea in connection with this legislation at the last Conference, was 78 per cent.; in South Africa, 83 per cent.; in Australia, 74.9 per cent.; and in New Zealand, 96 per cent. So far as protection to British tonnage is concerned as regards New Zealand, it would seem to me to be almost wanton to do anything to induce retaliation. My request is that we should consider the effect of our restrictions, and the probable efficacy of the methods we adopt to give greater protection to our local trade, remembering always that the maintenance of Britain as a world Power depends upon her mercantile marine, of which the Imperial Navy is but the symbol of its strength; and, of course, as the telegram just mentioned states, is nothing more than a defensive assurance. One might almost say of Britain what Byron said of Venice, that she is "" a ruler of the for vessels waters, and their powers,"" and if her greatness as a world Power is ever to be impaired, I firmly believe that, depending as it does upon commerce, it will fall as it rose, with the merchant Navy. I might quote from what Mr Lloyd George said at the Imperial Conference of 1907 on the question of the coasting trade of the world, the figures for which I have here, and the extent to whicli we really have to fear competition, or that reciprocity is not granted or is granted. He pointed out that the bulk of the foreign shipping engaged in our Imperial trade is Norwegian and German, and that neither of these countries excludes us from the coasting or Imperial trade. We have had various proposals recently introduced for the protection of British ship-owners and producers, some of them at the last Conference. This was the tenor of one niotion which was proposed, and on being amended became the operative resolution on which the Empire Trade Commission has been appointed. I am not going to do more than mention that they are carrying out the policy declared by us in 1907, when the Royal Commission reported and asked that certain subjects should be submitted to the Imperial Government, amongst others the desirableness of extending preference to British ship-owners and British producers. It is in reference to these suggestions that my remarks up to the present time have been directed; but I would like to mention that without any preference of that character in our navigation laws, wages have risen a good deal within the last two or three years. When the recommendation was made in 1907 for this to become a matter for Imperial legislation, the seamen were getting £ 6 ios. a month, whereas now they get £ 8 ; while the firemen who were getting £ 8 ios. a month get now ,£10, without any of this class of preference. If we are to have uniformity it must be Imperial; and without that Imperial uniformity, we are told by the Ministers in the Old Country that they cannot do very much to extend the international reciprocity which has to some extent been the result of' negotiations since the Imperial Act of 1906 was passed. As regards the present position, I may say that there are Imperial powers, Dominion powers such as the Commonwealth and State powers, all of which more or less clash as a matter of scope and as a matter of operation; that the Home advisers take one view of our powers, that our local advisers on some points take another view, and that it can be clearly shown that neither of them is right, because I will prove that the Home advisers on some points are wrong. First, let me say a few words as to what are the probable powers of the Commonwealth under which we propose to pass this Bill. These powers must be derived either from the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 or from the Commonwealth Constitution, or from both. I am now dealing with the Commonwealth powers at present, and they are not exhaustive of the powers on this side of the world. When the Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849, according to some writers-includin g Mr Garran, I think we had power which was not restricted by any Imperial Act to deal with navigation that is within territorial limits. But, in -853, the Customs Consolidation Act reserved the coasting trade of British Dominions in Asia, Africa, and America for British vessels, and that imposed a restriction on our powers to deal with the coasting trade which was removed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, and an Act of 1869. That Act contained a provision empowering us to repeal certain' provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act which otherwise extended to us, and, in 1869, we got power to deal with the coasting trade. specify in the Bill that British seamen only shall man the ships? taken in this Bill, as I shall endeavour to explain. The coasting trade power of 1869. which was re-enacted in the Act of 1894 by section 736, entitle us to regulate the coasting trade subject to certain conditions, namely, that the Act must be suspended for the Royal assent andcome into operation when it was proclaimed in the Possession; that all British ships were to be treated alike; and that the law was not to affect certain rights granted by treaties in existence prior to 1869, and only a few of which, I believe, still survive. These provisions were re-enacted, and are now sections 735 and 736 of the Act of 1894. Section 735 gives us power to repeal certain provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act in relation to ships registered in Australia; section 736 gives us power to regulate the coasting trade; whilst section 264 gives us power to apply to any British ship registered in, trading with, or being at any port in the Possession, any provisions of part II . of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 which would not otherwise apply. In other words, a complete code was framed by that Act. I am only dealing with the three main sections which affect us. We got, under section 735, power to repeal some provisions, under section 264 power to bring into operation other provisions which did not otherwise apply to us, and under section 736 power to regulate the coasting trade; but the point as to whether our regulation of the coasting trade could be extra-territorial or not before the Constitution is a matfer of doubt. Some of the writers for the Colonial Office and for the Board of Trade think that it had an extra-territorial operation, but that matter is somewhat doubtful, and is not material, because it is now affected, I believe, by covering clause 5 of the Constitution. I a|fe dealing with doubts, because I am going*to suggest difficulties we are in as regards our legislation. It is also doubtful to what extent we can supplement the British Merchant Shipping Act-to what extent Mr Keith says in his recent work and some of his late articles on the merchant shipping legislation, and Mr Garran dwells on the same matter-as long as our provisions are not inconsistent with provisions of Acts of Parliament extending to us expressly or by necessary intendment, legislating in the way we are given express",56,Pairs

It is also doubtful whether the Commonwealth is a British Possession within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, because, if it is not a British Possession, we cannot legislate under that Act. What can be said on that point ? lation. to our other powers. I am dealing at present with one possible source of our power. WhatI want to prove is that we are in a bit of a fix, and that there is only one cure -som e arrangement with the Imperial Government as to the whole aim of our maritime power. phase if we are not a British Possession. ter, and I am sure honourable members will excuse me if I refer in detail to what really is more law than matter of direct policy. What is the present law ? This is a matter which concerns, not only us, but the Imperial Government, and our policy may be affected by what are our probable powers. Section 18 of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1889, an Act of the Imperial Parlia' ment, governs the interpretation of the Merchant Shipping Act. It declares in regard to Dominions under a central Legislature that where part of such Dominions are under both a central and a local Legislature, all parts under the central Legislature shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be one Colony. This being a British Possession, it would appear that the States have no power, because we are the central authority; but I do not think that that is so. It seems clear that both are not likely to be British Possessions within the meaning of the Act, and there is a doubt on the point, because in the Kalibia v. Wilson case, Mr Justice Isaacs saidWhether the Commonwealth is a British possession for the purposes of section 775 is a' question I have not considered. When Mr Justice Isaacs says ^ a t he has not. considered a question, but suggests that it may be a moot point, it is time to ascertain the meaning of "" British Possession "" in this regard. If we cannot supplement the legislative powers to which I have referred, being a British Possession, some of the provisions of the Bill are ultra vires, such provisions, for instance, as those of Part IV., which apply to all ships, British and foreign. Clause 190 says that all ships shall be liable to inspection and survey; and clause 196, to re-survey every six months; but section 271 of the Imperial Act does not provide for the yearly survey of non-passenger vessels. member think that, in view of the recent Titanic disaster, the British Legislature will pass more strict and drastic legislation? Titanic disaster will affect what is done. A great deal of the newspaper criticism of the Board of Trade did not amount to much. The Board of Trade regulations were framed a few years ago, when %'essels did not exceed a maximum tonnage of 10,000 tons, but since then there has been a . very rapid increase of tonnage. There still exists great difference of opinion as to whether human life will not be better preserved by improving the methods of preventing vessels from sinking than by insisting on the provision of more boats. Our legislation may be repugnant to other provisions of the Act. Section 377 provides that a certificate cancelled in the Commonwealth and re-issued by the Board of Trade is not to have effect in the Commonwealth. That may be ultra vires. During the last few years the representations of the Board of Trade in regard to our proposals have been met to some extent. The New Zealand Bill of 1909, which I think did not receive the Royal assent before 1911, paid more heed than does this legislation to the principles which should operate in accordance with the Imperial suggestions, and the declaration' of the Imperial Conference of 1907 that our local laws should provide for vessels registered in the Commonwealth when trading therein, and for vessels wherever registered when trading on the coast, but not to foreign vessels not trading in the Commonwealth. The forty or forty-five original points of difference between the Commonwealth and the Board of Trade have, it has been stated by the Minister or by the honourable member for Kooyong, been reduced to eight or nine. There is still, however, divergence between our proposed legislation and the Board of Trade view. I have mentioned the different powers that operate. The Australian power is divided between the Commonwealth and the States. The Imperial law authorities have taken a view that is not on all points correct. Lord Crewe has stated that view in these words-^ Law oflicers and other distinguished lawyers advise that the Parliament has only powers of legislation so to override the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 as are given by sections 735 and 736 of that Act, and that the",58,Pairs

438,Mr Glynn,"I do not think that theeifect of section 51 and section 98 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth is merely to confer upon the Commonwealth power of legislation in navigation matters paramount to that of the State Parliaments, but that these sections do not in any way extend the legislative power of the Commonwealth beyond the powers previously exercised by the State Legislatures. That is incorrect. The Commonwealth has not power to override the legislation of the State Parliaments in navigation matters within their own sphere, because this is not a concurrent power. The sections of the Constitution which are relevant to this discussion are 51 (1), 98, 39, covering clause 5, and section 76 (3). Section 51 deals with trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States. section 98 the power of the Federal Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping. Section 39 deals with matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any Department or officer of the Commonwealth. Covering clause 5 says that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and port of destination are in the Commonwealth. judicial department of the Constitution. The Parliament may make laws conferring jurisdiction on the High.Court on any matter of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. As to the trade and commerce power in the Kalibia v. Wilson case, it has been decided that the Commonwealth power does not extend to the purely internal coasting trade. Some of the local text writers thought that it d i d ; but I had not much doubt about it. I was afraid that our Seamen's Compensation Act would not be valid, and, when dealing with the Judiciary Bill a year ago, threw out a hint that probably many of the provisions of the Navigation Bill would be found invalid for a similar reason, l t is a difficult matter to determine, and lawyers may honestly differ about it. the Court said was that section 98 does not enlarge the ambit of the commerce power, or do anything more than explain ""trade and commerce"" as applied to powers within that ambit; in other words, that ""trade and commerce"" includes navigation and shipping. In Canada navigation and shipping is a general power. So the Seamen's Compensation Act 1909 was declared invalid, because it dealt with both Intra-State and Inter-State trade. In the opinion of the majority of the High Court the provisions of the Act were not severable. I was Attorney-General at the time the measure was passed. It was quite right as originally drafted, and as it passed from my hands; but it was re-drafted afterwards, on a request to widen its scope, and it was thought that an opportunity for severance would be given by the Court. But there was a good deal of reasoning in the decision of the majority of the High Court that the provisions were not severable, and. of course, one must do his best ' in such matters. In the Under United States, Acts dealt with traffic on railways, and included provisions as to employers' liability and arbitration. The employers' liability provisions of the Act of 1906 were held to be invalid for the same reason as our Seamen's Compensation Act was held to be invalid, because it dealt with purely domestic or Intra-State trade, whilst the commerce power is Inter-State. Accordingly, the provisions were knocked out, and the Act was held to be not severable. In the following year, in the case of Adair v. United States, US.R. 208, at page 178, the Court said that if the provisions had been expressed in a detachable section, Section 76 deals with the so that the Court might have severed diem, it would have been valid. That referred to employers' liability, which, of course, is cognate to our Seamen's Compensation Act, which, as honourable members are aware, dealt with employers' liability. So that, according to the United States decision, with which our High Court agreed, if you do under our Inter-State power pass an Act dealing purely with Inter-State trade, that Act is valid. The United States law, however, is different in respects from ours. Their power is wider than ours. Uncier their power to deal with external commerce, they have passed extra-territorial laws Lhat, I believe, would be beyond our powers. In the United States, it must be remembered, there is no superior Parliament outside What Congress. Therefore, from necessity, they were forced to deal with external commerce in a manner covering something more than our commerce power covered. But in the the meaning of the words case of Lord v. Goodall-Nelson and Perkins, 102 US.R., p. 541-the Court, in effect, stated that the external commerce power extended to vessels engaged in the transportation of goods and passengers between ports or places in the same State, but part of whose course between ports was on the high seas. To quote from the case would be subjects of this class-claim s for the Court saidTn every just sense she was, while on the tions of title in cases of possession, salvage, ocean, engaged in commerce with foreign &c.; claims for salvage and towage; claims nations, and, as such,' she and the business she for necessaries to foreign ships; relations was engaged in were subject to the regulating power of Congress. In addition, in the United States they have repairs and possibly insurance. What the an Admiralty jurisdiction which we have law is within those limits, assuming the not. There the Admiralty jurisdiction is general maritime law to be the basis of the both judicial and legislative. It extends system, depends upon what has been received to all transactions of a maritime nature on as law in the usages of this country; and navigable waters of the United States, as I will give a quotation from the Kalibia well as those on the high seas. It does not case on a question of Admiralty jurisdicextend to inland lakes wholly within the tion. limits of a State and wholly unconnected side that the Commonwealth Act of 1909 with the navigable waters of the United was valid. Mr Justice Barton, at page States. In other words, it extends to any 704 of the report of the Kalibia case, sumwaters that, by themselves or by connection med the matter up in these wordswith other waters, form a channel of commerce between States, or with foreign counof Whatever tries ; but it does not extend to any waters position as the United States at the time of purely within particular States, and which the making of their Constitution-namely , that cannot become water-ways between States or of foreign countries. A writer on this subin ject, Willoughby, mentions thatThe Federal Admiralty jurisdiction being whollv independent of the power to regulate Tnter-State commerce, and attaching whenever the cause of action has arisen in navijrable waters, jurisdiction extends 'over all cases arisan over-riding power to legislate on the subject ing in navigable waters, even though they be whollv within the confines of a particular State, the grant in section 76, sub-section 3, cannot provided that they be links in a chain of commercial communication between States. In Australia, the Admiralty power 'is not legislative. It is purelv judicial. not, at present, exercised by the Commonwealth at all. Our Hieh Court has no Admiralty jurisdiction. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act T.890 invested British Possessions with .power fo declare any of their Courts Courts of Admiralty. power was exercised by all the States of Australia except New South Wales and Victoria; but I think New South Wales and Victoria came into line by Order in Council in May, 1911. So that now all the States have established Vice-Admiraltv Courts, all of which are. I think, connected with the Supreme Courts of the StatesI . Queen's Bench, 1892, page 272-the But we as a Commonwealth-I believe I am correct in this-have not exercised our jurisdiction under section 76, sub-section 3, of the Constitution by vesting in any of our Federal Courts Admiralty jurisdiction. We can do so, and we can make the power exclusive. But we have done neither. Even if we did choose to invest a Federal Court with Admiralty jurisdiction, our power would only be judicial. extend to in case we exercised the power Mr Glynn. damages done or sustained by a ship; quesbetween officers and crews; wages under contract wholly or in part performed at sea; It was urged by counsel on one might be the force of the reasoning those cases, if Australia were in the same a separated nation of independent sovereignty its relation to the United Kingdom-the reasoning has no force here, where the implication from imperative necessity cannot be drawn. The power to legislate on matters of Admiralty and maritime laws, if it existed in the several States at the time of Federation, remains reserved to them by force of section 107 of the Constitution. But there would be, and there is, in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and be construed as an implied transfer, or even delegation of that legislative power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth in respect of Australia. Such anargument, as will easily It is be seen, differs radically from that on which theAmerican cases were decided, for the necessity on which they are avowedly stated to be founded does not exist here. The power is merely given qua the restricted subject-matter to which it is in terms confined, namely, the confirmment of jurisdiction in a particular class That of controversies. That is a power which, as I have said, we have not yet exercised. I will make one other quotation from a law report, and that is from a Court of Appeal judgment on the question of what is English jurisdiction. In the case of the Queen v. Tke Judge of the City of London County Court judgment of Lord Esher saidMr Justice Story, whom I may venture to call an exceedingly great judge, in one of the most learned judgments which could be pronounced, went through every case which could be found anywhere from the earliest time, and he asserted for the Admiralty Court the largest jurisdiction which that Court had ever claimed. He held that in America, at all events, that Court had jurisdiction, not only over every tort committed on the high seas, but over every conWhat it might tract which is to be wholly or partly performed on the high seas. In that particular case he held that the Court of Admiralty had jurisdiction over a policy of insurance, and that a policy of insurance in respect of ships or goods could be enforced by it. It is undoubted that no such jurisdiction has ever been even attempted land Law Reports. In that case there was in England. Now, I do not think the judgment of Mr Justice Story has been adopted to any thing like its fullest extent even in AmericaI am inclined to think that American Judges have since flinched from it, and that the Amerilative power of New Zealand-which , can Courts do not attempt to exercise such a jurisdiction. But that judgment has been treated in one way only in this country. It has always been said that it is a departure by the American Courts with regard to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty from what has been held in England. I shall now pass on, simply stating that, in addition to the matters I have mentioned as falling within our legislative powers, under the heading of "" Admiralty,"" freedom of navigation between the States by connecting rivers might also, in the opinion of some, be covered by it. Covering clause 5 of the Constitution declares that our laws are to be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. The High Court will probably soon determine what is a port of destination. The question has not yet been decided. It was raised in the case of the Merchant Shipping Guild v. Archibald Currie and Company, reported in 5 C.L.R., page 757, but was not decided. seamen concerned in that case were discharged, and the voyage ended, not in the Commonwealth, but in Calcutta, so that the case was decided on other grounds. In the action of the Merchant Shipping Guild v. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company and two other companies, which I need not mention-it is known as the Fiona casea case was reserved by Mr Justice Higgins for the opinion of the High Court. After hearing arguments, the Court reserved its judgment, but intimated a few days ago that it desired that the matter should be reargued before the Full Court on the return, I suppose, of Mr Justice O'Connor. The question of what is a "" port of destination "" is, therefore, still undecided. The matter concerns us, inasmuch as we do not know whether a voyage commencing, say, in Sydney, and extending to the islands of the Pacific, to Auckland, and back again to Australia, with several intermediate clearances, would be within covering clause 5 of the Constitution as a voyage having its first port of clearance and its port of destination in Australia. In New Zealand, the question of our power-no t under a covering clause, because there is no such thing in connection with the New Zealand Constitution-to deal with similar conditions by arbitration was decided in the case of the award of the Wellington Cooks and Stewards Union, reported in 27 New Zeaa majority decision based on different grounds; but I think that the Chief Justice of New Zealand decided that the legisbeing a unitary State, has all the powers that the States and Commonwealth have here-in respect of navigation and all other matters extended to ships registered in New Zealand, trading in New Zealand, and owned by New Zealand citizens; that a voyage such as that which I have just mentioned would fall within that power, and that the arbitration award held outside the territorial limits. That judgment has been questioned. It has been cited, I think, in the Fiona case, and it affords another instance of the want of uniformity* in the operation of the laws of the Empire. Let me shortly summarize, not what the law is, but what I think is the position as regards our power. First of all, the Merchant Shipping Act probably applies to the Commonwealth. If it does, we have power, under section 735 of the Act of 1894, to repeal wholly or in part any of the provisions of that Act, except those of Part III . , relating to emigrant ships, in respect of The ships registered in Australia. An Act repealing any of those provisions would have to be reserved for the Royal Assent; -and, assent being given, there would have to be a proclamation. We cannot, however, repeal any of the provisions hi respect of State-registered ships plying within the State sphere. That is an important matter. I may mention to the Minister of Trade and Customs that I do not think we have power to bind the ships of a State. I notice that there has been a telegram on the subject published in the press. ground that they are State instrumentalities ? together from the question of State registration. Secondly, if the Merchant Shipping Act applies, as I think it does, to the Commonwealth, we have power under it to regulate the coasting trade between State and State or in the territories of the Commonwealth. regulate the trade of, for instance, the Northern Territory, or the waters of the Territory, because our powers in respect of those waters are exclusive of those of",59,Pairs

442,Mr Glynn,"Yes. We have power toftamgation the States. Our powers in this regard are subject to the equal treatment of all British ships, and to the privileges granted by treaties before 1869. That is the position under the Merchant Shipping Act. Laws so passed are extra territorial under covering clause 5 of the Constitution. clause applies to all our legislative powers wherever derived. Under section 264, we may apply any of the provisions of Part II. of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which otherwise do not apply, "" to any British ships registered in, trading with, or being at any part of that possession."" That would have effect throughout the British Dominions. In other words, we have power to make extra-territorial laws for specific purposes. Then, again, the Constitution gives us power to make laws in respect of trade and commerce between the States and with other countries, and in the waters of territories. The question of what power arises as being incidental to external commerce is not clear, but my opinion is that our power probably ceases, for external commerce, outside territorial limits. Unless that be so, our legislation would clash with, the Imperial Acts, and w.e have to take that into account when considering the meaning of a doubtful section. The commerce power of the Constitution includes power to keep the waterways open and safe from any obstruction by the States or otherwise. It also includes power to improve them for navigation. I come now to the position of the States. They have power, I think, to regulate Intra-State trade, with no extra-territorial operation by Act. Some think there is of necessity an extra-territorial operation; I merely say that the matter is doubtful. An important point is that the power under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 is not substantially affected by the Commonwealth Constitution. Which law is supreme, if they clash within respective spheres, is not necessarily determined by section 109 of the Constitution. That section provides that where there is a conflict between the law of a State and a law of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth law shall be supreme; but the important point is that the Commonwealth laws must be laws passed under the Constitution. of this Bill there will be an Imperial Act, the scope of which, in relation to Commonwealth and State legislation, is doubtful; a Commonwealth Act covering a limited external and a limited local field of jurisdiction; six State Acts Mr Glynn. [REPRESENTATIVES.] BtU. different in territorial scope and provisions for territorial purposes; and, under section 264 of the Merchant Shipping Act, for extra-territorial purposes. Further, there will be in the Courts of the States, though there is not yet in the Commonwealth Courts, Admiralty and StateI think that that covering Admiralty jurisdiction. We shall, in the operation of the measure, have a conflict with Imperial conditions, foreign conditions, and with New Zealand legislation, because their Acts do not dovetail into ours. For instance, a vessel coming from New Zealand in our coasting trade would be bound by arbitration awards and Australian rules under the Bill, and also by the rates under the New Zealand Act. The rates under the New Zealand Act may be higher or lower than ours, and the question will arise as to which are to be supreme within the territorial limits. Some provisions, such as section 291 of this Bill, as to an agreement to deduct excess that may be paid under local laws, when a vessel gets outside our territorial limits would be binding, probably, on Australian and New Zealand ships, but would not touch foreign ships. That is a very important matter. To sum up all, I recommend that we should consult the Imperial Government as regards the question of uniformity. to get advice now? time for dealing with the matter is limited. 1 might quote from Harrison Moore and several other writers on the subject, but I will conclude with a quotation from Keith, V o l . II . , page 1 2 1 1 It does not appear probable that the extension of the power of the Dominion Legislatures would by any means result in greater simplification in shipping matters. On the contrary, it would seem that further comparison would be inevitable if the powers of the Dominions are extended. What does seem desirable is' that some agreement should be come to between the Commonwealth and New Zealand with regard to conditions of shipping, and, if possible, some agreement with the United Kingdom. At present the existing legislative powers are tending to confusion and difficulty, and to add needlessly, and without corresponding advantage, to the problems of British shipping. AllI can say is that that is the conclusion I formed from an independent study On the passing of the various powers, and that is the dictum of one of the ablest writers dealing with the powers of the Imperial Parliament in relation to the Dominions. journed.
