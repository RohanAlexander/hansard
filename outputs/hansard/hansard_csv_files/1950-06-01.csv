CIVI 1 AVIATION. question to the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation, and by way of explanation, I point out that the Latrobe Valley development Bcheme makes provision for a permanent aerodrome on a site that is now privately owned land between Morwell and Traralgon. An aero club at Morwell is at present using a paddock just outside that town which has been lent to it hy a farmer. However, that area has become dangerous as a landing ground for aircraft because the surface is very rough, and the aero club is not prepared to expend any money on levelling it. Will the Department of Civil Aviation consider the advisability of anticipating some of the expenditure that it will incur on the construction of the permanent landing ground in order to make the area suitable for use by the aero club ? the matter .to which the honourable gentleman has referred, and the course that I recommend is that the local governing body concerned should apply to the Department of Civil Aviation to despatch an officer to the aroa for the -rrurpose of discussing tbe problem with the various parties who are interested in it. That may be the .simplest approach to the matter..",9,Setup

WOOL. face my question to tlie Minister for Commerce and Agriculture with the explanation that when the British Government joined with the Australian, New Zealand and South African Governments in the formation of United Kingdom Dominion Wool Disposals Limited, which was known as the Joint Organization, it had a direct and very important financial interest to serve in the orderly marketing of the balance of its purchases under the war-time appraisement plans, totalling 10,000,000 bales. Now, however, the United Kingdom Government has indicated that it will not enter into any post-Joint Organization scheme unless it receives international approval. Does that decision mean that the matter will be referred to the International Wool Study Group? If so, will the Minister advise the House whether the Government is prepared to accept the decision of the International Wool Study Group, seeing that it is composed mainly of consumer countries, with a fair sprinkling of the socialist variety? In view of the fact that with the liquidaGovernment. In the circumstances, I tion of Joint Organization stocks of wool, Great Britain will have no corresponding interest to serve as a participant in a new floor price wool marketing plan designed to protect the interests of wool producers in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, will the Minister advise the House on what basis the United Kingdom Government asks to join the scheme seeing that it is primarily a consumer country? Will he also say whether the Government is prepared to enter into a scheme without Great Britain? -ber has referred to the conference that took place in London early this year beyour tattention to .the fact that up to the tween representatives of the three woolgrowing dominions and the United Kingdom Government. One outcome of the conference was a suggestion that there might be consultation on a wider basis than that which that conference provided. It was I am seeking to ask suggested that the most convenient method of consultation would he through the wool study group which consists of representatives of the important producing countries and all of the consumer countries. At the present time, the wool industry seeks to express itself with respect to certain aspects of that issue, and in view of the importance of the matter, I believe that I shall be warranted in making a prepared and rather fuller statement on the subject. I shall take the earliest opportunity to do that. for External Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government that Australia's representative to the Soviet who is now in Australia shall resume his duties at Moscow? Does the Government still consider that the expenditure involved in maintaining such official representation is justified? first part of the honourable member's question is "" No "" . As to the scond part of the question, the increasing cost of upkeep of our embassy at Moscow is a matter which has given me considerable concern, particularly since the recent revaluation of the rouble by the Soviet directed that a communication should be sent to the Soviet Embassy in this country making certain suggestions with respect to the costs involved, because it seems to me that we much consider the size and scope of our representation in Moscow from the standpoint of the return we are receiving for the money expended. I have not yet received a reply from the Soviet Embassy on this matter, but as soon as I do so I shall communicate it to the House. THE PAELIAMENT.",12,Thursday 1 June 1950

12,Mr Chifley,"Mr Speaker, I drawpresent three questions have been asked this morning and on each occasion you have given the call to a member of the Government parties, whilst you have completely ignored a member of the Opposition who has risen to ask a question. In addition, you have intimated that you cannot see one honourable member of this House. I regard that attitude as completely unjustified under any of the Standing Orders. If an honourable member has been guilty of some indiscretion and you feel that he should be corrected, he should be disciplined and the Opposition believes that it is your duty to take such action yourself either directly or by bringing the matter to the notice of the House, thus giving the House the opportunity to form judgment upon your decision. In view of this unwarranted intrusion upon the privileges and rights of honourable members, and I say so respectfully, I now move, under Standing Order 60That the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) lie now heard. seconded ? Minister) [10.39] -I , in common with many other honourable members, have been giving some thought to the difficulty that has arisen, because I feel-as I am sure you, Mr Speaker, would feel-tha to have an honourable member indefinitely excluded from either putting a question or speaking would be a most unhappy result. From what we know-and I have taken the opportunity to have a look at the record that was referred to-tw o things suggest themselves to my mind. I hope that you will be willing to hear me put them before you, Mr Speaker, and before the House. The first is that on the bare words of the record it would appear as if Mr Speaker had ordered the honourable member for Wilmot to go to his, Mr Speaker's, room. That, I am sure, is an order that you would not think of making, nor indeed would it be an order which, as I understand it, is within the competence of the Chair. But it may well be that the words used were misunderstood, and if in fact you were offering an invitation to the honourable member to check the figures to which you had referred, and that invitation was misunderstood as an order, I am sure that you would be very willing to say so and that you were not in any sense delivering an order to the honourable member. further than that, and the right honourable gentleman knows it. matter to the House because there may be room for misunderstanding about it. In the second place, the record equally shows that the honourable member for Wilmot, as I am sure he will agree, challenged the distribution of questions and had in terms said that more calls were being given to one side than to the other. Having regard to the figures that Mr Speaker then mentioned to the House of the calls given, I am perfectly certain that the honourable member for Wilmot would he disposed to withdraw the imputation contained in his statement. If we are to proceed with the business of the House in a civilized way, what I have suggested is f u l l of good sense and any misunderstanding contained in the words used by Mr Speaker could be resolved by Mr Speaker making it clear that no order was given or made. own view. After all, I and other honourable members have to be the judges of this matter. T am making my observations primarily, if I may so with respect, to Mr Speaker and to the honourable member for Wilmot. I suggest that the course I have proposed will enable us to proceed, without further distraction, with the business of the Parliament. support the motion. The honourable member for Wilmot has been denied his privileges and rights in this House by Mr Speaker's refusal to enable him to exercise the right, which every honourable member enjoys under the Standing Orders, to address a question to a Minister of the Crown. I think it is quite clear that the point that was made -hy the honourable member for Wilmot on the motion for the adjournment of the House last Thursday was that during the 35 minutes in which questions are",13,Questions

The honourable member for Darling( Mr think that you have handled the matter Clark) will also withdraw and apologize for his statement. Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister has made the point that there has been a difference of opinion on these matters. I am merely stating my opinion. The question 'before the House is whether the honourable member for Wilmot who represents the electors of the division of Wilmot is to be continuously denied the right of a hearing in this House or whether he is to be heard. I consider that the onus now lies upon the Government to say whether the honourable member's rights and privileges in this Parliament shall be withheld or whether the honourable member shall be allowed to address a question to a Minister. The incident during which the honourable member is said to have offended the Chair occurred at a specific time on Thursdaynight. If on that occasion the honourable member said anything to which the Chair took objection, that is, if he had cast a. reflection upon the Chair, the Standing Orders provide that the Speaker should there and then have called upon him to withdraw any such reflection just as you, Mr Speaker, did a few minutes ago in my case. The honourable member could then have withdrawn if you had ruled that his statement was a reflection upon the Chair. You did not do so at that time, Mr Speaker. Consequently, it cannot be considered that the honourable member in any way reflected upon the Chair. If you considered the honourable member out of order at the time when he raised the matter, because you believed he should have raised it on a substantive motion as provided in the Standing Orders, you should have ruled him out of order on that score. Certainly the honourable member for Wilmot has not erred in the attitude that he adopted on Thursday night. I consider that you, yourself, Mr Speaker, erred in not ruling him out of order for raising a matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House that I withdraw and he should have raised by way of a substantive motion. I repeat that you should then and there have called for a withdrawal if you considered that his statement was a reflection on the Chair. I wrongly. The honourable member for Wilmot made his statements to you in good faith and is entitled to his opinions. I have much pleasure, therefore, in supporting the motion that he be now heard. I consider that the House should, in justice to the honourable member for Wilmot and to its own precedents, adopt the motion. In supporting the motion I desire to lay emphasis on Standing Order 60, which states able gentleman is now canvassing a decision of the House yesterday. He may not do so. Opposition has moved that the honourable member be now heard and under Standing Order 60 Order 60 has no bearing on the matter. and leave it for the House to decide.",14,Questions

34,Mr Clark,"I support the motion[10.48] -There appears to be a good deal of misunderstanding on this subject. I was in the House when the incident occurred on Thursday night. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) made certain statements which were proved to be inaccurate by the reply given by y° > ^'Speaker. The honourable u r member for Wilmot did not question the authenticity of the records from which you read.' If he questioned the reliability of those records he has had ample opportunity to examine them. I understand that he has not taken advantage of your offer to do so. It is the ordinary and decent thing for a man who has made a misstatement in good faith to retract his misstatement without being asked to withdraw and apologize when his mistake has been pointed out to him. I believe there was a very easy way out for the honourable member for Wilmot. If he accepted the authenticity of the figures that you j gave, it was quite easy for him to admit that he had made a mistake. He could have said, "" I do not wish to question your impartiality, Mr Speaker; I am prepared on the strength of the statement that, you have made to withdraw and offer my sincere apologies "". I am sure that the incident would then have been closed. When you made your remarks, Mr Speaker, I understood that it was with the express intention of allowing the honourable member for Wilmot to examine the records that you had kept of the number of questions asked by the members of the different parties in this House. He has not availed himself of that opportunity. The authenticity of your records has not been questioned, but has been accepted by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr with the aggregate number of questions Beazley) and I suggest that instead of censuring the Speaker it would be better for the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr members are aware, the important part Chifley) to suggest to the honourable member for Wilmot that he do the honest and manly thing on this occasion and admit his mistake. words used by the honourable member are plainly a reflection on the honourable member for Wilmot. to which ""you take objection? the honest and manly thing.""

I witnessed what occurred during the debate on the adjournment of the House on that occasion and in my opinion the honourable member for Wilmot did not for a moment challenge Mr Speaker's impartiality. What he did. was to ask for an alteration of thesystem under which the call was givenfor questions. He did not deal asked but with the method by which members were called. As all honourable of question-time is the early part of that period. The aggregate figures concerning members who had been called did not' have much to do with the honourable member's suggestion.

However, no suggestion was then made that the honourable member was out of order. He was not called to order and the heavy penalty of suspension was never suggested, but to-day, as a result of your subsequent action, Mr Speaker, the honourable member for ""Wilmot, although he is entitled to enjoy the ordinary privileges of the House and is able to sit with honourable members, is denied his privileges as an honourable member. That is an unheard of situation and it has caused the Leader of the Opposition to move this motion. I do not want to add any additional fuel to the flames of this dispute. I think it is a most unhappy incident. I submit, Mr Speaker, with the greatest of respect that you did, in substance, comhave given to the Opposition, when themand the honourable member to do something which you had no right to command him. to do and it would have been most undignified for the honourable member to have obeyed such a command. You gave your version of the facts and nobody disputes the correctness of the figures that you gave. However, they are quite irrelevant. Finally, I turn to what was said by the Prime Minister. What he saidamounts to a suggestion that you should take the initiative in this matter. So far, I have not noticed any indication of your doing that. I submit that in the absence of action on your part, the House and the Prime Minister should support this motion. Everybody can see tbe Prime Minister's view of this matter; it is implied in everything that he said to-day and in everything that he did. not say yesterday. It is the duty of the House to support the motion. member for Barton has stated that last Thursday night the honourable member for Wilmot referred to the first35 minutes of' questions. I have the record in front of me, and it is quite clear that he did not mention the first 35 minutes. He did say that I was granting two questions to Government members for every one that I granted to the Opposition. That statement is absolutely untrue. It was a gross reflection upon my impartiality in this position, and instead of calling upon the honourable member to withdraw forthwith I did what, upon looking it over, I think was perhaps a weak thing. Nevertheless it was a merciful thing. I gave the honorable member an opportunity to come to my office Mt. WARD -You ordered him. member says that I ordered him, he will be in trouble. The record is here, and it shows that the word "" order ""' was never used. The word "" direct"" was never used. I said that, the honourable gentleman "" will come to my office"" and examine the record and will make his explanation to the' House. If an honourable member gets up in this House, and says that I , have given two callsto the Government side for every one I facts prove that not on any day since I took this chair has that happened or anything like it, then I say that such a statement is a gross reflection upon my impartiality in this chair and my administration of the office to which I have been elected. I say that so far as I am concerned, what I require of the honourable member is an, apology for the imputation cast upon my impartiality last Thursday night. As to whether he comes to my office, I am quite easy on that-quit e easy indeed. I thought that the honourable gentleman would be a man who would at least have truth on his lips and justice in his heart. If he had examined the records, then his statement was knowingly untrue. If he had not examined the recordsj then he made a completely and utterly irresponsible and indefensible attack on my impartiality.

In the first place the question arises as imputation was made, and the facts to whether you, Mr Speaker, have directed a member of this House to attend you in your rooms. I am sure that you will agree with me, sir, that no member of this Parliament should submit to any such direction, and I am glad that your own words have indicated that you did not intend that impression to be conveyed although I must confess that the words. "" He will come to my office"", were very inapt. I can understand an honourable member construing such words as a direction to him to see the Speaker in his room. I do not believe that any honourable member will support the proposition that a member of the Parliament who has been sent to this place to represent a constituency should be told by anybody to report to the Speaker. The Speaker has control of the House here. He can discipline an honourable member for conduct that contravenes the Standing Orders and he can call upon the House to punish any honourable member for anything that he may have done of that character. Having made those statements, I make an appeal to the honourable member for Wilmot. I do so, not with a desire to gain party advantage, but with a desire to ensure that this Parliament shall work effectively. I have clearly indicated my view that in no circumstances can a Speaker demand that a member of the Parliament see him in his room. Indeed, I go so far as to say that in no circumstances could asking you a a Speaker punish an honourable member for refusing to see him in his room. I come now to the fact that the honourable member for Wilmot did make a charge of gross partiality against the Speaker. Both sides of this question have to be studied. If honourable members will view the matter objectively, it must be clear to them that, if a member of the Parliament says that the Speaker has deliberately called upon one side of the House as against the other side so as to give an advantage to the Government side over the Opposition side, that is one of the most serious charges that could be levelled at a Speaker, whose function is to preside impartially over the deliberations of this assembly. It seems to be commonly agreed that such an establish it beyond any doubt. Therefore, whilst I say that it is wrong for a Speaker to use language that, in my judgment, is indicative of compulsion upon an honourable member to attend him outside the chamber, I contend also that it is equally wrong for an honourable member to make a charge of gross partiality against the Speaker. WhatI am trying to do is to find ways in which this Parliament may work effectively. I am trying to approach the matter reasonably, and I suggest to the honourable member for Wilmot that, if he would indicate that he withdraws the charge of gross partiality against the Speaker, the incident can be closed and the honourable member can be heard as he ought to be heard. In those circumstances we could get on with the business of the Parliament. The speeches that have been made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) have been consistent with a. reasonable, honest and just approach to this matter. I regret that I cannot say as much for the speech that has been made by the honourable member for Corangavery greatly that you, Mr Speaker, have seen fit, in the statement that you have made, to aggravate what I consider to be a very serious offence.

No member of this Parliament can be directed by Mr Speaker to make a. statement following an interview that he has had with Mr Speaker at the direction of Mr Speaker. It is idle to quibble, as apparently some honourable members are attempting to do, about the question whether or not the words, "" He will come to my office"", constitute a direction. Only one interpretation can be placed upon that. The words "" The honourable member will see me"" are imperative, and they mean, "" The honourable member shall see me"" or "" I direct the honourable member to see me "". Any other interpretation of that expression is purely a dishonest quibble. The Prime -Speaker, and to the honourable member for Wilmot. I waited, although I had intended to rise earlier, because I thought that you might have risen, and admitted that you were in error. I feel that you have not done so, and that you have actually aggravated the offence which you committed on a previous occasion. It is clearly established that the honourable member for Wilmot made no charges of partiality against the Chair. member for Wilmot did not make such charges against the Chair. He followed the line which I followed on a former occasion, because we had been clearly told that Mr Speaker intended, when debates such as the Address-in-Reply and other subjects which were not contested, and at question time, to have regard for the number of members on both sides of the House. I thought that there was no disagreement upon Mr Speaker's decision on that matter. I was told by our party Whip and by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) that Mr Speaker intended on such occasions to give a greater number of calls to the combined Government parties than to the Opposition parties. had done so. true. been made to honourable members to discuss this matter with reason and restraint. I hope that that appeal with be heeded. It has been said to-day that members of the Opposition have asked more questions on some occasions than Government supporters have asked. If that statement be true in relation to some occasions, it must of necessity follow, that on those particular days, members of the Government parties were not seeking to ask questions. The fact that it may be said that the Opposition has asked more questions on a particular day than the combined Government parties have asked is not proof of that statement. tion at question time? A Government supporter receives the first call, and an Opposition member receives the second call, and assuming that the call then alternates between Government and Opposition members, the Government parties and the Opposition must have an equal number of calls.

I had accepted it as a practice, which had been adopted by Mr Speaker, that he would call, in turn, a member of the Liberal party, a member of the Opposition, a member of the Australian Country party, a member of the Liberal party, and so on, and I was never in doubt about the position.

You, Mr Speaker, at that moment, could have asked the honourable member to withdraw that remark, to apologize to the Chair for having made it, and to resume his seat. Had. the honourable member not obeyed the Chair, you could have suspended him from the service of the House"", or taken such other action as the situation required. It is idle to-day to say that the fact that you did not ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw the remark, apologize to the Chair for having made it, and resume his seat was a show of weakness on your part.

It has been suggested that the honourable member for Wilmot should apologize to tlie House and to you, Mr Speaker. There may be some reason for that, if you, sir, are prepared to make a humble apology to the honourable member and to the House for the stand that you yourself have taken. I believe that if you are not prepared to do that, members of the Government parties cannot logically oppose the motion. We contend that it protects the rights of not only the honourable member for Wilmot, but of all honourable members. If the motion is determined on party lines, -and if the Government, with its weight of numbers, upholds Mr Speaker once more, not one but two dangerous precedents will be established. It will be said that Mr Speaker can direct an honourable member not only to attend him in his rooms, but also to make a statement to the House about that fact on the following, day. The information which has 'been given about the number of calls that has been granted to members of the combined Government parties and of the Opposition, may be correct. The figures probably are correct, but the point which I wish to make -is -that they are irrelevant to this debate.

81,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister fordebate, and not one issue, as has been represented by the Opposition speakers. The first important issue is one which they have rightly stressed, and that is the rights which are enjoyed by private members to be called in their turn in this chamber and to put thn views of their constituents before the Parliament. No honourable member in any part of the House would support action which would take away from the private member the rights which he should enjoy. It has been made perfectly clear by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) that the Government will protect the rights of the private member against invasion, whether it be by any one outside this Parliament, or even by Mr Speaker himself. We would not lend ourselves to a situation in which Mr Speaker, acting beyond the disciplinary powers available to him under the Standing Orders, sought to direct members of the Parliament on what they should do in the manner which has been suggested, but you, sir, by your own statement from the chair, have made it quite .clear that such is not the real matter at issue now. It may be that the words which you used on a former occasion were not happily chosen, but, at least, you have said from the chair to-day that what you require, in substance, is some redress for a charge of gross partiality which has been made quite deliberately against you. That is the second issue which is involved in this discussion. The first issue may be the rights and privileges of private members, but the second issue is the authority and impartiality of the Chair. One issue is -not less important than the 'other is -Speaker is readily accessible, inforThis Parliament cannot function unless there is a general .acceptance by honourable members generally, and by Mr Mr Speaker's rooms, if he desired to Speaker himself, that the presiding officer maintains authority in the Chair without partiality to one side or the other, to every section of the Parliament, and to every member of it. It is of the -me to attend at your rooms "". If there utmost importance, therefore, that the impartiality of Mr Speaker should at all times be maintained, and that when that impartiality is challenged without cause, suitable redress shall be made. Your impartiality was unquestionably challenged directly by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie). I was in the House when the honourable member was speaking, and I heard his statement. He did not put his remarks in the form of a question, but he made direct allegations which had no meaning other than that you had quite deliberately, and acting with partiality to the Government side, denied reasonable opportunities to members of the Opposition. self, did not object .to it at the time. the time because Mr Speaker dealt with that matter himself. It is not for me or for any other Minister when the Speaker -is able to defend his own position to interfere in such circumstances. That is the Speaker's prerogative and also his responsibility. The honourable member for Wilmot made a clear charge against the 'Speaker which, on the facts, Mr Speaker refuted. At that time, the honourable member might have risen and said, in effect, ""On the facts you have given me, Mr Speaker, I see that I was in error and I desire to express regret if I have unwittingly made any allegation of partiality against you"". If we assume that the honourable member felt that he had been affronted at the time by the terms of Mr Speaker's comment, or that he felt that Mr Speaker had gone beyond what was proper in the circumstances the fact remains that the honourable member has had some days in which to take the course that common sense would have suggested to any honourable member. The mally, to every honourable member and the honourable member could have gone to him privately-no t necessarily to preserve a point of principle-and said, in effect, "" I .desire to express regret for what I said, but I icannot concede as a matter of principle that you can direct had been .any misunderstanding in the matter it could have been rectified in that way.

83,Mr Holt,"I did not object to it atBut, whatever may have been the merits of the case so far as the honourable member is concerned, he has done nothing to remedy his position. He has lent himself to a shabby party manoeuvre on the part of the Labour party. I say that deliberately. If the Opposition had made an effort in good faith to remedy the position, it could have heen remedied; but the Opposition has not made any such effort. What happened in this House yesterday? Opposition entered the chamber determined to stage an incident. Normally, from 20 to 30 honourable members opposite would rise when the Speaker called for questions without notice, but yestermember for Melbourne. day not one of them, except the honourable member for Wilmot, endeavoured to obtain the call. That happened three times, and the Leader of the Opposition, with a great show of moral indignation, then advanced to the table to make his protest. The right honourable gentleman was followed by his deputy, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who had carefully extracted from the Hansard"" flat"" the relevant pages and with his brief in his hand he endeavoured to stage a party stunt. Only a few weeks ago the Prime Minister( Mr whether an honourable member happens Menzies) exposed the tactics that thp Opposition has been adopting in relation to Mr Speaker. From the moment that Mr Speaker was chosen, honourable members opposite have set out to undermine his authority in the chair and have resorted to every manoeuvre in their power in order to discredit him. They have done that not as part of a personal vendetta against Mr Speaker, but as part of a campaign to discredit the Government. Those are the tactics that the Opposition has adopted. The Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) have clearly established the point of principle at issue so far as the Government is concerned. We affirm the principle that we shall not permit any invasion of the rights of private members by the Speaker, or by any one else, and that we shall not lend ourselves to a direction that an honourable member can be disciplined in the Speaker's private rooms. But you, Mr Speaker, have made it clear Mr Holt. this morning that all that you require from the honourable member is a public expression by him of regret for having made a charge against you which he made deliberately and in public. That is all that you require the honourable member to do, and that is what any honourable member with a sense of fairness and justice after having made an error would do. I hope that the honourable member for Wilmot will be prepared to take the Members of the decent and honest course in this matter. I and my colleagues will not lend ourselves to what is merely a party stunt on the part of the Opposition. Mr Speaker That the question he now put. Speaker.

100,Mr Speaker,"I must insist onceshould be taken by the State governments interested in the Callide deposits, in conjunction with the Australian Government, of the opportunity to develop the Callide field. I am glad that the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) is present in the House, because I know that he is eager to do everything possible to enable the field to be developed. The statement that the Queensland Government was not approached to conclude contracts covering coal, from the Callide field is absolutely incorrect. I propose to state the facts, so that honourable members may be able to make up their own minds about this matter free from politic cal considerations. When the Victorian Government was short of fuel in 1948', I , as the responsible Minister of that Government, wasauthorized to go to Queensland to ascertain whether I could obtain coal from the Callide field in order to assist the State Electricity Commission to maintain electricity supplies for industry and to provide warmth in the homes of Victoria during the winter of 1949. I visited the field in July, 1948. The only leases then being worked were those owned by the firm of Wood, Parnell and Julin, and by a man named Neil. The leases owned by the firm to which I have referred were not being developed in a manner that, offered prospects of the. Victorian Government being able to obtain its coal requirements from that source. In addition, the price quoted by the firm was so high that the Victorian Government did not consider a purchase on that, basis. I discussed the matter with representatives of the Queensland Government, including the Premier. It was mutually agreed that as the Queens^ land Government intended, in the early part of 1949, to appoint a coal board to act liminary contract for the supply of 30,000 as arbitrator in relation to price and conditions, it would be better to leave the matter until the board had been appointed. Because it was obviously impossible to arrange for the development of the Callide field and provide loading facilities at the port of Gladstone in time for Victorian requirements for the winter of 1949 to be met, the Government of Victoria decided to obtain coal from overseas countries. Late in September, 1948 an order was placed for 100,000 tons of coal from India."" The supply of that coal was very largely responsible for the fact that, during the winter of 1949, the fuel position was very much better in Victoria than in other states. The Victorian Government wrote to the Premier of Queensland in January, 1949, stating that as the State Coal Board had now been established it would like to renew discussions and go into the question of a contract for the supply of 200,000 tons of Callide Valley coal each year for three years. We. received a letter from the Premier of Queensland, dated the 3rd March,. 1949, in which he said that the Queensland Government considered that it would be much better if we did not deal through the Queensland Coal Board but dealt direct with the directors of the Callide Valley mine, in which the Government had no direct interest, as its interests were concentrated in the Blair Athol mine. As a result, in April, 1949, after making certain arrangements with the directors of the Callide Valley mine, we gave the management apreliminary contract for the supply of 30,000 tons of Callide coal. It was only a preliminary contract because we desired to have the coal properly tested. The directors of the mine then asked the Queensland Government for leave to supply that amount of coal to Victoria. Acting on behalf of the Government the Queensland Coal Board said that no coal was to leave Queensland until that State had a. reserve supply of, I think, either 50,000 or 100,000 tons of coal. I am not criticizing the Queensland Government for desiring to accumulate a reserve at that time, when it saw trouble looming, but the fact remains that in Marchi t said that it was not interested and in April, after we had given a pretons, of coal, it would not allow the contract to be proceeded with. As soon as the coal strike was over we wrote to the Queensland Government and said that we wanted to go ahead with the contract and asked what the position was in regard to future supplies of coal from Callide Valley. In reply the Government, or the Queensland Coal Board, which is the same thing in effect, said that it could not give us any definite date upon which coal would be available, and that it did",23,Opposition Members Hear Hear
101,Mr Kent Hughes,"Advantag enot know in what quantities it would be able to supply coal. In other words, it said, "" You can have some coal at some time of some quality at some price"". Would any honourable member or anybody who has done business even in a small way have proceeded with a contract of that nature ? Naturally, the answer is "" No "". At that time the Victorian Government had to prepare for the winter that lay .ahead, because it is impossible to obtain large supplies of coal at a. moment's notice. As the Queensland Government could give no definite answer the Victorian Government naturally went ahead and made fresh overseas contracts, not only with India but also with South Africa. The Queensland Government did not show any interest beyond a suggestion that it would be prepared, as I have said, to let us have some coal at some time of some quality at some price. It did not in fact show any interest until the present Government said that it intended to buy coal from overseas and to subsidize Victoria and New South Wales so that more coal mined in New South Wales would be left for use in that State. Those are the facts of the case. We knew how much coal could be produced from Callide Valley. We even tried to help in the supply of the necessary steel. We had the chairman of the Gladstone Harbour Board down in Melbourne trying to help to obtain equipment. We knew that Gladstone harbour had a depth of 27 feet of water and that Rockhampton had a depth of only 14 feet, but we were not interested in the local squabble. We wanted to help Queensland to develop its own coal-fields. I understand now that the quantity of coal that could be exported to other States from Callide Valley is about 250,000 tons a year. But we cannot he expected to buy coal of 10,400 British thermal units at the same price as -coal of 12,000 British thermal units and over. with 12,000 British thermal units come State Ministers of Health, representatives from ? from South Africa. Nobody should be was to be held, and that poliomyelitis expected to make such a contract unless would be discussed in common with it is a firm contract with an assurance of other problems. Last April the New definite regular supplies coming in every South Wales Minister for Health, Mr month. I am sure that such supplies Kelly, said that he knew nothing about could be obtained if a conference of the interested parties were called. I understand that such a conference has been called. Mr .SPEAKER -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. some time a very serious epidemic of poliomyelitis has been raging in two States, but the Government appears to be totally unaware of the fact despite the news items about the subject that appear in the press and that are broadcast almost daily. Either the Government is not concerned about the situation or it is powerless to act. Whether or not the Government is aware of the seriousness of the position, its attitude is in keeping with its policy generally on the question of national health. It appears to be fiddling, as Nero fiddled while Rome was burning. The Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) is fumbling and dithering around in connection with the Government's national health proposals and conferring with certain business and professional interests that may be concerned with their own economic interests, while many people in the community, particularly little children, are suffering. Even grown-ups are victims of the dreadful scourge of poliomyelitis. The Minister may be quite sincere in his desire to devise a practicable national health scheme, but he should not allow himself to be pushed around by those whose main concern is their own economic interests. After all, the health of the community is the Government's responsibility, and the Government should act fearlessly on behalf of the community irrespective of any vested interest. As evidence of the futility of the Government in this connection I mention the fact that some months ago the Minister assured the House, in reply to questions asked by of State Departments of Health and of",24,Opposition Members Hear Hear

104,Mr Morgan (Reid) [11.40],"Forfhe matter and had not received any invitation to a conference between State Ministers of Health and Commonwealth authorities for the purpose of discussing poliomyelitis, although he knew that some conference to deal with health matters generally had been proposed. Apparently nothing has come of that conference and the matter seems to have vanished into thin air, like the Minister for Health himself, because he has not been seen in the Bouse for the last week or so. The matter of dealing with poliomyelitis has apparently heen left to various high-minded citizens and bodies. Tn South Australia, where the epidemic has reached its gravest proportions, a research body has for some time been attempting to discover the cause of, and a cure for, the disease. That body was sponsored by the South Australian. Government and various local organizations. A committee was established comprising Dr. Southcott, Dr. Crosby, and Mr noticed at Prince Henry Hospital, and he N. S. Stenhouse of the Commonwealth Scientific Organization. Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney has been endeavouring to establish an institute of epidemiology. medical superintendent of that institution, Dr. ""Walters, has shown considerable interest in the matter, and Dr. Stanley was recently sent overseas to study methods of treatment and the progress of research in other countries. He has returned to Australia, after finding that re latively little progress has been made overseas, to seek a solution in Australia. The Kenny clinic has been operating for some time at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, but has been slowly strangled because the orthodox medical men in charge of tliat hospital do not regard it sympathetically, and because patients attending the clinic are being diverted to orthodox medical practitioners. separated areas and that young persons in As a result, the Kenny clinic will soon have to close down.

There is Mr Morgan. the National Health aud Medical Research Council the province of which is to encourage and assist research into various health matters which I presume include poliomyelitis. The following report appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20th May:The Medical Superintendent of Prince Henry Hospital, Dr. C. J. M . Walters, said last night that an approach to the National Health and Medical Eesearch Council for funds to finance research into poliomyelitis had been turned down flat. He was commenting on Sir Earle Page's statement on Thursday that proposals to establish an Institute of Epidemiology for research into polio should be submitted to the research council if financial help was required. Dr. Walter.* said it was not the province of those engaged in research to approach the council. It was the council's job to seek out scientists and research worker? and see what help they needed to carry on their work. Some years ago, when Professor Pratt had sought financial assistance from the eouneil to carry out research into polio, he was refused. Dr. Walters said the polio epidemic appeared to be on the up-grade and not abating as it seemed a few weeks ago. This had been thought the same .position applied at the and Industrial Research Children's Hospital. The Acting DirectorGjeneivil of Health. Dr. H . G. Wallace, said from the number of cases notified the epidemic a-ppeared to be holding a constant level. The The notified eases iii the last fortnight were slightly fewer than in tlie previous two weeks. Metropolitan cases numbered slightly more than country. Dr. Wallace said there had been about 1,000 cases of polio in the South Australian epidemic and 4.00 here. For an unknown reason, the South Australian death-rate was lower than in New South Wales. Four more cases of polio, bringing this year's total to 274, were reported to the New South Wales Health Department yesterday. During the same period of last year there were 40 cases. Two of the cases reported yesterday were girls and two were boys. They came from Balldale, Wellington, East Bankstown and Bondi Junction. Their ages were one, six, nine and seventeen years. Honourable members will note that these cases were reported from very widely the community were affected. That fact may provide a clue for those who are inquiring into the cause of poliomyelitis. search Council, instead of encouraging The encouragement of the activities of people who are very The machinery -more concerned with immunizing people throughout the community against an epidemic that has not even reached this country. On the 20th May, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the council recommended a wide programme of vaccination to prevent the introduction of smallpox into Australia. The Herald report statedThe Council in a report to the Federal Government suggests, as a precautionary measure, vaccination of 'persons liable to smallpox exposure, with re-vaccination after three years. deposits of Australia and is capable of They would include medical practitioners, health inspectors, hospital, ambulance, airways and overseas shipping companies employees, wharf labourers, taxi drivers, shipping crews, policemen and press reporters. The Council also suggests voluntary vaccination of young children between three months and two years with re-vaccination on entering school. School authorities should be encouraged to ask for vaccination certificates when the child enters school. It seems that this body which is charged with the responsibility of undertaking research is concerned with having people innoculated against a disease that has not reached our shores, whilst it is not concerned with this one which is raging throughout the community. I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to consider re-constituting the Joint Committee on Social Security, which operated for many years under the previous Government and which did good work and made many recommendations that were incorporated in the 1,000,000 statutes. That body would be able to explore the various possibilities of throwments of Victoria and South Australia. ing light on the cause of poliomyelitis This is a temporary measure which is and could encourage research bodies, parintended to bridge the present gap ticularly the Prince Henry Institute of between Epidemiology, to investigate practices that are outside the range of orthodox medicine, such as Sister Kenny's method of treatment and that exercised by mining Callide coal.

The present market, coal that was raised by the honourable would absorb much less than that quanmember for Chisholm( Mr Kent tity. The costs of production at Callide Hughes). Possibly honourable members are now relatively high. The cost of are not familiar with the record of the honourable member for Chisholm in matters of this kind but when he was a prominent member of the Victorian Government recently he made continuous efforts to encourage the development of Victorian and Australian natural resources. He was very interested in Callide coal. Callide is one of the great being exploited by open-cutting. The size of the deposit is not yet known with any precision, but it is known that it contains many millions of tons of coal and, I believe, may even contain tens of millions of tons. I have visited both of the open-cuts and have travelled along the road between Callide and Gladstone and I can assure the House that the Government is most anxious' to co-operate with the Government of Queensland in the development of the coal in that State. Callide is now being developed in two small open-cuts the tonnage from which ha? been very small. The sole market for the coal at present is in Brisbane whev it is used to produce thermal generated power and it seems clear that if C alii do is to be developed the principal market? for its output must be sought in Victoria and South Australia. The Commonwealth is importing about tons of coal for the Governconsumption and production of Australian coal. I assure the honourable member for Chisholm that the Government is actively pursuing the matter of ( Mr Menzies) has recently held discuswith the Premiers of South Australia and Victoria and, possibly as n least one Minister and officers of the Government of Victoria, are to visit night.

106,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister fordelivering it to the wharf at Melbourne' is something over five guineas' a ton because this has been done on a very piecemeal basis. I believe that the coal, is being mined with what is not wholly adequate equipment. It is being taken by road from Callide, a distance of between 50 and 70 miles, to Gladstone in trucks which are largely unsuitable for the job. There is no coal-handling equipment at the Gladstone wharf. Cargoes are shipped from Gladstone to the south intermittently and, consequently, the freight rates are very high indeed. In addition, the Queensland Government is exacting a toll of 5s. a ton on all coal transported by road from Callideto Gladstone so at present all the cards are stacked against Callide coal. thermal units of Callide coal compare with those of imported coal? less. The British thermal units of Callide coal are 10,400 whereas those of other imported coal are 11,500 and over. The figures for Indian coal are 11.5 and for South African coal over 12. If the operators of Callide coal are able to get orders for about 250,000 tons a year for southern markets in Victoria and South Australia, [ have no doubt, having been through the figures item by item, that that coal will be delivered for something like £4 a ton, and not £5 5s. 6d. a ton, on the wharf in Melbourne. That is rather more than the cost of New South Wales coal, on a British thermal unit basis, delivered in Melbourne, but tbe purchase of that coal will greatly improve the condition of industry in the south. I can only hope that the visit of the Ministers of the South Australian and Victorian Governments to Callide will result in orders for coal, not merely for one year but, in order to get this undertaking going on a business-like basis, for two, three or four years ahead. If Callide were to get orders to a minimum of 250,000 tons a year for three years, the coal could be delivered in Melbourne 'for very much less than is being paid at present. The road at Callide is being improved, and the Gladstone Harbour Trust is installing adequate modern coal handling equipment at the port of Gladstone which will reduce the cost of coal by 2s. or more a ton. If regular cargoes"" are delivered to the south, I am sure that the shipping companies will charge freight rates considerably less than they are' charging at present. I have high hopes for the Callide field. I know it fairly well personally, and I believe that it is capable of vastly greater development. It. is for the four governments,, the Australian, the Queensland, the Victorian and the South Australian, to get together and iron out the relatively small problems involved. If that is done we shall be able to ensure, particularly for the southern States, a large and important additional supply of coal. On the developmental side I am greatly concerned, because coal is the base of our economic pyramid in Australia. That has become apparent over the last twenty years because of the tremendous upsurge of mechanization in secondary and primary industry. Coal is the basic factor in primary and secondary industry. Even those who never see coal are at the present time almost entirely dependent for their livelihood on Australia being possessed of .adequate coal supplies. Callide is one of our important coal-producing areas. I believe that there is no reasonable doubt that Callide coal is not the best coal in Australiaby a long way. Its properties for steam raising and thermal power raising have been adequately tested in Brisbane. For a considerable time it has been subjected to tests by the experts of the Government of Victoria-,, and I believe that its quality is sufficiently high to make it most useful. A big future exists for this field, and 1 hope that the various governments concerned will be able to collaborate on production and distribution of Callide coal in the near future. I was pleased to hear the Minister for National. Development ( Mr Casey) say that the Government is anxious to develop the coal-fields of Queensland. It is true that the Blair Athol field contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world. It is also true that there are enormous deposits of coal at Callide.

109,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [11.59],"asked that consideration should be given by the Government to the subsidization of coal produced in Australia rather than overseas coal. In answer to a question I was informed by the Minister that the reason for the proposed importation of 1,000,000 tons of coal was that a gap between, consumption and production in Australia had to be bridged. We know that it will take the best part of twelve months to deliver that 1,000,000 tons of coal to Australia. When the Government was considering this importation, the two operators at Callide offered to supply 200,000 tonsof coal by the end of this year to consumers in the south. That was an offer to supply 200,000 tons of coal in the period during which 800,000 tons was being, brought from overseas, so that 1,000,000 tons would be made available for Australia within twelve months. The landed cost of Callide coal in Melbourne was £5 12s. 6d. a ton compared with £6 6s. 6d. to land South African coal, and £6 10s. to land Indian coal. The subsidy paid by the Government reduced the cost of the South African and Indian coal below that of Callide coal. Without the subsidy, the cost of Callide coal compared more than favourably with the cost of the coal imported from India and South Africa. In addition to that, as the honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Kent Hughes) said, the coal from South Africa has a heating value of 12,000 British thermal units, the Indian coal one of 11,500 and the Callide coal one of a little less. As a result of tests by the Brisbane City Council it was found that Callide coal has a heating value of 10,600 British thermal units. Tests made by the Queensland Mines Department showed 10,270 British thermal units, and tests by Gardner and Warner, of Melbourne, showed from 10,400 to 10,600 British thermal units. It will therefore be realized that Callide coal has not much less heating value than has South African or Indian coal'. However, Callide coal has a much lower ash content than Indian coal, the respective figures being I I per cent, and 23 per cent. In addition, Callide coal does not clinker. Therefore, Callide coal compares more than favourably with the coal that is to be brought to this country under subsidization by fhe Government. I should', now like to reply to one or two statements by the honourable member for Chisholm. He said that the Queensland Government did not make the offer to supply Callide coal to Victoria. Although the Labour party was charged, during the general election campaign, with wanting to socialize everything, the honourable member was told by the Premier of Queensland that he should deal directly with the owners of the Callide coal-field. The Queensland Government does not own the coal, it is owned by Wood, Parnell and Julin and by Neil. It should be remembered that the honourable member, when Minister for Transport in a Victorian government, spent some time in Queensland before a trial order was placed for 30,000 tons of Callide coal. That order was given when, everybody knew that a coal strike was imminent. At that time the Queensland Premier had the responsibility of ensuring that the Queensland people should have adequate supplies of coal during the crisis. His position would have been precarious if the Queensland people had been short of coal and had known that coal was leaving Callide for Victoria. Also, he was not far from a general election. what I said. honourable member, but neither was Victoria far from a general election. The position of the Queensland Premier under those circumstances would have been impossible and intolerable had he not done what he did. An honourable member said recently that the Queensland Government had submitted a bad sample of Callide coal for analysis. That was not true. The State Government has nothing to do with Callide coal. However, it is true that the engineer member of the Queensland Coal Board was present when certain tests were made of a sample of Callide coal that had been submitted by one of the companies that own the coal. Other' supporters of the Government have said that the State Government should' provide better transport services for the handling of Callide coal. In reply to them, I need only refer to a statement that was made by the present",28,Opposition Members Hear Hear

The present Prime Minister made the following statement to an audience at the Brisbane City Hall:We will nut in a decent transport syste i to replace the primitive set-up now at Callide. have to wait for years before they could That was a definite promise, but, although the Government has now been in office for seven months and the Prime Minister has told us that the coal problem has received the close consideration of Cabinet, it has not yet been honoured. In fact, the Government has done nothing to improve the arrangements for the transport of Callide coal. All its talk about developing Queensland's coal resources has been futile. At least it could take action to improve tlie situation by collaborating with the Queensland Government. Negotiations between it and the State Government for the purpose of increasing the coal output of Queensland, especially from the Callide field, were initiated some time ago but, according to the newspapers, the State Government has been waiting for weeks to obtain replies to communications that it has directed to this Government. The Government has mouthed great promises, but it has not followed them with constructive action. imported coal at the rate of approximately £2 a ton. In the circumstances, it should give favorable consideration at least to the claims of locally produced coal.

The prices of commodities are rising continually, and the Government has admitted time after time that the f l is now worth only about 10s. What is happening to the pensioners as this process of inflation continues? The Government expressed its concern for their situation in the Governor General's Speech on the 22nd February last, but six months have passed since then, and another six months is likely to elapse before we can expect it, to do anything to mitigate their hardships. I speak on behalf of all pensioners, but particularly for those who receive only £2 2s. 6d. a week. When I have raised the subject previously, supporters of the Government have asked by interjection, "" What did the Labour Government do?"". I remind them that I was not a member of this Parliament when, the previous Government was in office. In any case, I should fight for the welfare of the pensioners whatever government happened to be in power. I naturally expected that this Government would take the earliest opportunity to come to the aid of pensioners. It should do for them at least as much as has been done for other needy citizens of the world, both in Australia and in foreign countries. The Labour Government contributed £30,000,000 to the relief of distressed countries and encouraged the sending of food to the United Kingdom and European nations that were suffering from the effects of post-war shortages. Week after week, Australians send thousands of food parcels overseas and everybody approves of their actions. But the pensioners inside Australia are neglected. They are not able to augment their incomes by working overtime, as the Government suggests that employees in industry should do. The Governor General's speech at the opening of this Parliament contained the following passage:My Government realizes that the increase in the cost of living is accentuating the diffiwhether the Government proposes to culties with which age and widow pensioners in particular have to contend. My advisers realize, also, that the present system, under which various benefits are paid subject to a means test, gives rise to problems of which there is no easy solution. My Government, however, is closely investigating the most pressing anomalies to see what can be done to remove them. It believes, moreover, that the application of its financial and economic policy will result in improvement in the purchasing power of the currency, so that pensioners, as well as other fixed income groups, w ill benefit.

129,Mr Minogue,"Only time will showrelief for the purpose of assisting them to make adequate provision for themselves during the cold winter months. The Government has already shown special consideration for other sections of the community. For example, persons who were rendered homeless when disastrous floods occurred in many parts of the Commonwealth received assistance. I assure the Government that the plight of many pensioners is just as desperate as was that of the unfortunate people who almost starved during the floods. The Government has abolished the prohibition on the sale of cream, and I expect that it will abolish butter and tea rationing in the near future, yet the removal of those restrictions will not benefit the pensioners. They will see ample supplies of butter and tea in shop windows, but they will not be able to purensuring that they shall not go without chase them. Does any Government supporter contend that the pension of £2 2s. 6d. a week is adequate to defray rent, and the cost of the necessaries of life?

Chifley) told the people during the last general election campaign that, if the Labour party were returned to office, all pensions would be reviewed.

137,Mr Cramer (Bennelong^ [12.22],"Ithe Government of New South Wales, by many other bodies and, of course, by individuals. After the strike had ended, representations were made to the Commonwealth for the payment of compensation or, at least, a grant to cover some of those losses. Naturally, compensation could not be paid for all of them. I understand, from inquiries that I have made, that the Commonwealth gave to the Government of New South Wales a sum exceeding £3,250,000 to make up for some of the losses that it had sustained during that strike. As honourable members know, I have had an interest in electricity matters in Sydney. It was announced last week, on the auditor's certificate, that the Sydney County Council, which controls the greater part of Oiie distribution of electricity in the City of Sydney to more than 1,000,000 people, had sustained a loss of approximately £900,000 on its operations last year. agement has been made from time to time, against the Sydney County Council. M.r. DAVIES -There is a good deal of substance in that contention, too. ber for Cunningham ( Mr Davies) does not know very much about tlie subject. Statements have been made in this House to the effect that the Sydney County Council is largely responsible for the increased charges for electricity. I should like the Treasurer to provide some information about the representations that were made by the Government of New South Wales to induce the Commonwealth to grant it £3,250,000 in respect of the losses that were caused by the general stoppage on the coal-fields last year. I have a suspicion that the State Government's claim included the losses that were sustained on the generation of power. It may astonish the House to learn that the losses that were sustained directly by the Sydney County Council in providing electricity for the people during that general strike on the coal-fields amounted to approximately £750,000. In other words, £750,000 of the deficit of £900,000 on last year's operations was directly attributable to that strike. As a result of those losses, the Sydney County [120 ] Council has been obliged to increase the price of electricity to the people. The council has repeatedly requested the State Government to pay a part of that loss, because it has received from the Commonwealth approximately £3,250,000 in respect of losses that were caused by the general strike on the coal-fields. Unfortunately, the State Government has continually refused to grant any concession to the council for the work that it did at that time. Few people in New South Wales have any idea of the magnificent job that was done by the county council at that critical stage. Its foresight has been unjustifiably criticized for party political purposes. Did it not show foresight in expending £1,000,000 in order to fit the whole of its boilers at the Bunnerong power station with auxiliary equipment to burn oil instead of coal? Did it not show foresight when it established the biggest oil tank of its kind in Australia, with a capacity f 20,000 tons, and arranged for a subterranean pipeline to convey oil from tankers in the bay? Had it not been for the county council's foresight in those matters, the City of Sydney would have undergone one of the most tragic experiences that could possibly overtake a city. Supplies of electricity were maintained for essential industrial and commercial purposes, and domestic consumers were exposed to comparatively little hardship because the county council was able to produce electricity with its oil-burning equipment and, by that means, to maintain the City of Sydney at that critical time. In doing so, it incurred an expenditure of £750,000, and it has not received any compensation from the Government of New South Wales. I am wondering now whether it is yet too late to make an appeal to the Commonwealth for compensation, because it is definitely unfair-puttin g the matter on a national basis-that the users of electricity in Sydney should be obliged to pay higher charges as a result of the Communist-inspired strike on the coal-fields.

I am aware that within the last few years the friendly societies have increased their dispensary fee by as much as 200 per cent., whilst, at the same time, they are not dispensing nearly so much medicine as they used to dispense. ever, many medicaments required by pensioners are not obtainable at dispensaries that are controlled try friendly societies. For instance, sulphanilamide tablets whicb cannot be obtained at such dispensaries are sold by private chemists who charge move than friendly sosieties dispensaries would charge for them. The cost of medicines and medieal Watment represents a considerable proportion of the present amount of pension and leaves very little to pensioners with which to purchase the ordinary necessaries of life. Therefore, T urge the Government to provide assistance immediately for this sectionof the community. Numerous questions have been, asked by the Opposition upon this matter, but all our inquiries have merely been, referred to the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden). Apparently, we shall not know the Government'sintention, until the budget is' introduced next September.

That is not too much to ask ori behalf of the aged who have pioneered this young country. Furthermore, the"" present rate of pensions is not sufficient to enable recipients to attend entertainmertts or sporting fixtures at week-ends.

I point out that right from its inception the Callide coal-field has been worked by private firms, and that it has not been subject to any form of government control apart from the prohibition that the Queensland Government imposed upon the exportation of coal, from that State. This morning the honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Kent Hughes) revealed the real cause of the hold-up of the development of the field. The point I make is that regardless of whether the Queensland Government has acted rightly, or wrongly, in prohibiting the export of coal from. Queensland, the fact remains that if tliat prohibition had not been imposed the Callide field would now be supplying coal to the Victorian Government at the rate of 200,000 tons a year. Therefore, the blame in this matter must be laid at the door of the Queensland Government. Difficulties have also arisen in respect of the. transport of the coal from die field to the coast. allowed for this debate under Standing Order 291 has expired. Question resolved in the negative. Sitting suspended from 12.k5 to 2.15 p.m. (AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE' BILL 1950. Debate resumed from the 31st May (vide page 3505), on motion by Mr assurance of the passage of legislation That the bill be now read a second time. -This bill proposes to obviate deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate after a double dissolution. That purpose is admittedly very important. There is certainly need for some -measure of this kind. In the world to-day there is a formidable challenge to the system of parliamentary government. ""We defend that system; we lielieve it to be better than any other. As its champions our duty is to see that the syptem is workable and that it works, because the parliamentary system needs public confidence and public respect if it is to survive. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) warned us of the dangers in the recent decline of public respect for the institution of parliament. He reminded us that in many other countries people have been influenced to surrender their parliamentary institutions. That has been due, as he said, partly to the fact that the parliamertary institutions in those countries showed themselves incapable of taking courageous, prompt and unorthodox action when such action was required. _ The honourable member, who is the son of one of the fathers of federation, spoke yesterday thoughfully and informatively on this subject. He warned us that we stand in danger of losing our parliamentary institutions in Australia, and that what has happened elsewhere can happen in this country. That, of course, is a powerful reason for removing defects which we discover in the working of the parliamentary machine. It is clearly a defect that, a. double dissolution may perpetuate rather than resolve a deadlock between the two Houses. The purpose of a double dissolution is to end such a deadlock. The proportional representation system of the Senate demonstrably will result in a chamber containing 30 Labour members and 30 non-Labour members after a dissolution. That is unless one side or the other obtains at least 55 per cent, of the formal votes cast in at least one State. Political history shows how rarely that happens. The government of the day could have no transmitted to such an evenly divided chamber by the House of Representatives, and, equally, the Opposition would lack the numbers to amend government legislation. That position is established by tlie provision in the Constitution that equal voting in the Senate means the defeat of the question. When the last Parliament debated and altered the law relating to the method of Senate voting, no member of the Parliament directed attention to this consequence. The remarkable by-product of proportional representation-that it might destroy the",35,Opposition Members Hear Hear

151,' Mr Fraser (Eden,"Monaro) [2.15].value of a double dissolution-wa s not discussed in the Parliament. A correspondent of the Melbourne Age directed attention to the position early in January last. He was the first person I know of to do so. Shortly after the publication of his comments I gave a public address on this problem, and it was interesting to me to hear the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) devote his maiden speech to it. There can only be widespread regret that the honourable member has not been able to maintain in this House the high level and content of that opening address. Possibly the present period of chastening whicb he is now undergoing will have a salutary effect. "" For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth"", though how the Lord manages to love the honourable member for Mackellar may be beyond human comprehension. In one phase of his remarks on this subject the honourable member fell from the very high note he set himself. I refer to his accusation that the previous Labour Government deliberately brought about the position with which we are now confronted for its own future political advantage. That charge has been repeated during the debate on this bill. It is easy to demonstrate its absurdity. A Labour government, equally with any other government, needs a method of breaking Senate deadlocks. The disastrously at the hands of a hostile Senate. If the present position remains unremedied, and if a double dissolution no longer resolves a deadlock between the two Houses, a future Labour government may again suffer equally disastrously. Do not honourable members who make this charge of bad faith on the part of the .Labour Government realize that in fact they are also making a charge against the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) ? The Opposition is particularly charged in the Parliament with the duty of examining carefully all legislation and of publicly exposing its defects. Do honourable members opposite, when they make this charge, say that the Homer from Kooyong nodded, or that he saw the defect and concealed it for his party's political purposes? All such suggestions are unworthy and have no place in the present debate. It is agreed that a defect exists and it should be remedied in the interests of the smooth working of the parliamentary system. But surely no one claims that the bill deals with the only defect, or that the method proposed in this bill is the only way to overcome it. honourable member some idea of other methods that could be adopted ? honourable member for his interjection. Surely, since it is necessary to employ all the complicated and expensive machinery of constitutional change, there should first be most careful consideration before deciding what proposed change should be submitted to the people. And surely, since experience shows the practical impossibility of obtaining the consent of the people to an alteration of the Constitution which is opposed by a major political party, every effort should first be made to obtain agreement between the parties on the nature of the change to be submitted to the people. Let me deal first with the latter aspectthat every effort should first be made to obtain agreement between the parties. That should not be impossible because this is a matter which equally affects the interests of all political parties. All Scullin Government suffered of them are equally interested in the working of the democratic system. The holding of a constitutional referendum is arduous and expensive. A widespread campaign is necessary to bring the matters surrounding the proposal to the attention of the voters. The voters are required to give the proposal careful and detailed study. The cost of holding a referendum might well be approximately £200,000. Yet experience shows that referendum proposals are almost certain to be defeated unless both sides in politics agree on the terms of the change to be proposed and. join in recommending it to the electors of this country. What effort has been made on this occasion to obtain agreement between the parties on the terms of this proposed change? No effort has been made at all. On the contrary, the Government and its publicists, even prior to the presentation of the bill to the House, created an advance atmosphere calculated to",36,Mknmes

What other meaning ean be attributed to the advance heralding of this bill as "" A secret weapon to dish the Labour party "", and "" A bombshell to burst in the Labour caucus during the consideration of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill""? A number of such references were made before the measure was presented to the Parliament and before honourable members on this side of the House had any knowledge of what it contained. that those statements were not ministerially inspired. Government members interjecting, that they were directly inspired by Ministers. They were openly so inspired. No secret was made of the source of their inspiration. As a matter of fact, they were gloried in, no matter how foolish they sound now and. how much they may be regretted by those who inspired them. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) has no authority for saying that the statements to which he has referred were inspired by anybody. statement to which the honourable member has taken exception. that before this bill was presented to the Parliament statements were made that it was a "" A secret weapon to dish the Labour party"", and "" A bombshell to burst in the Labour caucus during the consideration of the Communist Party Dissolution B ill "" . I characterized those statements as having been ministerially inspired. member opposite can possibly know whether or not they were ministerially inspired. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has no authority for making such an assertion. statement in the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that should be withdrawn. He is entitled to express his opinions. Honourable members opposite are capable of expressing their own opinions in reply. statements were openly inspired by Ministers. They were gloried in, no matter how foolish they sound now and how much they might since be regretted. The movingfingerwrites, and, having writ, Moves on: nor all your piety nor wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a line Nor all your tears wash out a word of it. Nevertheless, I suggest that it is not too lute for the Government to repair the mistake that it made on that occasion. I do not think that that mistake was anything more than a mistake of political tactics. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) has, I understand, been recently promoted from the position of assistant witch hunter on the Government side to that of deputy chairman on the applause committee. I do not think, however, that even that honourable member would care to assert that his beloved leader is a master of political strategy or of human relations. The Government still has the obligation to endeavour to obtain agreement between the parties on the proposal that is to be submitted to the people. The other prerequisite for a constitutional change, with which I suggest that members of this House would generally be in agreement, is that before the proposal is submitted to the electorate there should be most careful consideration of its nature. The widest possible field of public discussion and thought should first be invited. That has been done in respect of other proposals for constitutional changes in former times, as was convincingly stated by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) yesterday. For reasons which it is very difficult indeed to fathom, that course has not been followed in this instance. The course pursued has been the exact reverse. Far from this constitutional measure being first thrown open for the widest possible discussion and for the assistance of the most expert minds on constitutional change, it wa» kept a complete secret from the Parliament until the very day of its introduction in the form of this measure.

162,Mr Fraser,"I repeat that thenot know to what extent honourable members on the Government side were taken into consultation about the details of the proposal before the bill was presented to the House, but I do know that not the slightest opportunity was given for a general discussion of the nature of the measure, such as the Government should, have permitted and initiated long before the bill itself was presented. The second extraordinary feature in the bill is that so far from it heing the product of the best minds in the community capable of dealing with a question' of constitutional reform, it is wholly the fruit of the mind of one man only. That man is himself not an elected representative of the people and is-not entitled to speak for anybody except himself. I have no doubt that he is a very worthy gentleman. An honourable member asks what evidence I have that the bill is the idea of only one man. On the day on which this bill was finally presented to the House the gentleman in question gave a press interview in Melbourne, in which he stated that the bill was, bolus bolus, his work, and that he was astonished to find that he had received no tribute or acknowledgment from the Government for that work. He later received a telegram from the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey), the contents of which were also published. The Minister telegraphed him in these terms, "" You should be a proud man to-dav on the presentation of this measure to the Parliament"". So be should be a proud man, when a bill that is solely the product of his mind is to be adopted by the whole of this Parliament as the very best proposal for the reform of the Senate that the combined wisdom of the Parliament can submit to the people of Australia. I suggest that the Government itself should not be proud of having adopted and presented to the Parliament a proposal for constitutional reform that is the product of the mind of one man only. It is clear from the structure of the bill became law the consequent minimum that the proposed change has not been enlargement of the House of Representawell considered. Nobody will deny that tives would have to allow for 48 some change along the lines suggested new members. The growth of populais desirable, but I consider that nobody tion may require an enlargement of would caTe to assert that this is the best this House by ten, twenty or 30 memform of change that could be evolved. bers, but this bill would prevent such No opportunity has been given for consideration and consultation regarding the proposal. The honourable member for Fremantle yesterday very clearly pointed to a number of weaknesses in this measure. The proposed change, if adopted by the people, would provide a means to enable the Government to face a double dissolution without throwing away the advantage of a majority in the Senate, which it would otherwise possess after the general election in 1952 unless the Labour part carried every one of the six States at that general election. It is a legitimate charge against the bona fides of the Government in this matter that it has so framed this legislation as to endeavour to preserve for itself the advantage of an almost certain majority. Secondly, the reform proposed does not touch the vital question of Senate by-elections, which was dealt with vety adequately by the honourable member for Fremantle yesterday. The Government has produced no answer at all to the Opposition's charge that the reason why it is not dealing with the vital question of Senate by-elections is that the present method enables it to control the election of a senator at a by-election in four States out of the six. The Government should face up to that position if it desires the support of this side of the House for this constitutional reform, and should be prepared to advance a reasonable proposal to the people. Thirdly, the bill has another very serious weakness in that it prevents the reasonable enlargement of the House of Representatives in accordance with the growth of population. The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have roughly twice as many members as the Senate has. Under the proposal contained in the bill the minimum Senate enlargement would be four senators for each State, or from ten senators to fourteen senators for each State, which would give a minimum total enlargement of 24 senators. If this bill an enlargement from being made and would, in fact, prevent tbe enlargement of the House until the population of the country had increased sufficiently to justify the enlargement of the House by 48 or 50 members. The bill will also weaken the influence of the electors and increase the power of political party organizers, as was pointed out yesterday by the honourable member for Fremantle. It will take away the present right of the electors to decide which senators shall be elected for a long term and which for a short term. That is a proper democratic right of the electors and this bill is weak yesterday that the people would not vote in that it removes the rights of the electors in that respect. That matter is also worthy of consideration, if the Government desires to present to the people a proposal that will have the support of al) major parties in the Parliament. Such support would give to the proposal a reasonable chance of being accepted by the people. Another serious weakness in the bill is system in which their fate would be that it proposes a permanent alteration entirely dominated by the wishes of the of the Constitution to deal with a situatwo largest States, New South Wales tion that has been caused by temporary and Victoria. I am quite sure that if legislation. The proportional representhe honourable member for Wilmot( Mr tation voting system for the Senate Duthie) had his rights in this House is admittedly an experiment that was made by an act of Parliament and that can be altered by another act able gentleman will resume his seat. of Parliament. However, once the proposed change has been made in the Constitution it may become permanent and may be a source of injury to the working of the parliamentary sys member for Sturt( Mr Wilson). tem.

Are there not a number of was having something to say about n simple ways in which the present diffidebate that took place in the House yesterculty in connection with deadlocks between day and was casting a reflection upon the Senate and the House of Representathe Chair. tives could be resolved?

It would mean only a minor change in the constitutional provision that where voting is equal the question should be resolved in the negative. That provision could be changed so that where voting was equal the question would be resolved in the affirmative. I do not wish to discuss at this stage whether or not the Senate should be allowed to exist at all. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) stated in favour of abolishing the Senate. I consider that his assessment of that matter is very probably correct. It is most unlikely that the people of the smaller States would vote in favour of the abolition of the Senate. Having some intimate knowledge of the conditions in some of the smaller StatesI would not blame the people of those States for being highly suspicious of a parliamentary gize for that statement. and apologized for my statement, Mr That sugpermission to continue my remarks.",38,Mknmes

I do not desire to be threatened. I conclude my remarks by saying that the Government's proposal is a matter whicli should properly be referred to a select committee of the Parliament, and should be dealt with only after full public discussion and by the assembled wisdom of the Parliament, in an endeavour to obtain united supportfor whatever proposal may be submitted to the people. There is no great urgency about this proposed change. When is it to operate? Is it intended that the referendum should be held prior to a double dissolution of the Parliament? If so, it is perfectly clear that the double dissolution which may be necessary to solve the difficulties now existing, cannot take place for very many months, if a referendum is first to be held. On the other hand if this proposal is to be submitted to the people by referendum, concurrently with the holding of a. general election following a double dissolution, which may occur early next year, then when will the principle, if established, usefully operate? History shows that double dissolutions are rare and that, on the law of averages it would be another 30 years before such a provision would be likely to operate. In all the circumstances there is plenty of time to make an effective change in connection with this matter. Some change is necessary and it is essential that such a change should be agreed upon by the major parties if it is to have a reasonable chance of success. I urge upon the Government the wisdom of referring the bill to a select committee of the Parliament. Mir. WILSOU (Sturt) [2.45] -The object of this bill is to enable the country to be governed according to the provision of the Constitution and to remove the deadlock which has arisen as the result of the legislation that was passed by the Labour Government last year. This question arose prior to the achievement of federation. Those great men who framed our Constitution realized that if we were to have an Australian Constitution which would work there must be some means of resolving deadlocks. There must be some means of enabling the will of the people to prevail. So, for weeks men drawn from every part of Australia devised ways and means of preventing a deadlock between the two Houses of the Parliament. Eventually' they arrived at a means of doing that which was incorporated in the Constitution and which worked satisfactorily until last year when the Labour party caused to be passed an alteration of the electoral bill which for all practical purposes has the effect of blocking the safety valve of the Constitution, and of destroying the very provision which enabled the Constitution to work. It destroyed the means of resolving deadlocks and it will enable the Senate to flout the will of the people. It is interesting to review the debates which took place in 1897 and 1898 which dealt with this very problem and to realize that this is not something that is merely incidental to the Constitution. It is something upon which the whole existence of the Constitution is based. The Honourable J. H . Carruthers, at page 543 of the Official Record of the Debates of the Australasian Federal Convention is reported as having saidIt would be a terrible state of affairs in future if we provided a Constitution so rigid that unconstitutional means would have to be adopted by the people to give expression to their wishes. At page 544 of this record the same gentleman is reported as having saidI fear, there will be a conservative opposition . to any proposal for providing against deadlock. To-day, the conservative party-the Labour party-is resisting this bill which is designed to enable the people's will to prevail. In other words, the Labour party which has.truly assumed the role of the tory and conservative parties is trying to block the will of the people. measure.",40,Mknmes

Honourable members on this side of the House would like to hear them because they want to solve this problem and would like to have the co-operation of the Labour party in doing so. The honourable member made a most extraordinary statement to the effect that this bill was kept secret. Suggestions have been made that members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties did not know anything about it. That statement is absolutely false and I suggest that it was made recklessly by the honourable member and without any belief in its truth. I knew all about this bill before it was introduced and. as far as I know, every other member of the Liberal and Australian Country parties knew all about it. Now the Government has introduced it and is informing the Labour party members all about it and inviting their support and. co-operation. Unfortunately, honourable members of the Opposition cannot understand the difference between their principles and those of the Government, parties. Our principle is that the House of Parliament is the proper place in which to introduce and discuss legislation. Honourable members of the Opposition seem to think that legislation should be introduced at an Australian Council of Trades Union or a caucus meeting and that once those bodies have made their decision members of Parliament should simply be rubber stamps for the purpose of endorsing it. Liberal party members have rights and responsibilities and they consider that this is the place to discuss bills. It is utter nonsense to suggest that this is a secret weapon or an atomic bomb. The only factor that has annoyed some people is that Liberal party members, when told things, do not blab them about the lobbies of the Houses of Parliament. Members of the Government parties, when they are given information, aet on it in the proper place, which is this House, and if members of the Labour party were annoyed because they did not know about this measure earlier, it is very nice to know that there are some people who are able to keep a confidence. The honourable member also complained that this bill was a product of one man's mind. I suggest that everything is originally the product of one man's mind, but the Government parties are not too proud to take advice and assistance from any humble citizen of this country, and if it was a humble citizen of Victoria, as some honourable members opposite have suggested, who put forward this scheme for resolving a deadlock, I congratulate him because it is a mighty fine scheme for the curing of the serious defect which the honourable member says is in the Constitution at the present time. dream ? ber for Eden-Monaro shows a much more intelligent approach to this problem than does the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin). The honourable member for Eden-Monaro admitted that this was one means of resolving a deadlock. His objection was that it was not the only means of doing so and did not go far enough. I think that other honourable members should attempt to make intelligent observations on this matter, which is vital to our constitutional system, instead of trying to be clowns. If this question had not been resolved when the Federal Convention met there would not have been an Australian Constitution to-day. Unless we do resolve the difficulty there will not be an Australian Constitution in the near future because sooner or later one of the Houses of Parliament will start to flout the will of the people and then continue to do so. If that occurs there will be no way of resolving the deadlock. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) spoke at great length about proportional representation. He claimed the credit of being the person who introduced it into this House and of eventually piloting it through to the statute-book. If proportional representation is to work properly, this amendment must be made. It is the system of proportional representation which has created the deadlock, and if it",42,Mknmes

He also said chat honourable members on this side of the House are conservative and must be won over by the fierce radicalism of the Government to do something so desperate and revolutionary that it will quicken the pulse of the people of this nation. He believes that this legislation is necesvested interests of the States. Those vested sary to ensure sane and well-ordered government. I agree that there is a considerable problem relative to the Senate, but I remind the honourable member for Sturt that his fears and protestations are about twenty years too late. In 1930, the will of the government was frustrated by the Senate in regard to legislation that affected the lives and happiness of the whole of the people of this nation. At that time, no anti-Labour voice was heard advocating liberalism and progressive thought because the anti-Labour parties gloried in the political opportunities given to them by the Constitution. They gloried in the opportunity to frustrate the will of the Labour Government; led by Mr Scullin. Pleas for mrecy from that Government were unheeded. The plea dealt with was no ordinary matter of government. It related to legistbe hard facts of life. After the recent lation designed to deal with the most desperate crisis that had ever occurred within living memory in Australia, and, in fact, in the world-the depression. The honourable member has spoken about virtue and trust and the necessity to approach thi? matter with a liberal mind. History has proved, particularly the history of events in 1930-31, that the party he represents did not think so at that time. I . also include the members of the Australian Oountry party in that remark. They snuggle up to the Liberal party and are known as the ""kiss, kiss, kiss in the corner"" group. Their attitude was the same as that of the Nationalist party during 1930-31. If the conservatives on the Government side of the House see anything wrong in this Constitution. I point out to them that their remedy is worse than the disease. The honourable member for Sturt made a good contribution to the debate in other parts of his speech, inasmuch as he analysed the difficulties facing the Government to-day. However, I must contest one of the points relied upon by the Government parties. That is the idolatry of the Constitution. History will show that there were very few toweringfiguresamong the so-called fathers of federation. Beyond a few State righters sanctified by miswritten history they were "" poor boys "". Only half a dozen men stood against the interests are sometimes represented in this House, where they try to frustrate an alteration of the Constitution which will give us true federation instead of a conglomeration of people sitting here pretending that they constitute a federal parliament. Actually the Constitution strips them, of all power. I do not idolize the fathers of federation, because in the desire to retain the sovereign rights of the State they drew up a ramshackle Constitution which provided for a ramshackle Senate. As the years have gone by it has been proved that this Senate suffers from all the troubles that ever beset a Senate. During mv first six years' membership of this House, the Senate was treated as a calm retreat for aged gentlemen who no longer worried about general election it became a roaring, raving lion, which chewed up legislation and spat it out to the great consternation and indignation of the Government. It, was only then that the Government developed a conscience. If Government senators had been in sufficient numbers to pass the Government's legislation we should not have heard anything about the necessity for democratic government. The curious thing about this attempt to bring democratic government to Australia is the completely involved algebraic equation put forward as a. means of solving the problem. While arithmetic is necessary, this involved equation may ultimately give the same result as a much simpler calculation. The Commonwealth Constitution is full of faults. We agree that it is not democratically good to have deadlocks, and we have searched as assiduously as the Government for solutions. Any solutions we proposed were rejected and tossed back in our faces. The human problem is to make the Senate work smoothly. Tho first point is the election of so many in and so many out. Then there is the fifty-fifty basis which, if this legislation is passed, would solve the problem for only one parliament. Have honourable members considered that? This proposal looks good on paper. It was rushed here, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) said, with all the glee of some one finding somebody else who had had a brainwave. I pay tribute to the disinterestedness of the gentleman from Melbourne who attempted to find a formula. His arguments were well intentioned; but the only way to deal with this matter is to put it to a select committee so that the brains of both Houses could be employed upon it. The Government has complained of criticism, but honourable members on this side of the House complain of the Government's precipitate action. measure was submitted as a plan to end all deadlocks, but it appears to be only a bright technicolour dream. In the morning, when we wake up, the dark problem remains. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Oalwell) last night gave a reasoned speech on the matter supported by statistics. The most ponderous statistics are talked about in this matter quite needlessly. A human problem exists in relation to the Senate which cannot be solved by mathematics. This bill will make confusion even worse confounded so far as the people are concerned. After all, the people are our masters and we .should bo able to provide for them somothing more simple than the prnypnt insarq complication of Senate voting. The fact that there were 505,000 informal Senate ballots at the last general election indicates that there is something wrong. Apparently, 500,000 voters found the difficulty of sorting out 20, 30 or even or Bill Jones is told that the bill pro40 names spread across one ballot paper was too great for them to resolve and, in desperation, voted merely for the sake of avoiding fines instead of for the sake of choosing the legislators to represent them in the Senate. Anybody who has been a booth worker at an election-and who in this House has not?-knows how difficult it is for some people to vote according to the silly democratic process that we have at present. Yet, the Government proposes to pile complication upon complication! The human factor cannot be ignored. In any case, I maintain that very little can be done to eliminate the perplexity that is caused by the multiplicity of candidates under the democratic system. How can we ease the mental confusion of a voter who is confronted with a ballot-paper almost as long as his arm? The Government's answer to the question apparently is to present each voter with two ballot-papers, or one that must be marked on both sides, in order that some candidates may be elected for six years and others for three years. The honourable member for Sturt. had the temerity to say that that would help the electors! ""Whatever may have been said in the past about the Senate being the House of the States, to-day it is very much the House of the government of the day, unless there happens to be an Opposition This majority in the upper chamber as there is now. With the close organization and the marshalled propaganda of electoral contests, the nominees of the strongparties win the Senate ballots, usually according to their positions on the ballot papers. The proposal for the ballot papers to be so arranged that the electors will choose some candidates for a term of six years and others for a term of three years after a double dissolution will not simplify the system. The idea is absurd. The method of electing the Senate is already so complicated that 500,000 people have been disfranchised as the result of informalities in their ballots. What will the ordinary citizen think of the algebraic symbols in the bill ? They will confuse him still further. In addition, he will be expected to deal with two ballot-papers, or one ballot-paper divided into two sections. The Government's intentions on that point are not clear. If John Smith vides that the number of senators for each State must be divisible by two without remainder, but not divisible by four without remainder, he will imagine that, by some freak of chance, he has arrived at a radio quiz where contestants are told, "" Take away the number you first thought of and you may win a book "". We want clarification and simplification. If the Government is genuinely sincere, it will allow the bill to be referred to a select committee. I pay tribute to the young",44,Mknmes

The people have a ^ N b ^ complex in relation to referendums, which members of the present Governmentparties helped to create. They will find that the people will throw their old slogan backin their teeth. The. Opposition wants to reform the system of electing the Senate by meansj of a proper constitutional amendment. It does not want the reform, to be merely a temporary expedient to overcome what I consider to be a very happy situation in the present Senate, though, taking the wide nattonaj view, perhaps that situation ismost unfortunate. Anqmalies. in the, Senate electoral system cannot be removed satisfactorily by means; of. a, burned legislative enactment'. There. must he, a pj-oper inquiry by a se.l.Qct committee., aud all. parties' in/the must be. in agreement so that agreement up, to that point, ^e should fuvth-orStfa-iye t®, ma^e the Senate a body but the planners stopped short when they were dealing with the Senate scheme. They seemed to be reluctant to give it anything to do during the placid periods that it was to enjoy for many years. The American Senate is a great power in the world. The members of its foreign affairs committee are policy-makers for peace. American Senate committees have dealt with great problems of national development, tariffs., and international humanitarian work and they have served that ( -ountry magnificently. The Americans indeed have elevated their chamber of review to the dignity of one of the greatest use each vote in such a way as to ensure institutions for ^eace and good government in the world. We should emulate them. Some subjects should be lifted out of the hurly-burly of politics in this chamber and referred to the Senate for the framing of policies. I refer to such matters as immigration, repatriation, and even the White Australia policy, which subjects should not be trumpeted about or trampled upon in this place as they are of importance to every Australian citizen, whatever his political opinions may be. The Government's proposition smacks of politics. If it wants to change the Senate election system and establish a stable form of government that will operate smoothly in both Houses of the legislature, it must hasten slowly. Certain features of the bill worry me conconsiders that good chance to be w«rt,h siderably. One of these is the proposition that, after a double dissolution, candidates for the Senate shall be divided into two sets, one eligible for election for six years and the other eligible for election for three years. I should like the Government to announce what form the ballot papers will take because I envisage dreadappointment of a select committee. The ful confusion if the plan is ever put into effect. I do not think that the bill will solve the problems that we want to solve. I do not believe that any equation of numbers or formulas can provide a satisfactory solution. We must work out the necessary reforms carefully and without haste. The existing system has been evolved slowly over the years since federaimprovement of its performance as a unit tion. The ""first past the post"" system in elections was rejected in favour of preferential voting, which, in turn, has been rejected in favour of proportional representation. History shows that democratic processes are evolved by trial Ur. Baf/len. and error as the result of diligent and careful study. The Government is acting too quickly, and therefore the bill bears the taint of politics when it should carry the high sign of statesmanship. It will not achieve what the Government claims that, it will achieve, except perhaps by temporarily resolving the Government's immediate difficulties in the Senate. It will not solve the problem of deadlocks in the Senate in the long run because proportional representation is inexorably effecting a levelling-off process. The basic idea of proportional representation is to that its value steadily increases until the final result of the election has been made clear. I am not a great believer in the system, but, since .it is the system that we have,T consider that we must try to make it work effectively. The most urgent need is for a system that will enable the electors to exercise their Senate votes intelligently. Under the existing method, half a million voters have been disfranchised because they were unable to indicate correctly their order of preference for a multiplicity of candidates. The method of balloting in order to decide .the position of candidates' names on the ballot-papers is absurd. The man who is lucky enough te have his name placed in the first position in the group to which he belongs an extra total of 100,000 or more votes in the aggregate. Such features of the system are objectionable, but they should not be altered hastily. The subject requires careful research by some important, conscientious and well-appointed committee. That is why I advocate the people are not being accorded true democratic justice under the present Senate election system. If the Government is reasonable enough to acknowledge the necessity for further discussions on this subject, I hope that it will also realize the importance of rebuilding the Senate with a view to the of the legislature. There is a division of opinion within the Opposition concerning the Senate. Some of us consider that it should be abolished and others consider that it should be strengthened. Supporters of the Government have said that the Labour party once advocated the abolition of the Senate. That is true, but we now cherish the institution. Labour's hatred of the Senate arose from the fact that it was a massed House of privilege in the past. It should be made into a truly democratic institution that will operate successfully as a means of implementing the will of the people. Times and conditions change, and governments come and go. That is the trend of democracy. It would not be a democracy if it were otherwise, and we can have no real regrets about that system. However, T suggest that if we are to review the Senate system of election in particular, we shouid reject this bill in its entirety, si lid. ask the Government to provide a more concrete and stable proposal, even as a holding measure. Let us throw a wider ri.ot, and ascertain whether we can obtain assistance from other people in our perplexity in order to make our democracy work smoothly. Let us make the Senate a more democratic institution, with an international tie-up with the other democracies of the world through committees which have been given wide terms of reference. It is a disgrace to this Parliament that the committee system has been almost completely abandoned. reasons, governments have decided not to appoint joint parliamentary committees, committees of the House, or even ministerial committees to assist them. Committees of such kinds which functioned in the past, were useful and democratic. If they have not worked satisfactorily in the flux and hatreds of political contests in this House, the remedy may be to allow an impartial Senate to appoint committees to undertake valuable inquiries. Those are my conclusions on this matter. The bill has merit only up to the point that it recognizes that the time has arrived for the system of electing the Senate to be upon the problems of the constitutional reviewed. I find that the bill is really needs of this country since federation. a formula, like the formula for the manuAustralia is approaching the end of thf facture of the atomic bomb, which goes first, half century of its existence as a into astronomical figures of arithmetic, federation, and during that period of 50 wild algebraic symbols.

I have establishment of an upper house in the honestly expressed my opinion about bicameral legislative system. The second the dangers of the bill as a weak political instrument for the solution of a problem that should be considered on a national basis. I again plead for the bill to be submitted to a select committee, which will have power to co-opt the best brains of the nation for advice on parliamentary electoral systems. ""We are in despair about the Senate, not only at present, but also for the future. Let us evolve a formula for the election of that chamber so that democracy may still exist and function in this Parliament. support the bill, which is a brief and clear legislative proposal to give effect to the Government's plan for the avoidance of double dissolution deadlocks in the Senate. The House should congratulate the Government on meeting its responsibility in that respect so early in the life of this Parliament. Honourable members are well aware of the situation that has resulted from the introduction of the new system of electing senators, and the Government has placed the present proposal prominently on its list of responsibilities so that, at the earliest possible moment, the For various existing irregularity may be corrected. ""World conditions are becoming seriously unsettled, and Australia will be increasingly affected by them. This country requires stable government more urgently now than possibly ever before, and will continue to do so for the next few years in particular. The people have granted to the present Government a clear mandate, which was most decisive in the overall voting, to give effect to its pre-election promises, but stability of government cannot be maintained while the Senate is so hostile to the present Administration.

A bill which is completely fair, is entitled to receive a fair trial at the hands of all honourable members. [Quorum formed.} . The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), shortly before he rose to speak last night, was given a few suggestions and inspired thoughts by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and one or two of his colleagues. able gentleman evidently acted on those suggestions, which had been quickly passed to him, because he devoted the greater part of his remarks to an attack on the upper house system in this country, and he referred particularly to the Legislative Council of New South ""Wales. His remarks plainly revealed that he had little knowledge of the working of that chamber, and, for that reason I propose to make a brief reference to it. If an upper house is to be effective, it must stand as a safeguard between the government and the people, and should prevent a government, regardless of party, from imposing upon the people important legislation for which it has not received a. mandate. During the last session of the last Parliament, the Senate should have made it clear to the Chifley Government, when it introduced legislation to nationalize the banks, that it had no mandate to pass such legislation. The Senate should have forced the Government to go to the people to seek such a mandate, but it failed to do that. It was completely dominated by the Chifley Government, which it allowed to put legislation on the statute-book for which it had not received a mandate from the people. I shall now refer to practices and principles observed by upper chambers in the State parliaments, particularly the Parliament of New South Wales. Until about 1934 the Legislative Council in that State was a nominee chamber. The government of' the day nominated appointees who were generally approved by the Governor of* the State. In 1934. This the chamber was reconstructed. The new constitution proposed for that purpose was submitted at a referendum and the people completely endorsed it. Under its new constitution the members of that chamber are elected by the joint votes of members of the two chambers of that Parliament. In 1934, a large number of members of the council were nominee members, all of whom had the right to vote at the first election that was held under the new constitution. That election resulted in the return of a large majority of non-Labour members because at that time non-Labour parties had a substantial majority in the lower house The honorhaving been returned by the people in their violent rejection of the Lang Administration. It was said then that the upper chamber had been stacked against the Labour party for all time. honourable member has said that the nominee members of the Legislative -Council of New South Wales were appointed by the governor of the day. -I submit that that is a reflection upon the King's representative. of order. port the submission that the honourable member for Reid has just made. already ruled that the honourable member has not raised a point of order.

However, time has proved the wisdom of that new system because relative party representation in that chamber has changed in keeping with the gradual swing that has taken place in the meantime towards Labour in the lower house. Labour has a majority of members in the upper chamber. That is evidence that the system of election of members of the upper house in New South Wales has worked effectively and fairly from the standpoint of all parties. Opposition members interjecting, able members on my left do not cease interjecting and give the honourable member for Lyne a fair hearing, I shall have to take action. the upper chamber in New South Wales. I was a member of the upper chamber in that State for a period of nine years. At no time has a majority of non-Labour members in the upper chamber ever prevented a Labour government from enacting legislation for which it had received a clear and definite mandate from the people. I challenge the Opposition to cite one instance in which that upper chamber has ever prevented a. Labour government from passing legislation for which it had received a mandate. Certainly, the upper chamber amended several measures. amended the Western Lands Bill, because the premier of the day, in the course of the general election campaign that had just taken place, made merely an ambiguous statement that he would review western land leases. He made no further reference to the subject in the course of that campaign. However, when the particular measure came before the upper chamber it was found to provide for the complete confiscation of those leases. The Government had not received any mandate from the electors to take such action, and, therefore, the upper chamber amended the measure in order to prevent the Government from confiscating those leases. I repeat that the upper house interfered only with legislation related to vital issues in respect of which the government of the day had not received a mandate. Honourable members from New South Wales are aware that during a certain period, the upper chamber in New South Wales made 103 amendments to legislation of a genera! nature and that the government of the day The result is that, to-day. voluntarily accepted 99 of those amendments. That is evidence of the fact th;r that chamber has safeguarded the interests of the people of New South Wales whenever a government in thai State has attempted to enact legislation for which it has not received a mandate. To-day, the Labour party hasa majority in that chamber. I point out that in New South Wales, non-Labour governments when making appointments to the upper chamber invariably did so on the basi9 of giving representation to all sections of the community and to all sections of industry and commerce, with actual operation of the the result that the composition of the chamber represented a cross-section of the vital interests of the State. An examination of the facts will convince any honourable member that that statement is correct. But what have Labour governments done in that respect? On every occasion on which a vacancy has occurred Labour has alwaysselected a trade union secretary as its nominee. During a period of seven years only one of tbe persons who were nominated by the Labour party for election to the upper chamber came from a oountry district. For instance, it If ever there was a time when the Senate should play its part fearlessly in the interests of the people, it is now. SinceI have been a member of this House, and probably for many years previously, the members of the Opposition have seized every opportunity to bring up the old argument that in 1930-31 a non-Labour majority in the Senate prevented the Scullin Government from carrying out its policy. The present Government recognizes that the Senate ie hostile to it, but it is facing up to the issue. Unlike the Scullin Government, it will not sit idly by and permit the country to fall into a depression and then run' round the Commonwealth blaming a hostile Senate for its failure to grapple with the problems that confront it. The Scullin Government could have brought about a double dissolution with a view to seeking",51,Mknmes

It was not game to face up to the issues that -confronted it ; but ever since then the Labour party has claimed that a hostile Senate prevented that Government from carrying on. This Government is not prepared to remain in office under similar conditions and, consequently, it has introduced this measure in order to rectify the anomalies to which 1 have referred. The bill now before us provides a simple way of dealing with the situation so that as soon as possible the people may, in their own interests, make it possible for the National Government to work along sound and solid lines. Supporters of the Government have refuted the statements made by the Opposition that the Cabinet did not inform all its supporters of its intention to introduce this measure. Every supporter of the Government was apprised of these proposals and was given every opportunity to express opinions upon them and to suggest any alternatives. However, not one member of the Opposition is prepared to help the Government to solve this problem even though he knows that the proposals embodied in it are completely fair from the standpoint of all parties and"" will enable a government to carry on the administration of the country in the interests of the people. The Opposition is endeavouring to confuse and frustrate the people in this matter. I have pleasure in supporting the bill, which, I hope, will soon be placed upon the statute-book. the Opposition) [3.59] I was interested to hear the speeches that have been made Eggins) and the honourable member for New England. ( Mr Drummond). The honourable member for New England was a member of a government in New South Wales that perpetrated what I believe to be one of the greatest politcal rackets that have ever been worked in this country. I refer to the alteration of the system of election of the members of the Legislative Council in that State, That Government was so little concerned about the rights of the democracy that it brought about a set of circumstances which resulted in Labour having to govern for nine years, and to fight three general elections, in each of which Labour candidates secured a huge majority of the votes of the people, before it was able to obtain a majority in the State upper house. The system of electing the New South Wales upper house was altered solely to prevent Labour from ever gaining complete control of the New South Wales Parliament. The honourable member for New England was one of the sponsors of that proposal. The honourable member for Lyne was merely one of the cogs in the machine. Even now the Labour Government of New South Wales has only a majority of one or two seats in the upper house. The most extraordinary feature about the proposal was that it provided for the election of some members of the upper house for a period of twelve years. For twelve long years the people were denied the right to decide who should represent them in that legislative body. The proposal was adopted on the joint vote of both houses of the Parliament in which the majority of the seats were held by conservative interests. Although at one period Labour held 55 of the 95 seats in the lower house it had no control of the upper house. In one or two short periods Labour held an even greater number of seats in the lower house but in spite of its overwhelming majority it was unable to control the upper house. Something has been said about a mandate from the people for the legislation now before us. No government can possibly claim to have a mandate to deal with every emergency which arises during the period of its administration. It is impossible for the leaders of political parties to state in their policy speeches are elected to office. Do honourable members opposite believe that Mr Churchill was able to claim that he had a mandate for every action taken by his Government during its term of office? I have always regarded the action taken by the anti-Labour parties in New South Wales in changing the system of election of the upper house as a. political racket to keep Labour out of office.

These are the people who are so solicitous of the welfare of the people, and who are now demanding a "" fair go"". Let us consider what has happened in the State Parliaments of Victoria and Tasmania. Is it contended that a government should not have the right to carry on the services any other purpose than to gain a party of the State merely because it cannot command a majority in the upper house, particularly when the members who constitute that majority have not been elected the government of the day a fair deal. by the popular vote of the people ? What wonderful solicitude for the principles of democracy honourable members opposite and their friends exhibit when they permit a state of affairs to continue which is in existence to-day in almost every State in the Commonwealth! Tory reactionary interests have made it their business to retain control of the upper houses of the State parliaments no matter what majority Labour may have in the lower houses of the legislatures which, in the main, are elected on a popular franchise.

I ask the Leader of the Opposition to return to the bill. ing digressed. I was led to do so by the interjections of honourable members opposite. It has been claimed that the Government has no sinister or ulterior motive in introducing this measure. Does any honourable member opposite, or any one else, believe that it was introduced for political advantage for the Government parties? not prevent deadlocks from arising in the Senate. I do not think that any honourable member opposite claims that it will do so. The Prime Minister has said that, at most, it can only minimize deadlocks. As the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said last night, the Government, in it3 attempt to minimize deadlocks, has produced a clumsy measure, the predominant purpose of which is to gain a political advantage for the Government and its supporters. What solicitude have honourable members opposite exhibited in relation to this matter in the past? From October, 1941, until July, 1944, when a Labour government was in office in this Parliament, a deadlock existed between the House of Representatives and the Senate. During the whole of that period the government of the day was engaged in the task of conducting the war. Did honourable members of the anti-Labour parties then talk about the rights of the democracy and the need for a "" f a i r go"" for the government?

210,Mr Eggins,"Why did not the governber for Lyne knows nothing of the history of those days or he would not have made such an interjection. In 1929 Labour went to the polls and literally swept the country, and although the Scullin Government had a majority in the House of Representatives and equality with the Opposition parties in the Senate, Opposition senators adopted obstructive tactics, and so prevented the Scullin Government from carrying on its task. The question has been asked why the Scullin Government did not seek a double dissolution. The reason can be definitely stated. When the Scullin Government took office in 1929 it was faced with a bankrupt Treasury and the country was moving into the throes of a depression. The previous Government had been unable to borrow money either in Australia or abroad, and conditions had become so bad that it would have been useless for the Scullin Government to approach the banks for money to relieve unemployment. The number of unemployed was growing daily by thousands and because of the exigencies of the times the Scullin Government was forced to impose import prohibitions and high rates of duties. Import prohibitions covered more than 200 items. In the event of a double dissolution the tariff schedules which had been tabled but not passed would have lapsed. That matter had been held up in the Senate. I do not like to have to recount the history of those days. What happened is to the discredit of those who were responsible. Let us consider some of the other extrahave been wary about seeking a double ordinary things that have happened.

The man who was elected to fill the vacancy caused by Senator Keane's death had previously been rejected by the people. man. thing against him as an individual. My remarks are directed solely to the fact, that his political views were diametrically opposed to those of the man in whose place he was appointed. When honourable members opposite talk about fairness they should remember that they themselves have committed acts which were the absolute negation of fair play. It is distinctly unfair that casual vacancies in the Senate should be filled by persons whose political faith differs from that of those whose places they fill. The present system under which members of the upper house of a State parliament, which is elected on a property franchise, should be able to influence the election of a person to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate, is most unfair. The Prime Minister has said that most of the provisions of this bill will minimize the possibility of a deadlock resulting from a double dissolution. If I had the time to do so, I could cite cases in which in such an event a deadlock between two houses could be aggravated. What is the history of double dissolutions in this country? Only one double dissolution has or-curred since federation and the government that was responsible for it did not fare too well in the subsequent general election.

I refer to meetings not of the Cabinet, but of the parties. All that this proposal will do is to establish a new set of complications. The elector will have to fill in two ballot-papers for the election of senators. He will have to decide on one ballot-paper which senators he desires to be elected for six years, and on another ballot-paper which senators he desires to be elected for three years. long to decide. ber for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) should --tudy the number of informal votes cast at the last general election, especially in his own electorate. I consider that some action should be taken to avoid the high percentage of informal voting, particularly under the system of proportional representation. I had the experience of entering a polling booth to vote at 7 o'clock on the evening of election day and of having to complete a buff-coloured ballot-paper in a dim light. The ballot paper had a large number of names on it, and the elector had to.mark his preference in a small square printed beside each name. I am not surprised that under such conditions a large number of informal votes are cast at general elections for the Senate. I am at one with the MinisterI am not at all happy about preferential voting for the Senate being carried down to the twenty-third place, as it was at the last general election for the Senate. On one occasion 30 Senate candidates appeared on the ballot-paper for New South Wales. It is very easy for an elector to make a mistake when so many names appear on the ballot-paper and when he must indicate his preference for every one of them. I believe that a large number of voters are, in fact, disfranchised because they make mistakes when completing such cumbersome ballot-papers and because they have too much pride to go to an electoral officer to obtain a fresh paper. I do not intend to argue with the Minister for the Interior about that matter. I do not want anybody to think that I was tremendously enamoured of the system of proportional representation in Senate elections, but the Labour party decided to adopt it after due consideration. Proportional representation is, theoretically, completely democratic, but has defects in actual practice. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) will have some knowledge of proportional representation as it applied to the lower house in New South Wales, in connection with which it did not prove satisfactory. Many people have considered that the system of proportional representation should be abandoned or altered, but now the Government proposes to ask the people'for an alteration of the Constitution to deal with an electoral condition caused by an act that introduced a system that may not be continued by this Parliament and that may, indeed, be abandoned by the present Government. As the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) stated, this proposed new section of the Constitution may be left high and dry by an amendment of the electoral act. There is no saying that the present Government may not itself believe that proportional representation, after it has had a sufficiently long trial, may not be worthy of continuance. The Government wishes to have the Constitution altered in respect of Senate elections only to meet a temporary difficulty in relation to so-called possible deadlocks. Such deadlocks have been occurring in parliaments throughout the world for a long time. It is physically impossible to avoid them.

Despite what the honoraible member for Lyne( Mr parochialism, but I have no doubt that Eggins) may say about this matter, the framers of the Constitution apparently never wanted all the members of the Senate to be elected at the same time as the members of the House of Representatives are elected. They provided in the Constitution that only one-half of the senators should go to the people at any general election. As >a consequence of .that provision in the Constitution eighteen senators, or one-half of the strength of the Senate as it was constituted until the election, of the present Parliament still remained in office during the election and for three years thereafter. The framers of the Constitution had good reasons for that, and they may have included some of the reasons that the honourable member for Lyne has mentioned. They believed that there should be an overlap. En the general election of 1946 the Labour party failed by only a narrow margin to win every seat in the Senate that it contested. If all the senators had stood for election at that time the Senate would have been a complete replica, party polically, of this House. That has happened in the past when conservative governments have been elected to office. The framers of the Constitution desired to avoid such an eventuality. I cannot read the minds of those who are dead and gone but I assume that they did not want to provide for elections at which all the members of the House of Representatives .and all the members of the Senate should be elected. They must have foreseen the possibility of deadlocks arising from such a system. I shall give the House a simple illustration. In 1928 the Bruce-Page Government swept the polls for the Senate, and ten months later, in 1929, the Labour party had an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives. stood for election at those two .general elections there would have been a complete change of senators twice within a period of 10 months, and the Senate in each case would have been :a mere reproduction, party politically, of the House of Representatives. I have no doubt that the framers of the Constitution desired to avoid such an Let me take one eventuality. Honourable members can argue as much as they like about State what I have outlined was the objective in the minds of the framers of the Constitution. They never intended that the Senate should be a mere reproduction, party politically, of the House of Representatives. I do not. think that anybody will deny that all that this bill will achieve in the long run will be a cumbersome, expensive and very intricate system. Anybody would only have to read the explanation of the bill made by the Prime Minister when he introduced it to the House to be convinced of that fact. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and I propose to prepare a short comedy on the Prime Minister's statement about twos and fours and what is left over. How in the name of heaven can the people of this country be expected to understand this proposed system when the speech of the Prime Minister himself was almost incomprehensible? The right honourable gentleman admitted that when the bill came from the draftsman he was completely puzzled by it. He is a great politician, parliamentarian and lawyer, yet on his own admission, when the bill came to him at first he could not understand it and had to get the Parliamentary Draftsman in to explain it to him. After the Parliamentary Draftsman had explained the bill, the Prime Minister admitted that he had drafted the bill correctly. How can the Prime Minister expect the ordinary man in the street to understand the bill ? people will read the bill? upon the electors. My reply to the honourable gentleman is that, although the Prime Minister is an able man, his If all the senators explanation of the bill was almost incomprehensible. If a parliamentarian cannot understand the bill there is not much use in attempting to explain it to the ordinary man in the street. There are factors about the Senate, particularly regarding the filling of casual vacancies, that I regard as a complete electoral anomaly.",56,Mknmes
224,Mr Hulme,Ho w many ordinary,57,Mknmes
225,Mr Chifley,"That is a reflectionState parliamentarians elect people to the Senate to fill vacancies that are caused by the death or retirement of senators who were elected by the people and they can, a3 they have done before, elect people who hold opposite political views to those of the senators who formerly occupied the seats. Surely honourable members cannot defend such a system. There is room for improvement not only in regard to the matter covered by the bill but also in rehonorable gentleman an incident pregard to other matters. The method of filling casual vacancies might well be thoroughly examined by experts, or with the advice of experts. The proportional representation system is known as the Clark-Hare system, but when I first studied it I considered that it should have been called the "" March Hare"" system.. The only man I know who can explain that system thoroughly is the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). He is the only man I know who seems to have a complete grasp of the system. We spent one Saturday afternoon with sheets of paper that flowed in great rolls over the edge of a desk before I could achieve a reasonable understanding of how the system works. It is possible that this Parliament Senate by-elections or ordinary general may consider that the system of proporelections. Honourable members should fix tional representation and the system in this cardinal point in their minds. use for filling casual vacancies in the Senate ought to be submitted to an expert committee for review.

BeforeI continue, I ordinary statement that only three Minisdesire to refer briefly to what the Leader ters knew the contents of the bill and tba*"" of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) has said. Much of his speech appears to me to be irrelevant to the issue before the House, and some of it, in fact, was inaccurate. I refer to his statement about the number of votes polled in the Queensland election. I submit that his statement was quite wrong. Wheni t comes to a discussion on questions of fairness in the past, I can cite for the right cisely similar to the incident that he cited in connection with Senator Keane. A labour council in a certain town took action precisely similar to that which he described and when the mayor of the town, a Labour mayor, protested that the action was undemocratic, he was expelled from the Labour party for daring to criticize. Nobody claims that this bill gives a 100 per cent, iron-clad guarantee that it will prevent a deadlock, but in all human probability it will do so. The bill is intended to provide that when certain circumstances arise the expressed wish of the Australian people shall not be frustrated. That is the kernel of the bill, which deals only with the possibilities that may follow a double dissolution of the Parliament. It is not concerned, and properly so, with other situations such as I want to refer to the attacks that have ment side were not consulted. Whilst acknowledging the delicate tribute to the The",57,Mknmes

Does it mean that the honourable gentleman is not going to honour his pledge or that he is an extremist or an academic extremist, whatever that may be? First of all, honourable members of the Opposition spoke about the bargain of federation and then they indulged in this "" academic extremism Wowing bnt and cold in the same breath. When the Labour Government took any action about the Senate it increased by two-thirds the membership of that chamber. It is very hard to follow the antics of these "" academic extremists "". The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), whose honesty all honourable members respect, and who stands like a rock in the surging and uncertain sea of his party, gave the reasons why he and presumably his party oppose the bill. He said that if a double dissolution occurred on an unwelcome issue and his party were defeated, it would be in danger of losing its majority in another place as well as in this House if this bill had previously received thp approval of the Australian people at a referendum. In other words, honourable members of the Opposition oppose this bill because they desire to retain their present insecure hold on their tottering political fortunes in this Parliament. Fear is the motive which inspires the opposition to this bill, fear of the consequences, fear to face the verdict of the people of Australia. A double dissolution is a special event which very seldom occurs. Honourable members of the Opposition have been at great pains to point out how seldom it does occur. I suggest that it occurs only when the party that has been out a definite policy is unable to do so because the majority in the Senate, which has been elected on different considerations, prevents the expressed desire of the people from being carried out. The object of this measure is to implement the will of the Australian people. It does nothing else. The matter is not one of constitutional law or of what happened in the past.

It was very much afraid of how the people would vote if they did so. This bill restores the sovereignty of the Australian people. It is designed to make their will prevail. was a bill for an act to provide for a It is a democratic measure in every sense of the word and is designed to fulfil a deadlock in the Senate after a doublethe expressed wish of the electors. There is no complicated issue, as honourable gentlemen of the Opposition attempt to persuade the House there is, for the electors to understand. The very simple proposition stated in this bill is that the very complicated. As the Prime Minisnumber of senators for each State, whether it be an original State or a new State, shall be a number which is divisible by 2 without a remainder but not divisible by 4 without a remainder. I suggest that an understanding of that proposition is well within the compass of the intelligence of honourable members of the Oppo-3.ition. The principle that is embodied in this bill is enunciated in the common expression that is found on the lips of every Australian-the principle of a "" fair go ''. It is fair to the Australian people and it will enable them to have their expressed wishes carried out. I commend the bill to the House and I have no doubt that its merits will commend it to the Australian people. this bill was introduced, honourable members and the public of Australia were bombarded witb propaganda which informed them that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), on a certain evening at S p.m., would drop a bombshell in this House, that he had a mystery measure which would remove the deadlock in the Senate and make everything right in this community. ""ballyhoo"" in the newspapers and it Donald Cameron) stated that the element reminded me more of the advertising of surprise was very necessary in this of a Jack Davey or a Bob Dyer show on instance. Honourable members of thethe radio, than of the preparation of the Opposition do not want any element of people of Australia and, more particusurprise in the introduction of proposals larly, honourable members of this House, for the. alteration of the Constitution. for the reception of a seriou9 piece of A great deal of consideration should legislation. But when the Prime Minisbe given to proposals of this nature ter had addressed thi-; House and had exby all sections of the community before plained this wonderful mystery measure any alterations are made to the Conthat was going to cure all our ills stitution. Honourable members of the it was found that it was similar to many of the other statements that he had made after a great advertising boost. An examination of the bill proves that it is a peurile thing which is not worthy of the consideration of this House. The right honourable gentleman said, that it system of election that would prevent dissolution. The bill does not mention the possibility of a deadlock after an ordinary general election although that possibility is always present. Themeasure is expressed in phrases that are ter himself admitted, he had to call in the draftsman to explain one clause to him because he did not understand it. The bill provides that in the event of a double dissolution there shall not be a subsequent deadlock in the Senate. There has been one double dissolution in a period of 50 years. There might bea second in another year or it might not occur for a further 50 years but the Government says that the bill will ensure that there shall not bea deadlock after a double dissolution. No consideration has been given to what will happen in the event of an ordinarygeneral election, in 1952 or 1953, resulting in the return of an equal number of representatives of the Government and' Opposition parties in the Senate. Noprovision is made to prevent deadlocks after ordinary general elections but in case, once in 50 years, there may be adouble dissolution, the Government says that machinery should be provided to ensure that there shall not be a deadlock: after the ensuing general election. That idea is preposterous and this is a most ridiculous proposal to place before this House. I read the The honourable member for Oxley (Dr.",59,Mknmes
231,Mr Bryson (Wills) [4.40],"Befor eOpposition do not want to deal with this subject in a secret manner. They do not want to keep all ideas concerning it in the mind of a half-dozen men until it is suddenly introduced to this chamber and pushed through with as much speed ;« possible. It is necessary not only that members of the Parliament should understand the meaning of proposed alterations of the Constitution; the people of Australia also should understand them. The people will be called upon to vote yes DI no, and it is not reasonable to ask 1 diem to vote on a proposal which they do not thoroughly understand. This is M incisure which has been given scant i-onsideration by the Government parties, and one that will receive only limited consideration in this House. The honourable member for Oxley complained that <-ertam honourable members of the Opposition had described the bill as an ill considered measure. I am of the opinion that it was given no consideration at all. ! understand, and I am open to-correction if I am w-rong, that honourable members on the Government side did not know the contents of the bill until a few hours before it was introduced to this House. Therefore, it certainly did' not receive much consideration from honourable members on the back benches who are to-day supporting it. They are endeavouring to make it appear that this is a reasonable proposition, and that it is necessary to alter the Constitution. 1 suggest that quite a number of them -still have a very vague idea of its meaning although they are telling us that it is a panacea for all the ills that affect the Australian system of government. honourable member himself does not know to-day completely outmoded. A number of much about it. criticize it, and perhaps I shall teach you parliaments. In four of the States the a little more about it if you listen to me. able member must address me. tion, Mr Speaker, to the fact that certain thwart the wishes of the democratically interjections are occurring. ber should refrain from taking any notice of the interjections. Many things must be considered in relation to this bill. Upon an examination of the Prime Minister's introductory speech, it becomes quite apparent that he said, in effect, that while a particular party has a majority in the House of Representatives it is necessary that that party shall also have a majority in the Senate. In effect he said that the Senate should be a reflection of the Government in this House. He inferred that the Senate should be merely a rubber stamp to approve every proposal that the Government puts forward. That is the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from the Prime Minister's remarks. If that is to be so, then there is an alternative to this very complicated system of resolving double dissolution deadlocks. The obvious remedy is the abolition of the Senate. If the Constitution is to be amended to ensure that the Senate shall meekly carry out the bidding of the Government, then the necessity for the Senate, which is the so-called States House, no longer exists. The cheapest and most satisfactory method of ending deadlocks would be to hold a referendum to ask the people to alter the Constitution to provide for the abolition of the Senate. The nation would be saved a certain amount of rnoney and the Government and administration of the country would be simplified. If the Government will bring forward a proposal of that nature I shall support it whole-heartedly. I shall not only support it in this House, but also campaign on the Government's behalf throughout the country to try to ensure an affirmative vote of the people. I believe that the sysremarks have been made to-day in regard upper houses are merely houses of privilege which represent approximately one-third of the electors, who are arch tories.

Such a result, incidentally, would contribute to the progress and prosperity of Australia, and it might be achieved in the event of -an early double dissolution. That is why I am not worried about a double dissolution. Before submitting any proposals for constitutional alterations to the people, we must give them the fullest possible contors into the House of Representatives so sideration. They must be of such a .nature that, if approved by the people, they will improve the method of governing the nation. We need Constitution alterations not only for the purpose of improving the method of electing the Senate, but also for the purpose of extending the powers of this national Parliament. Therefore, I suggest that a select -committee be appointed to consider the problem of avoiding Senate deadlocks and various other subjects. The best brains available should be called upon to decide, amongst other questions, whether the Senate should exist at all, whether the system of equal representation of the States in the Senate should be continued, whether senators should be -elected for terms of six years or only three years, and whether all senators .should retire at the one time as do members of this House. -should be carefully considered before we ask the people to express their views upon them. The people would be enabled to vote intelligently if proposals of that character were first carefully studied and then clearly explained. One can readily imagine the reaction of the people to the Prime Minister's mathematical epigram that the number of senators for a State, whether an original State or a new State, should be a number which is -divisible by two without remainder, but is not divisible by four without remainder. It is only .reasonable to assume that a vast gence of great party political divisions majority of the people would not understand the meaning of that proposal and would be strongly opposed to its acceptance at a referendum. It is not of much use to place questions before the people at a referendum unless there is a strong probability of gaining an affirmative vote and improving tbe Constitution. The bill provides that the number of senators from each State may be reduced to six or increased to fourteen, eighteen or even 22. Mr Bryson. However, the Constitution provides that, in order to increase the number to fourteen, it would be necessary at the same time to increase the number of members of the House of Representatives by approximately 48. That might or might not be a good proposition. In my opinion, the most satisfactory procedure would be to abolish the Senate and bring senathat every measure could be thoroughly discussed in this chamber. That method would produce much better results than are achieved at present. able member's time has expired. With all due respect to this House, I think that the debate has wandered at times very far from the main point of the bill. Therefore, at the risk of L""eing tedious, I propose to re-state the has: matters to which the proposed alteration of the Constitution relates. The makers of the Constitution gave us a parliament of two houses. The first, which is the House of Representatives, is modelled on the British House of Commons. It represents the people of Australia in divisions of approximately equal numeriSuch questions cal strength, and it discharges the most important functions of the Parlament inasmuch as it has control of the Executive. The second House, which is the Senate, was intended by the framers of the Constitution to represent the interests of the States. Therefore, the Constitution provided that an equal number of senators should be elected from each State and that no State should have less than six senators. Unfortunately, in practice, the Senate has not proved to be a States' House. With the emerthroughout the country, it succumbed to the same party influences as the House of Representatives. The possibility of deadlocks between the two Houses is inherent in any bicameral system. Had the Constitution ooerated as its framers intended that it should, with the House of Representatives representing the people upon a population basis and the Senate representing the States, the number of deadlocks would have been very few because",63,Mknmes
241,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,64,Mknmes
242,Mr Osborne (Evans) [5.10],"each House would have approached the problems of the Parliament from an entirely different standpoint. The House of Representatives would have dealt with them on broad party lines and the Senate would have reviewed the results of the. deliberations of the House of Representatives on the basis of the interests of the States. Although deadlocks were expected to be infrequent, the framers of the Constitution included in it a special provision to enable deadlocks to be overcome. Thus, section 57 of the Constitution provides the machinery for dealing with a double dissolution. Its general terms are well known to honourable members. If the Senate rejects a measure that has been passed by the House of Representatives and within three months rejects it a second time after it had been passed again by the House of Representatives, the Governor General may dissolve both Houses of the Parliament. Both Houses must then be re-elected. If a deadlock occurs again over the measure on which the dissolution occurred, both Houses will sit together and make a decision by their combined vote. The existence of these provisions in the Constitution has had the result . intended by the framers of the Constitution and deadlocks have been few. In fact, there has been only one double dissolution in the history of federation. But by the previous Government in 1948 increased the number of senators from 36 to 60, and the number of members of the House of Representatives from 75 to 123, and also introduced proportional representation as the method of election of the Senate, an entirely new situation has arisen. After a double dissolution, in the present circumstances, the strengths of the Government party and of the Opposition would almost certainly be equal in the Senate. It has been pointed out clearly to the House that, except in a most exceptional division of the country, in which an almost impossible proportion of the votes had been given to one political party, an equal division in the Senate would be inevitable, and consequently, the deadlock would continue. After such a double dissolution, a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Repre(1211 sentatives could deal with the particular measure over which the double dissolution had occurred, but when that difficulty had been overcome, another deadlock would occur on the next controversial measure, and therefore parliamentary government would be obstructed indefinitely. The remedy proposed by the Government for dealing with the unexpected, and, I think, unforeseen result of the previous Government's legislation is provided in this bill. Tbe operative and important part of the measure is contained in proposed new section 13A of the Constitution, which provides that, after a double dissolution, there shall be two elections for senators for each State. In other words, the senators required for each State will be elected in two groups. elected on the same day and at the same time. vent proportional representation from operating. sort. It is a necessary measure to overcome a fault in the method of introducing proportional representation into the election of senators that will have the effect of hamstringing the operation of the legislature in the circumstances about which I since the legislation initiated have been speaking. After a double dissolution, all the senators for one State are now elected in one group. In accordance with sections 14 and 15 of the Constitution, the Senate itself decides who shall retire after three years, and who shall retire after the full period of six years. Under this amending legislation, that decision will be made by the electors themselves; so that, in effect, after a double dissolution, the electors will choose the group of senators who will be elected for three years, and the group who will be elected for six years. any preference, because the names of tbe candidates will be on different lists. themselves may offer a group of candidates for election to the Senate for three years, and another group for election to the Senate for six years.",64,Mknmes

When proposed new section 13A is read in conjunction with proposed new section 7A, it will be seen that provision is made that two groups unequal in number will be elected for the periods of three years and six years respectively. The effect will be that one political party must gain a majority in the Senate. That is the purpose of the bill. Because a simple mathematical means has been taken to ensure that there shall never be an unequal number in either of those groups, the Opposition has imagined all sorts of mysteries about the proposal. It is a simple mathematical formula that statesThe number of Senators for a State. . . shall be a number which is divisible by two without remainder but is not divisible by four also believes that the measure is wrong without remainder. That formula may seem complex, but, in reality, it has a perfectly simple and obvious result. As I have stated, this proposed alteration of the Constitution is a simple measure designed to overcome a defect in the legislation of the previous Government. It is a fact that it involves an alteration of the Constitution, and, consequently, a referendum. That is unfortunate, but it is the only method that has been seen to be capable of overcoming the present situation. Has the Opposition suggested any other method? Members of the Labour party criticize the Government's proposal, but they have not suggested any other means of overcoming the difficulty that has been caused by their own imperfect, ill-considered and hasty legislation. Last night the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) made what I think was a considered attempt to criticize the bill, and at the conclusion of his long speech, in a series of staccato phrases, produced with a kind of machine gun precision, intended, no doubt, to overwhelm all criticism by speed and force of numbers, he summed up his objections to the bill. He produced them with speed, but fortunately not with sufficient speed to prevent me from making a note of them, and I have been able to reflect upon them at leisure. The honourable member first considers that -this measure is wrong in form and inadequate in scope, because as he says, it is party political legislation, and relates solely to present conflicts. I do not suppose that any honourable member is so naive as to think for a moment that the last Government's introduction of proportional representation in 194S as the method of electing the Senate was free from party political considerations. Although the application of the principle of proportional representation to Senate elections may prove in the course of time to be beneficial-and personally I think that it will-the immediate purpose of the previous Government in introducing that system was to safeguard the seats of a number of Labour senators who would otherwise have been defeated at the last general election. The honourable member for Fremantle because it proposes a permanent alteration of the Constitution in order to suit a temporary electoral impasse. That sounds like an alarming state of affairs, when it is expressed in long words and at high speed, but, in effect, the validity of such criticism depends entirely upon the nature of the measure itself, and whether it can stand, as an alteration of the Constitution, on its own feet. Quite clearly, it can do so. Whether or not proportional representation is continued indefinitely as the method of electing senators, this measure can take its place as a part of the Constitution without being detrimental to that instrument in any way. If proportional representation were abolished in the course of time, the effect of this measure would be to apply a species of proportional representation in the event of a double dissolution. It would be perfectly harmless. The criticism that has been voiced by the honourable member for Fremantle, to the effect that the Government is seeking to make a permanent alteration of the Constitution in order to overcome a difficulty that arises in ordinary legislation, results from an attempt to draw some kind of distinction between permanent constitutional",65,Mknmes
249,Mr Bird,But the choice is thereby,66,Mknmes
250,Mr Osborne,"It will be forlaw and amendable law. However, that distinction does not exist. As any lawyer knows perfectly well, tbe law of tbe Constitution is found not only in the document known as the Constitution Act. Every act that in any way affects the election of members of the Parliament, or the exercise of the Commonwealth's powers, is a part of the law of our Constitution. The suggestion that there is anything wrong in remedying a constitutional defect that has been revealed in ordinary law not part of the Constitution Act, by altering the Constitution Act itself, is quite groundless. The honourable member for Fremantle next suggested that this bill is clumsy because, in Lis opinion, it will make it difficult to adjust the size of the House of Representatives. The effect of it certainly will be legislators in future will not be able to decide the exact number of the members of the House of Representatives, but they will have ample flexibility and scope in choosing the number, and, therefore, the honourable member's criticism is again groundless on that count. explain what he means by the words ""ample flexibility and scope""? able member for Fremantle suggested that this bill was clumsy because it would impede the choice of Parliaments in the future to decide, when they were considering whether membership should be enlarged or diminished, the precise number of members. Upon the adoption of this proposed alteration of the Constitution, the number of senators will have to be a number divisible by two without remainder, but not divisible by four without remainder. Consequently, some limitation is placed on the choice of numbers for any enlarged Senate. The numerical strength of the House of Representatives is determined by a formula that is related to the numerical strength of the Senate, and therefore, the honourable member for Fremantle seeks to establish that the bill limits the right of the Parliaments of the future to decide the number of members which the House of Representatives shall be composed. The limitation, in fact, is only to the infinitesimal degree that the Senate must consist of a number that is divisible by two without remainder, but not divisible by four without remainder. There is an infinite series of such numbers, and, consequently, the argument that this bill will impede the ability of future Parliaments to decide the numerical strength of the House of Representatives is futile. Next, the honourable member for Fremantle considered that the bill is inadequate because it leaves untouched the problem of Senate by-elections. The bill would be inadequate only if it attempted to overcome every constitutional difficulty from which we now suffer, and nobody pretends that it is designed to do so. That vein of criticism may be traced through the whole of the honourable member's speech. He constantly returned to his contention that the bill was inadequate and incomplete because it did not deal with every constitutional difficulty. A similar line of criticism is to be found in his statement that the proposal is faulty because it does not propose an alteration of the unnecessary provision that an alteration of this House shall have twice the membership of the Senate. The honourable gentleman considers that it is inadequate in scope because it accepts the Senate as it is, and merely provides for an electoral change when there are possibilities of making the Senate a useful chamber. Those criticisms could be valid only if this bill purported to be a measure to undertake a review of the whole Constitution. Of course, it is not intended to do so. The bill is a simple measure designed to overcome a particular difficulty caused by the short sighted and hasty legislation of the previous Government. It has no other purpose. It does not attempt to meet all the shortcomings that have been revealed in the Constitution since federation. I should be the first to agree that it is time that a convention was summoned to review many aspects of the Constitution. But that is not the purpose of this measure. Nor is it a valid criticism to say that it does not attempt to overcome all the defects that have been revealed in the Constitution. The honourable member said that the measure does not face up to the problem of resolving deadlocks without a double dissolu'ion, and that it does not consider the possibility of providing for a suspensory veto",66,Mknmes

253,Mr Morgan (Reid) [5.37],"Thispowers formerly exercised by the King were transferred to the people, nominee chambers, were relegated to the background. Originally, the King was an absolute monarch and all legislative powers literally flowed from the Crown. To-day, that is true in theory only. Likewise, in earlier times, legislators and Ministers were direct nominees of the Crown and were the King's Ministers in the fullest sense. That was the position that existed in this country before federation when the States were Crown colonies and the members of their legislative councils were nominated by the Governor as the representatives of the Crown. the free settlers asserted their right to parliamentary representation, the King's nominees were relegated to upper chambers, and, as was the case with the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, rhe members of the upper house were directly representative of the privileged classes. However, the purpose of upper houses in this country still remains the same as it was when they were established. Their purpose is to act as a brake on progressive legislation, or onwhat honourable members opposite usually describe as hasty legislation. That old parrot cry is always raised whenever the people attempt to assert their democratic rights. The purpose of the upper houses is to frustrate the will of the people. Those chambers represent elements thrt fear progress in all its forms. In thr early days of settlement in the colony of New South ""Wales the landed gentry who were then members of the upper chamber attempted to defeat legislation that had been passed by the lower house with the object of bringing about the cessation of the transportation of convicts to Australia. Those who sponsored that legislation founded the fir»t political party in this country and because they took such action they were described by their opponents as "" Communists, socialists, anarchists and breakers cf law and order "". represented in the upper house. those who had been given cheap grants nominations that were made by the Goof land by the Crown profited from the vernor on the recommendation of the transportation of convicts to Australia Government the Labour party gained who were a source of cheap labour and those interests jealously resisted any encroachment upon their privileges and powers. Indeed, some of those interests advocated the setting up of an upper house on a hereditary basis similar to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. Fortunately, statesmen like Sir Henry Parkes resisted that attempt to introduce the caste system into Australia. But the "" old guard "" succeeded to some degree in establishing the caste system in this country through the upper houses, or nominee legislative councils, such as the council that now exists in New South Wales. Those chambers were established As on either a nominee basis, as was tbe case in New South Wales until 1934, when all appointees were direct nominees approved by the Governor, or were elected on a restricted property franchise, as is still the case in Western Australia and Tasmania. Labour governments have been elected on various occasions in those States, but they assumed not power but office because the representatives of conservative interests in the upper houses were able to frustrate any attempt to enact the legislation that they introduced. Thus, the will of the people has been frustrated, and it is hollow mockery on the part of honourable members opposite to support this measure when their party political predecessors down through the years made no protest against that system. The time has arrived when the people themselves must take up this matter because, apparently, it will be impossible to reform the upper houses in the State parliaments except by petitioning t\ie United Kingdom Parliament to prevail upon His Majesty and the government of the day in that country to alter this state of affairs by the enactment of legislation for the purpose in the United Kingdom Parliament. Legislation designed to effect such a reform cannot be enacted in this country unless it has the support of a majority of members of the upper house which it is designed to reform, or abolish.

255,"Mr Morgan""","Yes.a majority in. the Legislative Council in when the Stevens Government was returned it realized that the Labour party majority in the upper chamber was in a position to help to abolish that chamber. Therefore, the Stevens Government submitted by way of a referendum to the people a proposal which it was represented would provide for thp election of the Legislative Council on a democratic basis. The whole proposal was clouded by propaganda and -misrepresentation. referendum was carried by only a very small majority. Incidentally, the methods that the Stevens Government then employed were similar to methods that this Government seeks to employ under this measure. By providing for the election every three years of 15 members of the 60 members of the New South ""Wales upper house, the election of the whole of the members of the House is virtually spread over a period of twelve years. That alteration was made in the guise of a measure to give the people a democratic vote. In four groups of fifteen each the first members were elected for periods of three, six, nine and twelve years and subsequently, for twelve year periods. but by the most limited franchise that has ever been adopted in this countryby a total of 150 votes, 90 in the lower house and 60 in the upper house. Far from being a democratic vote, those who submitted themselves for election voted in respect of their own election and a quota of nine votes was sufficient to elect each member. That system was a travesty of democracy, and is a typical example of the sort of tactics that conservative interests resort to in order to suit their own purposes. The honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) revealed the true state of affairs when he pointed out that in one year the upper house made nearly 100 amendments in legislation that had been initiated in the Legislative Assembly. That sort of stratagem was also resorted to by the anti-Labour Opposition in the Senate during the regime of the Scullin Government. There are more ways of killthat State, hut subsequently ing a goose than by chopping off its head. The representatives of conservative interests in the New South Wales upper house were not prepared to make a direct attack on the legislation introduced by Labour governments in the Legislative Assembly, but by referring measure after measure to select committees for inquiry and report they were able to frustrate the will of the people. The manner in which this bill was introduced by the Prime Minister( Mr Nevertheless, the Menzies). showed the right honourable gentleman's undemocratic approach to this subject. He did not even consult the members of his own party about it. bers opposite keep repeating that statement, they will eventually believe it to be true. Prime Minister acted in a most undemocratic and dictatorial way and offered a studious insult to the collective brains of Government supporters. If the Prime Minister had consulted the members of his own team-and it includes many earnest young men-h e would have produced a better measure. Instead, he referred the problem to a young Liberal lawyer in Victoria, who is apparently well versed in cross word puzzles and skilled in the solution of football competitions, but has apparently not had much experience in political affairs. He is not even a politician, and he is not likely to become a statesman' unless he drops "" smart Alec"" legal tricks, gains more experience and reaches a better understanding of democracy. He is a little like the beardless professors who in war-time sought to impose their impractical theories on the Government of the day. Like them, he had all the answers. The Government, hoist with its own petard, now brings into bold relief the whole subject of the usefulness of upper branches of our legislative institutions. An upper house may have been all right in the horse and buggy days when events moved slowly and the parliaments of this country could afford to take their time in dealing with the affairs of the nation; but in this atomic age events move rapidly and consideration should be given to the streamlining",69,Mknmes

259,Mr Morgan,"In this matter thenot only of the Senate hut also of the upper houses of the States. The present situation calls for the formulation of a system that will be both workable and useful. In a masterly exposition of tbe situation last night, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) made constructive suggestions which should be given the closest consideration by the Government. The manner in which he tackled this subject showed that if the bill were referred to a joint -select committee of members of all political parties a useful and workable formula could be evolved. What we need is a Senate constituted and operating on lines somewhat similar to those of the Senate of the United States of America. We all know of the excellent work that is done by the committees of the United States Senate, notably the Foreign Affairs Committee. Let us consider for a moment what has happened recently in connection with the Government's much vaunted health and. medical benefits scheme. The Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) perambulates round the countryside consulting bodies and organizations concerned, with health matters, but honourable members who represent the people in this Parliament are not consulted in the formulation of the scheme. From day to day we get a ballto-ball description in the press of each fresh plan as it is evolved. If a joint committee representative of all political parties in the Parliament were appointed to consider such matters in detail the problems that face the Government would he dealt with more expeditiously than they are in present circumstances. A limit should also be placed on the period d.uring which the Senate may veto legislation that has been passed by the House of Representatives. The honourable member for Fremantle has suggested that we should follow the procedure adopted in Great Britain where the powers of the House of Lords to veto legislation passed by the House of Commons have been substantially curtailed. Now, the House of Lords may hold up legislation passed by the House of Commons for only a year. The adoption of a similar system in this country might well be considered by the Government. The Labour party is vitally interested in the reform of the Senate because Labour governments have had some bitter experiences when they have not had a majority in both Houses. This bill has heen introduced solely as a matter of expediency and it may not serve the Government's purpose. If , after it has been passed, a double dissolution occurs, the existing position in both Houses may well be reversed and a further deadlock may occur in a period even more dangerous than the present. The Government parties have not been consistent in their attitude to this matter. Only a few years ago, during the crisis of war, when the Curtin Labour Government was in power in this House, but not in control of the Senate, the anti-Labour Opposition in the Senate resorted to all sorts of manoeuvres to defeat its legislation. The same attitude was adopted by the anti-Labour Opposition Senate d.uring the economic depression when the Scullin Government was in command in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate. In two of the greatest periods of crisis in the history of the Commonwealth-the economic depression of the 'thirties, and during the years of World War II -the anti-Labour Opposition in the Senate ruthlessly used its majority to defeat legislation introduced by Labour governments. I urge the Government to give this matter further consideration. After all, second thoughts are best. According to the Government its proposal to change the law arises solely from its second thoughts on the matter. Let the Government follow its own advice and give a second thought to this legislation which has been introduced in a hasty and ill-conceived manner. If it agrees to appoint a select committee to inquire into and report upon the proposals contained in the bill a useful and workable formula will be devised which will place the Senate on a proper basis and allow the government of the day to carry on the business of the nation.

260,Debate (On Motion By Mr Pittard),,71,Papua And New Guinea
261,Mr Spender (Warringah,"Ministe rfor External Territories) -by leaveThree months ago, in my capacity as Minister for External Affairs, I surveyed Australian foreign policy and then pointed out that, situated as we are in the south-west corner of the Pacific with outlying islands of the Asian continent almost touching our own Territories of Papua and New Guinea, our first and constant interest must be the security of our own homeland and the maintenance of peace in the area in which our country is geographically situated. Experience has shown how vital the ring of islands to the north of Australia is to the defence of our country, and I do not need to remind honourable members of the part that the Territories of Papua and New Guinea played in the last war in preventing an aggressor from overrunning our country. SinceI made my statement on foreign policy I have had an opportunity to make an extensive tour of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea which has brought home to me how severely those territories and their inhabitants to the allied cause in repelling the tans suffered as a result of the war. It has, moreover, confirmed the conviction I already held that the importance of the territories to Australia has not been fully appreciated and that if we are to hold these territories safe from external aggressors they must be developed as quickly as our resources permit. There can be no doubt that we must so hold the area; nor can there be any question that we shall not be able so to do unless we make the fullest possible use of the undoubted natural resources with which the territories are endowed. The present Government has no illusions about the magnitude of the task of developing the Territories. The task is great, yet our resources are limited by many factors, including our own internal programme of development. The external territories of the Commonwealth consist of the Territory of Papua, the Trust Territory of New Guinea, Norfolk Island and the Trust Territory of Nauru, each of which has its own particular problems. The Territory of Papua has been the responsibility of Australia since 1906 and the Territory of New Guinea since 1914, when it was captured by Australian forces and, after the conclusion of hostilities, placed under Mr Spender. mandate to Australia in 1921. The area is now wi thin the trusteeship system and is administered by Australia under a trusteeship agreement approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Prior to the war of 1939-45, Papua and New Guinea were entirely separate entities and although steady progress was made in their development they were little known. They did not attract the public interest that their importance demanded. With the exception of an annual grant of a very small sum from the Commonwealth towards the cost of administration of the Territory of Papua, the Territories were required to live and develop within their own financial resources. Achievements in the administration of those areas, which are inhabited by backward peoples, were nevertheless, particularly in these circumstances, remarkable and the soundness of the policies pursued was clearly demonstrated by the loyalty and assistance given by so many of the indigenous inhabiJapanese who overran the territories and were halted only within about 35 miles of Port Moresby. The administrations of the territories were destroyed and practically the whole of the settlements and utilities were devastated. Civil administration was restored to the territories progressively from October, 1945, to June, 1946. Much has been done since then to re-establish the administrations of the Territories, to rehabilitate the inhabitants and to repair the ravages of war, and the Australian Government has made available funds to the amount of £11,000,000 to supplement the revenues of the territories to meet the cost of such work. Very much more, however, remains to be done, and my survey of the territories has clearly demonstrated to me that whilst the task of developing them is a big one, we cannot afford to neglect it and that we must with all possible speed ensure tbe advancement of the indigenous inhabitants and the fullest development of the territory resources. To achieve this purpose I believe that our prime objectives must be-(1 ) the welfare and advancement of the native peoples and their increasing participation in the natural wealth of the territories; (2) the development of the resources of the territories to the point at which Ultimately they will be economically selfsivpporting and thus advance their development and the welfare of their inhabitants, and enable them to supply the .needs of Australia and the world generally with the valuable commodities that they are capable of producing. In my survey of foreign policy, I stated that our purpose in relation to these external territories will be to ensure that they shall be administered and developed in a way best calculated to protect the welfare of the native inhabitants and, at the same time, to serve Australia's security interests. security interests clearly require that our efforts shall be directed towards establishing in these territories a population of a strength and quality that will enable us to build up in those areas a friendly, prosperous and loyal people who will be able in times of crisis to assist in the protection of their own interests and to provide strength, not weakness, to the Australian nation, to which they must inevitably turn as their protector. Ttjse objectives should generally be capable of attainment in conjunction with the normal economic development of the areas and, in the final analysis, the essential need in any programme for the advancement of these territories is active and progressive measures for theii economic development, from which is inseparable the political, social and economic advancement of the native people themselves. One of the principal, if not, the principal limiting factor, in the rate at which such development can be achieved is the size of the labour force that is available. The territories of Papua and New Guinea -wit h a total area of 180,000 square miles and an estimated population of 1,500,000-ar e sparsely populated and the degree of mechanization that is possible under a tropical economy is, for the time being at least, comparatively limited. It follows that, while there is yet an appreciable scope for economic advancement with the labour resources that are already available, development beyond a certain point will be largely dependent upon a population increase which, I am firmly convinced, will be possible only through active and extensive programmes for health, education and a generally improved standard of living for the native peoples. It will be apparent to honourable members from what I have said that the economic development of these areas presents a formidable task. The indigenous inhabitants of the territories will be unable, for many years to come, to play any important part in the executive government of their country. Moreover, they have neither the capital nor the skill to handle the task of developing the latent resources that are available in those areas. ""Whilst it will be the task of Considerations of the Government, through its programmes for their social advancement, to enable these peoples to take a constantly increasing share in the government of their country, it is to private enterprise under proper safeguards that the Government must to a major extent look for assistance in securing the economic advancement of these territories. To this end every encouragement will be afforded to private enterprise in bringing its available skill and capital to bear on the development of the territories' natural resources and, in so doing, to impart to these backward peoples the means of participating to an ever-increasing extent in developing the wealth of their country. It can be said, therefore, that this Government's purpose will be (1) to locate, assess and regulate the availability of the natural resources of the territories so as to bring them within reach for development; (2) to afford all reasonable encouragement for the investment of private capital in the development of these resources; (3) to ensure that the native peoples of the territories shall be enabled to participate to an ever-increasing extent in the fruits of this development. The limiting factor of labour, to which I have already referred, will necessarily govern the rate at which this development can be achieved and it will be apparent that, in any programme for the advancement of the territories, the Government must expect to find, for investment in these areas, large amounts of capital from which no immediate or even early return can be expected. In any programme for economic development of the territories it is essential to clarify the economic relationship that is to exist between Australia and its territories. It is the view of this Government that such development should generally be complementary to existing Australian industry. The economic relationship between Australia and the external territories will necessarily require to be developed in accordance with this broad policy. Australia is the logical market for territory production, and geographical and other advantages should normally ensure that market to the territories. However, during the initial stages of development, territory industry will almost certainly need a measure of assistance and protection which it will be the purpose of this Government to provide through whatever appropriate channels are available. Conversely, this arrangement implies that Australia should expect to supply the territory requirements of capital goods and consumer goods, and it is proposed that this arrangement shall also be secured to the greatest practicable extent. The effect of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the proposed International Trade Organization is not as yet fully clear in relation to the external territories, and it is possible that, the territories themselves. in giving effect to a policy ,on the foregoing lines, practical difficulties may be encountered because of the limitations that those international commitments impose on the grant of preferential treatment. However, it is the view of this Government that in the overall interests of Australia and the territories a close integration of economies is desirable and our policy will aim generally at this objective. Some progress has been made with the work of restoring the territories from the state of devastation that was caused by the recent war. In the territories of Papua and New Guinea, every township and settlement lying to the north of the Owen Stanley range was obliterated. can be developed by large-scale operaPlantations were heavily damaged and tions and it will be the policy of the scarcely a building of any description Government to encourage organizations remained. The cost of replacement for with the necessary technical staff and public utilities alone has not been estiresources to extend their organizations mated, but some indication of the damage to these areas. Recently, the Governcaused can be gained from the fact thut ment announced the decision to form, the total amount of war damage compenin conjunction with the British Alumisation paid to private firms and nonnium Company Limited, of London, a if r . Spender. native inhabitants alone was approximately £9,000,000. Such restora tion as has been achieved to date has been largely on a temporary basis, having been regulated by the quality of materials available and it is dear that, in conjunction with any programme for the expansion of activities in these areas, the Government must also expect to undertake to the extent that resources permit the heavy costs of an extensive reconstruction programme. In considering these financial aspects, however, it must be kept in mind that, quite apart from strategic and other considerations which require the early development of these areas, they in fact possess a potential wealth the development of which should eventually place them in a position of being self-supporting, not only for their day-to-day requirements, but also for such capital as they may require for tlieir longer term development. It will be the aim of this Government to see that this stage shall be reached at the earliest practicable time through-(1 ) A carefully planned programme of development; (2) close supervision of the expenditure of funds provided under that programme; (3) a sound and balanced fiscal policy within Generally, the policy of the Government for the territories will be to encourage private enterprise to foster production with a. view to their resources being developed to the utmost, and to advance the welfare of the native peoples. A very good example of private enterprise doing a job which the Government cannot do, is the search for oil. Already the Australasian Petroleum Company has spent millions of pounds on an undertaking which no government would venture to shoulder. If they find oil, as I hope they will, the progress of the territories will be tremendously stepped up. There are other latent resources that company to be known as tbe New Guinea Resources Prospecting Company Limited. The objectives of the company will be the location and development of largecapacity hydro-electric power schemes suitable for uses in industries, particularly aluminium production, and prospecting for bauxite and minerals relating to aluminium production. The territories are capable of producing many commodities such as rice, cocoa, jute, tea, &c., and with proper organization each of these could, no doubt, be the basis of a substantial industry. Rubber has been grown in the Territory of Papua since 1916, and for a number of years this industry has been one of the most important in that territory. During the war the rubber supplies that Papua was able to provide to the Allied war effort were invaluable. This industry has, however, been subject to market fluctuations over the years and requires to be reorganized and expanded so as to make it a large-scale and stable industry of the territory. An economic survey of the industry was made some time ago and the report of that survey is now being examined so as to determine the best way in which the industry can be stabilized and expanded in the long term. Other possible ways in which the agricultural resources of the territory may be developed are in relation to the use of mangrove bark for tanning and the use of inferior types of timber for the establishment of a wood pulp industry. The kunai grass which grows prolifically in the territory has been shown to be suitable for the manufacture of paper. During the last few days I have received samples of paper made from that grass from the northern district of the Territory of Papua. The extent to which these may lead to profitable commercial projects, however, remains to be tested. Gold has been produced over a number of years mainly at Edie Creek and Bulolo Valley in the Territory of New Guinea. Knowledge of the resources of that territory in other minerals is scant as full investigation has not been made. Arrangements have been made whereby the technical staff of the Commonwealth Bureau of Mineral Resources has been made available to the Administration of the Territory and a resident geologist and other staff have been appointed for duty there. The technical staff will carry out investigations to determine whether such minerals as asbestos, chromite, platinum, &c, exist in the territory. There are known deposits of sulphur, copper and manganese, and an examination will be made to determine their extent. The Government attaches such importance to the future of the external territories that it has appointed a ministerial standing committee, composed of myself as the Minister for External Territories, the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture National Development ( Mr .Casey) to assist in the preparation of material for the consideration of the Government. Also, the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) has been appointed Parliamentary Secretary to assist me in relation to the external territories portfolio. Considerable investigation and thought will be necessary before full details can be worked out to give effect to the broad principles of policy that I have mentioned. However, as a result of my visit it has been possible to take decisions in regard to a number of pressing matters and I shall now mention some of them. Since the war the Australian Government has accepted the responsibility for providing shipping and stevedoring services within the territories and has purchased a number of vessels which are operating under agency agreements that were concluded with three of the companies which operated shipping services In the territories before the war. As the territories were almost entirely dependent upon shipping for internal transport the provision of efficient and adequate shipping services is of the highest priority. The task is plainly and preferably one for private enterprise, and inquiries are now being made both in Australia and overseas to ascertain the extent to which private enterprise might be interested in providing the services that are required. The services must, however, cater adequately for the requirements of all interests in the territories. As a first step towards placing this important activity with private enterprise the ban upon vessels over 25 tons operating in the service",71,Papua And New Guinea
262,( Mr Mcewen) And The Minister For,"which was imposed by the preceding Government has been removed, and it is now possible for any vessel that complies with the laws of the territories relating to further applications be received for timber registration and operation to engage in the trade. This has already proved of benefit to the territories. Furthermore, 1 have directed that stevedoring at ports in the territories shall be open to private enterprise. The Territories of Papua and New Guinea are covered to a. large extent by rain forests. The forests resources are not so large, however, that they can be subjected to unrestricted cutting. The forests for the most part are of very complex composition and present considerable difficulty to economic harvestactivities in the territories, it has been ing and utilization. ""With proper treatment the territories will be capable of providing for their own timber requirements and to supply a considerable quantity of logs and timber for export. However, without the application of proper forestry methods the timber resources could be dissipated in a comparatively short time and irreparable damage would be caused in the territories. Apart from the timbers that can be secured for general purposes there are two species of special value, that is, walnut, and klinkii and hoop pine. New Guinea walnut, which is available in limited quantities, has already found favour in overseas markets and judicious cutting of this timber can be continued so as to develop a reasonable export trade. The stand for hoop and klinkii pine in the Bulolo Valley, which has received considerable prominence during recent years, is a valuable national asset and is regarded as one of the most important stands of timber of its kind in the southern hemisphere. For some considerable time the milling of timber even for local requirements has been for all practical purposes at a standstill, even to the extent that timber has been imported from New Zealand; and during my visit, a serious application was made to me that dollars should be provided to enable timber to be imported into New Guinea from America. Two basic points of policy formulated by the preceding Government in 1946 were that holders of pre-war permits should be encouraged to re-establish their operations so as to meet the Mr Spender. requirements of the territory for sawn timber and to supply logs and sawn timber to Australia and overseas; that no permits for general logging and milling; and that all future grants of timber be only in respect of areas designated by the territory Department of Forests and be allotted as a result of public tenders. I have found that in the absence of appropriate legislation, the timber requirements of Papua were not being met and that, although many people in both Papua and New Guinea were ready and anxious to carry out timber operations they' could not do so. Recognizing the importance of timber supplies for practically all determined that there shall be a vigorous forest policy on the following lines:(1) An orderly development of a timber industry in the territories on sound forestry principles with provision for the reafforestation of all areas to the satisfaction of the forestry officials of the territories. (2) As a general rule rights to forest areas may be obtained only as the result of public tender, and in respect of areas that have been designated by forest officials of the territories. There will, however, be exceptions to this general rule so as to meet the requirements of the territories, and the Administrator will be authorized to grant timber rights over stands of timber not exceeding 5,000,000 super, feet without tender where the timber is for territory use and not for export unless so authorized by the Administrator. Such timber rights are, however, to be regarded as emergency measures and will be limited to a period of ten years. (3) To meet local requirements in districts adjacent to timber supplies, for example the Sepik district, the Administrator will be empowered to issue to sawmillers authority to secure from natives logs that will be used to supply timber for the district itself. (4) Royalty will be payable to the Administration on all timber cut. It will be the aim of the Administration to ensure that such timber rights as are granted shall be worked and, as a means to that end, holders of timber rights granted pre-war and still current will be required to fulfil the conditions of those permits by the 31st December, 1950. That will be done in order to prevent areas that ought to be used from lying unused. The Bulolo pine stand, and such other areas as are declared by notice in the Gazette, will, however, require special consideration. The previous Government tentatively decided that the Bulolo pine stand should be developed for the production in the territory of plywood, veneer and timber, by a joint company to be formed by the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with Bulolo Gold Dredging Company. This proposal is being re-examined by the Government, which has appointed a committee un'der the chairmanship of Mr G. J. Rodger, Commonwealth Director-General of Forestry, to advise whether this or some other method would ensure that the pine stand shall be used to the best advantage. An ordinance will be enacted to give expression to the policy that has been outlined, but, in the meantime, I have directed that restrictions which had been placed upon the administration of the present ordinance of the Territory of New Guinea shall be removed. The present timber ordinance of the Territory of Papua will be repealed and the forestry ordinance of New Guinea will be applied to Papua. An increased staff of trained foresters will be required and steps are being taken with a view to securing such personnel. Prior to the war, natives in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea were employed under a system of contract known as the indenture system. Under this system natives were liable to imprisonment for breaches of tbe contract such as desertion, failure to show reasonable diligence and disobedience of a reasonable order, &c. .Shortly after the re-establishment of civil administration, the former Government approved modifications of the system and removed the provision which required that impr son: ment should be a penalty. Pecuniary punishments were provided for such offences as being absent from work without leave or reasonable excuse, improper performance of work and causing friction between labourers and employers. Those pecuniary punishments are still applicable. The maximum period of service under a contract was reduced from three years to one year and the provision was made that a native could not again be employed under contract until he had been home for a period of three months. At the same time it was announced that the indenture system would be abolished as soon as possible, and in any case within a period of five years. A separate Department of Native Labour was established to deal with all aspects of the employment of natives. This Government is in agreement with the decision to abolish the indenture system within the time stated. Although the indenture system will be abolished, the majority of natives in the territories have not reached the stage of being able to work without some form of written agreement approved by the Administration. There are in the territories natives in varying stages of development. If these people are to be employed in industry, it is essential to retain adequate safeguards to regulate their recruitment and employment. It is proposed, therefore, to retain these safeguards in the form of a written agreement to be known as ""Native Employee's Agreement"". This agreement will incorporate the provisions of the existing contract of service under which those necessary safeguards are provided, while dispensing with the provisions relating to penalties, leaving only the civil remedies that would apply to any normal contract for an agreement between and employer and an employee. From my observations and the inquiries that I have made, I am satisfied that the limitation of the term of engagement to one year is not in the best interests of the natives or of the territories. It is, therefore, proposed that the maximum fixed period of employment under the agreement shall be eighteen months with a provision that the period of engagement, may be extended by a further period not exceeding six months; but with the right, to both the native and the employer to terminate the contract during such further period by giving ono month's notice. No term of engagement, will be permitted beyond the period of two years, after which it will be necessary for the native to be returned to bis village before entering into any further term of engagement. Tbe existing provision under tbe ordinance relating to tbe employment of natives in certain circumstances without written contract will be continued. Those provisions are that a native may be employed without written agreement within the district in which his home is situated or in any part of the territory where authority is given for such native to be employed without authorized officer of the administration. The provisions of the present Native Labour Ordinance under which natives may be employed under contracts of service will continue in operation until the 31st December, 1950, and new contracts may be made under those provisions until and including that date. Any contracts that are current at the 31st December, 1950, may continue for the balance unexpired of the full period. of twelve months, but no new contracts of service will be possible after the date mentioned. An ordinance will be enacted to provide for native employees' agreements and they will be operative from a date to be announced. The operation of the revised system under which natives may be employed will be closely watched and I have arranged for the Administrator to report to me periodically as to how the system is working. The Government considers that the extension of the maximum period of employment will have a marked effect upon both the native and industry in the territories. The native will be able to remain in employment for a sufficiently long period to secure a training in industry and the employer will be able to bring reasonable stability to his operations. During my visit to the territories I saw natives in their villages and in employment in industry. The beneficial effect upon the natives of the regular food and medical and other attention that they receive while in is. most evident. The supervision of the employment of natives is one of the major tasks of the Administration and should be undertaken by officers trained and experienced in the administration of natives generally. It has, therefore, been decided that the Department of Native Labour, as at present constituted, shall 'be put of the territories. As a result of the Mr Spender. discontinued and that the functions o!' the Administration in regard to the control of natives in employment shall be allotted to the Department of District Services and Native Affairs, which in my opinion is better qualified to discharge these functions. A separate organization primarily for inspectorial purposes will, however, be retained. This separate organization will be placed under the administrative control of the Government Secretary. written agreement by an The Territories of Papua and New Guinea have been joined in an administrative union, but the separate customs tariffs which operated in these territories before the war are still in force. These tariffs differ materially in the rates and incidence of the duties imposed and -it has been decidtd to revise them with the object of bringing them into line and so providing a uniform tariff for the two territories. At the same time, the opportunity has been taken to review generally the incidence of the duties and as a result the schedules of duties will be revised to move the incidence of taxation from important basic necessities towards less essential and non-essential items. The purpose of thi is to relieve both general industrial costs and the basic co3ts of living as a measure of assistance and encouragement in the further development of these territories. This new tariff will take effect as from the 1st July, 1950. Copra is the most important of the agricultural products of the territories. Prior to the war, exports amounted to some 90,000 tons per annum. Following on the invasion of the territories in 1942, production of copra came to a standstill. Subsequently, the Australian New Guinea Production Control Board was formed the purpose of which was to secure from the areas within our control the greatest possible output of this product which was employment badly needed for war purposes. With the ending of war, this board was used for the purpose of assisting private enterprise in the rehabilitation of the industry. As this rehabilitation progressed, the board gradually relinquished its activities and since 1947 it has been responsible only for the marketing of the copra outworld-wide shortages of fats and oils wbich have developed during and since the siders that the agreement does not, in war, copra is at present commanding high itself, provide the full measure of prices.

Negotiations to this end are now in progress with companies and organizations likely to be interested in the marketing of territory copra under these sonditions. Pending the termination of the board's activities, producers will be given representation on the board, which at present is composed only of government officials. The present procedure for obtaining land in the territories and the machinery for the administration of tbe laws of the territories relating to land will be overhauled with a view to facilitating the taking up of land by people who wish to settle in the territories. Land in the territories belongs to the native inhabipersonnel of the former administration of tants who may only dispose of it when administration officials are satisfied that disposal of it will not be detrimental to the interests of the natives. It A3 proposed to carry out an investigation of the land holdings of natives with a view to determining what further area could be made available for nonnative development without injury to the interests of the natives. During the course of my visit numerous representations were made to me that some scheme of land settlement for ex-servicemen should be formulated for the territories. I favour such a proposal and it will be examined in consultation with the appropriate Commonwealth authorities. acquired after the 1914-18 war a number of plantations in New Guinea which were vested in the Custodian of Expropriated Property and were sold under long-term agreements. Some of these properties have reverted to the possession of the Custodian and will be made available for purchase by ex-servicemen at an early date. Mr Spender. Our first and foremost duty is the advancement of the native peoples of the territories and their development to the stage at which they will beable to share in the administration of their country. This will take a very long time, but the natives have shown that with the proper guidance and the opportunity they have the capacity to carry out both manual and mental tasks in accordance with our concepts. Immediately following the re-establishment of civil administration after the war a major task was rehabilitation of the native inhabitants and the reconstruction of their villages. This phase has been completed and the native life of the territories has in a large measure been restored to the pre-war standard. This, however, is not enough and it is the aim of this Government to improve those standards as rapidly and as far as its resources will permit it to do so. Such an improvement will be effected through health, education and agricultural services. In all those services the first requirement is the provision of staff, which must be carefully selected and trained for the specialized tasks they will be required to perform. The heavy loss of experienced Papua and New Guinea has been a severe handicap and it is not possible for that loss to be repaired in a short time. The special arrangements that were made for the training of staff at the Australian School of Pacific Administration will be continued and action is now being taken to appoint a principal and other academic staff to the school. Applications for these positions were advertised some time ago. The council of the school is now examining the applications received and it is expected that the appointments will be announced at an early date. There are areas of the territories that have not yet been brought under the conThe Australian Government trol of the administration and in which the native inhabitants have not been in touch with the -white man. Many of these areas are in the centre of the mainland of New Guinea and consist of most rugged country. The task of bringing the natives of those areas under the control of the administration is difficult end slow. However, we cannot allow any part of the territories We administer to remain a closed book to us any longer than can be avoided and it is the aim of the Government that every part shall be fully within the next five years. I was at Goroka in the central highlands when an administration patrol returned after an absence of some weeks from the station during which it penetrated areas not previously visited and located large populations that had been living in completely primitive isolation. Such patrols demonstrate the success of the system of peaceful penetration and the need that I have mentioned already to have experienced staff in order to extend and consolidate government influence. Some time ago in this House an inquiry was made regarding the wisdom of permitting natives from the highland areas to be engaged for employment in other areas in the territories. Until 1949 there had been a prohibition upon the employment of natives from areas above an altitude of 3,500 feet in areas below that height. The extension of the administration influence into the highland areas has shown them to be inhabited by a large population of a virile type and following investiit. gations by the Director of Public Health and other technical officers of the adminiskeenness to participate in the movement, tration, it was considered that with proper safeguards such natives could be permitted to engage for employment in other areas with advantage to themselves and to the development of the territories. The medical examinations and vaccinations against tuberculosis, typhoid and other 1 diseases. The natives are selected by the administration from those desirous of proceeding to employment and special measures are taken to supervise their activities at their places of employment. I was met by an assembly of natives at Goroka and two of their spokesmen conveyed to me the enthusiasm of the people for the scheme. They were very interested to know how their fellows who were in employment elsewhere had fared and I listened to an officer who had recently visited the places where the natives were employed describe the conditions of employment and assure their relatives of their well-being. A request was made to me that some of the seniors should be permitted to visit those areas to see the conditions under which their kinsmen were living. Authority was given to the district officer to arrange controlled and administered for some of the village leaders to be given an opportunity to make such a visit in company with an Administration official. At present many of the natives are transported long distances to their places of employment. As the resources of the territories are developed it will be the aim to employ the natives as near to their homes as possible; in other words, to develop the resources adjacent to the areas in which there are large populations. An instance of the possibilities has been given by an inquiry that has been received concerning the growing of vegetables in the highland areas of the territories. There is a constant demand for fresh vegetables in such centres as Port Moresby, and with air transport it should be possible to meet this demand from an organized industry in the highlands. The co-operative movement has been introduced, and the Administration is guiding and sponsoring natives in the formation of societies under The natives have displayed a which is being encouraged by the Administration as it affords a splendid opportunity to the native for self help and is a practical means of education in the ways of modern society. safeguards include special The Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme was established in the territories for the benefit of natives who served with the forces during the war. This produced very creditable results, and a scheme of a like nature has been continued by the Administration, and is open to all natives who svish to receive, and are adaptable for, training as artisans and technicians such as carpenters, electricians, engineers, &c. In all these activities in relation to the native peoples care is taken to preserve the structure of native tribal life and native customs that are not harmful or repugnant to humanity. The native village of Hanuabada close to Port Moresby is now being rebuilt by the natives themselves under the guidance of an administration officer. The matter of rebuilding this village has been the source of concern to the Administration for some years and is now being solved largely by the initiative and enterprise of the native people themselves. The natives of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea were not included in the Australian war damage compensation scheme and the former Government approved of a special scheme of compensation for the natives to cover death and injury to their persons and destruction and damage to their property. Amounts totalling £960,000 have already been distributed to the natives and the latest estimates indicate that a further amount of approximately £1,230,000 remains to be paid under the scheme, making a total estimated cost of approximately £2,200,000. During my recent visit to the territories environment, including all aspects of representations were made to me to the effect that the circulation of these large sums of money to the natives had had a harmful effect upon their outlook in regard to employment and also upon the economy of the territories generally. Moreover, in the absence of a full supply of goods that would be useful to the natives, it is considered that they themselves have not received the full benefit which the scheme was designed to give to them. Indeed, in many cases, they wasted the money in useless purchases and accordingly much of it was dissipated and not used for the purposes for which it was intended. I. considered that, whilst natives continued to receive cash payments from the fund and were not able to put such moneys to proper use, the territories and the natives themselves were not receiving the benefit of this money, which is being made available by the Australian Therefore, steps are being taken to protect the interests of the natives by paying into savings bank accounts all moneys payable to them in excess of a small amount. ""Withdrawals from these accounts would be permitted only on the authority of a district officer, who will see that the sums withdrawn shall be applied to the purpose for which they are intended, namely, the replacement by the native of goods and effects lost during the war period or to enable him to purchase other classes of goods that would assist his rehabilitation. Mr Spender. is abundantly clear that hand-outs of money do not represent the best way to advance the interests of the native and make him a responsible person. Such easy money can be positively demoralizing and prevent the native from realizing that only by his own efforts and enterprise can he improve his status and standard of living. In the promotion of the welfare and advancement of the native people and in the steps to be taken to ensure their participation in the fruits of the development of the resources of the territories, one of the principal factors is education. The broad objectives of the educational programme of the territories are universal literacy and the development of the native people as a community within their own native culture. To this must be added such instruction as will assist the native to adjust his mode of life to the changed conditions resulting from contact with civilization and culture and such technical training as will assist him to become more self-sufficient whilst taking an active part in the general development of the territories. A plan for an educational programme has been prepared and is designed to become fully operative over a period of five years. This plan is now being examined in the light of the needs of the territories, the availability of staff and cost of equipment, buildings and other essential factors. Apart from native education there is the need to provide adequate facilities for the children of European and Asiatic residents. This aspect is covered by the plans prepared. Up to the present, however, secondary education has not been availGovernment. able in the territories and children have had to proceed to the Australian mainland to complete this phase of education. Approval has now been given for the establishment of a secondary school at Wau, and the preliminary steps to prepare plans for the building have been taken. A scheme was in existence to establish a composite school for Asiatics and Europeans. After giving the matter careful examination, I consider that, in existing circumstances, the time for that is not opportune, and accordingly I decided against it and directed that the It scheme be discontinued. The Christian missions have always played an important part in the territories in relation to education, health and the general welfare of the native people. In the plans for the extension of educational and health services, the facilities provided by the missions will have their place, and the integration of the activities of the administration and the missions in these spheres should prove of mutual benefit resulting in improved services generally. I had an opportunity of visiting some of the missions, and I was greatly impressed by the zeal of the missionaries, their devotion to their task and the benefits they have conferred upon the native peoples. In any territory development, an intebe protected from disease and regral part of the plans must be better health, with its greater expectation of life, and an increasing population. Future large-scale development of the territories requires a larger labour potenare needed to give a minimal tial than is immediately available. A high ambition is to achieve eventually a 2 per cent, annual increase of population. .Better health in the territories demands an expanded service which can give full practice to modern concepts of preventive and therapeutic medicine. A major contribution to this expanded service must be the part taken by the native people themselves. It is therefore essential that training establishments be introduced. Fortunately, many of the diseases of the territories lend themselves to the practice of preventive medicine. It is hoped that, as staffing allows, more intensive campaigns will be undertaken to minimize or even eradicate many of the diseases, such as malaria, hookworm, yaws, the dysenteries, whooping cough and leprosy. Already, mass vaccination with B.C.G. against tuberculosis is being carried out and this, with other precautions, has allowed native people from the central highlands to move safely to coastal areas. These central highlanders for the first ? time recently in contact with Europeans, have no tuberculosis in their midst, in contrast to many coastal people, where, after more than 50 years' contact, it is now a scourge. Furthermore, with air travel and population movements in the Far East, it has become necessary to commence widespread compulsory vaccination against small-pox. A problem facing the Administration arises from the fact that, as the people become civilized and their expectation of life increases, the health authorities see diseases not commonly experienced amongst the primitive native people but well known in our western communities, such, as cancer and appendicitis. To meet these many medical problems in territories such as Papua and New Guinea, with their limited transport, facilities, there must be an adequate staff and sufficient institutions in which diseases may be treated and natives trained to take their place in the Department of Public Health. Such services must also provide that people who make their homes in the territories will ceive the full benefits of modern treatments. The Director of Publie Health of the Territory has strongly represented that at least 76 hospitals optimum service to them. It should be remembered that the territories have an area of about 180,000 square miles, two and a quarter times the size of Victoria, and an estimated population of over 1,500,000. In addition to general hospitals, tuberculosis and leprosy hospitals, a mental asylum and bulk stores are required. It is estimated that the cost of such a programme will be in the vicinity of £7,000,000. A committee including Dr. John Gunther, the Director of Public Health of the Territory, Dr. W. Kirkland, of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and Dr. T. Brennan, formerly Director of Public Health of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, will very shortly make a full investigation of these requirements. Immediate requirements are base hospitals and medical training establishments at Port Moresby and Lae, and tenders for these will be invited in Australia and overseas as soon a3 the necessary technical details can be determined with a view speedily to provide these esssential institutions. The European hospital at Port Moresby is a disgrace to this country. In association with the hospital at Port Moresby there will be a central medical school, on the lines of the Central Medical School at Suva, at which natives will be trained to be assistant medical practitioners. The recent arrival of 3S New Australian medical improved the staffing position, so that now every district has at least one medical officer. Such increase in staffing has allowed an expansion of the infant and maternal welfare work and for investigation to be made of areas in which there is either a high infant death rate or a low birth rate with depopulation. in Papua and New Guinea? told, the infant mortality rate is as high as 50 per cent. During my visit I was not satisfied with the progress that was -being made with the building of houses, wharfs, offices and other government establishments, and since my return I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Gasey), who is rendering to me every assistance in the task. I found that, since the re-establishment administration in 1945-46, various methods have been tried to find a way speedily to carry out the large reconstrucbranch of the Department of Works and tion programme that is necessary to restore and expand government facilities in the territories and to operate and maintain such facilities as roads, water supply, electricity &c. Prior to the war, the Commonwealth Department of Works did not operate in the Territory of Papua or the Territory of New Guinea, each of which maintained its own public works department. In 1945, the administrations of the two territories were provisionally combined, and, as from the 1st July, 1949, this arrangement was confirmed by the Papua and New Guinea Act, which provides for the territories to be administered in administrative union with one administration and one public service. In 1945, the territorial Public Works Department was established, with responsibility for the maintenance and operation of public utilities, and, by arrangement with the Minister for Works and Housing, his department was to carry out major works as requested by my department. It was found that the territorial Public Works Department was unable to carry out the maintenance tasks. owing principally to the lack of suitable staff. It was then arranged that the practitioners has greatly Department of Works and Housing should take over all works projects in the territories, including operation and the maintenance of public utilities, for an estimated period of from three to five years, but, owing again to difficulty in regard to the recruitment of staff, this has not been fully effective. Late in 1949, by agreement between the Minister for External Territories and the Minister for Works and Housing of the former Government, it was proposed that the works organization for the territories should be re-organized and that for a period of from eight to ten years the territorial Public Works Department should be inoperative and that a branch of the Department of Work and Housing should be established there in the same way as that department operates in the States of tbe Commonwealth. The organization for this arrangement has been completed in consultation witb of civil the Commonwealth Public Service Board and, while I was there, the Director Director of Works commenced duty. The Housing will be the constructing authority for the Administration and for the Department of Civil Aviation and such other Commonwealth departments as operate in the territories. Under this arrangement, it is expected that many of the difficulties previously experienced in regard to staff, particularly technical staff, will be overcome and that when the arrangement is fully effective it will be possible to proceed with the construction programme for the territories as expeditiously as the supply of men and materials will permit. It is realized that the supply of material*; in the territories and in Australia will be a determining factor in the rate at which the programme can be carried out but by a greater use of private contractors, both from Australia and overseas, it is hoped that appreciable progress will be made in the overall programme which, however, in the most favorable circumstances, may not be near completion for a number of years. It is hoped that, by large scale contracts, costs will be reduced and the present limitation of Australian resources will be overcome by attracting",75,Papua And New Guinea

264,Mr Spender,"In some places, I amcommercial organizations from overseas with the necessary men and material to undertake construction work in the territories. A contract has already been let for the construction of a wharf at Samarai and the tenders that have been received for one at Madang are now being examined. Tenders will be invited for a new wharf at Port Moresby as soon as plans and specifications have been completed. These projects, including a wharf which is being constructed at Lae by the Department of Works and Housing, are estimated to cost about £700,000. Included in the major works to be undertaken are the rebuilding of Port Moresby, now the capital of the two territories, according to an approved plan, the building of Lae and a settlement to replace Rabaul, the completion of the road front the coaist to the gold-fields in them since the re-occupation of Rabaul. the Morobe district, and hydro-electric installations at Port Moresby and later in other parts. 1 So far as the maintenance of the road from the goldfields is concerned, negotiations are now in train with a view to this work being carried out by gold-mining companies that operate in the area. In addition to the works I have mentioned, a further intensive programme is necessary to supply the houses, offices, schools, hospitals and obher establishments that are required. A full programme of such works is now being prepared so that it will be possible properly to organize the projects in an orderly manner. It will be remembered that a severe have been experienced in the loading, volcanic eruption occurred at Rabaul in unloading and transhipment of stores 1937 with disastrous results to the native and copra. population and the town, which was then the capital of the Territory of New Guinea.

In the meantime, Rabaul will be maintained as M temporary administrative centre and all possible precautions will be taken to guard against any loss of life in the event of another eruption. A vulcanological observatory established after the 1937 eruption was destroyed during the war. Arrangements were made this year for its re-establishment, and a vulcanologist took up duty' in the territory in April last. This will ensure to residents facilities for giving advance warnings of impending eruptions that have not been available to Rabaul is one of the most important ports and is a point of concentration for territory produce for shipment overseas. All wharfage accommodation was destroyed during the war, and such temporary wharfs as were constructed after the recapture of the area have a limited and uncertain life. It is proposed, however, to maintain those facilities so far as it is practicable to do so, and to assist in the provision of wharfage and storage accommodation three Philippine lighters have been purchased. These lighters were towed from Sydney to Rabaul and arrived there on the 27th May. They should go a long way towards removing the difficulties that I have already mentioned the steps services throughout the area by private operators, as it is recognized that they, too, can play an important part in opening up the territories. The administration of the territory is vested in an administrator, who is assisted by an executive council and twelve departments. Guinea Act passed in 1949 makes provision for the establishment of a legislative council to consist partly of nominated members and partly of elected members and includes a provision that three of the nominated members shall be indigenous people of the territory. The act further provides that the Legislative Council shall be established as soon as practicable after the 1st July, 1950. Pending the establishment of the Legislative Council, legislation for the territory is made by tbe Governor General. This Government is not entirely satisfied that the proposed composition of the council will be in the best interests of the territory in its present stage of, development. The provisions of the act will, therefore, be further examined before steps are taken to bring the council into being. In the meantime, however, it is felt that the people of the territory should be in a position to express their views on matters affecting their interests, and it is proposed that district advisory councils consisting of residents nominated by the Administrator shall be established to assist the district officers in the various districts. It is frequently stated that, in the administration of the territories, there is too much control from Canberra and not enough responsibility granted to the man on the spot. the Department of External tories in Canberra and the Administration in the territory have been doing excellent jobs in most difficult circumstances. The department in Canberra, which has never been given the recognition that its importance demands, was established as a separate department with a separate ministerial portfolio only in 1941 by the former Menzies Government. Even so, it was not until 1944 that a separate secretary was provided for the department. Cinderella of Commonwealth departments and it has only been by the energy and enthusiasm of a small number Mr Spender. of officers that the department has been -able to cope with the many and varied problems that are inherent in the administration of the external territories. Steps that are in train to strengthen the staff of the department will be continued so that it will be equipped to The Papua and New carry out its functions. A t the same time it is clearly necessary that responsibility for detailed administration shall rest with the staff in the territory and that there shall not be undue reference to Canberra in matters that can and should be settled on the spot. It will therefore be the policy of this Government to place administrative responsibility as close as possible to the people who are affected by such administrative actions. As between Canberra and Port Moresby, delegated authority will be reposed in the Administrator whenever practicable, and likewise, in the territory itself, there will be a policy of decentralization and the spreading of authority. In the pre-war laws of the territory, which are still in force, the Administrator was required to submit to the Minister for approval any item of proposed expenditure that exceeded £5,000. Steps are being taken to amend the relevant ordinance so that the Administrator will be able to incur expenditure upon any one item not exceeding £15,000. applied since the end of World War II . ? operation, but the ordinance will be amended within a week or so. In my I have found that view, it is fantastic to limit expenditure Terriby the Administrator to the amount of £5,000. Therefore, I propose immediately to increase his authority in order to enable him to expend up to the amount of £15,000 on any one item. This is the first step towards delegating increased authority to the Administrator, as I am satisfied that only by so doing can the best efficiency be developed. As an extension of the same principle, the financial authority of the heads of departments and district In fact, it has been the officers in the territory will be increased. As a further step towards more speedy and effective administration, two officers in distant parts of the territory will be",84,Papua And New Guinea
265,Mr Deummond,Has that system,86,Papua And New Guinea
266,Mr Spender,"That law is still invested with the powers of the Administrator in the capacity of deputy administrators. Such officers will be required to act for the Administrator in routine matters and in other matters that are within the framework of the approved policy on any subject. A greater measure of authority and responsibility will also be vested in the district officers in relation to all matters within the districts in which they are placed in charge. I pay a tribute to the district officers and to the work they do. I think that their prestige and standing have been allowed to decline. I propose to restore that prestige, which, I am convinced, will be in the best interests of the Administration. Henceforth they will be known as district commissioners. With a view to securing a cohesive administration in all its aspects, arrangements will be made for a regular exchange of officers of the Department of External Territories with officers of the territorial administration. It is proposed also to approach the British Colonial Office and the New Zealand Government with a view to arrangements being made for a regular interchange of suitable officers in the various areas under their administration. In order that the technical officers in such departments as Agriculture, Forestry, Native Administration, i i c , will be able to learn the methods used and the problems encountered in other tropical areas, selected officers will be sent overseas for training. One particular item in relation to territory administration that has caused delay in bringing some matters to finality is the inability of the department and the administration to have legal drafting work done in the normal course of Commonwealth Administration. This has been hampering in many directions and, after consultation with the Solicitor General, arrangements have now been made whereby as many ordinances as possible will be prepared within the Department of External Territories and the territorial administration before submission to the Minister for approval. Prior to the passing of the Papua-New Guinea Act 1949, the Public Service of the territory was on a provisional basis. An investigation was carried out to obtain the necessary data to establish a permanent Public Service under the act. The principles of classification for the service have been approved, and details are now being worked out in consultation with the Public Service Commissioner for the territory. The proposed classification will make provision for approximately 1,600 officers and is designed to equip the administration adequately to carry out the difficult and important task of native administration and other functions of government that are so necessary for the development of the territories. The rates of salary and the conditions of employment for officers of the Public Service have been reviewed with the object of bringing them into line with improved Public Service standdards and having regard to the special requirements of the territories. One of the major obstacles to the establishment of a stable and contended Public Service has heen the inability to provide reasonable living accommodation both for single and married officers. Much reconstruction and building is essential and will take a long time to complete. For the officers of the administration alone it is calculated that at. least 2S0 residences will be required by the 30th June, 1952. Authority has been given for the construction of 62 houses and for the erection in Port Moresby of single accommodation for about 70 officers. The need for the provision of such accommodation is fully recognized, and ways and means are now being explored to accelerate the construction. I was greatly impressed by the enthusiastic representations that were made to me at various places for the re-establishment of the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles as a unit of the Australian Citizen Military Forces. My colleague, the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) has already announced that approval has been given for this to be done and that enlistment will begin as soon as the necessary administration machinery can be set up. Numerous requests were also made for assistance in the formation of rifle clubs. The Government will give every possible encouragement in this connection. Approval has also been given for the formation of a Papuan-New Guinea Division of the Royal Australian Navy, to be recruited from the indigenous inhabitants of the territories. The establishment of a native regiment as a part of the Australian Military Forces is also under consideration. It is most important that the territories should be kept free of subversive influences, and steps will be taken, by legislation and otherwise, to see that they are not exposed to this menace. From the re-establishment of civil administration, between October, 1945, and June, 1946, to the 30th June, 1949, ihe expenditure by the Administration was £9,300,000, and it is estimated that by the 30th June, 1950, the amount will be £14,500,000. During that period the revenue of the territory amounted to £3,926,000, and the balance was made available by the Australian Government by way of grants. The more intensive programme for the development of the territories will entail increased expenas a "" must"", and as involving a different diture. It has been estimated that a programme of hospital building will amount to about £7,000,000, and the cost of establishing a head-quarters settlement to replace Rabaul is calculated to cost at least £5,000,000. Many other items necessary for reconstruction and development will involve expenditure :i comparable scale. Expenditure of that magnitude is clearly beyond normal budgetary provision, and the question of obtaining at least a substantial portion of the necessary funds by way of loan must accordingly be explored. It is intended also that the share of the cost of administration borne by the residents shall be fully examined. p resent time, residents are not subject to Oommonwealth income tax, nor is there any direct territorial taxation. territorial customs tariff, under which import and export duties are levied, and there is a royalty of 5 per cent, on gold produced. There are also various fees and levies collected by the Administration in connection with mining, lands and other operations. Further, it is considered that hank finance should be available to assist private persons and companies who wish to settle in tbe territories, and the means of doing this will be investigated in consultation with the Commonwealth Bank and other banking institutions. This, it. is considered, will be a most important factor in the future development of the Mr Spender. territories, as it is necessary both for the advancement of the native inhabitants and the territories generally that the Australian population in the areas shall be augmented as much as possible. Australia has, in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, a great responsibility and a great opportunity. We must make up our minds that the tasks ahead of us, which I have mentioned only in bare outline, are such that we must courageously face up to them and discharge them if this area, vital to Australia, is to be kept secure and its people gradually developed as a self-supporting, modern community. These people look to Australia as their natural protector in their interests as well as our own. We must get on with the task as rapidly as possible. In my opinion, we should view our financial commitments in respect of the territories budgetry approach from the method that has been adopted to date. We cannot solve the problems of New Guinea merely by relying on revenue hand-outs by the Commonwealth. We must consider engaging in loan expenditure which, in my view, is the proper way for the purpose of on establishing capital buildings and equipment in the territories. that deductions were made from the. pay of the natives for inefficiency and the like. He also mentioned that their money was banked. I should like him to inform me who makes the deductions At the for inefficiency, and who supervises that system. member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) has There is, however, a misunderstood me. I did not say that deductions were made from the natives' pay. I said that, under the system that is operating at the present time, a pecuniary penalty is imposed by law for a breach of discipline, disobedience and matters of that description. Breaches of discipline are punishable by fine, which is imposed by the courts. I propose to extend the term of employment to two years, and a pecuniary penalty will no longer be imposed.

Debate resumed (vide page 3635). substance, this measure deals with elections of the Senate. Although the bill consists of only three clauses, it must not be judged by its brevity, because it is exceedingly important. It proposes an alteration of the Constitution. Members of the Opposition have said that it has been ill-conceived in that it does not make provision in respect of several legal difficulties. Supporters of the Government have complete faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister( Mr ensure stable government in this country, Menzies) because they fully recognize his ability as a constitutional lawyer and his eminence in his profession. He has been the father of many important pieces of legislation that now stand on the statute book. Honourable members opposite have described the measure as hurried legislation. They have said that the Government is giving it precedence over other measures that are of greater urgency. I refute that statement. The urgency for the introduction of this measure is apparent from its title. The Government has been obliged to introduce it as the result of the attitude that has been adopted by the Opposition majority in the Senate. The colleagues of honourable members opposite in the Senate have implied that they will force a double dissolution. Therefore, the introduction of this legislation is fully justified. It can be regarded as hurried legislation only in relation to the attitude that the Opposition majority in the Senate has adopted in frustrating legislation for which the Government received a clear mandate at the recent general election. The Constitution makes provision for resolving deadlocks but the need for this measure arises directly out of legislation for which the Chifley Government was responsible, that resulted in an enlarged Parliament and. that applied the system of proportional representation to Senate elections. Let us examine the responsibilities that the Constitution imposes upon the Senate. The Senate was established to safeguard the interests of the public against the possibility that the majority in the lower House might seek to enact vital legislation for which it had not received a mandate from the people. Originally, the Senate was meant to be a house of review and a non-party house. The framers of the Constitution never envisaged that a majority in the Senate would use its numbers to thwart the expressed will of the people. Other legislation that has already been dealt with by the House indicates that troublesome times lie ahead of us. I refer to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill which the Opposition has endorsed in principle. In view of that fact urgent steps must be taken to and if the Senate thwarts legislation of that kind in the circumstances that now exist the people must be given an opportunity to say whether they uphold or disapprove of its action. That is the object of this measure. It merely seeks to give to the people an opportunity to say whether they wish to enable the Government to avoid deadlocks and stalemates. Thus it implements the essential democratic principle of giving to the",90,Papua And New Guinea
289,Mr Pittard (Ballarat) [9.17],"I npeople the opportunity to pass judgment upon matters of such importance. Under this measure the Government is not endeavouring to foist anything upon the people. It merely seeks to give to them the opportunity to accept, or reject, this proposal for an alteration of the Constitution. Such a proposal is not so devastating when we remember that all members of the Labour party have signed a pledge to work for the abolition of the Senate. The Government now seeks to eliminate for all time the possibility of deadlocks and statemates in the Parliament. ment, when it introduced the system of proportional representation for the election of the Senate, did not do so in order to maintain Labour's stranglehold on that chamber following a possible double dissolution, then the Opposition has no ground whatsoever for refusing to support this measure. However, if it was the intention of the Chifley Government to ensure that Labour should have a majority in the Senate in practically any circumstances that might arise in the future, its opposition to the measure is quite understandable. Tbe bill does not involve any interference with the rights of electors. It does not seek to add to, or subtract from, the representation that each State now has in the Senate. The measure relates solely to the method of election of senators following a double dissolution. All honourable members are conversant with the details of that proposal. it is that following a double dissolution tbe ten vacancies in each State shall be filled by the election of five senators in each of two ballots and that the five senators who are elected in one ballot shall hold office for a period of six years and the five who are elected in the other ballot shall hold office for a period of three years. Under those conditions a party may obtain in either ballot a majority of three to two, four to one or five to nil; but the essential point is that one of the parties will obtain a clear majority in each of the ballots. Thus, the possibility of equal representation of the Government and Opposition parties in the Senate will be eliminated. It is highly improbable that a deadlock would result under such a system, whereMr Pittard. as, under the present system of representation in the Senate, it is highly probable that the Government and Opposition parties would be returned with equal representation, in which event the last position of the Parliament would be worse than its first. Every party that has the welfare of the country at heart will welcome this proposal. Habit, and habitalone, brings forth obstruction from those who sit on the other side of the House. It is unfortunate that those who sit opposite to any government should be classed as "" the Opposition"". If the Chifley GovernThe term "" Opposition"" is a very ill chosen one which seems to engender in its members a spirit of antagonism that debars them from co-operating with the Government. If ever there was need for co-operation between the Government and the Opposition, and for a measure such as this to be considered on non-party lines, this is the time. When addressing the HouseI try hard not to use the word "" Opposition"" because we all are here to represent the people of this country. This bill is for the good of all governments. It is for the protection of whichever party is chosen by the people to implement their views. It is not good for Australia if the attempts of this House to place legislation on the statute-book are nullified by the Senate. The sole purpose of this bill is to ask the people whether they desire a change in the system of electing the Senate or whether they seek to perpetuate Briefly, a system under which their elected government may be completely frustrated. At the outset of my remarks I directed attention to the fact that this is a small bill that contains all told only 34 lines, that it is an important bill, and that, because it proposes an alteration of the Constitution, it calls not for' heated discussion but for solemn consideration. It is a bill the passage of which is of as much import to those who sit on the other side of the House as it is to those who sit on the Government benches. I appeal to all members of this Parliament to support it so that the government of the country may be carried on smoothly and effectively, recognizing that these are troublesome times and that we have a trust to ensure that the progress of this country shall continue unhampered and that our lives and livelihood shall be protected. We cannot honour our trust if the legislation brought into the Parliament is frustrated. I commend the bill to all honourable members. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [9.33] -The title of the measure before the House is, "" A bill for an act to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Senate "". The purpose of the bill, as has been explained by the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Pittard) in what appealed to me as a very eloquent and sincere speech, is to avoid deadlocks after a double dissolution. Tbe honourable member explained the means by which the Government proposes to achieve that end. It is proposed that in the event of a double dissolution ten senators from each .State shall he elected in two groups of five, one group of five to sit for three years and the other group of five to sit for six years, the principle being that in a group of five one side of politics would win three seats and the other side would win two seats. In each State one party would have six senators and the other four senators. The Government claims that that would avoid the disadvantages of a deadlock in the event of a double dissolution under the existing system of proportional representation when the probability would be that each of the opposing parties would win 30 seats. On the face of it, the Government's proposition appears to be reasonable. Honourable members on this side of the House are just as concerned as are honourable members opposite about the possibility of our parliamentary institutions becoming unworkable. The objections that we raise to the bill are that it is too narrowly confined. We cannot avoid the conclusion that the Government is thinking of itself-that it was introduced to enable the Government to gain a party political advantage and that the problem is not being tackled from ii national standpoint. In order to develop that argument, may I say at the outset that honourable members on both sides of the House are vitally concerned with the subject of constitutional reform. We all agree that our Constitution is an antiquated and old fashioned piece of machinery and that it is very ill equipped to enable the Parliament to deal with the complex and diverse problems that face us in these modern days. It is well to recall that our Constitution was drawn up in the nineteenth century. It was hammered into shape by its framers after the holding of several conventions. Its main inspiration was the Constitution of the United States of America which, in turn, had been drawn up more than 100 years earlier, in the eighteenth century. Consequently, its provisions are most inadequate to deal with the problems that face our community to-day. Since it was first crafted events of the greatest importance to this country have occurred. We have taken part in two world wars and have suffered from a great economic depression. The nature of our society has changed. We have become a highly industrialized community. Unfortunately, we have also become a highly urbanized community with the largest proportion of our population concentrated in a few great capital cities. We have had to face difficult problems of employment and unemployment. We have had to surmount problems arising from large-scale industry and commerce with their attendant problems of production and distribution. We have problems concerning industrial relations and the task of maintaining peace and harmony in industry. In order to enable us to deal with those problems our Constitution must be brought up' to date. I do not blame the Government for not having tackled in this measure the general question of constitutional reform-that would require a lot of preliminary work and consideration-bu t I do criticize it for not having widened the confines of this legislation as far as the Senate is concerned. The Government has confined the measure to the narrow point of attempting to minimize the undesirable results that might follow a double dissolution. It has not considered in whole the position of the Senate in our constitutional framework. That is why we suggest that the Government has introduced the bill solely to gain a party political advantage for itself, and that it should look at the matter from a national viewpoint. What part is the Senate to play in the life of our community? Has the Senate failed to live up to the part intended for it by the framers of the Constitution? What are the weaknesses and inadequacies of the Senate as it exists to-day? These questions are pertinent and should be fully considered, and the answers to them involve tackling the whole constitutional position as it relates moneys, or imposing' taxation, shall not to the Senate. It is worthwhile recalling that the fathers of our Constitution had three models to which they could look for guidance, the American Constitution, the Constitution of Canada and the Constitution of Switzerland, all of which were Federal Constitutions. certain amount of inspiration from each of them. From the Constitution of Switzerland, for example, was adopted the referendum as a method for the alteration of the Constitution; but it was from the Constitution of the United States of America that were derived the expressions "" House of Representatives "" and "" Senate"" and the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States, the enumerated powers being given to the Commonwealth and the residuary powers remaining with the States. In many instances the actual scope of the powers granted to the Commonwealth bore very close resemblance to those contained in the Constitution of the United States of America. However-and this is the crux of the matter relating to the Senate -we did not adopt the American presidential system with the having no responsibility to Parliament. We followed the Canadian model, which was based on the British, model, and we adopted the system of responsible government by the Executive, which is responsible to the Parliament. House of Representatives is the body which makes or unmakes governments. The defeats which the present Government has suffered in the Senate have not caused it to resign, but its defeat in this House would cause it to do so. From the outset the Senate was given an inferior role. In that sense the framers of our Constitution departed from the American model which gave to the American Senate a voice in the formulation of foreign affairs policy and in Mr W. M. Hourkc. important appointments, all of which conferred on it pi'estige, dignity and importance. By the provisions of section 53 of our Constitution the Senate was deliberately placed in a subordinate position by comparison with the House of Representatives. Section 53 provides as follows:Proposed laws appropriating revenuo or originate in the Senate. . . The Senate may not amend proposed law* imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any .proposed charge or They drew a burden on the people. Except aa provided in this section, tin: Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. Because of its inferior position the Senate has not been able, to live up to the part that the fathers of the Constitution intended it to play. The Senate was intended to be a States Hou.:e. As a matter of fact, it was proposed that it should be called ""The CtatesH o i r e "" ; but the American title of "" The Senate"" was preferred. In the Senate each of the States, irrespective of its size and population, was granted equal representation. Tasmania, with its comparatively small population has the same representation as has Now South Wales. It was intended that -uch means should make the Senate a Spates House and the protector of the Executive inbrests of the States. We oil know that the Senate divides on par'y lines just as does this House, that it hah turned out to be merely a replica of this House and that it is not serving any really useful purpose because it has failed to live The up to its role of the protector of the States. Because it was placed in that inferior position by the Constitution it has not been given any of the extra functions that have been given to the American Senate and have raised that body to a position of such great importance. It is interesting to note that, in the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution that was held in 1929, Mr Ashworth, one of the commissioners, made a dissenting report in which he summed up the position in relation to the Senate in those days. I consider that what he said then is equally applicable to-day. I quote from Mr Ashworth's report as follows:Of the major parts of tlie Commonwealth constitutional machinery, the Senate or upper chamber of the Federal legislature is clearly the most defective. The Senate has failed in the aims for which it was designed. Its mission was the safeguarding of State rights against any attempt at Federal encroachment. It was fashioned on the model of the second chamber of the United States. But in the process of imitation and adaptation it was emasculated, for the control of foreign policy and appointments to high place-function s that lend a peculiar authority and dignity to the American prototype were stripped from the Australian body. . . . It is not a house of revision: it discharges no function that is not better undertaken, by the House of Representatives; it lacks the sense of responsibility which comes from the knowledge that the fate of the Government depends upon its decision. Obviously, therefore, this unnecessary member should be forthwith lopped off in the general good, or, in the alternative, a new purpose should be infused into its "" veins "". In approving that general statement. I make no reflection upon the quality of the senators in this Parliament. From the little that I have seen of the .Senate since I have heen here I know that we have in that chamber men of wide experience, men of great capacity, and men of extensive knowledge. I am merely commenting upon the system and the institution. The first question that comes to my mind is : Why did the Government, in considering this bill, not consider also a proposal for the abolition of the Senate? that the Opposition would support such a proposal. MrW . M . BOURKE reason. good reason for not seeking to abolish the Senate, as a means of getting out of its present difficulties, on the ground that that chamber serves no useful purpose in our reason is that the abolition of the Senate would set a most unfortunate precedent that would rebound on the parliamentary systems of four of the States. A f t e r all, although the Senate may not serve any great purpose, it is elected on a democratic franchise, whereas the corollary chambers in the four States, the State Legislative Councils, are elected upon an undemocratic and privileged franchise. In Victoria, for example, one-third of the electors have the right to vote to elect members to the Victorian Legislative Council. It does not appear likely, therefore, that this Government w ill sponsor a proposal that the Senate be abolished, because the abolition of the Senate would set a precedent that would not be welcomed by the Government's supporters in the States. If the Government w ill not face up to that proposition, then why, when it was introducing a bill to deal with the Senate, did it not also seek to do something about the system for the filling of casual vacancies in the Senate? That matter is provided for in section 15 of the Australian Constitution, which states in partIf the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of service, the Houses of Parliament of the State from which he was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the election of a successor. . . . That, of course, is a most, undemocratic procedure which departs from the basis on which a general election to the Senate rests, whereby the electors themselves elect the senators. In the case of casual vacancies the two houses of the Parliament of the Statei n which the vacancy has occurred, including the undemocratic Legislative Council, in the election of which the majority of the people have no vote, elect a senator to fill the casual vacancy and in that way can thwart the w ill of the electors. We had an example did not think of the w ill of the electors being thwarted following the death of Senator Keane, a Labour senator who died while he was in T h a t is not the office. The Houses of the Parliament of The Government has a very Victoria held a joint sitting and elected Senator Fraser to f ill the vacancy caused by Senator Keane's death. Senator Fraser was a supporter of the anti-Labour parties and the method of his constitutional framework. That election to the Senate was a most unjust and undemocratic one. If the Government regarded this whole matter from the broad view of national interest, and not fro m the narrow view of party political advantage, it would seek the adoption of a provision whereby casual vacancies in the Senate would be filled in a democratic manner. If the Government is sincere in its proposals, and regards the",91,Second Reading
290,Mr Hamilton,"W ewhole matter from the standpoint of national interest, why does it bother about effective way to resolve deadlocks would preserving the cumbersome and objectionable constitutional provision for double dissolutions? I regard that provision as being hopelessly inadequate and outdated. There are much better methods of resolving difficulties that arise between the two Houses, if we intend to keep two Houses, than this method of double dissolution which causes a lot of trouble and expense to the country. member suggest one? Mr W. M . BOURKE -Yes, I can certainly suggest one. I refer the honourable gentleman to the Parliament Act of Great Britain which caused such a furore when it was passed in 1911. That act was amended last year under the Attlee Government. The Parliament Act, as amended, regulates the relationships between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Commons can pass any legislation that it wishes to pass and the House of Lords has no power to reject it but can merely delay if for a maximum period of twelve months. The procedure is that when the House of Commons passes a bill it goes to the House of Lords. If the Lords reject it the Commons can pass it a second time. If the Lords still refuse to pass it, it automatically becomes law at the expiration of twelve months. appears to me to be a much simpler and more effective method of dealing with disputes between the two Houses than is this horribly compossible that at the succeeding general plicated method of double dissolution. I suggest again that the Government might well consider adopting the method employed in the British Parliament, and ask the people to approve of a provision that if the Senate refuses to pass legisthat had been brought about by a double lation that has been passed by this House, it shall automatically become law after a specified period has elapsed. There is another method by which a deadlock could be overcome in a much less cumbersome manner than by the method of double dissolution. We could evolve more effective machinery for joint sittings of the two Houses so that in the event of a dispute compulsory joint sittings would take place and the deadlock would be resolved. For my own part, I consider that the most be by the method employed in Britain under the Parliament Act. We can raise other objections to this legislation but I do not propose to go into technical details except in relation to one point. The honourable member for Ballarat said that this bill is intended to minimize the possibility of a deadlock resulting from a general election held after a double dissolution. He admitted that this method honourable will not avoid the possibility of a deadlock. If this bill becomes law the probability that the ten senators elected in each State will be returned on the basis of six for one party and four for the other party. It would be possible for six Labour party senators and four Liberal party senators to be elected in three States and for the position in each of the other three State9 to be the exact reverse-si x Liberal party senators and four Labour party senators. probable. Mr W. M . BOURKE -It is by no means highly improbable. In the event that I have mentioned a deadlock would occur just as if this legislation had not been passed. There is also the possibility that if this legislation is passed, and an election is held after a double dissolution, one of the parties will win six That seats in each of the States and so come back with 36 senators. The other party, having won four seats in each State, would come back with 24 senators. It is quite election, three years later, a deadlock will occur again. In such a case the effect of this bill will be merely to postpone the deadlock for three years because in the election following a general election dissolution, one-half of the 36 senators representing one side would retire and and one-half of the 24 representing the other side also would retire. One side would have eighteen retiring candidates and the other side would have twelve retiring candidates standing for election. If there were a swing away from the party that went to the polls with eighteen retiring candidates, and instead of winning three seats in each State it won",95,Second Reading
291,Mr Osborne,Oan the,96,Second Reading
292,Mr Tubnbuxl,"That is highly imonly two, the position would be reversed and the party that went to the polls with twelve retiring candidates would come back with eighteen senators. Each side would then have 30 senators, which would mean a deadlock, and exactly the same position would then apply at the election three years after a double dissolution as if this . bill had not been passed. Does that not make it clear that the Government, in bringing forward this legislation, is not taking a long-range view? It is not looking to the future, but is merely considering a short-term political expediency that will suit its own political interest. If the Government were concerned with dealing with the matter on a long-range basis it would realize that this bill does not go very far, but that it merely makesperhaps-the possibility of a deadlock a little less likely. But deadlocks could still occur in the two ways that I have mentioned. Eor that reason the bill will uot achieve any long-range benefit. 1 consider therefore that the Opposition is justified in refusing to support the measure on the ground that it does not deal with the whole problem of the functions of tbe Senate but merely makes provision for resolving a deadlock and even in that respect does not deal with ihe problem in an effective manner. The bill also does not seek to provide for any more acceptable or better methods of resolving a deadlock, or of filling casual vacancies. Eor fhese reasons the Opposition is justified in holding that it would be much better in the interests of the nation for the Government to withdraw this bill and give the matter further consideration. For instance, more could be achieved if an all-party committee were established, not t,o deal generally with constitutional reform, but to consider the constitutional position of the Senate, with a view to evolving the best method of dealing with deadlocks, which, I fear, are likely to become very common in the future as a result of the system of proportional representation that is used for Senate general elections. I cannot avoid the conclusion that this bill is' a part of a game that the Government is playing to as to prepare the way for the double dissolution that it has been talking about for so long. [122] In conclusion, I . direct the attention of honourable members opposite to the fate of a previous government that forced a double dissolution. That double dissolution occurred in 1914 when the conservative forces in this country had a majority of one in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, however, the Labour party had a majority of 22 to fourteen. The Right Honourable Joseph Cook was Prime Minister, and he was determined to force a double dissolution. He did ""not select a legitimate issue upon which to do so. He introduced a bill with the deliberate intention of forcing the Labour Opposition in the Senate to reject it so that he would be able to go to the country after a double dissolution. That was a bill to prohibit preference to trade unionists in the employment of the Commonwealth, which the Government knew that the Labour majority in the -Senate would reject on principle. That Labour majority duly rejected the bill on two occasions and, upon the advice of his Ministers, the Governor General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, granted a double dissolution. It is very interesting to recall that at the general election which followed the double dissolution the Government that had forced it received the just retribution that it deserved at the hands of the electors. That election took place in the dark days just prior to the outbreak of the 1914-1S war. Andrew Fisher, the Labour leader, during the election campaign that followed the double dissolution, made his historic statement that if war broke out Australia would stand by the Mother Country and help to defend it to the last man and the last shilling. The Government that had forced the double dissolution was defeated, Labour winning 31 of the 36 seats in the Senate and a workable majority in the House of Representatives. Andrew Fisher then became Prime Minister. I point that ""out to those honourable members opposite who may be considering that this bill is just the first step towards a double dissolution. If it is passed and the Government proceeds with its proposals for a double dissolution, history will repeat itself and the Liberal and Australian Country parties will be defeated at the polls as the retiring government was in 1914. Last night the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) said that this was an intimidatoi'y measure which had been designed by the Government in order to force the members of another place to discontinue their delaying tactics in relation to legislation. To-night, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr House are such fools that, having been W. M . Bourke) adopted a somewhat intimidatory attitude. He tried to upset new members of the Government parties by saying that this legislation might have the same effect as other legislation had had on the Cook Government in 1914. I do not think that the honourable member's remarks will have much effect on honourable members on tbe Government side who were elected by tbe people to do a certain job. If , in attempting to do that job, they are frustrated by the objectionable majority in another place, the Government must take measures to protect itself and must carry out the duties that were assigned to it by the people at the last general election. The honourable member also said that this bill would not reduce the likelihood of deadlocks. I disagree with him. It is most unlikely, in practice, that a deadlock will result from this legislation. He suggested that the Government should have considered abolishing the Senate. That remark calls for very little reply. The Government parties do not believe in the abolition of the Senate but the party to which the honourable member is attached has pledged itself to abolish the Senate and two years ago had the opportunity to do so but by a cunningly planned trick evaded its obligation and brought about the state of affairs that exists to-day. The honourable member said that the Government should consider the whole position of the Senate in relation to the parliamentary system. He knows that that would take a considerable time to do. The Government has not time on its side at the moment and if honourable members of the Opposition in another place adopt obstructive tactics it must honour its obligations to the people and safeguard their interests by bringing down legislation that will give effect to their wishes. Honourable members of the Opposition say that the Government is talking this action in order to gain a political advantage. not do that, surely! it. Do our opponents consider that honourable members on this side of the returned to this House, they will allow honourable members of the Opposition to take charge of the business of the Parliament? Of course not. Honourable members on this side of the House intend to stand up to their obligations and do the job that they were elected to do. Honourable members of the Opposition have said a lot about New South Wales. I thought, for a while, that honourable members were engaged in the New South Wales general election campaign. During the course of their remarks a lot has been said about the non-Labour parties that introduced the present system for election to the upper house and about what they described as the snide tricks of the clever gentlemen who had been responsible for it. Unfortunately those gentlemen were not clever enough to prevent the Labour party from controlling the upper house in New South Wales since 1941. The fact that that happened blows the Opposition's argument to pieces. This afternoon the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) said that this bill had been rushed into the Parliament without having been considered by members who support the Government. I was sitting at the table with the Minister for the remark was passed and I said that we had seen the bill. The Leader of the Opposition, thinking that my colleague had made that interjection, replied that Ministers might have seen it. Honourable members who support the Government discussed the bill before it was introduced in this House. Government supporters who occupy back benches ? bers who occupy the back benches did so, too. All the supporters of the Government did so. They are not like the members of the Labour party. I well remember that when the Banking",96,Second Reading

However, in view of what the Leader of the Opposition has said, every honourable member of the Opposition must carry his portion of blame until the onus of proof is removed. This measure has been introduced to cope with a peculiar set of circumstances. It has been designed to give the people of Australia the opportunity, per medium of the ballot-box, of ensuring that their wishes shall be put into effect. Under section 13 of the Constitution it would be practically impossible to avoid a further deadlock if there should be another election in circumstances similar to those under which the last general election was held. Section 13 provides that the senators themselves shall decide which senators shall sit for six years and which senators shall sit for three years. Honourable members of the Opposition have claimed that this measure will deprive tlie people of the right to say who shall be elected or for how long, but the people have never had that right in the event of a double dissolution because the first part of section 13 of the Constitution is obsolete; it was effective only immediately after the establishment of federation and the election of the first, Senate. This measure will enable the electors to have some voice as to who shall represent them for six years and who shall represent them for three years. On one side of federal politics in this country there will not be a democratic understanding nor an endeavour to allow the electors to have that voice, but on the side of politics that I support the people, through their various organizations, will have some voice as to the candidates who will be put forward. If there were a double dissolution under the provisions of the Constitution and a general election under the present Electoral Act, the chances are 100 to 1 that the parties would be returned I did not refer to to this House at their present strengths and the Parliament would not be able to carry on. A solution of the problem has to be found and the Government has introduced this very simple measure in that spirit. Honourable members of the Opposition have said that the Government should overhaul the whole Constitution. They know that that would not be possible in the time at its disposal. referred only to those provisions that relate to the Senate. needed to deal with those provisions. The",98,Second Reading

This measure complies with the provisions of the Constitution and the Government intends to give the people the opportunity of saying yea or nay to it before it comes into effect. Honourable members of the Opposition know very well that the present position is of tlieir making. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr sort of thing was boasted about in Wentworth) pointed that out when he made his opening speech in this Parliament. that it was necessary to enlarge the lower house of this Parliament. was stated in the press, broadcast over the air, mentioned in public places and debated in study and discussion groups. It fell to the lot of a Labour government to enlarge the Parliament. Then what happened? There were 45 members of the Government party in this House. In the Senate there were 33 Government supporters and three Opposition supporters. When a meeting was held to decide how the Parliament was to be enlarged, the then Government, for the sake of preserving the places of its supporters in the Senate,decided to act constitutionally. time threw its sacred pledges to the wind, ft cast away a most important plank of its platform,' the abolition of the Senate. were not prepared at that time to ask the people by way of referenMr Hamilton. dura to so alter the Constitution that the numerical ratio between the number of senators and the number of members of the House of Representatives should be altered. Yet to-day the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Eraser) said that any referendum of the failure. We were not asked to support a referendum on the matter, and I think that I should be correct in saying that had the proposition been placed before I do honourable members on this side who then composed the Opposition, they would have supported a referendum of the people to obtain their approval of an alteration of the ratio of membership of the two houses of the Parliament so that the lower house could be enlarged without increasing the number of senators. The then Government realized that if it went to the people senators would run a grave risk of being defeated. It then had the bright idea, of incorporating, in separate legislation, the system of proportional representation. All that certain candidates for the Senate then required in order to be in this Parliament for life was the endorsement of their party. That the precincts of this House. It was said that so long as candidates could get It was realized before 1948 first, second or third position in either party, they would be here until 1962 or That later. That was the deliberate plan adopted by the then Government. But that is not the whole story by any means. The Government knew that only eighteen of its 33 supporters in the Senate at that time had to face the people, and that, under a system of proportional representation, with seven senators to be elected from each State, unless a landslide occurred in favour of the then Opposition, at least three of those retiring senators would be returned from each State.

The council has not yet put forward nny final recommendations, but has suggested that exploratory talks should take place with universities and professional organizations as a first step.
