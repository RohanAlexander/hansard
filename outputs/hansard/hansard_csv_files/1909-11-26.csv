The remark applies more strongly if, as is suggested, the authority of a State Government is behind them. Our relations with the Governments of the States are fairly, though not. completely, defined by the Constitution, and I hesitate to enter upon a consideration of the particular point at which any action would involve action on our part. HadI a well-considered opinion on this subject, I would not care to express it now, because to do so would not at all help matters. Only action on the part of the Commonwealth can be of value in this grave contingency. I am extremely sorry that the dispute is intensified, and that the. hopes of the last few days are apparently dwindling. As the Attorney-General said yesterday, the Government is watching every incident which can be officially verified, and, at the first opportunity when the Constitution permits our intervention for the purpose of arbitration and settlement, we shall be prepared to take action. by day with a view to securing a settlement. member's statement. When the time comes, the Government will be ready. In the meanwhile, we shall arouse less feeling, if , like the Judge of a Court, we preserve a strictly judicial attitude, reserving our opinions until some questions in dispute are officially before us. ther the action of the Railways Commissioners is not in distinct violation of the Constitution, inasmuch as it tends to the rehas the Prime straint of trade, and discriminates between individuals. which I would venture to answer off-hand, or without prolonged consultation with the Attorney-General and the Cabinet. The honourable member's view is that the action of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales is a breach of the Constitution, because in restraint of trade. Assuming, for the purposes of the argument, that it is so, nothing would be gained by my saying it. The expression of an individual opinion would carry no weight. It may be, that, within a few hours or days, the Government will require to adopt a judicial attitude in this matter, and it will then be better if we have not personally expressed even mature opinions upon the points at issue. of mines, being started to permit of the coal miners who are on strike at Newcastle, and in other districts, obtaining employment. If a sufficient number of mines are opened, the strike will end, and the general public will be supplied with coal. Has the Prime Minister considered whether it is not a direct restraint of trade for any authority, either of the Commonwealth or the State/ to prevent the employment of persons who desire to go to work, and have made legal arrangements for their employment in the production of coal ? states the case very broadly. I do not know that the Commonwealth would have jurisdiction, for instance, were the restraint of trade only in the immediate neighbourhood of the mines. I could imagine a case of another complexion, in which another set of circumstances might arise, when redress would be through Federal Courts.

On the receipt of a claim it is the duty of an Electoral Registrar to at once enter on the roll the name of the claimant if satisfied that he is entitled to enrolment, or, if not satisfied that he is entitled to enrolment, to transmit the claim to the Divisional Returning Officer with such observations relating to it as he thinks proper. If the Divisional Returning Officer decides not to enrol the claimant he is required to notify him of the fact, and if the claimant is not satisfied with the decision of the Divisional Returning Officer he may then appeal to a Court of summary jurisdiction. This procedure appears to meet all reasonable requirements. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. MR. ANGUS NICHOLSON-SUPPLY CF With reference to old-age pensioner, Mrs. bournei .

30,Sir John Quick,"I am informedter, upon noticeIn view of the letter in the Herald, wherein the President of the Master Tanners and Leather Manufacturers' Association states :"" I would like the people of Australia to know, through your medium, that the Victorian Master Tanners' Association is wide awake to the undeniable fact that the tanning industry, and the welfare of those of our people who are dependent upon it, is being quickly and surely undermined by the foreigner, who has found that, with cheaper labour and longer hours our hides can be profitably purchased at a price that leaves no margin for the Australian tanner. Unfortunately this is not a case that, left alone, would cure itself, but one that demands immediate action on the part of Parliament if the industry is to be kept alive. My association has, with others in the neighbouring States, petitioned the Minister to take into consideration the facts, and send us speedy relief. I also understand the Trades Hall have made a similar request, entirely independent of our action ""1. Will the Government, if necessary, introduce a short measure to give effect to the wish of the Master Tanners and Leather Manufacturers' Association and of the Trades Hall? 2. If not, in view of our hides when exported being adulterated with barium, sugar, sodium, and magnesium, will he undertake, on behalf of the Government, during the next session of Parliament, to take the necessary steps to bring about an export duty on hides, and so enable Australian leather to hold its own as honest leather against the outer world? and Customs informs me that a very special set of problems is involved in the imposition of any export duty, and that they need to be handled with extreme caution. He has taken a special note of this matter, and will deal vvith it in connection with other Tariff questions that he has now in hand. member for Robertson asked what was the effect of a Papuan ordinance relating to the local Tariff. I promised that if he would repeat the question to-day I would be prepared with the necessary information. The effect of the ordinance is to increase the duties as follows :Former Duty. s. d.

I do not know where he obtained his information. Last year reports by surveyors of the Railway Department were placed before the Victorian Railways Standing Committee, recommending the route going through Orbost, and thence following the Little River, crossing the watershed of the Cann, and reaching the border near Bondi. The line would be 142 miles in length, and its estimated cost was £5,150 per mile. That estimate shows that the country to be traversed is not very difficult. Another route was suggested, the highest elevation on which was only 1,600 feet, and it was said that it would permit of a broad-gauge line, with fairly steep grades and round curves. That which the surveyors recommended, however, is the easier one. speed of travelling over such a line? way trains in Victoria. that point, but the route is easier than that through Murrungowar. Another proposal was made for a direct route passing through Buchan, by which a saving of 30 miles would be effected, but the Railways Standing Committee would not take any evidence with regard to that route, holding that they were concerned with the question not of what would be the shortest and best route to Dalgety, but of what would be Increase, the best route for a railway to Orbost. s. d.

Honourable members all agree that the supply from the Snowy River is unlimited, whereas ""it is limited at Yass-Canberra, and must be supplemented by the construction of expensive works. Had the selection of Dalgety' been confirmed, the Snowy River would have been our own property, and'it is admitted that that is the best river in Australia for the generation of electrical power. The only f-means by which we can be placed in the same position, in regard to water supply, that we would have been in had we selected Dalgety, is to give the Commonwealth -priority of rights Over the Snowy River; and this might make the selection of the Canberra site more tolerable. 1 In one of field, Resident Engineer of the Department -of Public Works of New South Wales, he contrasted the supply at Queanbeyan with rthat at Buckley's Crossing, and I presume 0 he had made reasonable investigation. Mr Bloomfield statesBuckley's Crossing is decidedly the best. The supply is unlimited, the distance the water will have to be brought is small, and provision could easily be made for generating electricity at the place where the water supply would be taken off, as the f a l l in the river is very rapid. In a further report, published in Mr Oliver's contribution, Mr Bloomfield made a similar statement. short distance from Canberra to the Snowy supposed that we should select a site close to the water supply.

Mr Wade, Chief Engineer of New South We know that under the Barren Wales, in his report in 1906, stated that, under the Barren Jack scheme, there would be available only something like 5,000 horse-power The present Treasurer, who For water power the Cotter and Gudgenby Rivers are almost worthless for this purpose, and, compared with the Snowy River, may be dismissed as incomparable and not worth considering.

That, no doubt, gives sufficient rights to the Commonwealth, and confers power on it to erect works on the Snowy River and convey electricity to the Territory, but there is no priority of right provided for. As power will probably not be required from the Snowy River for the Capital for the next fifty years, the State may in the meantime step in and erect works on the river, which will give it priority of right over the Commonwealth. To show the necessity of placing the matter altogether beyond doubt, let me quote clause 2 of the agreement, which deals in a very different fashion .with the area reserved by the State for the use of the Commonwealth for water supply purposes.

The honourable member's attitude is, "" Dalgety is the best site, ancl if I had an opportunity I should vote for it, but I will not give the people of Australia an opportunity of the doing so."" When he faces his electors in March next, he will be able to tell them that although Dalgety is the best site, it has not been chosen, and that the site which has been chosen cannot furnish a water supply sufficient for the great centre of population which the Attorney-General predicts will be established at the seat of Government. The honourable member has stated that, in his opinion, Dalgety should have been chosen, but that, as a majority is now in favour of another site, he will follow it.

I am therefore at a loss to understand why he opened up the question to-day. However, I shall support his proposal, with a view to obtaining a better water supply for this waterless area. In reply to the Minister of Home Affairs, I desire to read a report appearing in the Age last week, wherein the Premier of New South Wales, referring in the Legislative Assembly to the Capital Site Surrender Billexplained that he proposed to take the second reading of the measure to endorse the principle, but not to go beyond that stage until it was-",20,Pairs

If the House of Representatives, -in for the Commonwealth paramount rights its wisdom, thought the schedule should be modified it could be referred back^ to the State, and be dealt with before it had passed through Committee. If the House of Representatives decided to pass the Bill and endorse the agreement without alteration then the course of the States was perfectly simple. He evidently anticipates that this Parliament may alter the agreement, and has therefore nol yet submitted it to the Parliament of his State. negotiations in regard to this matter between the Commonwealth and the State. express our opinions on the subject. .

That was an endorsement of the original decisioii regarding Yass-Canberra. The passing of the motion for the second reading of this Bill was the re-affirma tion of previous decisions. Having agreed to the second reading, it is our duty now to consider the details of the agreement with New Soutli Wales.' If any honourable member thinks that any clause of the agreement should be altered., he may propose an amendment of it, and should his views not be met in regard to what he considers a matter of vital consequence, he will, be at liberty to vote against the third taining water from the Snowy River, in reading. The report read by the Minister of Home Affairs estimated that a horsepower of 7,000 could be obtained within the territory, and, in addition, a horse-power of 5,000 from the Barren Jack scheme; but a total horse-power of 12,000 would not be sufficient to run the suburban railways of Victoria by means of electricity, so that clearly we need a still greater water supply. to run the suburban railways of Victoria by means of electricity supplied by the water power in the Federal territory. Federal Capital will not remain a small village, but will develop into a large city. While I do not complain of the deficiency of the water supply for domestic purposes, I think it the duty of Parliament to secure oyer a supply from the Snowy River which will give an unlimited electrical service, so that in choosing Yass-Canberra we shall not be in a worse position regarding water supply than had we kept to Dalgety. surprised that the honourable member for Wimmera has not accepted the statement of the honourable member for Gippsland that the second reading of the Bill introduced' by the Fisher Government was not passed' unanimously.

The amendment, I contend, is beyond the scope of the Bili. that the amendment would not be in order, but I had not then carefully examined this clause. Honourable members will observe that it provides that certain laws shall be continued, and that it is quite possible for the Committee to agree to take over the territory with certain modifications or additions. Having regard to the scope of the clause, I cannot refuse to accept the amendment. Mr J. H . CATTS I regret that the honourable member for Werriwa should have seen fit to interrupt me with a point of order which he must have known would not be upheld. The k'Tiendment proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland provides that a licence for the manufacture or sale of intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall not be issued in respect of the territory except upon a direct vote of a majority of the people resident therein, but it does not enable the initiative to be taken by the people. It was for that reason that I asked the honourable member to consent to the addition of the words '' initiated by petition in such manner as may be prescribed."" The honourable member has consented to that addition, and the amendment so amended will enable the Government to prescribe regulations permitting the people to take what action they think fit. It has been said that this condition would have to be accepted by the Parliament of New South Wales. That is not so. It is not for the State Parliament to determine what laws shall operate in the territory after we have taken it over. Although it has gone to certain lengths in interfering with Federal matters, I do not think it would be prepared to go so far as to say what laws should operate in the territory once it is taken over by the Commonwealth. This is a reasonable amendment. It simply declares that the manufacture and sale of spirituous liquors shall not be forced upon the residents of the territorv against their will. ber close the hotels now existing there? Mr J. H . CATTS -Would the honourable member do so? ask only to ascertain whether the honourable member would grant compensation. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member is putting these catch questions to me, although he himself is opposed to hotels being allowed to remain open in the territory, and is opposed to compensation. Mr J. H . CATTS I know'what his views are in this respect, and he knows what mine are. There is nothing in this amendment that can be objectionable either to those who desire or to those who object to the manufacture or supply of intoxicating liquor within the territory. option. Mr J. H . CATTS -Quite so. There is in the States. a growing consensus of opinion against the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors. That being so, this Parliament will be compelled to legislate on the question, and I think that we ought to take time by the forelock by making provision for the settlement of this vexed question from the very beginning. The manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors should not be imposed on the people against their will, and they should have the power, on petition, to initiate a referendum, and give expression to their views. [12.0] -Lik e the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, this measure has been pared down to only that which is necessary to the surrender of the site. There is no clause providing for what I may call specific Commonwealth legislation for the management of the area, the existing laws being reserved until we shall have made the necessary provision.

CATTS -An alteration in the wording of the amendment would put that right. pointing out that the amendment, as submitted, will be utterly inoperative. However, the main objection I have is that we are not now, as in the case of Papua, providing a complete Constitution, and that, if we accept this amendment, there is no machinery by which it can be brought ii.to operation. If the amendment is anything, it is simply a bann on the issue of licences another place,, and will, probably, not be by the State. Under the State' laws, local option is in operation in the territory at the present time; and, if we accept this amendment, we shall find ourselves absolutely without any machinery by which we could register the will of the inhabitants. The very object aimed at may be defeated, owing to the fact that, by this amendment, we wipe out the law of the State. Mr J. H .

CATTS -Unde r the State there must be«a three-fifths majority. law is not as complete as it might be, and that I am in favour of an absolute majority The Bill first comes into prevailing. If , at the proper time, the honourable member for Cook will move an amendment in favour of the change I have indicated I shall support him, or, if he Mr J. H . CATTS -In ten years' time, after all the damage has been done! would be absurd from anybody but the honourable member for Cook. Does he think for one moment that we shall allow ten years to elapse without passing any Act for the government of the territory ? The amendment is premature, and is proposed in the wrong Bill. Moreover, if the amendment be carried, it will prejudice and endanger the measure, and I believe that that is one of 'the principal reasons of the honourable member for Gippsland in submitting it. I point out that if this amendment be made, the Bill will have to be sent back to passed this session. There is one point that seems to have been overlooked. It must be presumed that there are some hotels at the present time within the selected area, and that the licensees possess certain rights conferred on them by State law. If we pass this amendment, we shall immediately deprive those people of rights for which some of them may have paid considerable sums of money. That, it seems to me, would be grossly unjust ; and, for this reason alone, we ought to reject the amendment. No reason has been given why Parliament should destroy existing rights, created under State law, without some provision for compensation. As I interjected when the Attorney-General was speaking, the amendment appears to me to limit the powers conferred by subclause 2 of clause 6, by which the existing authority is continued in the Governor General, or whoever may represent the Commonwealth.

If the amendment is carried, some honourable member may be tempted to make the provision more ridiculous by moving that all public-houses -shall be closed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. because he does not use intoxicating liquor, thinks that no one else should be permitted. to do so. He has no moral right to dictate to others what they shall eat or drink. dictate to the people of the territory what they shall drink. by his continued interjections, has shown his intention to vote for this amendment, and for even a more extreme proposal. I do not think for a moment that the honourable member for Gippsland has submitted the amendment with a view of imperilling the passage of the Bill. of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. able member for Maribyrnong is unknown to me, but I feel sure that there is no desire on the part of the honourable member for Gippsland to destroy the Bill or delay the settlement of the question. I hope the amendment will be rejected. surprised to hear the honourable member for -Nepean say that the acceptance of an amendment of this sort will mean the rejecmits that the hotels cannot be closed for a tion of the Bill. merely that the Bill would have to be returned to the Senate. be the idea, however, if we may judge from the cheers of the Minister of Defence and the Government Whip. It is to the credit of the Minister of Defence, however, that the Bill has reached its present stage. This Bill has been sent to us from another place, and evidently we are to accept it holus-bolus-to make this Chamber merely a registering body of the decisions of another place. are told that if the slightest amendment is made in the Bill, ancl it has to go back to another place, it will be lost, because there in spite of ""the fear that another place may will be no time to deal with it. That is not a fair position to put us in. If the Minister says that no amendment, however better decide that this discussion should not continue? I want to point out to the Attorney-General a necessary amendment. The Bill now provides for two proclamations. ' words. rible danger, that if a few extra words are put into the Bill, the Senate, according to the honourable member for Nepean, will not have time to consider it ! Apparently we cannot even meet an obvious technical difficulty.. Clause2 necessitates one proclamation ratifying and confirming the agreement, ancl clause 5 another accepting the territory, while clause 6 refers us to the proclamation day, without stating whether it is the proclamation under clause 2 or clause 5. It has remained for the Attorney General in the course of the debate to discover that two proclamations are necessary. put in deliberately. There must be two distinct proclamations, because the State has not passed its Act. sary to specify in clause 6 which proclamation day is meant. Another argument of the honourable member for Coolgardie is that the amendment will mean immediate prohibition, and he does not want the hotels to be closed.

VVe might wish to choose another part of New South Wales, where the' awful injustice pointed out by the honourable memtier for Coolgardie of being able to close hotels without compensation might be avoided. The amendment as amended gives the Government power by regulation to put into force the machinery about which the honourable member for Nepean is so anxious. The honourable member for Nepean and the honourable member for Werriwa will have something to answer for if they refuse to vote for an amendment which would insure the Federal territory being a temperiince district, and give its inhabitants the right to decide whether it should contain any hotels. The honourable member for Calare will also be undoubtedly on the side of temperance. I hope that all those honourable members will show that their temperance principles are not only for the platform, but are also occasionally to be put into legislation. Home Affairs) [12.24] -In the beginning of next session the Ministry will introduce a Constitution for the proper government of the Federal territory. Every honourable member will then have a full opportunity to seek to embody in that law any provision that he thinks it necessary to bring forward. licences be granted in the meantime? laws will be in force in the territory until the Constitution is passed, and any application for a licence in the district will have to be granted under fhe local option provisions of the New South Wales law. I understand from the honourable member for Werriwa that there is only one hotel at present in the territory, and it has passed through the local option system. In the circumstances, seeing that no new licences can be granted except by a local option vote, and that the Government will next session introduce a Constitution for the territory, the Committee might fairly reject the amendment. are many provisions which I should like to see embodied in any law for the government of the Federal territory. It is important, for example, that no public lands in the territory should be sold. If I had to choose between the two, I would as soon choose land nationalization as prohibition, although I favour both, but if , before we undertake to frame a Constitution for the territory, we are going to lay down every principle that we think ought to be embodied in it, it will be impossible to pass this Bill during the life of this Parliament/ As a temperance man, I have not sufficient confidence in the honourable member who moved this amendment to constitute him my leader upon the temperance question. for Gippsland is a Son of Temperance. son of anything that would block what he thinks is a very bad measure for the Commonwealth. member thinks the question of temperance is more important than the selection of the site? site first. We can very soon afterwards settle the question of temperance. The honourable member for Cook was not quite correct with regard to the rights that a hotel keeper gets under the New South Wales local option law. Those who wanted to secure a period of eight years before their hotels could be closed had to obtain a lease before a certain day, which expired two years ago. No licensee could get an eight-years' right by obtaining a lease now. I think every honourable memCan any new ber, who is opposed to the liquor traffic would be satisfied to accept an assurance from the Minister that, pending the passing of a Constitution for the territory, the Government will oppose the granting of any further licences there.

150,Mr Fuller (Illawarra,"Minister of a piece of gratuitous impertinence on the part of the Minister of Defence to suggest that I moved this amendment for the express purpose of destroying the Bill. Since the Fusion came about, we have not had many such exhibitions of his temper, but it was characteristic of him, and he was as usual absolutely incorrect. I had no thought of the effect Of the amendment on the Bill. When the amendments were circulated, I decided that I would support this one. It was discovered to-day that the proper place to move it was clause 6, and, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong was not in the chamber, I took the liberty of moving it for him. If it were my intention to destroy the Bill, I should not have. the faintest hesitation about saying so; but the fact that the moving of the amendment may delay the passing of the measure will not deter me from trying to insert a provision which I think should be in the agreement. Parliament will not be in a position to make laws respecting the Federal territory between the end of the year and next July, and I wish to prevent the creation within that time of vested interests which it will cost something to buy out. With the permission of the Committee, I shall alter my amendment so as to provide for the insertion of the word "" new "" between the word "" no "" and the word "" licence."" Amendment amended accordingly. [r-2-33]-The Federal territory is going to be national property. The nation will hold it in fee simple. We therefore should be careful to prevent the creation of vested interests there before we take possession, especially vested interests in "" stagger juice."" law will not permit it. States at the present time are spending a good deal of money in reducing the number of licensed houses. The licensing of an hotel creates a vested interest, not for the benefit of the person who makes the business, but for the benefit of the owner of the property. ties have held that there is no interest in an military 'camps, and, to be consistent, we annual licence. no person shall be allowed to sell "" stagger juice"" in the Commonwealth territory unthat, according to the honourable member, it less by Commonwealth licence. No doubt has a poor water supply 1 the Minister means well, but I remember a case in Augusta, Maine, in which a man proceeded to sell "" stagger juice "" in bulk, in defiance of the State prohibition law. The SupremeCourt decided that he could not be prevented from doing this if he did not put up the liquor within the State. The reason why prohibition has failed in many of the States of America is that vested interests have constantly interfered. The liquor traffic is one of the most profitable businesses in the world. We reformers believe in so regulating it that its profits may go towards the reduction of taxation, and that the business may be made respectable, and cease to create drunkards. My fear in this instance is that the opportunity to make boodle may induce the issuing of new licences in the Federal territory before we can take charge of it. New South Wales, the local option poll has to be taken before any new licences can be granted. mised yesterday that, so far as I was concerned, the measure would be disposed of by 1 o'clock to-day, but, when making that promise, I was under the impression that the clauses of the agreement could not be discussed. I have since learned that they can be discussed. able member so? An agreement ought to be honorably kept. cross-examined by the honourable member. The information did not come from him. In dealing with the proposal before the Committee we must ask ourselves-first , is it a good one; and, next, can we give effect to it? I believe that it is a good one, and that a majority is in favour of it. M.r. MAUGER -The question is whether this is the time and place for moving such an amendment. we should not be ready to do what we can to prevent the growth of the liquor traffic.

I left office received no reply, and presume that my predecessor in office was treated in the same way. Various phases of the question were discussed, and there was a changing of ground. A third partu intervened, a gentleman representing the Bible in State Schools League. called on me casually, and afterwards sent along a memorandum with all the statements of which I did not agree, and I told, liim so. The interview was not official in the strict sense of the term. I am entirely with the Prime Minister in this matter. It is most undesirable that State issues should be raised to complicate Federal elections, -especially when Federal referenda will make matters very perplexing to the ordinary elector. that what the Prime Minister has said is -correct, and that I have done an injustice to the honourable member for Darling Downs. On the 3rd September, 1907, I asked the honourable member for Hume this questionI t has been announced by the Premier of -Queensland, that he proposes at the time of the next Federal elections, to take a"" referendum of the State on the subject of Scripture education, and that the Premier of Victoria, if a referendum B ill is passed through the State Parliament, will propose a similar referendum. Does the Acting Prime Minister think it right that sectarian issues should be permitted to enter into Federal politics, as they necessarily must if , at the time of the Federal elections, a referendum is taken in regard to the teaching of Scripture by the State? To that, he repliedThe matter has recently been brought under my notice, though not by the Premier of Queensland, and, in regard to it, I have had occasion to refer to previous correspondence of a confidential character. While the Government does not wish to refuse anv reasonable request by the State of Queensland, Ministers feel that as the Queensland State elections will take place .before the Commonwealth elections torian elections. are likely to take place shortly after the Commonwealth elections, and, therefore, the Government does not intend to agree to the proposal. In my opinion, it would not be wise to allow any matter savouring of sectarianism to be mixed up with Federal politics. The Queensland Government were informed by that announcement of the views of the Commonwealth Government, and I hope that the present Ministry will stand by the position then taken up. If necessary, we should put into the Bill words which will prohibit the taking of the State referendum in connection with the Commonwealth elections. It will be very dangerous to allow State and Federal politics to become mixed. The Premier of Victoria wished to save State members from embarrassment by proHe viding for a referendum on a State question to be taken at a Federal election. If we permit the Queensland referendum to be taken during the next election, we shall on future occasions have all kinds of State questions submitted to the electors at Commonwealth elections, and it will be impossible for them to decide between the Commonwealth and State functions. If during my candidature I am asked if I believe in permitting the Bible to be read in State schools, ancl replv that the question is not of Commonwealth concern, I shall be thought by many to be sitting on a fence, while if I define my position I shall have to spoil a speech dealing with Commonwealth politics by an expedition into the field of State politics. I take it from what the Prime Minister has stated that no part of the Federal electoral machinery will be used for the Queensland referendum. booths nor the officers acting for the Federation will be used. land candidates who try to gain seats in this House at the coming election, Ijecause the State question will be made a burning one, and will cause them trouble, whatever their views may be.

240,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"MinisThat the amendment be agreed to. rather interesting to find that although the Government fought so vigorously for the retention of these words when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion, they are now prepared to accept an amendment made by another place which practically covers the amendment which the Opposition desired the Minister of External Affairs to make. help recalling the fact that the Minister, when this Bill was previously before us, took a very strong stand against'the clause being amended in this way. He suggested that the High Commissioner might desire to accept the office of President of the Royal Colonial Institute, or an honorary position in an organization having for its object the strengthening of the Empire. Indeed, he grew quite eloquent in his support of the clause as it stood. We now find him, without explaining his change of attitude, inviting the Committee to agree to an amendment which cofhpletely blots out the speech that he then made. seems to have accepted the statement made recently by the right honourable member for East Sydney that the advantage of turning a complete, somersault is that when one does so, one lands on one's feet.

In order to remove any doubt it is necessary to put the amendment in proper legal form. It has been submitted to the law officers, who desire that it shall be placed in strict legal' phraseology.

According to a telegram sent from Sydney yesterdayMrH . H . Moore, Sydney manager of Messrs. A. Kethel and Co., whose mines are to be worked by the Miners' Federation, stated to-day that his company was in no way connected with the Newcastle vend or Defence Association. Further, he added, "" We have no grievance with our miners, or they with us. We maintain that we have every right to work our collieries should we think fit. I might mention that the Sydney coal merchants, who all handle the vend coal, and the InteT-State shipping and coal companies have during the past twelve months lent every effort to crush our firm out of the trade. We can quote instances, if necessary, where the vend refused to load cargoes if our Wallsend coal formed part of such cargo. Another instance of the tactics adopted by the vend was when it refused to load its coal as cargo because our coal formed part of the bunkers of steamers, hot a ton being despatched as cargo. The predicament caused by such selfish action can well be imagined. Should the Commonwealth Government ever desire to inquire into the methods of the vend and certain steam-ship companies in regard to the restriction placed upon InteTState and oversea tTade by their combined action-and .such inquiry certainly should be made-w e shall be most happy to support our statements by instancing cases in which our trade has been hampered by the methods I have mentioned."" Mr Moore is one of Australia's most reputable business men, and Mr Kethel is another. In the face of the fact that those who constitute the vend are refusing to meet the miners in open conference; ancl that their interference with Inter-State trade and commerce is increasing the cost of living, closing up factories, throwing men and women out of employment, and depreciating property everywhere; will the Attorney General read carefully what appears in Australia's national organ, and. having made sure of his facts, ask Mr Moore to help him to bring these men within the pale of the Commonwealth law? Prime Minister, in moving the adjournment of the House, referred to the business on our notice-paper, but made no statement about the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. ness in this House which has come to us from the Senate, and vvhich, when we have 0 dealt with it, will be concluded. I did not allude to any measures before the Senate. that time will be given to the Senate to deal with the important measure which 1 have named. It is not suggested that the wish to say a few words regarding a veryimportant subject, the inspection of produce passing from State to State. It is high time that the Federation took this matter into its hands, by appointing inspectors who could do the work impartially, and give general satisfaction. I should have liked to bring this matter before the House in a form which would have enabled honourable members to vote on a definite proposal, and have been urged by many public bodies to do so ; but, as there is no opportunity for that, I am forced to take this action. I hope that the Government will look very closely into the matter, and see whether it cannot provide for Commonwealth inspection in the immediate future. The past season has been so unsatisfactory to producers that the Commonwealth should begin to create machinery for dealing with the business of next season. A most peculiar position has been created. In practically all the States, the same diseases are attacking vegetable produce, ancl yet, one State will not accept sound produce from another, alleging that it must prevent the introduction of disease. By this action, not only are the producers affected, but the consumers, and those who handle produce, are also injured, great monetary loss being entailed. A most un-Federal feeling is also being produced. When men send sound .produce from their State to another and have it rejected, and are convinced that there is being consumed within that State inferior locally-grown produce, they cannot help thinking that they have gained nothing by Federation. Did time permit, I could quote a number of instances in which injustice has been done; but I do not wish to detain honourable members unduly. ber referring to the fruit industry ? State Governments in regard lo imported produce generally. I think that the people would be glad to have Federal substituted for State inspection, and that the State Governments would like to be relieved of their present task.",40,Acceptance Bill Inspection Of Inter State Produce Shipments

320,Mr Atkinson,"To the action of thement of a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau meet the difficulty ? done at once. The establishment of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau is far in the future, and we must deal with this matter before r;ext season. It is true that New South Wales has just removed her embargo on produce coming from Victoria and the other States; but as she has no potatoes of her own at the present time, her inspectors may now pass potatoes which, in April next, when there is a local crop, may be condemned. The action of the State Governments this season has been disastrous so far as many producers are concerned, and should teach us a lesson. Having read the opinion of the Attorney-General, I am afraid that the Quarantine Act does not empower the Commonwealth Government to deal with this matter by proclamation. Therefore, it is the duty of Ministers to propose an amendment of the law which will enable us to provide, at the first opportunity, for proper inspection. wish to refer to a newspaper statement concerning the honourable member for West Sydney, who is not here to defend himself. In a sub-leader in this morning's Argus, these words occur-the subject under discussion is the Newcastle strikeThe legal adviser and general director of the men in revolt against die law is Mr W. M . Hughes, M.P., ex-Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, who, so far from acting in a manner conformable to the high position he has held and persuading the unions to submit to the trito do so because of the belief that the bunals they were principally instrumental in creating, encourages them in their contumacy. That such statements have an effect upon the minds, not only of the outside public, but of honourable members themselves, is evidenced by an interjection made a few moments ago by the honourable member for Corio. The statement that the honourable member for West Sydney is encouraging the men in their contumacy is a deliberate and absolute lie. The honourable member for West Sydney, and I , are interested in the same organization. He is the President and I am the Vice-President of it. and as one who is behind the scenes I have no hesitation in saying that there is absolutely no foundation in fact for the statement concerning him of which I complain. I give it an unqualified denial. Were it noffor the efforts of the honourable member for West Sydney the industrialfire,, which is confined at present to a small area of the Commonwealth, would develop into a huge conflagration and extend throughout the Continent. knows that that is so. cowardly and contemptible attack made behind the cover of an unsigned article. the honourable member concerned. to those who make these unprincipled misrepresentations as to the action of the honourable member. By' cowardly inferences and innuendoes they endeavour to throw mud at him and others who at present occupy the Opposition benches. I take this opportunity to resent such statements in. the strongest possible wav. Prime Minister has appealed to the House to assist him in bringing the session to. a close at the end of next week. sist him in expediting public business, but I should like to clearly understand whether or not the Government, in dealing with important questions, and more especially the Naval Loan Bill, are going to display that impartiality which ought to dominate their control of the House. If I receive fair play 1 shall not avail myself of the forms of the House to prevent any honourable member from expressing his opinions. But in justification of a certain action that I took in the House early this 8 week, I desire to explain that I was led "" g a g "" had been used unfairly, not only to curtail discussion, but to penalize certain honourable members in the discharge of what they conceive to be their public duties. So long as the Government deal fairly with honourable members generally I shall take no action; but if they continue the conduct of which I complain, I shall have to persevere and show that this weapon of the ""gag"" is used for the persecution of some honourable members.. I know of no Legislature within the British realm where there exists such a closure resolution as we have in operation in this Parliament. I was not present when it was passed; had I been I should have opposed it. I have never supported the ""gag,"" and do not believe in it.

332,Mr Webster,"I did not support it.bers have a full sense of the responsibility of their position and recognise the reasonableness of the desire of a Government to push on with public business. In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly the closure cannot be applied to an indivi'dual member unless a .majority of those present approve of its application, and a still larger majority is necessary to permit of the application of the "" gag "" to the general question. In this way honourable members are safeguarded against the unreasonable use of a weapon which, I admit, is necessary, although not to the extent to which it has been employed by the Government in this House. If the debate on the Naval Loan Bill is not going to be one-sided 1 shall be satisfied; but I shall certainly protest if we have a repetition of the action of the Government in connection with the consideration of a measure recently before us. On the occasion to which I refei, three honourable members on the Government side of the House, having practically voted against their expressed convictions, desired naturally to put their position before the country. The Government connived at securing for them an opportunity to make a statement, but as soon as they had done so, and the Leader of the Opposition rose to speak, the "" gag"" was at once applied.' That was palpably an act of persecution. When the weaponis so used resentment must be expected. If the Government are prepared to play the game fairly, I am. Buti f they attempt to use the "" gag,"" as they have done, as an instrument of oppression, I shall resist their efforts as far as possible, and shall not hesitate to repeat what I have done in this connection. I sound .this note of warning, because I am determined to secure fair play. Sir member receives his .fair share. member has been misled, and has got off his usual track. In that he has my sympathy. As for the statement made by the honourable member for Herbert, I think it cruel that an honourable member who is doing his best to bring about a peaceful settlement of a dispute that threatens the whole of the commerce of Australia-wh o is endeavouring to have it dealt with by legitimate methods according to the laws of the country, and to frustrate extremists who might take steps that would be disastrous to the country-shoul d be assailed as the honourable member for West Sydney[ 33 ] 2 has been. The honourable member is trying to settle a great difficulty, and in dealing with it has displayed ability and capacity such as no other honourable member could show. Every encouragement should be given him in his endeavour to bring the dispute to a satisfactory issue without resort to violence, such as would probably have occurred bad he not been called to the position that he now holds, and acted as a mediator. As a member of the Labour party, as a man having some interest in the welfare of the masses, and of the commerce of Australia generally, I resent these insults hurled at a man who is deserving of credit for the stupendous efforts he is making, notwithstanding that he is hot in the best of health, to combata grave public difficulty. [4.9] -In reference to the remarks of thc honourable member for Darwin, I do not think it necessary to add to what the Prime Minister said this morning. If a carrier engaged in Inter-State business is interfering with trade and commerce between the States by failing to give fair and reasonable facilities for traffic, his being a State authority does not exempt him-from the application of the Trade and Commerce section. As to the other matter to which reference has been made, I may say that I saw MrH . H . Moore's statement, as published iin the press this morning. I read all these matters, and after perusing the paragraph in question I gave instructions to the Crown Solicitor to communicate with that gentleman. The honourable member for Wilmot has raised the question as to whether we should not either bring into force the provisions of the Quarantine Act or pass legislation extending them. I do not think that JOHN FORREST -The honourable the whole field in relation to this matter is covered by section 13 of the Quarantine Act; but it is rather late now to consider the advisableness of amending that statute. It would require a great deal of .care and an ample staff of supervisors to supersede the State jurisdiction. would be willing. such' an amendment of the law without deliberation.
