3,Mr Deakin Laid Upon The Table The,"graph appears in to-day's Argus:There is abundant evidence of the neglect to which the cadets have been subjected. In every company there are boys without belts, boys without bayonets, boys without rifles. In most companies there are some boys without any equipment at a l l , while 13 f u l l companies marched past the saluting-base without Government equipment. these they provided themselves. I wish to know from the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Defence, whether, as a result of the recent Conference, immediate action is likely to be taken to place all the boys serving as cadets on the same footing in regard to equipment? nation of the motion of want of confidence, Ministers are not answering questions, but the circumstances to which the honourable member has called attention will receive my colleague's consideration.

A great deal of special pleading as well as this. has appeared in the press in regard to this matter, the attempt being made to cause surer give the reason for asking for Supply the impression that injustice will be done if now ? the Supply Bill is not passed immediately. On a previous occasion, the Minister of member will not let him. Defence protested against procedure of this kind as most unconstitutional, though he lieve that consent would by now have been afterwards agreed to what was done, on given to the course proposed by the Governthe ground of urgency.

Unless a. satisfactory explanation of the Government recognised its position, and paragave to honourable members the consideration which is their due, it would ask merely for one month's Supply, and to such a request consideration would' be given.

Of course, there are circumstances under which Supply must be granted at once, but at the present time it is being attempted to introA l l they had was their uniforms, and duce a Supply Bill earlier than it is needed to meet the public necessity, if not the convenience of the Government. Prime Minister moved his motion in so low a tone that many of us who were listening attentively thought it to be one for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Supply Bill to be taken through al l its stages at once. I understand now that it is for the postponement of business on the notice-paper, to enable such a motion to be moved.

My opinion is unchanged, and I am confident that the Government have an overwhelming desire to do nothing but to remain where they are. This Bill which the Treasurer says is not unusual is, on the face of it , most unusual. want Supply for two months in the first place ? Sir question before the House. the peculiar position in which the right honourable member is placed in being asked to inform the House why Supply is wanted. If there is any person in this country who is less capable of affording the House that information, I should like to see or know of him. Personally, I do not believe there is such a person. Sir member's stock-in-trade is personality. personalities. Of course, the truth is sometimes not at all agreeable, but I have never heard it stated by any moralist or dabbler in ethics that the truth was to be dammed back because it happened to bump up against somebody's personality. The honourable member's gamut in politics, so far as we have seen him run it in this House, has gone so far that when the Watson Ministry approached the House some four years ago he proposed to cut its existence short the same afternoon. member kindly discuss the question before the Chair? member's interruption naturally threw me off my somewhat delicate poise. We are now discussing whether the Government have a right to live or not. We say they have not the confidence of the House or the country. Yet the right honourable member for Swan, apparently repeating what he has been told by the Prime Minister, asserts in the calmest way that Supply must be granted, or the country will go to the dogs. The country would be ail right if honourable members on the Ministerial side would only do what is decent and proper. I shall not agree at .'this stage to allow the business of the House to be interrupted. I am aware that Supply must be granted at a later stage, and, when the House has voted on the question of whether the Ministry has or has not its confidence, I shall be quite prepared not to offer any factious opposition to the grant of Supply, but [17] to discuss the motion with the' amount of criticism that the circumstances warrant. With the leader of the Opposition, I am nf opinion that there is no necessity for Supply for more than one month, though personally I should not feel inclined to give Why do the Government the Government even that. The propercourse is to proceed with the motion of want of confidence; and then, if the GoJOHN FORREST -That is not the vernment show that they have the confidence of the House, they can proceed with other I can quite understand measures. that the House will proceed to this business, and get through it at the earliest possible moment.

I , for one, would .point out that even before the importance of the debate carried on hopelessly, and without definite object, as shown by the mimbers already indicated in the House, the measure submitted is one which ought to be carried through; then honourable members, who desire to speak on the motion of want of confidence-thoug h it appears to be to me more or less purposeless-ma y do so afterwards. W ill the honourable Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) [3-2-0-I am a little amused at the proposals submitted by the Government; and I cannot The right honourable help calling to mind the attitude assumed on a former occasion, and more particularly by the present Minister of Defence, when, in a case of much greater necessity, I , as Treasurer, asked for Supply. Sir JOH N FORREST -When was that? the year before, though I cannot give the exact date I realize that payments undertaken by the Government must be made, though I also realize that at the present moment we cannot discuss the amount asked for, or the time over which Supply is to extend. My own opinion is that it would have been well to clearthe motion of want of confidence out of the way before asking for Supply. We have not had a single hint as to how this, money is to be provided; and, knowing as much as I do of the difficulties of the Treasurer, we ought to be given some idea as to how the Government propose to provide for tlie £ 8 8 3 , 0 0 0 .",16,Advance Account Acts Of Last Session We Have I T On The

28,Sir William Lyne,"Last year, orthat the only matter open to debate is the question of urgency of Supply; the amount of Supply, or the time over which it exLends, must be discussed at a later stage. tion before the House is carried, a Supply Bill must be introduced; and I have no doubt, in view of the peculiar constitution of this confused House, the proposal of the Ministry will be carried. At the same time, I may be permitted to say, generally, that the course proposed by the Government is an extreme one, unless money is urgently required. The only ground for such action is urgency; and the question we have to decide is whether the money is really required before the first or second week in next month. As to trusting the Government, I would not trust them with the care of a rabbit; at the same time, I do not wish to stand here to object seriously to the proposal of the Government, though, when I was Treasurer, the present Minister of Defence carped at what I did, and called me all sorts of nasty names. The Government say that ihey must have money ; and the question of how much they are to have or how long a period Supply should extend over, will come up for discussion after we have decided tlie matter of the suspension of the Standing Orders. I suggest that it is not wise to take a vote on the motion before us; I have known the pinch as Treasurer. The only question, as I have already indicated, is whether this is the right time for the motion-whethe r we should not wait until next week. I wish to place on record that it is most unusual, in view of the fact that Supply is not required for ten days or a fortnight, to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders. Honourable members may say that the motion of want of confidence represents a hopeless fight; but I cannot agree with the honourable member for Perth in turning on his own party as he did just now. Conservative vote ! Opposition have their duties, just as have the Government, especially in connection might wish to have some time to discuss the with motions for the suspension of the B ill . Standing Orders. They are entitled to take any course they please, and, having reto take some time in discussing it. gard to the peculiar circumstances with which we are confronted, there is a special tional reason why we should proceed with reason why they should be very careful to the Bill now. see that there is no topsy-turvy business so far as monev matters are concerned. I surer does not think that we should do cerI have already ruled would suggest, however, that the motion be allowed to pass, so that the Supply Bill may be introduced. We shall then have an opportunity, in discussing the items, to deal with many matters that cannot be referred to during the debate on this motion. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) [3-3-t]-I wish to offer to the honourable member for Perth-wh o is not in his place, and, I suppose, will be away, as usual, for the rest' of the day-m y congratulations on his first bid for the Conservative vote. Doubtless, in the Argus and Age to-morrow he will get the nice little pat on the back for which, no doubt, he was looking when he spoke. I object, however, to any honourable member dictating to me what course I should take. I object to dictation even on the part of the honourable member for Perth, although at one time he may have belonged to the party of which I am. a member. belonged to it had he been selected as a member of the Labour Ministry. We are asked to take an unusual course, and I hope that the House will not agree too readilv to set up a. bad precedent. I have always objected, both in State and in Federal politics, to motions for the suspension of the Standing Orders, so that a Supply Bill may be hurriedly passed. Such a procedure does not conduce to the proper conduct of business. The Treasurer has shown that the only reason he has for asking us to agree to this motion is that he wishes the Bill to reach the Senate tomorrow. journ for a week. this House should not be conducted with a regard solely to the interests and desires of another place. members of another place desired an adfirst bid for the journment.

The honourable gentleman has taken up an extraordinary attitude, and I hope that in future our debates will not be curtailed at the dictation of another place. Question resolved in the affirmative. posedThat the Standing Orders be suspended in order to enable the Committees of Supply, and Ways and Means to be appointed before the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Opening Speech has been agreed to by the House, and to enable all other steps to be taken to obtain Supply, and to pass a SupplyB ill through all its stages without delay. motion is obviously necessary if the Bill is to be dealt with expeditiously. I should like to say in reply to the honourable member for Perth that it is absolutely incorrect to say that if the course proposed by the Government is not adopted, working men will be kept out of their money. Wages are paid fortnightly, and the first payment under this measure will not be due until the middle of next month. member say that is so in regard to day Supply would be sufficient. labour; some demands, I am told, will be due within a week ? wages, demands under a fortnight. day-to-day payments falling due, but amounting to not more than petty cash expenditure. The statement that day wages men will be thrown out of work because of our failure to pass a motion of this kind is altogether too mean and paltry to be discussed in a national Parliament. The last occasion on which we were asked to pass a Bill of this kind was. on the 3rd or 4th July last, and the present Minister of Home Affairs then made a speech, extending over five pages of Hansard, in which he pointed out that the proposed procedure was altogether wrong. Why attempt to bolster up a wholly untenable position by the paltry statement that unless we agree to the Government proposal workmen will be deprived of their wages. Undoubtedly the public responsibilities ought to be met, but there is no justification for the request for two months' Supply. This is the only occasion when under like circumstances two months' ! > 7 j -2 Supply has been asked for. In all other cases there has been a demand for only one month's Supply. The Prime Minister proposes now to double the Supply asked for, just as he has doubled the number of Honorary Ministers. as three months' Supply has been obtained. Parliament to remain out of session for a certain period, in order to pay an international courtesy to the visiting American Fleet. Surely it is not pretended that the circumstances to-day are the same. for three months' Supply. we agreed to one month's Supply. day before. asked to grant only one month's Supply. Another occasion was the 28th June, 1906. These are the only occasions upon whicb Supply has been asked for before the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and then the grant of it has been limited to one month'. The Government are certainly not justified in now asking for Supply for Provision for one month's Question resolved in the affirmative. toThat the House will this day resolve itself into a Committee to consider the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. That the House will this day resolve itself into a Committee lo consider the Ways and Means for raising the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. posedThat Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair, and the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply'. If this motion be agreed to I desire to know whether it will be possible under our Standing Orders for honourable members to indulge in a general debate upon the items covered by the Supply? I think that at this stage it is possible to engage in such a debate, but, if not, I should like to be informed of the real position. fore the Chair is, ""That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair and the House resolve itself into a Committee of Supply,"" for the purpose of dealing with the whole matter.",18,Advance Account Acts Of Last Session We Have I T On The

The right honourable member must make good any insinuations of that kind. When the late Government quitted office, the preparation of the Estimates was. as forward as any man could make it at the time. The statement that it will be the end of August before the Budget is delivered thatmonth. Budget will not be delivered until towards the end of August is a declaration that the Government are not readv with anyfinancial proposals whatever. It is an intimation to this House and the country that they have no policy at all, because upon more than one occasion the Prime Minister clearly stated that he considered this Parliament should have been convened earlier, in order that it might deal with the vast financial problems that await our attention. But now that it has met I have not seen somewhat later than he desired, we find that the delivery of the Budget is to be deferred for a period of three months. For that can be discussed. Is that the Treasurer's trouble? The trouble is that our Standing Orders permit us to discuss the absolute incapacity of the Government to frame a financial policy until three months have elapsed from their assumption of office. The members of the Government are not new to Ministerial office. Of course, I recognise that we shall have ample opportunity to discuss these questions tion of the Treasurer that he will not be able to make his Budget statement until towards the end of August amounts to a declaration to members of this House, and to the country, that the Government have no financial policv whatever, and are merely waiting the drift of events to enable them to overcome the troubles which face them.

70,Mr Fisher,"The broadest question-nearly all ready when the honourable member took the office of Treasurer. -ready. A commencement had scarcely been made in the preparation of the Estimates. Indeed, the only work! which had been done -related to a reduction of the Estimates by ^£70,000 or .£100,000, which the right honourable member had ordered without consulting his officers. It was attempted subsequently to fasten on to my shoulders the blame attaching to his action. That he ordered the reduction was evidenced in -dccuments which I afterwards submitted ro the House-document s to which his initials were attached. For the right honourable member to say that he cannot make a Budget statement for three months after the meeting of Parliament is absurd. It is a token of incapacity and of want of knowledge of the Department over which he has been presiding for a considerable time. When I assumed control of the Treasury, the officers of that Department probably thought that I was a slave-driver, but I told then: that the work had to be done because Parliament wanted the Budget within a very short time. The Under Secretary informed me that more than 100 men would be required to do the work within the period that I indicated. My reply was, "" Get as many men as are needed, but the work must be done."" Sir JOH N FORREST I think that the fact I had to undo a great deal that the honourable member delivered his Budget on present Treasurer had prepared-if one the 8th August of that year. Sir WILLIAM LYNE had assumed the office of Treasurer only time, because there was cast upon my about a fortnight previously. YetI made shoulders the blame which arose from the a Budget statement as complete as any that right honourable member who preceded me has yet been delivered in this House. The at the Treasury having unwarrantably cut only complaint urged against it was that off ,£70,000 from the Estimates. I am not I read it.

Accordingly, I took it, and 1 Hansard shows that I was only in office eight days when I made my Financial Statement. I had to put great pressure upon my Department in order to do it. I made the officers work up to the full extent of their power.

I stopped it as far as I -could. Money voted for one purpose has been spent for another, and I hold that that is not a proper thing to do. The practice used to be followed in Sydney under a roads and bridges schedule, and I stopped it there. I do urge that if the Government propose to raisemoney by loan, the fact should be made public now. I -do not wish to deal with small amounts, but with large sums involved in carrying out important matters of policy which the Government have to face. A few minutes ago I was going to say -that, in regard to -old-age pensions, about which so much was said in this Chamber the last time. I brought in a Supply Bill and a Budget .statement, the late Prime Minister knows that I intended to use the money set .aside out of the Surplus Revenue Fund, .and then to finance six months of the time, until we got control of the Commonwealth revenue in 1910. 'That is all known. If it could be done -then, it can be done now; but it cannot be done if the Government is going to put off -dealing with the financial relations between .the Commonwealth and the States for five years longer.' The States have had .greater consideration, and received' larger .sums of money, than they could ever have expected to get, in consequence of the large .revenue we have derived from Customs and Excise. If we put off the consideration of -this question any longer, and the Government is going in for a borrowing policy, then all the good which has been done by .preventing an appeal to the London or Australian markets will be destroyed, for the people at present believe we can be trusted to deal with the finances. It will be a good thing for the Opposition, and those who act with me, but a very dreadful thing for the Government, if they start that game. We ought to know before August what is intended to be done, and that is a point I press home at the present moment. I did not mean to speak at this length to-day, 'because I had intended to speak to the other motion on the notice-paper, when I should have dealt with some of these questions. But this particular question is so important and urgent that the House ought to take action immediately, unless it can get some satisfaction. The people of this country will back us up by taking the most -extreme action in regard to a question of this sort, which is bound up with the prosperity of the Commonwealth and of every individual in the community, especially, with thefinancesslacking, as they are now, to some extent. If we are not made acquainted with the intention of the Government, and do not press by all means this question, it will be our own fault, and we shall be blamed. If we are defeated, all that we can do will be to appeal to the electors at the earliest possible moment. But do not let us make a mistake about the urgency of this question. , It is one of the strongest points on which any party can go to the country. I think that there is no question so strong as that of stopping the lavish borrowing to which the States have resorted. We should not defer for one moment the settlement of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. The proposal which was made on a. previous occasion was taken, some of it from the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, some of it from the proposals of others, and a little of it from the statements of Sir George Turner, and some of it originated with myself. I am never desirous of taking credit from any one to whom it is due. I admit freely that the basis of the altered scheme came from the honourable member for Mernda. That was worked out with the great assistance which was given to the Treasury officials and myself by the Prime Minister when he was Minister of External Affairs. His anxiety was never so distinctly shown to me as it was then to clear up the accounts of the States at once. He will find all he said on the subject -in minutes in connection with the Department of External Affairs, and in the report of the Premiers' Conference. That was one of the strongest points which he pressed upon me as Treasurer, and in connection with the matter he told me many things which I shall not repeat now. When the trouble arose with the honourable member for Swan, he attacked me because I did not do what he proposed to do when he was at the Brisbane Conference. There he showed his hand, and disclosed that he was more a State Minister than a Federal Minister. there.

114,Sir William Lyne,"The Primesay at Brisbane, as I told him before in this Chamber. When I went as second to the Prime Minister to meet the Premiers in Conference at Melbourne, he commanded my admiration for the way in which he handled them, and the strong points that he brought out in urging that there should be no delay in settling this question. I have been very much amazed to read in the press rumours and statements that it is to be deferred for five said on either finance or anything else. As years for breathing time, and then Heaven knows how much longer it will be deferred before it is actually taken in hand. I repeat that the end of 1910 will be tlie time to deal with the question. We should not follow the system of drift, and continue the fight, which must be continued if we do not lay down a certain rule as to what we shall do with the revenue from Customs and Excise. constant bickering so long as the finances of the Commonwealth ancl the States are not divided in a proper way. I hope that the few words I have uttered to-day will cause honourable members and the public to think as to the very serious position of the finances. Let us have no medley of borrowing money and raising revenue, no hocus-pocus statements, no further time lost, as it has already been lost by the Ministry in asking for an adjournment of three weeks when one of ten days would have been quite sufficient for them to prepare what they have prepared. Indeed, so far as I can see, there is nothing prepared now after an adjournment of three weeks. Ministers did not put their shoulders to the wheel as I did when I was in the Treasury. When a Minister undertakes to perform a task, it ought to be done, or be should leave his position. That is the attitude which honourable members ought to take up. I hope that this debate will not be allowed to close until we get some stateruling, Mr Speaker, though I did not ment as regards the future administration of the finances. We have to get a statement regarding many other things. We want to know, for iustance, about the written compact between the Protectionist party and the Free Trade party. We want to know about a number of things on which we have not yet been taken into the confidence of the Ministry. When I was sitting on the Ministerial side of the House, and the honourable member for Parramatta, with his supporters, was sitting on the Opposition side, the latter were always wanting' to know what agreement we had with the Labour party. Sir William Lyne. matter of almost every discussion, and of the bulk of the questions whicb were asked. I , for one, desire to know what agreement has been' entered into in this unholy alliance. We shall be found in possession of plenty of voice and stamina to see that these matters are brought to light, and that the people of this country are not kept in darkness, as they are kept now, without one word being regards finance, what was the proposal which was built up mainly on the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda? We were to take over tlie State debts, which amounted to £244,000,000or .£246,000,000, and which amount now, I believe, to £252,000,000 or .£254,000,000. It was proposed that the Commonwealth should assume the responWe shall have a sibility for the whole of that indebtedness by the States. the honourable member that there are already three debates set down on the notice paper, namely, a debate on the question as to whether or not the Government enjoys the confidence of the majority of this House, a debate on the Address-in-Replv, and a debate on the policy of the Government. So long as general principles have been touched upon, I Have not interfered with the honourable member, though he was going very near to several of the questions covered by those three Orders of the Day. Buti f he proposes to go into details as to how many millions are owed by the States, the distribution of the millions, and so on, he will see very clearly that he will be anticipating one or more of the debates on .the notice-paper. I ask him not to proceed in that way. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I bow to your know before that a debate such as this, in which, ordinarily, every grievance that can be thought of, may be mentioned with a view to redress, can be limited because of other matters on the notice-paper under which such questions might be dealt with. I thought that the redress of 'grievances took first place when Supply was asked 1 for.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am sorry that I may not finish my remarks, because their curtailment now will make it necessary to refer to the matter in another debate. However, I shall not proceed further, for two reasons: first, that I think you are the best authority we have in regard to matters of this kind, and, secondly, because I would not wish to do anything which you do not -desire me to do. I shall repeat what I have already said, in as forcible language .as I can command, though I shall try to be as little offensive as is possible under the circumstances. This is a time when no honourable member should hesitate to call a spade a spade. I have done so as plainly as I can, without being unduly offensive. I think it is my right so to speak without apcJogy to the House. Two matters upon which I feel very strongly are the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and Commonwealth borrowing. just listened to a speech charged with admonition ancl warning in regard to the -criticism and supervision which honourable members should exercise in respect to the financial proposals of the Government. I -do not think that any honourable member would deny that such proposals must be keenly scrutinized, but I refuse to admit ^hat such scrutiny is the province of the -Opposition alone. -close supervision of financial administration' is a duty attaching to every parliamentary representative. The fact that a man has moved his seat from one side of the Chamber to another does not alter his responsibility in this matter. Since the first Commonwealth Parliament was opened I , with Others, have been "" a voice crying in the wilderness "" in protest against the introduction of Supply Bills. think, to hear the honourable member for Hume this afternoon for the first time, 0 -that he is a model parliamentarian. He -now says that Supply Bills are iniquitous, --and that to hold back a Budget statement may be dangerous. Speaker, will allow me to refresh your ready memory, I shall point out that the cial year has introduced no fewer than four Supply Bills. Therefore, his objections to the practice of obtaining Supply in this way are rather belated. Similarly-, the members of the Labour Party were not formerly heard in protest against Supply Bills, but now their sense of what is right is outraged by the proposal of the Government. I am delighted that they have awakened to the fact that honourable members are recreant to their duties if they permit the passing of Supply Bills under other than most exceptional circumstances. They are saying now that the most important thing in parliamentary government is the control by members of the public purse stringsa tardy recognition of a fact of the greatest moment. I am pleased that their removal to the Opposition benches has brought about this change of view. The honourable member for Hume has also protested against Commonwealth borrowing. He tells us that he, and every Government in which he has been a Minister, has been opposed to borrowing. He was cheered for that statement. But let me again refresh your ready memory, Mr S/peaker. Sir George Turner, as Treasurer of a Government in which the honourable member for Hume was Minister, brought forward a proposal for borrowing which was defeated by a vote of the House, I being one of those who voted against it. Unquestionably the public must be delighted that we' have not piled up a national debt, but it has not to thank the honourable member for Hume for this. No doubt it is unfortunate for his reputation for consistency that I have a retentive memory; but since he has admonished the House as though he stands on In my opinion, the a pedestal, and is not playing the part of a strict guardian of the public purse merely for the edification of those outside, it is necessary to refer to these things. hacl forgotten them. Government will forget to bring forward any proposal for borrowing. In my view, One would the States must either be content with a smaller return from Customs and Excise revenue, or must expect tbe Commonwealth to adopt other sources of taxation to obtain the revenue required for its needs. If the States insist upon being paid yearly",26,Advance Account Acts Of Last Session We Have I T On The

It is monstrous to think of paying old-age pensions and providing for defence by borrowing. If the ordinary revenue of the year obtained from indirect taxation is not sufficient to pay old age pensions, they should be provided for by means of direct taxation on the wealthy. There is no escape from that position. funds for defence must also come from direct taxation. the general principles of that question, or to debate at this stage what sources should be tapped by direct taxation, or what should not. I shall have that opportunity, as you, sir, have indicated, during the debates on various motions that will come before the House. The Government are failing on tlie very threshold of what they call responsible government, by asking the House to vote two months' Supply. They have blazoned out to the public the fact that they have taken office to restore representative and responsible government. asking for one month's Supply in the exceptional circumstances of their taking office, but there is no justification for a request for two months' Supply, and the consequent delaying of the Budget, the settlement of the financial problems of the and what the press ancl the Government themselves prophesied would be responsible government in excelsis. We were told that for the first time in Federal history, we were to have Ministers who would take charge of the affairs of the Commonwealth on the plain and beaten lines of responsible government. of taking too strong a view of the question, and consequently of not playing the game, but no one can with justice complain of me for adhering to the fundamental on which responsible government is built. It may be through over earnestness, or because I lack good advice, or proper experience in parliamentary affairs, or it may be that I do not know how to play the game, that I find it necessary to refer to these matters, but I must point out that the Government told the people that the difference between them-selves and honourable members who now sit Mr Wilks. opposite was that they would restore responsible government, with its accompaniment of representative power. For the Government to introduce a two months' SoveSupplyB ill without telling the House when the Budget is likely to be introduced is inthose circumstances to trifle with the very If the requirements of principle which they took office to restoreI n the last twelve months four Supply Bills were introduced by the then Government, and readily supported by those honourable members who are now sitting in Opposition. Not one word of protest came from them, and they gave no assistance to those few of us then sitting on that side, who were foolish enough to oppose those Bills. They arevery studious in regard to these matters toThe night, and rightly so, but I am sorry their studiousness did not come earlier. ByI do not wish to go into means of those four Supply Bills, the House was rendered comparatively powerless in matters of finance. The discussion or criticism of Estimates became a myth, a farce, and the custody of the purse, so f a r as the interests of the public were concerned, passed from members of Parliament when they surrendered the control of finance to the Cabinet. Are we now, on the threshold of a new Administration, to be met with a continuation of the policy of introducing Supply Bills until the Estimates are presented to the House? Until the Budget is I could understand their submitted we cannot obtain the Estimates. I for one refuse to debate Estimates after the money with which they profess to deal 1 has already been voted. I hope the Government will reconsider their proposal to ask for two months' Supply. One plea is that Commonwealth, they want time to prepare the Budget. The honorable member for Hume, who is soquiet and inoffensive, although I admit that occasionally he uses the capital "" I , "" said he had only eight days to get his Budget ready. I interjected that the'world was made in six. The honourable member also revealed the fact that the Treasury officialsI may be accused really wrote his Budget, he being only responsible for the policy and reciting it to the House. Apparently that is what is to take place for the future. The Governprinciples ment of the day will have their policy, and"" the Treasurer will simply marshal the figures as he finds them, and present them to the House. The Financial Statement, instead of being a Budget as we have knownBudgets in the States, or read of them in the British House of Commons, is rapidly becoming more or less an accountant's statement of accounts. I see no reason for pleading for two months' delay. Thestatement of Ministerial policy now before which they will submit for the year.

I think that it was the honourable member for Fawkner who said, "" What about the telephone rates?"" I understood from that remark that the honourable member considered that an act of maladministration had been commitred by the Fisher Government in their proposed alteration of the telephone rates. As that matter was connected with the Post and Telegraph Department, in which I was interested at the time, it will not, perhaps, be amiss if for a little time. I deal with the question of the telephone rates. I may, at the commencement, deal briefly with the history of the telephone service so far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. When the Post and Telegraph Act was passed, as honourable members are aware, not only did the Commonwealth take over the ordinary postal services, but also the telegraphic and telephonic services. At that time, in every State in Australia, the telephone rates were on what is known as the flat rate system.

In Adelaide the business man paid £ 1 0 per annum, and enjoyed an unlimited number of calls; whilst in Brisbane he paid £ 6 . I have not at the moment the figures for Perth and Hobart. In 1901, when speaking on the Post and Telegraph Bill, I protested against what I thought was an unfair system, namely, that subscribers should be charged alike, irrespective of the use made of the telephone. I thought that the flat rate was unfair, unjust, and unbusinesslike. I mention this"" because some of the metropolitan newspapersI refer especially to the Melbourne newspapers; the principal dailies in Sydney said little of an unfair character about the proposed alteration of rates-accuse d me of being altogether swayed by the opinions of the officials of the Department in the policy which I proposed to inaugurate.

Speaking on the 13th August, 1901, I saidI think a different system from the one we. have now, of simply charging so much for business places and so much for the householder, might well be adopted. I do not know what the charge is in Victoria, but in New South Wales, if a person desires to have the telephone laid on to his business house he pays £10 a year, and if to his private house £ 5 a year, irrespective of the extent to which the telephone is used. It seems to me rather absurd that an hotel like the Hotel Australia should pay a rate of ,£10 per annum for a teleHouse that the Government were prepared phone that will probably be working all day and all night, while a business person will have to pay exactly the same amount for a telephone which he may not use for more than half an hour in each day, and that the same anomaly should exist with regard to private houses irrespective of their size. I find that I made a slight mistake when I spoke of business houses having to pav £10 a year in New South Wales. should have been £9. On the 17th November, 1904, I spoke for a considerable time on postal affairs, dealing at length with the toll system. I pointed out that the system was being universally adopted, and gave quotations from America, and various other parts of the world, showing fhe advantages of the toll system over the flat-rate system. On the 22nd Nos'ember, 1905, I asked some quesMr Thomas. tions of the then Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. In his reply, he informed me that the Grand Hotel, Melbourne, was paying ,£18 per annum for two telephones, and that the Hotel Australia, Sydney, was paying £ 3 5 per annum for its telephones; and that the fees paid to operators alone on account of the Grand Hotel, -Melbourne, came to ^40 13s. 9d., and for the Hotel Australia, .£34 14s. 9d. per annum. On the 16th December, 1905, I asked the following question of the Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Eden-MonaroHas the Postmaster-General made up his mind to adopt the toll system of charges, for telephonic services? The reply given wasBoth the toll and flat rate systems are under consideration, and when a decision is arrived at I shall be glad to inform the honourable member. Speaking on the"" Estimates,"" on the 7th November, 1908, when, I think, the honourable member for Maribyrnong was Postmaster General, I raised the question of the telephone system, asking him whether he intended to make the toll system universal! throughout Australia. I pointed out that, under the then system of compelling all new subscribers to come in under the toll system, but permitting those under the flat rate to remain so if they desired, we were acting unfairly. I stated that if we were not prepared to make ihe toll system universal, we should do away with it altogether, and allow those at present under it to come in under the flat rate. I expressed the hope that before the session was over the Minister would be able to inform the to adopt the toll system. Later on, in the same sitting, whilst the Postmaster-General was replying to crificisms upon the Postal Estimates, I again asked him, "" What about the toll system and the flat rate?"" His reply wasThat is too big a question to deal with tonight. I am going to consider the matter. It The honourable member should not expect me to say right off what I am going to do on such a great question. I think that by these quotations I have been able to show that whatever I may have done whilst Postmaster-General, I was not necesEngland, sarily influenced, in proposing to substitute the toll system for the flat rate system, by any pressure brought to bear upon me by officials in the Department. I had spoken several times on this question in the House, as hacl other honourable members, including the honourable member for Gwydir, who also advocated the substitution of the toll system for the flat rate system. A report on the subject had also been obtained by the then Deakin Government from Mr Hesketh, the -electrical engineer, who had been to England and America for the purpose of in-quiring into the matter. very valuable report upon telephonic services. The Government of the day, after the presentation of that report, announced that they intended to make some alterations in the telephone rates. announcement was made, the big users of telephones were up in arms. papers started at once to thunder against any alteration in the charges. There was a very big outcry made by Chambers of Commerce and newspaper proprietors. ment of the day commenced answering some of the objections that were raised to the proposed alteration, by stating that the-charges they were then making were practically lower than the charges levied anywhere -else in the world. Some figures were given to the press at that' time, which showed that the charges in London, Berlin, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other places were -considerably higher than those which prevailed in Australia. One result was that the Argus came out on 13th March, 1906, with -some statements which I feel sure will be heard now with very great pleasure by the honourable member for Darling. The honourable member has always contended that competition does not make things cheaper. He has always insisted that competition means waste, and that its effect is to make 'things clearer rather than cheaper. Argus, in replying to the information supplied at the time by the Department, made this statementIn the United States competition has greatly be dealt with in a different way from that increased the cost of telephoning. 'That is something which will be read with the big user knew that he could repleasure, not only by the honourable member main under the flat rate system there was no for Darling, but also by those who, like necessity for further inquiry; but when I , as -myself, have some leanings towards the Postmaster-General, said that all men, rich theories ancl aims of Socialism.

Here, in Australia, the Postal Department has not got to meet competition. It has a monopoly. There is no necessity for it to spend money on improvements, and it can keep its expenses down to a minimum. I was rather pleased at the time to read that statement in the Argus, which certainly is not a Socialistic paper. After this agitaHe presented a tion had been going on for some time, the then Deakin Government announced that they were not prepared to make it compulsory for any one on the flat rate to come under the toll system. They intended to Immediately that introduce the toll system, but would not make it compulsory for any one on the flat The newsrate to come under that system. They decided, however, that all new subscribers should be given no alternative, and must start under the toll system. Immediately The Governthis was announced, the opposition ceased to a very great extent, because all the big users learned that, if they so desired, they could continue under the flat rate system. A t that time it was not considered necessary for the Deakin Government to make any special inquiry before taking the action they proposed to take. When it was proposed to substitute the toll system for the flat rate system a special inquiry was demanded, but immediately the Government announced that it was to be optional with existing subscribers under the flat rate system to come under the toll system, the agitation for the special inquiry ceased. In the circumstances, I should now like to ask Ministers, why, if they cannot bring all people under the toll system 'to-day without a special inquiry, the previous Deakin Government were able to bring all new subscribers under that system The without such an inquiry? Of course, the reason is obvious, that in dealing with big users the Government were dealing with big men, and with some Governments apparently it is necessary that big users should in which small users are.

I was told by one authority that the difference between the wages paid in Switzerland ancl those paid to our operators is equivalent to a difference of as much as £ 2 in the working of each telephone. With the exception of Sweden ancl Switzerland, there is no place in the world where a network of lines such as there is in each of our main centres of population costs the subscribers as little as ours would have to pay were the rates which I attempted to impose in force. The Birmingham rates come nearest to those. There a ground rent of £ 3 3s. and an extra one penny per call is charged. A Birmingham subscriber who used his instrument on the average only once a day would pay £4. 13s. 3d. annually, and an Australian subscriber, charged the rates of the Fisher Government, would pay £ 4 15s. 2d.; but while the Birmingham subscriber who used his instrument on the average twice a day would pay £ 6 3s. iod., an Australian subscriber .would pay only £ 5 ios. sd. In the newspaper report of an interview with the present Postmaster General, a Mr Alcock, a member of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, is represented as having said that he pays £ 9 a year for the use of the telephone, whereas, were the charges which I endeavoured to impose in force, he would have to pay £ 2 8 ios. a year. If he were a Birmingham subscriber, and used his telephone as much as he does here, he would have to pay £ 6 5 a year for the service. I have asked for exact information on the subject in the following question :Whether it is a fact that a Mr Alcocka member of the Chamber of Commerce, Melbourne-a t a deputation that waited on the Postmaster-General re the telephone rates, made the following statement :"" That he found that on one of the telephones for which he was paying £ 4 ios. per half-year, he would under the new telephone rates (i.e., the Fisher Government . rates) have to pay ^28 ios.""-and to ask(1) If this statement is correct, how many rings per dav of 312 days per year would there ""be? (2) And how much would be paid in wages to the operators alone for attending to these rings? No doubt, the question will be answered directly the motion is disposed of, unless, of course, the Opposition ds fortunate enough to carry it. My question deals with a year of 312 days, because it is not usual for business men to use their office telephones on Sunday. Mr Alcock apparently makes about 50 rings a day, which must cost the Department from £ 1 0 to £ 1 1 in operators' fees alone, although the Government receives only £ 9 from the subscriber. cost must be a very complicated one. on the strength of figures supplied to me, not when I was Postmaster-General, but when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro held that office, and I asked for certain information regarding the expense of attending to the telephone at the Grand Hotel, Melbourne. ness of those figures, in the light of subsequent investigations. tion cannot be spoken of as an unfair one. I do not profess to be a business man, though I understand that we have now a Ministry composed of business men. is a business man. administration is now to be carried on strictly on. business lines, though it seems to be necessary to make a special investigation to ascertain whether a service for which the Government receives only £ i S , and on which it expends £40, is to be regarded as profitable. In Mr Alcock's case the Government receives £ 9 and spends £ 1 0 or £ 1 1 in giving the service. I have also asked a question as to the number of. rings made. by the Argus office. I might have asked for similar information regarding the Age, but I did not wish my questions to be too long, and no doubt what will apply to one office will apply to the other. member discriminates because the Age is more favourably disposed towards him than i's the Argus. may gather what I think of the two newspapers when I say that it is the Argus which is delivered at my house every morning. It will be found, when the information which I require is supplied, that the telephone service given to .the Argus costs in operators' fees more than the newspaper's proprietors pay for it. The Government rightly objects to telephones leased under the flat rate being used by any but the subscribers themselves, or on their business.

If the Department knows that a non-subscriber is using such a telephone, it has the right to disconnect it. There has, of course, been great abuse in this matter, but the rule, in my opinion, is a fair one. If a subscriber on the flat-rate system allows a non-subscriber to use his telephone, and charges for the ring, he ought to be summoned and punished. To some extent the late Government introduced the toll system, which meant that, for a fee of £ 5 , the subscriber could have 2,000 rings, with a subsequent charge of Jd. a ring. In this connection the following is a question which I placed on the notice-paper: [1) Whether it is a fact that under the telephone charges of the previous Deakin Government a subscriber can have a toll telephone for £ 5 per 4mnum with 2,000 free rings? '(a) Iff so, is a subscriber permitted to allow free rings is that, as they cannot use the a non-subscriber to use any of those free rings and charge the non-subscriber for doing so? I wrote a letter to the Postmaster-General this morning, informing him that I intended -to speak to-day, and asking him whether -he would be good enough to answer the question I have read. -General has been courteous enough to send irne a reply, and in each case that answer is ""Yes."" I should like to point out what this means. We have now had for some time a system under which a person, for £ 5 P year, is permitted to have 2,000 er calls, and he may allow non-subscribers to use the telephone at a charge of i d . per ring. Does it appear necessary to have a special Committee of Inquiry to investigate an anomaly of this kind, under which -the subscriber pays £ 5 per annum, for his -telephone, and may charge £ 8 6s. 8""d. for ;the use of it?

Department ? develop business. people, are liable to make mistakes; and in the case of the Department it is necessary lo cloak the mistake up. However, I have too much respect for the Postmaster-General to think that he is seriously prepared to defend so idiotic an arrangement. What happens with the subscribers who have 2,000 telephone themselves, they place the machines at the disposal of their friends. I have been told of a lady, who had a telephone installed simply in order to be in touch with a doctor, on account of a sick child; and as she had to pay for the 2,000 rings, whether she used the telephone or not, she The Postmasterplaced it at the disposal of a friend. I was at dinner with a lady friend a little while ago, and I was told that the little girl of my hostess, immediately she got out of school, went wth her friend, Florrie, and rung up all the friends they knew. Of course, from a departmental point of view, it does not matter whether the rings are on business.or pleasure, so long as they are paid for. Mr Alcock stated that under the regulation of the late Government, he would have to pay £ 2 8 10s., instead of £ 9 , under the old regulation; but, if the matter be worked' out, I think it will be found that, under the Chapman rate, Mr JOHN QUICK -The subscriber may Alcock would have to pay rfrom £ 2 2 to £ 2 3 per year.

The honourable member may have made the statement which I previously quoted without consulting his masters-the newspapers and the Treasurer. of the toll system, if it has not been, will have to be accepted. The people will see that it is. Whether the newspapers suppress these facts or not, they will be brought out on the public platform. The end may be' delayed for a little while, but the flat rate is doomed in Australia. I take it that the Government have appointed the Committee of Inquiry with the legitimate object of having a report made to the House. Then, having accepted the principle of the toll system, and thrown overboard the flat rate, where was the -necessity to suspend what the Fisher Government did ? ' The Prime Minister has told the House that the Government hope to have a report from the Committee within three months. If the report is presented in that time, we shall know within three months whether the Government intend to alter the rates which I introduced. much, as will be obvious to anybody who has studied the figures in connection with the telephone business. The Government I have no might well explain now why they suspended the Fisher rates. Under the system which we introduced, no one would have to pay more than £ 2 for the first half-year. Under the existing systems every man who has a telephone in the big centres of population, must pay more than £ 2 for the first half-year. If under the old flat rate he would pay AmI not right in saying that the £ 4 . ios., and' if under the Chapman arrangement, £ 2 ios. I admit that under our proposal, as there would be no free calls, It he might have to pay a good deal more than £ 2 during the second six months. Buti f the Government are sincere in asking for a report, and really mean business-if it is not merely a device to gain time-the y could find out within six months whether the rates we proposed were too high or too low. If they were too high, the matter could be rectified in fhe payments that would have to be made in the second six months. For that reason there was no necessity to suspend the rates we introduced. Some people regard a ground rent of £ 4 as exorbitant. If that was found to be so, it could have been allowed for in the second six months. The officers of the Department presented me with a statement showing that the capital The honourable memcharge for each telephone, covering the cost of conducting the exchange, and giving a complete service, including switchboards, cables, & c , was at least _ £ 3 9 . Those figures may be wrong, and I sincerely hope that the report will show that they are toohigh. But, on comparing them with figures The principle presented to me in relation to other countries, I found that £ 3 9 was not an unfairly high estimate. I have no objection to the Committee being appointed, and in fact I promised the commercial classes that while I was Postmaster-General a f u l l account would be given. It is only right and fair that it should be given. The Committeemust bring in one of three reports. They may report that the Fisher Government's charges were not exorbitant, but fair, just, and equitable. If they do, that will be a personal triumph to myself and the Government of which I was a member. They may report that the charges were too low, and if they do there will be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth among, at least, some of those who have been agitating.'

Thus the Government lost tens of thousands of pounds without calling upon the big users of the Telephone Service to make up the deficiency. If , prior to Federation, the service was a paying one, the loss sustained by the Department as the result of subscribers like Mr Alcock, making perhaps one hundred calls a day, had to be made tip by the small users of the telephone, who might perhaps make only nine calls per day. ' Now, however, if the service is not a paying one the general taxpayer has to make good the deficiency occasioned by the large users of the telephone. The Postmaster-General should have been prepared to tackle the anomalies which I have pointed out quicker than he has done. ber had six months of Ministerial office in which to effect these reforms, whereas the present Postmaster-General has had only one month. ber for Bendigo had continued the rates which I introduced, no subscriber for six months would have had to pay more than £2. have been made into the matter, and at its end the charges might have been readjusted had the adoption of the course been found to be necessary. Surelyi t is a sound principle that people should be called upon to pay the Statei n proportion to the services which it renders them. Personally, I entertain no objection to the appointment of a Committee of Accountants to determine what rates it will be necessary to charge in order to make the Department a paying one. , 1 shall not allow the Postmaster-General to forget that such a committee has been appointed, and if within three months it has not reported, I shall want to know what has become of it. I welcome its appointment, because I believe that the result of its inquiry will be the abolition of the flat rate and the general application of the toll system, although I realize that, if only for the sake of appearance, some alterations will be made in the rates that were chargeable under the regulation which I framed, even though those alterations are not of a vital character. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo-Post master General) [6.25] I think that under the special circumstances of the .case my predecessor in office had a perfect right to ventilate the subject of the telephone rates even to the extent that he has done this afternoon. I can assure him that the task of considering and advising the Executive to suspend his regulation was a very disagreeable one to me. But he must recognise that the Gazette notice which contained it invited the commercial public to lodge objections to the proposed increase of the telephone charges if they entertained any. Consequently he can scarcely complain if private individuals,as well as the commercial people of Australia, accepted his invitation and inundated the Postmaster General's Department with objections. When I assumed control of the Department the office was filled with complaints, and a regular storm of indignation was raging. must have been received within twenty-four hours after I quitted office. Sir JOHN QUICK I found a long list of objections awaiting me upon the very day that I took office, and those objections continued to accumulate. I believe that if the honourable member for Barrier had seen If the honourable memthe accumulated protests, founded upon commercial and financial grounds, he might have recognised the necessity of re-considering some of his proposals. The honourable During that time f u l l inquiry might member has expressed his approval of the appointment of an actuarial committee to determine what rates it will be necessary to charge to make the Telephone Service a remunerative one. But I wish to point out to him that he made a mistake in framing his regulation first, and approving of an inquiry into it afterwards. ' My policy is first to appoint the committee to ascertain the grounds, the data, and the principles upon which a new regulation can be framed. It was not wise to frame a regulation first and to subsequently hold an inquiry into the rates which it imposed. I am sure that if my honourable friend had had an opportunity of appointing a committee to inquire into this most complicated question, he would not have assumed the very great responsibility of passing the regulation which he dida regulation which provoked a storm of indignation throughout the Commonwealth. monwealth. The objections to it were confined to Melbourne. Sir JOHN QUICK I can assure my honourable friend that objections to it poured in from all the States, with the exception of Western Australia.

I think that the honourable member would have saved himself and the Department a lot of trouble had he seen his way clear to have followed the clearly expressed advice of the late chairman of the Postal Commission. In a report which he forwarded to the Governor General on the occasion of his resignation from that office, the honourable member for Bourke recommended the appointment of a committee to investigate the question of the telephone rates which should be charged, with a view to making the service a payable one. the Commission? Sir JOHN QUICK of the retiring chairman of the Commission. who was backing down from doing what he ought to have done. who had been chairman of the Commission for a considerable time, the recommendation of the honourable member for Bourke in favour of the appointment of a Committee of Accountants was entitled to considerable weight. Sitting the Chair being one for going into Committee of Supply, I have hardly time, and this is not a fitting opportunity to do justice, either to myself in reply to the honourable member for Barrier, or to the subject. It would take a considerable time to go over the whole of the ground that he has covered, as well as to use the materials which I have in readiness to vindicate my own attitude! and to explain the reasons why the regulations in question were suspended. deal of explanation. hardly a fitting opportunity, and it would ill become me as Postmaster-General to take up much time, and prevent Mr Speaker from leaving the chair. . which the honourable gentleman has received ? Sir JOHN QUICK I intended to make that my opening observation. The honourable member, having been Postmaster General himself, will appreciate the force of what I say. Inasmuch as my predecessor in office has admitted that a Committee of inquiry was necessary, he has practically acknowledged the overwhelming force of the argument in favour of the suspension of the regulations. jection to the Committee. Sir JOHN QUICK It would be an absolute mistake to impose regulations levying heavy charges, amounting in some cases to taxation, on subscribers whilst making inquiries as to the justice of those charges. admits that there are anomalies. But as long as the fat man is greased, it is all right. Sir JOHN QUICK It is admitted that there are anomalies in the regulations. TheI t was the report honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when Postmaster-General, admitted that long ago. It was the report of a man He tried to solve the problem, but found it to be very difficult indeed. My honourable friend the member for Barrier, also attempted to solve the problem, but found that it was a very difficult one to solve in a satisfactory manner. The only solution, and the proper one, is that of which he now admits the propriety. The course that I have adopted is confirmed by the recommendation of the officer, Mr Hesketh, upon whose advice, no suspended from 6.30 to 7-45 doubt, the honourable member, when in office, based his regulations. Mr Hesketh, after I had discussed this matter with him fairly and squarely, for two or three days in the Department, going over the whole of the ground, and examining the regulations which had been framed, frankly admitted that the problem was one which should be investigated by a Committee. Having regard to the great diversity in the cost of construction, and the lack of uniformity as to the method of apportioning the expenses of the various telephone systems, he It would require a good recommended that a Committee should be appointed to inquire into the charges, of whatever nature, relating to the telephone branch of the Department, under their several headings, and also the basis on which the charges for services should be determined.

Mr Hesketh, while standing by his previous opinion as to the cost of working the telephone service, admitted that it was a matter for inquiry by experts. I may tell the honourable member that the reason why a partial system was not adopted, and the flat-raters brought under the toll system by a modified regulation, was that if they had all been brought under the Chapman regulations, which admitted of 2,000 odd free calls per annum, there would have been a great loss of revenue, because, as between the flat-rate system and 'the toll system, the flat-rate subscribers were the most profitable subscribers of the Department.

They are in a sufficiently bad tangle already, and if any one of them were to set about doing things he would disorganize the whole team. honourable members, I protest against the demand for two months' Supply. As a matter of fact, I object entirely to the practice of introducing Supply Bills. As no reason, so far, has been given by the Government for demanding two months' Supply, I propose to give one. It is that the Government require time to consider the financial problem. They are such a mixed team, and there aVe so many differences of opinion amongst them that it is necessary for the Treasurer to conaltogether if Federal members for the dissult the State Rights party, and there has not been time to call them together. As the Government tell us nothing, we must obtain information where we can. A time limit appears to be imposed upon members of the Government who desire to speak. We saw that just now when the Postmaster-General was so evidently called off, lest he should make some mistake. The honourable gentleman strayed away in his own electorate and let out something about a £2,000,000 loan, and he had to make an explanation the next day, He hacl to apologize and explain that he did not mean what he said. If the honourable gentleman hacl not been called off on this occasion we might have learned a little more from him. I am watching affairs, and I .hope that we shall know something of the policy of the Government in two or three months' time. It is clear that it would be no trouble to the Treasurer to prepare a Budget statement. What is worrying the right honourable gentleman is that he must consult the outside people who are ruling him. In other matters of policy the Government must consult outside bodies, but in the matter of finance consideration must be had for the amount to be returned to the States and whether it is advisable to continue the Bradhandled the funds of the State, and he don section. The Government appear to be absolutely sure that they have a majority ancl intend to take their time, no matter what we may sav. introduction of Supply Bills, the present Government is only worse than previous Governments, and seeing the elements of which it is composed honourable members could not have expected anything else. Every Government that has yet held, office in the Commonwealth has been guilty of the practice of depending upon Supply Bills. Delay in the delivery of fhe Budget has a serious effect in connection with the construction of public works. For instance, a lengthy dewhich must be passed before the works can be undertaken. If it is desired to erect a new building, after the Works Estimates are In common with other passed, the Department concerned sets out to look for a block of land on which to erect the building. Negotiations for its purchase involve delay. When it is secured there is delay caused by the State Public Works Department, upon which we must depend to get our business done. It is the practice of the Works Departments of the various States to make Commonwealth business second to State business, and they would forget the Commonwealth business tricts interested did not stir up the Home Affairs Department, and get that Department in turn to stir up the States Public Works Department. It is possible that after a delay of six months, specifications may be prepared for the building. Then tenders are called for. Very often there is found to be something the matter with the tenders, and fresh tenders have to be called for. So there is further delay, and the financial year expires before the work can be undertaken, and it must then be delayed until a new Budget is submitted, and fresh Estimates are passed in August, September, or October. However, the present Government claims to have brought in the millenium politically in having secured responsible government for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. We might have expected, in the circumstances, that they would have proceeded on model lines. But they do not seem to have yet awakened to the stupidity of postponing the Budget and the Works Estimates, until the end of August. The Treasurer is a man of vast experience, who ran affairs in Western Australia for a great many years, and as Treasurer of that State, should be able to set a good example in the Commonwealth.

This afternoon the honourable member for Dalley pointed out that two months' Supply represents one-sixth of the total appropriations for the year. Why does the Treasurer ask for two months' Supply when one-half of that amount would be sufficient to enable him to carry on ? On some occasions the larger part of the money has been expended before the consideration of the Estimates has been reached. The late introduction of the Estimates has been the cause of many works and buildings not being proceeded with within the financial year. I ' do not know whether it was done designedly or not, but during the last financial year many works which should have been proceeded with in my electorate were neglected. that ? surer was to blame for not bringing down the Works Estimates in time to allow tenders to be called within the financial year.

If the Government intends to borrow, why do-not Ministers announce that policy? wait for Gympie. an announcement from Gympie sooner than he expects.

Now Ministers ask for two months' Supply, which is too much. The Treasurers of the States are anxious to know in what position they stand. statements until they know how they will be treated by the Commonwealth, and we have been told by the Treasurer that his Budget speech will not be delivered until towards the end of August, which, of course, will mean the end of August. tember. of the Budget will delay the preparation of the financial statements of the Treasurers of the States, a delay which has continually occurred in the past, ancl about which there has been great complaint for a number of years. I was surprised to read in Saturday evening's newspaper that the Commonwealth old-age pensions are to be paid in Victoria and Queensland on the 15th July, and in Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, on the 29th July. As Australia is now federated, whatever is done should be done on the Federal principle. All the States should be treated going to alike. If pensions are not to be paid until the 29th July in the three States which I have named, the other two States should not be treated differently. If the officials who have had charge of this matter for the last twelve months are not capable of making arrangements for paying pensions in accordance with the decision of Parliament, they should make way for others who will l>e able to do so. It is a long time since the pensions application papers were sent out in Tasmania. There the old people have been looking forward to getting their few shillings, to which they are more entitled than we are to the remuneration r which, as members of Parliament, we receive each month.

I will defer Sir JOHN FORREST I do not think that there is anything singular or new in asking for temporary Supply. Honourable members opposite are just as much bound to give it as we are to ask for it . It is not a party matter. Money must be voted to carry on the public service. I feel under no personal obligation to any one on this side of the House, or on that, when Supply is asked for. It is our public duty to see that the public service is carried on, and that public obligations are provided for. Therefore, all this trouble-excep t in regard to the expression of opinion as to whether Supply should be granted for one month or two-is beside the point.

The right honourable gentleman has told us that everything is very well in the Treasury, and that nothing is unusual outside it j that the affairs of this Government in general, and in regard to finance in particular, are, now that he is in office, and presiding over the Treasury, not only beyond suspicion, but beyond criticism. It is a little unfortunate, however, that the purpose for which this fusion was chieflv constructed Sir JOHN member has fusion on the brain ! .it in the pocket!

But the Prime Minister, if you remember, Mr Speaker, in most of those speeches which he made upon various subjects, and upon various sides of those subjects, during the recess, dwelt, towards the being a perfectly clear and obvious thing latter end of the campaign-so far as I that it is so, what are we to say of the degather, the matter did not strike him during liberate statement made by the present Prime the earlier portion-upo n the necessity and Minister, wbich, as the right honourable the urgency of the earnest consideration of the Treasurer said in reference to an interjection financial position of the country.

It has, however, been made abundmeasure. We had, in common with the antly clear to the House, and the country, Deakin Government, suffered some amount of that during the regime of the Fisher Govobloquy in supporting what is known as the ernment, before it, and since, there never Surplus Revenue Act, which was the basis has been any moment at which the provision of our old-age'pensions system, and is now the source from which the pensions are in the main to be paid.

It was done, no doubt, with a deliberate object. What that object was is perfectly clear. It was intended to create in the minds of the electors of this country the impression that the policy which was to come into force on the ist July, and as to which the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay, had declared most emphatically that whatever came or went old-age pensions would be paid from the first of that month, was in danger.

417,Mr Hughes,"The greater is thethings there must be something alarmingly wrong, because if it were not so there would not be such a wide discrepancy between the rates in these other places and our rates. Although in very many countries^I think in nearly all except Germany -the telephones are run by private companies, yet, as a matter of fact, unless they are getting such extortionate profits as to formulate a condemnation of private enterprise, which I submit the Minister and hi? colleagues are not quite ready to do, his figures stand condemned. Every country in the world where private enterprise is running a telephone system charges four times as much as our Department propose to charge under the business-like system suggested by my late colleague. While the Postmaster-General has the right to make all these inquiries and every calculation that he can to check this departure, which I , of course, admit very freely is open to argument, as everything of that nature must be, yet I venture to say that the representatives of the commercial community who waited on the honourable gentleman and insisted upon a reversion to the old systemI refer to the Chamber of Commerce-ar e singularly happy in the fact that such a Ministry as this is in office. Had we been in office and a trade union had waited upon us and suggested that we should do something to establish a service on a non-paying basis, I do not believe that there would have been sufficient black type in the possession of the daily press to express their horror and condemnation of our dastardly conduct. But the Chamber of Commerce can wait upon the Postmaster-General, make a suggestion to him, and insist upon its being carried out. It may be' only a coincidence that it is carried out. I say nothing at all about that. office, I asked the honourable member forBarrier to suspend the regulation. digo Chamber of Commerce had asked him to do so.

If the honourable gentleman did something before the depusaid that the other day. tation came to see him, and he is doing it now; if, in short, at two intervals widely anything of the sort. separated he is of the same opinion, I would ask him a question : Since he told what the honourable member for Kennedy his constituents that he would give the late Government a fair show, why does he say something different now? Government a fair show. DidI not help them to get into recess? deal with the honourable gentleman in a logical, and, as I thought, perfectly fair way, and to demand from him some sensible and logical reply; but I find that I cannot get it. This is the first time. I have ever heard it seriously argued that the State should do something for less than cost price. What business firm can afford to do that, except, of course, for the purpose of getting more business ? A man can do it on a side line; but if it is his main business, as the telephones are in the Government service, on which we are employing thousands of persons, and in which we have invested millions of pounds, we cannot afford to do it merely because a Chamber of Commerce waits upon us and asks for something. We must insist that the subscribers shall nay at least the cost of the service, and a fair return on the capital invested. That is only a fair business proposition, and although I am a Socialist, I still do insist upon plain business like methods being introduced into everything, into politics even. If a greater network of lines means a greater charge, I ask the Minister why the rate in Adelaide is £10, and in Melbourne ancl Sydney only £9? the old State laws. man has gone back to the old system.

The other morning the honourable member .for Corio, who formerly was never suspected of the least humour, became a regular 'comic opera. Not only has the party become humorous, it has also become numerous. Gentlemen who, when they supported the last Deakin Government, did not constitute a majority, now are a They know majority.

On the 13th August three months' Supply, amounting to ,£1,003,744, was asked for, of which the Treasurer's Advance covered £^20,000. On the 8th November Supply amounting to £787,000 was asked for to cover two months. the Tariff. sion the Treasurer's Advance amounted to ,£50,000. On the 19th November another Supply Bill providing for the sum of .£704,000 was passed, and the Treasurer's Advance on that occasion was ,£25,000. Thus in 1907 four Supply Bills, covering the sums I have named, were passed. In 1908 there were three Supply Bills, one, on the 7th March, for .£760,000; one, on the' 10th June, for £1,412,000, including the whole of the Treasurer's Advancea sum of ,£200,000-and one on the 14th October. As to the complaint in regard to the amount proposed to be voted in respect of the Treasurer's Advance, I would point out that ,£30,000 is required for the Postal Subsidy, and £28,000 is due on the ist July to the Western Australian Government, who will remit the money to London on behalf of the Commonwealth. Then, again, weekly wages for men employed on day labour have to be paid, and the Treasurer has no money whatever for the purpose. cover that. am speaking more particularly of the Treasurer's Advance. agreed to the Treasurer will have ,£50,000 in his Advance account. be sufficient to cover the items I have already specified. Then, again, special pay for the squadron has to be provided whenever asked for, and mail contractors and others have to be paid. We have to make progress payments on contracts, petty cash payments, and payments in respect of new works and buildings, including telegraph and telephone construction, tunnels now being proceeded with, and buildings under contract and in course of construction. A sum of ,£80,000 will be required for two months in respect of these works. The advance for naval pay and Government printing will come to another ,£12,000, and it is estimated that during the two months under review we shall require the whole of the proposed vote of ,£100,000 to meet liabilities that will fall due. It is solely as a matter of convenience that we ask for two months', instead of one month's Supply. The Government do not wish to take advantage of the House by obtaining two months' Supply, but we know that busy times are ahead of us. No one knows how long it will take to dispose of the three motions that are before the House, and it would be unprofitable and unnecessary to interpose another Supply Bill during their consideration I see no reason why two months' Supply should not be granted, or why exception should be taken to the Bill since it provides merely for the ordinary services of the year. It covers nothing that has not already been vcted in this House in previous years. It provides merely for an interim Supply, and is based on votes passed by this House last year. The Treasurer's Advance of £100,000 is the only item which will be used for new works and services, and. even those are services for which votes were passed on existing estimates, but will lapse with the close of the financial year, to-morrow. The only reason I can assign for the disposition shown by some honourable' members not to grant two months' Supply is that they think that the Government is trying to gain some advantage. I fail to see what advantage we can secure. So far as the position of the Government is concerned, there is no reason why we should not ask for one month's, rather than for two months', Supply. We consider, however, that it will be more convenient, having regard to all the circumstances, to ask for two months' Supply. Honourable members may discuss any matter the amendment be they please on this Bill, and before we dispose of the Address-in-Reply and the no confidence motion another month will be",61,Forrest Th E Honourable Was A Deliberate Criticism Aimed At The Very

I did not anticipate that exception would be taken to the B ill . We are adopting the usual procedure. If we were asking for something that had not already been voted upon during a previous session, there might be some cause for complaint. TheB ill , however, has been carefully framed by the Treasury. It contains nothing to which honourable members have not assented on previous occasions, and to which they will assent and will have to assent as part of the expenditure is necessary for the public administration of the Commonwealth. I , therefore, ask honourable members to pass the Bill as it stands. There, is nothing in the records of Parliament showing that two months' Supply has been asked for in like circumstances. The only other point I wish to emphasize is that the reason three months' Supply was granted last year was to allow an international courtesy to be paid to the visiting American Fleet. There seems to. be a singular desire on the part of the Opposition to take a vote upon this question. Government. Leader of the Opposition desires that I should not make any remarks upon this occasion ? surer were accurate as far as they went, but I scarcely think they met the objection which I outlined this afternoon in all friendliness to the Government. The feeling which I entertain in regard to the practice of granting temporary Supply from time to time is not a new one. I am convinced that unless we deal with the Estimates at the beginning of the financial year so as to insure that the money which we vote shal 1 be expended during that year, the Departments will have no opportunity whatever of basing their new Estimates upon the expenditure of the previous year but will be compelled to base them merely upon the Estimates for that year. This is a very serious matter from the stand-point of the finances of the country. I know that in one Department there are numerous directions in iwhich economies might be effected, but those economies are rendered impossible because of the practice which has grown up of granting temporary Supply from time to time, and of dealing with the Estimates only towards the close of the session. I sincerely hope that the Treasurer will see his way to overcome this difficulty at an early date. His main justification for his present action is that he is following precedent. But I may say at once that it is a precedent to which a number of honourable members, including myself, have always objected. member has been one of the worse offenders. honourable member. member is a grade lower than the knight whom he has been attacking. In his political contortions he reminds me of nothing so much as the definition which a lady gave of a line-""somethin g of indefinite length lying consistently between two extremes."" The view which I have urged upon the Ministry in all friendliness is one which I hope they will consider in order to avoid the possibility of alienating support upon occasions of this kind. I hope that this is the last time that Ministers will ask for Supply for more than one month. It is rather a pity that a Supply Bill should have to be interposed in the D o I understand that the midst of a no-confidence debate, and in view of these special circumstances, I think that the Government might well have asked for only one month's Supply.

I hope that the bad habit of passing temporary Supply Bills, which has been largely fostered by the action of the honourable member for Hume when he was in office, will be discouraged. Independent of any procedure that may have been adopted in the past, the Opposition certainly cannot accuse the Government of .being dishonest, even if they secure a grant of more money than they require at the moment. There are numerous works in progress throughout Australia, and it is absolutely necessary that any body of men charged with administering the affairs of a country like this, should be able to see more than one month ahead of them.

To-day we heard the late Postmaster-General talking -about how many telephone rings there are .daily in one place and how many in another, but he did not tell us what it costs to run a withdraw and apologise. telephone in Melbourne, or in Sydney, or Adelaide.

But I wish to ever learn how to conduct a Department by worrying the employees? The honourable member for Gwydir, has been good enough to throw a few remarks at me across the chamber, because I ventured to ask what was the cost of the inquiry that is now proceeding into the administration of the Postal Department. As I said then, I and other honourable members are determined to find out the cost. At the time when the Royal Commission was appointed, I am sure that no honourable member expected that it was intended to -harass and worry the telephone employees. It was intended to have a proper inquiry into the working of the Department, and to obtain a report which would be of some value to Parliament. Some months ago I mentioned the work done by the Keep Commission in America. We hoped to obtain something of that kind here. If the Commission would find out where leakages occurred, they would do some sort of good, but they will do no good by-worrying the telephone girls and officials.

520,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Prime Minbeen able to follow this debate, and that is the reason why two months' Supply is asked for. Independently of the precedents and illustrations already given, and of the immediate necessities of current contracts, it is because on no other occasion in the history of the Commonwealth has there been a Budget associated with questions of such importance, or with a variety of financial changes of such immense magnitude, as those which we have to face in a couple of months. The Government were faced with the alternative of coming down with a request for one rnonth's Supply, and then again before the Budget could be prepared for another month's Supply, or of submitting a proposal for two months' Supply at the present time. Not that the Budget will be postponed a day longer than is necessary. On the contrary, it will be submitted at the earliest possible date. It may be submitted by the middle of August. In fact that was the date which the Treasurer rose to mention ; but it was pointed out to him, that for precautionary reasons, he had better indicate that while the Budget would be brought forward as soon as possible, it might not be so soon as the middle of August, although it will be even earlier, if possible. What we have to face first is the payment of the old-age pensions, for which object we must look not only at the current six months, for which we have either a sufficient sum or a very large proportion of that sum; but recollect that Budget proposals must allow for the provision of at least as much more, and probably a larger amount than the existing trust fund, now amounting to barely £700,000. Despite the fact that the Surplus Revenue Act has enabled us to put aside, say, one-half-probabl y it will be less-of the total, no previous Treasurer of the Commonwealth has been faced with the responsibility of finding any such new sum within the Commonwealth fourth. ter advised me what to do. year the Commonwealth has been faced an absolute misstatement.

I am not going to be hoodwinked. are aware of the anxiety that has been felt in order to set aside tbe sum necessary for the payment of old-age pensions We have yet to be assured of finding this sum and sufficient income for the present year from the ordinary sources. With that uncertainty before us, I think that honourable members, on consideration, will see that the seriousness of the question raised by the payment of old-age pensions during the next eighteen months has not been in the least degree overstated. It is a very serious contingency, which requires to be provided for. Nor does it stand alone. In addition to that, in the present circumstances, not only of Australia, but in the present circumstances of international relations, it will be necessary for the Government to consider what sums of expenditure will be required during the twelve months, in order to make more adequate provision for the defence of Australia-nava l and military. This constitutes a very serious demand upon the public purse, for which provision will have to be made. In addition, we are faced, in the Post and Telegraph Department, as well as elsewhere-bu t particularly in that Department-wit h instruments which have become due for replacement, and demands for more effective appliances, involving larger expenditure for the improvement of the Department than has been contemplated in any year since Federation.

What is proposed is that during some period which will examination of the financial relations * with a view to a permanent settlement, there shall be a the Customs and Excise revenue other than that provided for by what is popularly known as the Braddon section, with, perhaps, some other serious financial conditions attached to it . is what is the matter. to be dealt with in that Budget of the Treasurer, 'which is due before the close of August. gentleman intends inviting the States Premiers to another Conference. stances, the three great demands for old age pensions, the Post Office, and for defence, taken together with a reconsideration of the whole of the financial arrangements Budgets of every year have absolutely depended-whic h it is proposed to recast in a new form, for a few years, preluding a still further departure-thes e must, I think, satisfy honourable members that the Budget about to be submitted has not. had, and could not have had, anyparallel in the history of the Commonwealth up to this date. to be submitted will be of an extent and a gravitv demanding the closest consideration, first of the Government, and then of this House.

For making it at this time of the year I have given strong and convincing reasons. The necessity . for obtaining an opportunity of f u l l y and closely considering these proposals before we submit them to the House is the heaviest task that rests upon the Government to-day. As the Leader of the Opposition reminded the Committee, I have often pointed out that this must be practically a financial session. Every subject to be dealt with will, of allow of an exhaustive course, affect finance, but on this particular occasion these great demands are related in quite an exceptional way. If new division of there has been no precedent of this kind at the commencement of any preceding session, it is because at the commencement of no preceding session have we been called upon to face problems approaching in magnitude, and complexity the problems with which we are confronted to-day.

He succumbed to the importunities of some of the officials, and agreed to certain expenditure before I became Treasurer.

My intention was to call attention to the impertinence of the honourable member for Hume, and I think it is time some notice was taken of it. impertinent remarks, if they were uttered; but at the time there was a good deal of noise. If they were uttered, the Minister of Defence had a proper course to follow. He should have called my attention to them, and I would have called upon the honourable member for Hume to withdraw them. Apparently the Minister preferred to take another course, and went even further, for in his second explanation he took up the position that I was deliberately allowing the honourable member for Hume to say certain things that I knew he had no right to say. If the honourable member disclaims that, I must accept his explanation. There is, however, a proper course to take in these matters, and I hope honourable members will take it. While I occupy the position of Chairman, if I feel that I cannot honestly carry out my duties, I hope I shall have sufficient manliness to resign. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I did not think I said anything that offended against the ordinary rules of debate, and I must be excused if I speak hotly when I feel as strongly as I do upon the speech made by the Prime Minister to-night-the most extraordinary that I ever listened to, knowing what I do of his past determination, and of his agreement to do things that I wanted done. If I have said anything that goes beyond the limits of orderly debate, I am willing to withdraw it at your instance, or even without it. I have dealt with defence and old-age pensions as touched upon by the Prime Minister. wish now to say that the Post and Telegraph Department could be conducted and made efficient, to the satisfaction of honourable members and the people, without the borrowing of money, if we could only get a Ministry who would stand up for their own rights and keep their own money. We want no borrowing, and I do not think that the country will allow it. lot more. cut off from communication with the outside world. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -If we had kept the money we had in the past we could do it. I know that more work is necessary to be done. No one' knew it better than I did when Treasurer, and no one was in a falser position than I was when I had not the money required to do it. We have not reached 1910, but we are getting closer to it, and the closer we get to it the further off appears the settlement of the question of what money we can command. The honourable member said that the dealings between the Commonwealth and States required considerable time and serious consideration, and that is the gist of the whole thing. We are approaching the 1910 period, when we ought to have money to carry on all our Departments. In New South Wales, the year before I left office there, I financed the whole of the Departments for a little over .£9,000,000, including the Defence, Post and Telegraph, and Customs Departments. Yet last year New South Wales spent ..£ 15,000,000 in doing the work I did for a little over ,£9,000,000. Where did that money come from? It came from the Federal Treasury. I silenced those who were carping at the Commonwealth and charging it with extravagance in a speech I made in Sydney. They have never held up their heads since, because they cannot refute my figures. WhatI intend to fight for is a definite arrangement to be come to at once, or not later than 1910, between the Commonwealth and the States. The settlement suggested to the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne, primarily by my then chief, the honourable member for Ballarat, and supported by myself, was based upon the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, and other valuable schemes on record in the Treasury.' It was the Prime Minister who converted me then, if conversion were required, to the view that the I State and Commonwealthfinancesmust be kept separate if we are to have harmony. He urged upon that Conference more strongly and lucidly than I could hope to do it, that that must be the groundwork of any agreement. We offered to take over the whole of the State debts, to give the States at once £6,000,000 per annum, and to allow the remaining two millions and some hundreds of thousands of interest-the interest bill being some hundreds of thousands Many of my constituents are over eight millions-to remain for five years. At the end of that period a commencement was to be made to pay that off at the rate of one-thirtieth per year for thirty years. We were to pay one-thirtieth off every year for thirty years, and take the whole responsibility as a Commonwealth, and pay off",70,Forrest Th E Honourable Was A Deliberate Criticism Aimed At The Very

It appears to me to be mere hypocrisy to talk of bringing the Postmaster-General's Department up to date, to pay old-age pensions, to take over the Northern Territory, and to connect the Eastern States with Western Australia by means of a transcontinental railway, unless we adopt a financial scheme very different from any that has yet been propounded in this House. With the approach of 1910 there is a possibility of doing something to alter this state of affairs, but in the Minisany proposals that we may make in this terial statement submitted iby the Prime Minister, there is an indication that the existing arrangement is to be continued for an indefinite period. did not say that the same arrangement would be continued.

Prime Minister's statement mean? emphatically in his statement of the Ministerial policy. to have an interim arrangement a continuation of the Braddon section, in, perhaps, some modified form-for five years. I speak to-night, not as a party man, but as one who feels that the great question to [20] be faced in this Legislature is not whether we should have the toll system or the flat rate in connection with our telephone service, but whether this Parliament, as opposed to the Parliaments of the States, is to be supreme. Is the Commonwealth Government to go, cap in hand, to the State Treasurers, and to ask them how much we may retain of the revenue that we collect, and what we are to do in regard to our financial proposals? Are we to go to them, cap in hand, before we dare to step out on new lines ? Are we to consult, and actually submit first of all to the State Parliaments, and the Treasurers of the States, regard? That would be a most undignified position for this Parliament to occupy. I care not, except in so far as administrative matters are concerned, who are on the Treasury bench; but the Parliament should speak with one voice as to what shall be our financial relations with the States. No one knows better than do honourable members opposite that at the end of 1910 the Braddon section must be abolished, and some new arrangement made. I repeat that it is little short of hypocrisy to talk of taking over the Northern Territory, of constructing the transcontinental railway, or of bringing the Postmaster-General's"" Department up to date, unless we can build on a solid financial Basis, without having to go to the States. WhatI fear is that honourable members forming the Coalition party have sold the birth right of this Parliament to the State Parliaments. grave danger that at the next general elec-. tion the combination on the Government benches will try to placate the State Parliaments, and so make their return sure by selling the birth right of the Commonwealth.

What has this Parliament done already in the matter of old-age pensions? It has relieved three States of their liability to pay these pensions ? It has also shouldered the obligation of the three remaining States to grant such pensions. Then is it too much to ask that the States shall grant to this Parliament the full amount necessary to enable it to pay these pensions? that. tain conditions. I say that the States ought not to hesitate a moment, but ought to grant to this Parliament out of their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue a sufficient sum with which to pay old-age pensions. I cannot understand their attitude upon this question. They declare that they must have three-fifths of the Customs and Excise revenue returned to them, and they stipulate that the minimum amount returnable in any year shall be ,£6,500,000, with a special grant to Western Australia of £250,000. The States are endeavouring to prevent this Parliament from imposing direct taxation. On the one hand they say. that they want their full pound of flesh so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, and on the other they declare that this Parliament must not encroach upon their preserves in the matter of direct taxation. It must be patent to every honourable member that if the Commonwealth is to face its obligations no continuance of the Braddon section. this stage I interjectedWe must have sufficient finances to carry long ? on the affairs of the Commonwealth, and I trust that the question will not be raised as a party one by honourable members on any side. We should put our House in order and place our affairs upon a proper basis. But .while I say that, I have no wish to do an injustice to the States, which must have the means with which to carry on. I trust that before long the present Government will tell us what they mean by this interim period of five years. listening to the remarks of the Prime Minister, I have come to the conclusion that his Nobody will be opinion is that it would take five years to bring about a regulation of the State debts.

The honourable member for Flinders pleaded with the Government to bring about a settlement of the financial problem between the Commonwealth and the States. No Government since that time has done anything whatever to solve the problem. Now we have the Premiers of the States congratulating the Prime Minister on getting into office, because they hope for specially favorable treatment from this Government. There is not a member of our party who wishes to injure the States. But as the honourable member for Grey said, this is a national question, and should be settled without party prejudice. I was sent here as a member of the National Parliament, not as a "" State frights"" partisan. I am well aware that at the next election we shall have to face the State rights advocates. Mr Kidston, the Premier of Queensland, said as soon as he landed at Fremantle from England, that he intended to fight the Labour party at the next Federal election in the interests of State rights. I welcome that announcement. The same people who return us to the Federal Parliament also return these pettifogging State Premiers and their supporters. It is not reasonable to assume that any one wishes us to injure the State with which his reputation as a. politician is bound up. Neither do we wish to injure other States than our own. I should be sorry to see Victoria injured, for instance. But I want to see the National Parliament secure a fair and square deal. PerhapsI may not be here very long. Many of us may be politically dead after the next election. every honourable member who is here now will be here again after we have faced our masters. I have no ill-feeling towards any honourable member. I have no ill-feeling towards my strong and burly opponent, the honourable member for Echuca, although he so often tries to bully me. Had the advice of the honourable member for Flinders been taken two years ago we should have been on the way to settling the difficulty. But I trust that whatever Government is in power the interests of the National Parliament will be considered first, and those of the State Parliaments afterwards. a quorum present.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Unde r the Constitution, we cannot permanently bind ourselves. with the States are not worth anything. this issue goes to the country and is explained to the people they will decide in favour of a national policy. I am in favour of waiting until after the general election. It is not long to wait. We can then determine what shall be done. I have read accounts of meetings addressed by the Minister of External Affairs in Queensland, not only in his constituency, but in other districts. He then said that the National Parliament must be paramount in everything except industrial business, and that financially the Commonwealth must work out its own destiny irrespective of the States. But now we see him sitting with the State Rights party. The Premiers of the States are hopeful of what they will get from this combination. Directly the present Government was formed, Mr Kidston,.the Premier of Queensland, wired to the Prime Minister, not in these words, but to the effect, that now that the Labour party had been put in their proper position he felt that State rights were secure. Thev know that they have reason for hope from this Government, The honourable member for Parramatta, when leader of the Opposition, was never tired of advocating State rights as against Commonwealth interests. Whenever there was an opportunity of advocating the interests of the States as against those of the Commonwealth, he never lost it.

That would give the House control of the finances, and there would be no objection to the granting of a further month's Supplyi f it were afterwards found to be necessary. Very little time would thus be lost, because even if .another Supply Bill were discussed even at the length at which this Bill has been disprepared to do so without any discussion cussed, it would still go through in twenty-four hours, and in all probability that time could easily be spared from the general discussion that might be .going on at the time. If the Government had asked for one month's Supply, I believe that the Bill would have gone through without any delay. The discussion which has taken place has been due to the demand for two months' Supply. The only reason given for the demand is that the Government has got financial problems to wrestle with in Cabinet. only as the last word. by the Prime Minister only at the last moment. I was not in the chamber when the Treasurer spoke, and so I do not know what reason he gave for the request for two months' Supply. 110 particular reason for two months' Supply any more than for one. the House has no justification whatever for passing two months' Supply. The Prime Minister told us that the Government required two months' Supply because there were great problems which they had to wrestle with in Cabinet before the Budget statement could be put before the House. If that be so, I must say that I have no sympathy with the Cabinet whatever. The Government took office cheerfully, knowing that they would have these great problems to deal with. They are not new. They have been confronting the leading members -of this House for many years. . Honourable rhembers opposite knew of them last year, and if the present Ministers considered these problems so desperate and so important that their consideration. would require a great deal of time, why did they not fuse before the recess, and take the whole -of the recess to think them over ? Why did they waste all that time, and then on the meeting of Parliament at once defeat a Cabinet that was given no opportunity to make their proposals, take office without [29 JUNE, 1909.] (No. 1). 533 hesitation, postpone the business of the session for three weeks, and then, after another week, ask for two more months within which to deal with questions of finance? .If they took one month's Supply, and at the end of the month were not ready with their proposals, I am satisfied that the House would give them still another month. Certainly I should be whatever. But at present, I see no reason why the Government should be given Supply for more than one month. a.m.] -Eve r since I have been a member of this House, I have protested strongly against these Supply Bills. It is not fair to the House or to the country that the business of the Commonwealth should be carried on by means of Supply Bills. I recognise that at a time like .the present, when we have reached the end of the financial year, and it is necessary that the Treasurer should get certain information in order to prepare his Budget, some little exception might be made. It may be necessary to cover such an interval with"" a SupplyB ill ; but the whole tendency of the Commonwealth has been practically to live on such Bills for a considerable portion of the financial year. By that means a great deal of the useful work that might be done in considering a Budget statement is lost to the House, and there is a lot of useless criticism on Supply Bills. In view of the conditions which now obtain I am prepared to vote a month's Supply. What struck me as unusual was the request for two months' Supply. There does not appear to have been advanced a sufficient reason for covering that period. The financial year of the States is about to terminate, and their Parliaments are about to assemble. The State Treasurers will not be in a position to make fheir financial statements and bring forward their Estimates pending the delivery of a financial statement by the Commonwealth Treasurer. that in the slightest degree. delay in the delivery of the Budget speech will affect the proposals of the State Treasurers ? delay on my part.

Since then, he has intimated that he will use his best efforts to deliver it earlier if he can, but I want him to consider the awkward position in which the State Treasurers will be placed if its delivery is unduly delayed. One of the complaints which the States have had against the Commonwealth has been the length of time which it has taken the Federal Treasurer to prepare his Budget, and so put them in a position to disclose their own financial position.

678,Sir John Forrest,"I promised toThat the House do now adjourn. -Minister of Defence) [12.23 a.m.]. -The honourable member for Wide Bay has alleged, by innuendo, that an .agreement was about to be broken. What took place between him and me is this. I crossed to the Opposition side of the chamber, and suggested that if he would give us the motion, meaning that for the suspension of the Standing Orders, we would leave the Supply Bill over till to-morrow. He afterwards came to this side and said to me that he hoped that there would be no misunderstanding about the vote. I took him to mean the vote on the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. That is the only agreement I made with him, and I regret that it has not been kept. It is two and a half hours since it was made.. -Explanation s beget explanations. I shall make no explanation. I shall state the facts. The honourable member for Parramatta came to me and asked me whether I was willing to close, and I said ""Yes, certainly, after we have taken the vote."" Being in doubt whether the honourable member meant the motion that was before you, and that was not opposed, and to which there was no suggestion of opposition, I purposely used the word ""vote."" My meaning was that after we had taken the vote we should adjourn. That was agreed to. A vote can mean only one thing a vote taken in division by honourable members who differ upon a particular subject. It.had been declared by every honourable member on this side that we were quite willing to grant Supply for a month, but not for two. The vote on that question was the only vote that could be referred to. To make doubly sure, however, I went back to the honourable member for Parramatta and said : "" It is clearly understood that it is after the vote that we shall adjourn."" -In justice to the honourable member for Parramatta I wish to say that I was speaking to him before he went across to the leader of the Labour Opposition. I asked him what course was proposed for the evening, and he told me be was going to try to get the Leader of the Opposition to agree to astonishment to see the Prime Minister get take the resolution to go into Committee of Supply and adjourn the business of taking Supply until to-morrow.

I rose simply to endeavour to clear up a misunderstanding that has arisen between two honourable members, both of whom I respect. a.m.] -Whil e I was speaking I received a note asking me not to speak long because a vote was to be taken.

When I rose I was informed that an arrangement had been made to take a vote, and was asked to curtail my remarks, with the result that I did not touch on the matter that I bad intended to deal with, but dealt simply with the question of the month's Supply.
