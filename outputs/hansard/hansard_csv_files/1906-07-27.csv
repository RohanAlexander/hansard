To Ask The Minister Representing The Min","ister of Defence whether, in view of the extraordinary occurrences which have taken place, a military escort from Bendigo to the State Parliament House, Melbourne, will be furnished to the Rev. Mr WorraH on Tuesday next ? On behalf of the Frinting Committee, I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a resolution passed yesterday by the Senate. On 2'8th June, 1906, I , as Chairman of the Committee, sent the following letter to the Prime Minister: Sir,I have the honour to inform you that at a meeting of the Frinting Committee of the House of Kepresentatives, held on the 15th inst., 1 wasrequested to call your attention to the unnecessary printing and extra expense incurred by the Senate in printing regulations under the Fost and Telegraph Act 1901, as set out in the journalsforwarded herewith. As I pointed out in my letter of 14th July, 1904, regulations of thischaracter are published under the Rules Publication Act 1903, and presented to Parliament in the usual printed form of such rules. The resolution passed hy the Printing Committee was as follows :That the attention of the honourable the Prime Minister be again called to the fact that these regulations (see page 11 of Journals of the Senate) are published underUie Rules Publication Act, and that there is no necessity for their being printed asparliamentary papers. The Printing Committee, in forwarding, that letter, had no desire to question the right of the Senate to order the printing of any document, nor to assail the discretion of the Frinting Committee of that Chamber. We, in no way, criticise or' challenge the exercise of its prerogatives by the Senate. But, in the performance of the duties for which we were appointed by this House, we think that we have a perfect right to draw, the attention of the Government to what we consider-extravagance in the matter of printing. The letter was merely a continuation' of correspondence which has been conducted by me on behalf of the Printing Committee during a period of some years. The first letter on .the subject was sent to the Right Honourable Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister, and' sent a second letter to the honourable member for Bland, when he was at the head of affairs, and he, too, thoroughly agreed with the Committee's suggestions. This is the third letter on the subject. Our object is to draw the attention of the Government to the facts, so that the. Prime Minister may place himself in communication with his colleague, the leader of the Senate, and informhim that certain documents are printed, published, and circulated by authority of an-",13,Setup

I do not think it desirable that anv Committee should communicate by letter, or in any other fashion, with a Committee of another House, unless expressly authorized so to do ""by this House. While speaking last night on the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong. I said, feeling strongly that Queensland will not obtain the advantages to which she is entitled under the mail contract, because Brisbane has not beer, made a port of call for the steamers, that I condemned the Government for ignoring the interests of the State, and that it seems useless to appeal to them for justice. Apparently I was understood to say, or may unwittingly have said, that it seems useless to appeal to this House. I had no intention of using those words, because, of course, many honourable members are favourably disposed to 1 the State of which I am a representative, and, if I have accidentally hurt their feelings, I am sorry, and apologize for my mistake.

Are Government officers to examine, test, and brand butter under Part III . , clause 8, section 3, sub-section a of the Regulations under the Commerce (Trades Description) Act 1905? 2.

If by the factory manager or exporter, will that branding be accepted or will Government officers subsequentlv examine and test the butter to prove the accuracy of the branding? 4. Will the examination and testing, if performed by Government officers, be done on the wharf or in the store or factory, and at whose cost?

The factory, its capital, and its products are exempted from national taxation for ten years. confined to preferential railway rates on certain agricultural products. In Brazil the same procedure obtains. In Bulgaria the manufacture of yarn, and certain other articles, is encouraged by the factories being exempted for fifteen years from licensing, land, and stamp taxation, by reduced railway rates, and by a proviso thatThe produce of these factories is lo be preferred lo foreign goods in a l l Stales and municipal contracts, even though it be 15 psr cent, dearer than the latter, including the Customs duties paid by them. In Chili bounties are allowed on the exportation of wines and spirits, and the manufacture of beet sugar and sulphuric acid. In France, i i i order to encourage the cultivation of hemp and flax, a law, dated the 8th April, 1898, provides that for a period of six years an annual expenditure of £100,00 0 shall be allowed for bounties to growers of hemp and flax. No bounty is paid unless the surface cultivated is more than, 956 square yards in extent, and the rate of bountv is fixed by Ministerial decree. For 1902 it was fixed at about £ 1 3s. per acre. The expenditure for bounties since 1898 has been1808 1899 1900 1901 (estimated) 1902 ,, ... ... 100,000 1903 Bounties to encourage cod fishing are granted to the crews of French vessels engaged in the industry. range from 12s. to £ 2 per head, according to the location of the fishery. A bounty on dried cod from French fisheries is also allowed, ranging from 4s. rod. to 8s. i d . per cwt., according to port of shipment and country of destination. From 1899 to -9°3 £1,037,000 has been expended in this manner. A system of preferential railway rates is also in force in connection with French products. In Germany no bounties are given for agricultural products, but in the case of goods manufactured from imported or excisable material, and afterwards exported, a drawback is allowed of the duty involved. In Italy there are no bounties, but preferential railway rates are allowed in a few unimportant cases. In Japan the Government granted a subsidy of £ 7 , 0 0 0 per annum in 1893, for a period of ten vears. to advertise and promote the com[69] 9^9 merce in Japanese tea. The Ministry of Finance are reported to be satisfied with the results obtained. In Portugal an effort In Hungary the bounty system is was made by the Government in 1892 to encourage the consumption of native wines by the grant of a bounty to a company called the "" Companhia Vinicola de is'orte."" This association, in return for a bountv of £ 3 , 3 3 ° annually, bound itself to display exhibits and establish depots at various foreign cities, one of which was Berlin. The term fixed for the continuance of the subsidv was fifteen years, with the proviso that should the company's profits attain to a certain magnitude at the close of ten vears, a corresponding reduction in the grant should be made for thc ensuing five. In Russia, in addition to the drawback of excise duty paid on the exportation of spirits, corn brandy, and preparations of : the same (infusions), the exporter receives a bountv. This bounty i& fixed at the rate of 3J per cent, for spirits of everv strength, both rectified and unrectified ; for rectified spirit not lower than 95-J per cent, proof, and satisfying the standard fixed for puritv; i j per cent, is additionally payable to the exporter.

The Bill does not deal with as many, industries as some honourable member might desire. would like. thought it desirable to deal with other industries, my colleagues would doubtless have agreed with me. I wish to quote a statement made by the honourable member for Gippsland at the Hobart Conference. In reference to bounties, he saidThese are matters which would naturally f a l l under the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. Government have sole power to encourage production and export by means of bounties or bonuses; then, naturally, the Federal Agricultural Department should do what it could to encourage the establishment of new and valuable industries. which are being successfully carried on in other parts of the world, and which to all appearances might be very successfully established here; but the transplanting of a new industry to a new country always involves new conditions of production. For instance, we would have to find the best seasons for planting, and the best seasons for harvesting, and many other things which involve a certain amount of risk; and therefore people are very slow to undertake that risk unless the State as a whole will give some encouragement during the first few years. *hink we should be very careful about encouraging the establishment of any industry, unless we are tolerably sure that it could be successf u l l y and profitably carried on, after it had a fair start, without any State advantage whatever in the future, and become a profitable industry to the whole Commonwealth. I quite agree with the statement of the honourable member, but at present we have not a Federal Department of Agriculture. My colleagues agree with me that the time is not very far distant when we shall have to establish a department of that kind. At present, however, the Slates have organised such departments, and perhaps it would be better for us for some years to come to work in co-operation with them, instead of duplicating expense. If the Bill be passed, we shall probably enter into negotiations with the States Governments with a view to securing their co-operation in giving effect to our intentions. In the same way I am applying to the States to practically work the Commerce Act with the machinery at their disposal, reserving to the Commonwealth merely the supreme power of control. In Victoria, I may mention that many years ago a bounty was offered in connection with the planting of vines. The payment, I think, was based upon ihe acreage put under vines, and I am told that in a great many instances that bounty was practically wasted because sufficient inducement was not offered to the planters to obtain the best possible stock with a view to making substantial profit's at a later period. ordinary business incentive? why that incentive was lacking, but I am informed that after the planters had received the bounty, they did not proceed with the cultivation of their vines. Another is, of course, the Federal been too high. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Probably. Under this Bill we do not propose to pay any bouni'y for the cultivation of the soil, or for planting operations.

In connection with the payment of the sugar bounty, I am aware that in some instances ihe growers do not get it. grower in the first instance. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is so. But I have, seen some of the agreements with the growers-agreement s under which the bounty is not secured to ihem in the way that it should be. Whenever we discover a weak spot in that respect, we should endeavour to provide against it. The' Bill is so framed that no bounty will be payable in respect of the articles enumerated in the schedule unless they have been produced by white labour.

31,Mr Fisher,"It must be handed to the Parliament and of the country. It is further proposed that the bounty shall become operauve only when the plants are sufficiently matured to produce the particular commodity required. Just now I heard an interjection in reference to chicory. That leads me 10 say that I have received information from one or two persons in Sydney who have been dealing in that article. From them. I gather that the granting of a bounty upon the production of chicory is not a very important matter. 1 I learn that a great deal of chicory-al most sufficient to supply the requirements of Australia-is grown in the neighbourhood of Western Port. Consequently, when we come to deal with that item, I shall move that it be omitted. I was not aware until a few weeks ago that so much chicory was produced in the locality indicated. I hold in my hand a list of articles which is interesting from the standpoint of showing how much employment might' be afforded to our own people if we produced them in sufficient quantities to provide for our own requirements. Take the article cocoa as point. the raw cocoa imported into the Commonwealth in 1904 was £ 1 7 , 0 3 7 ; in 1905 it was £ 1 9 , 4 4 1 , whereas the value of the manufactured cocoa imported in those years was £157,52 7 and £ 1 8 5 , 6 8 6 respectively. whole of that ourselves. year the importations of flax and hemp were valued at £ 1 2 8 , 3 8 3 ; of preserved milk, at £ 1 9 4 , 6 5 8 ; of concentrated preserved milk, at £ 1 , 8 1 3 ; of oils, at £174,501; ; £ 3 > 5 5 4 ; ^ d of rubber, crude, which is 1:I not dutiable, at £1.02,983, and of rubber manufactures, n.e.i., at £ 1 2 9 , 4 8 2 . present stage I do not intend to deal in detail with the various articles in respect of which I have information. I propose to have that information printed, and copies of it distributed amongst honourable members. In this connection, I may say that a great deal of very valuable data has been placed in my hands by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who has gone to considerable trouble to supply it. I mayinform honourable members that the Government have had under consideration the advisableness of grantinga bounty upon the production of a number of other articles, [ 6 ] -2 9 but, after discussing the matter very carefully, it was not deemed desirable to go further than we have gone in this B ill . made in the measure for the grower. Sir WILLIAM LYNE If the honourable inember is of opinion that the Bill is weak in that respect we are quite prepared to amend it. It is intended to benefit the grower. If honourable members will defer raising objections to it until the measure reaches Committee, they will enable me to get along much faster than I can do if I am called upon to reply to a running fire of interjections make it perfectly clear whether the bounty is to be paid upon the finished article or to the grower. Sir WILLIAM LYNE A t the end of the Bill the honourable member will see that certain powers are vested in the Minister to make regulations. I can assure him that the bulk of the money is intended to go to the grower. The Bill is designed to prevent the manufacturer from fleecing him. an instance in ""owner of the land shall be deemed to have been employed in the production of the goods,"" although, as a matter of fact, he may have nothing to do with it. is that the bounty shall be paid to the grower. In some cases in which it must be paid upon the finished article, I wish so to frame the measure that it shall provide that the producer shall get the larger share of it . of rice, uncleaned, at ill-considered B ill . Sir WILLIAM LYNE If that be so, the honourable member must blame the draftsman. Under the Bill a bounty of i d . per lb. will be paid upon manufactured cocoa. I have already mentioned the importations of raw and manufactured cocoa. I think that the quantity of cocoa imported into the Commonwealth is sufficiently large to warrant us straining every nerve to produce that article for ourselves. I quite admit that it cannot be grown in the south of Australia. I recognise that it can only be successfully cultivated in the northern parts of the Commonwealth. In dealing with that question we might well consider the prospects of the successful cultivation of cocoa in the Northern Territory.

When I was in Queensland about 1864. I saw, on the Logan River, a cotton plantation where the plants were growing very well indeed. attempts have since been made to establish the industry there, but they have not been altogether successful. For the information of the HouseI shall quote the statistics as to our imports of cotton, which is free. In 1904 we imported 537,793 lbs., valued at 973 I believe that, as a £ 1 1 , 8 4 4 , and in 1905, 1,049,306 lbs., valued at £ 2 0 , 9 6 2. from which I am quoting does not indicate whether it was or was not raw cotton. The word "" cotton "" is used. The quanI t is proposed tity of cotton produced in Australia is very small. In 1904, 30 acres were grown in Queensland, ancl cotton in seed netted In1 4-5ths of a penny per lb. f.o.b. Brisbane, whilst ginned cotton realized 6Jd. to 4$d. f.o.b. there. It is proposed that the bounty shall extend over a period of five years, and. that it shall be 10 per cent, on the market value, payable in respect of If that statement be correct quantities of not less than one bale of 300 lbs. The reason we have decided that this bounty shall be payable for only five years is that the time occupied by this plant in reaching maturitv is not as long as in the case of My informaother plants to which I ha.ve referred. The producers of this cotton will enjoy the bounty for, at all events, four years. I There are very large areas, not need hardly remind honourable members that whilst we have refrained from proposing to grant the bounty for an extended period, it is always open to the Parliament to readjust the bounty, and, if necessary, to extend the period during which it shall be payable. We should be able to grow in Queensland and the northern parts of South Australia and Western Australia, a great deal, 'if not all, the cotton we reauire. me a statement that it has been discovered I stated before that cotton can be grown in other parts of the world by means of white labour.

Australia. ing rice has just been commenced on the Murray. appeared in the American Review of Reviews, written by Robert S. Lanier, shows what is being done in this matter in America. The article is headed "" The Revolution in Rice Farming,"" and is as follows :Now, the settlers have seen labour saving implements make wlieat fortunes in the Dakotas and California. Why could not they themselves make these Gulf prairies blossomwith rice at a profit? Accordingly, they brought on the wheat machinery they were used to, they adapted it to the new crop, they worked out irrigation methods, and vvith Government help found the best seed varieties. Here is one result of their labours : before the Civil War, South Carolina produced about three-fourths of our home rice; North Carolina and Georgia most of the rest. To-day, it is Louisiana and Texas that produce three-fourths of the whole. However, the greatest result is that, for the first time in history, a labour-saving method of rice-production has been demonstrated. American farmer, although he pays a higher price for labour than any rice grower in the world, may eventually find himself in control of the world's markets. The patient Chinaman with his mud-rake and his twenty-five dollars a year profit, the Punjab ryot's women wielding their slow hand-sickles, the toiling fellah of the Nile delta, the Japanese mattocking his plot, too tiny for a flow to turn-al l will be undersold by the progressive American driving his four mule twine binder to his power cultivated fields, past the steam plant where a battery of clanking pumps, impelled by eight hundred horse-power, has sucked up to his growing crop its seventy-day bath of vital, fresh river water. Down on the Gulf coast, one farmer, one helper, and good teams can prepare and plant to rice two hundred or three hundred acres. In general, rice can be Drofitablv grown by the new methods wherever there is land so level that large single fields can be uniformly flooded by fresh water, and possessing enough clay, either in soil or subsoil, to hold water and quickly to drain the fields dry enough for the support of heavy terms. This shows what can be done by the employment of machinery, and indicates to us how we might carry on the cultivation of rice in Australia. At present we levy a duty of 3s. 46. per central upon uncleaned rice. Starch rice is free, But rice n.e.i. is subject to a duty of 6s. per central. In 1904 we imported 232,611 centals of uncleaned rice, valued at £107,070, and 267,574 centals df rice n.e.i., valued at £129,465. In J905 we imported 259,004 centals of uncleaned rice, valued at £113,554, whilst of and elsewhere in Northern rice n.e.i. we imported 253,319 centals, valued at £112,939. Rice is worth 2^d. per Ib. The local production is very small indeed; in fact, we cannot ascertain that any is produced. worth 2jd. per lb. formation given to me. We propose to grant a bounty of £ 1 per ton of unhusked rice for five years. Now we come to the last item in the schedule, namely, rubber. Last night, I had an interview with the manager of the Dunlop Tyre Company, who told me that if we could produce rubber in the northern parts of Australia-and there is, no doubt that it could be produced, because we have a native rubber tree which is capable of being cultivated with advantage 'his company would purchase £10,000 worth of rubber per month. In view of this large local demand, every encouragement should be offered to planters to engage in the enterprise. It is proposed to give a bounty which will not exceed £7,000 per annum for a period of ten The years, under conditions to be prescribed by regulation. We have not been able to fix the rate at which the bounty shall be payable, because the matter is a difficult one to deal with. At present, crude rubber is admitted free of duty, but we levy 15 'per cent, upon rubber manufactured n.e.i. In 1904 our importations of rubber manufactures, including crude rubber, which were admitted free, were valued at £100,389, whilst the imports of rubber manufactures n.e.i. were valued at £100,275. In 1905 the imports free of duty were valued at £102.983, whilst the rubber manufactures n.e.i. introduced were valued at £129.482. At present the rubber used by the Dunlop Company comes from Java, or South America, and their consumption is very large.

Another reason why we should express out opinions freely, is that the step which we are now asked to take is a very grave one.

Whilst fully agreeing with the"" system of bounties, I doubt whether the proposals which have been submitted to-day are best suited to the requirements of Australia at the present time.

97,Mr Mccoll,"I do not agree with myare doing. The Minister has expressed a similar opinion, but I would point out that the Bill contains nothing in the shape of proposals to that end. We know that some States are doing a very great deal towards developing their territory, whilst others are doing very little. At Perth, in Western Australia, there is a station which is accomplishing a little. In Queensland there is the Gatton College, which takes students, and which, within its circumscribed area, is performing good work. In New South Wales there is the Hawkesburv College, and several' other institutions which are rendering excellent service ; and in Victoria, we have the Dookie College and the Longerenong institution, although as a Victorian I am 'bound to confess that they have not proved the success which they should have been. The Dookie College has not sent out one man who has left the imprint of his individuality upon farming operations in this country. tution been in existence?

South Australia possesses a college at Roseworthy, but in Tasmania there is no such institution. College merely a preliminary school ?

Until we do .so we can have no permanent settlement. requires to be so treated that all the moisture precipitated shall enter it, and be stored tliere for plant use. In order to accomplish this, it needs to be worked by special cultural methods. quire to plant crops which are adapted to our soil and climate. We must further 1 develop the seed that we get. in order to obtain that which is most suitable to the conditions of our country. Then we must learn the right time and manner of planting that seed. It is well known that crops grown under arid conditions are better than those which are produced under more humid conditions. If we can accomplish something in that direction we shall be moving upon right lines. In regard to the cultivation of tropical products we must always recollect that they will have to compete with the cheap labour of the world. For a very long time the market for thoseproducts will be outside our own country, and consequently I do not think it is eithernecessary or desirable to introduce into thisBill restrictions as to the class of Labour that shall be employed in their cultivation. It seems to me that our present restrictivelaws are sufficient to enable us to deal with that aspect of the question without imposing upon the growers of these productsany more restrictions than are absolutely necessary. As far as is possible, consistently with the d'eclared policy of"" this: country, we should allow them as much freedom in carrying out their experimentsas we can. Then the Minister has given, us absolutely no information whatever regarding the organization under which effect is to be given to the provisions of the Bill. When proposals involving such an enormousexpenditure are submitted to the House, it is only reasonable that details as to how they are to be carried out should also besupplied. It seems to me that we ought to have adopted the advice which was. given to us some years agOj and to have had' in existence to-day a Federal Department of Agriculture. Honourable members will recollect that in June, 1901, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo brought that matter under the notice of the House. It was then dropped for a period of three years, but in July, 1904, the honourable and the pupils are learned member again pressed the subject upon the attention of Parliament. Hisproposal was supported in most eloquent speeches by the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Macquarie, and others, but up In the first place, the soil to the present time nothing whatever has been done to give .effect to it. I . contend that we need not start upon elaborate lines. If we commenced operations upon a small scale, and allowed Then we rethe Department to grow gradually, we should be acting wisely. If we did that, and co-operated with the States, we should be confident that the undertaking would he efficiently supervised, and that our operations would tend to ultimate success.

102,Mr Mccoll,"We must deal with the State Parliament when those proposals were submitted, in 1886 or 1887. They were very much better thought out than are the proposals contained in the Bill under -consideration. the Hon. J. L. Dow, who has always been .a strong supporter and sincere friend of the agriculturist. Their objects were as -follow :First, to induce the farmers throughout the -Colony to enter upon the growth of additional products by means of acreage bonuses, in order that they may not confine their attention to tbe production of one or two cereal crops; second, ito promote an improvement in the quality and packing of dairy produce, fresh fruits, and -wines exported to the London market; third, to induce the establishment of factories for fruit canning, fruit drying, dairying, wine-making, raisin and currant making, vegetable oil making, and preparing for the manufacture of flax, ihemp, silk, and other products to be named in regulations; fourth, for the introduction of new -varieties of seeds and plants; fifth, for the -establishment of a system of agricultural -technical education; sixth, for the publication of agricultural reports; and, seventh, for the introduction of new kinds of agricultural machinery and appliances. I should very much Jike to have seen a -comprehensive proposition submitted to this Parliament, instead of the proposals which are embodied in the measure before MS, great and useful as many of them are. in this Bill are merely am earnest of what we intend to do. a large expenditurethat I fear other matters with, which it is essential we should -deal immediately will be relegated to the background for many years. The bonuses arranged to be given by the Victorian Government totalled £250,000, and were to -extend over five years. the butter bonus was the only one that had a beneficial effect. Whilst a large proportion of that bonus went into the hands of merchants and middlemen, the whole of it -did not do so, because in many cases the prices which ihey paid to the producers for their cream were increased owing to the fact that they were to receive the bonus -on the export of the butter. the bonus, but the producers secured a 1 great deal of it. -agents have been blamed for having secured the whole of the butter bonus, but, as I have already pointed out, a great part of i i went to the producers in the shape of increased prices for their cream or butter. The Victorian proposals, to which I have referred, were much wiser, more comThey were submitted by prehensive, and far more suited to our circumstances than are those now submitted to us. When we examine the Bill, we find that the bouniies are to be paid on goods, and not on crops. It is specified that they are to assist agricultural development, and they have been heralded with the cry of "" Protection for ihe farmers."" They will certainly give assistance to the farmers, but they will not constitute protection for the farmer in the sense that we understand the term. They will probably help some but not many farmers. I believe that the Government proposals will play into the hands of the manufacturers, and help them to a much greater extent than the farmers. I understand, however, that that is not the intention of ihe Minister. The honourable gentleman emphasized the point v that his desire was to assist the primaryproducer. I would remind the House, however, that under this Bill, the bounties are to be payable only on the finished product placed on the market. We shall find that the great bulk of them will be paid to those who turn the raw material inio various manufactures, and not to those who actually produce it. factured"" will cover a good deal. ister has expressed his disapproval of the system of paying on acreage. If we are to help the farmers, however, that is the system we should adopt. We should divide these bounties into two parts, and pay the farmer separately for the work that he honestly performs-for the cultivation of his land and for the production of the raw material which the manufacturer can work up inio the finished product. We ought' to pay the farmer according to the quality and quantity of the raw article that he produces. With one or two exceptions, ihe bounties are to be paid on the manufactured product, arid, therefore, the manufacturer will reap the benefit. honourable member refer? 0 only raw materials in respect of which bounties are io be paid. in the schedule to the Bill will all go to",25,Thomson Condensed And Its Importation Was Valued At £108 147

If a proposal like this had beeri made with respect to the payment of the sugar bounty the House would not have accepted it. We insisted that the bounty on sugar grown by white labour should be paid direct to the farmer. If that is the correct policy to pursue with regard to the production of sugar by white labour, why should we not follow it in dealing with other primary industries? apply all round. ister condemn the system of paying according to acreage-o n the raw material, instead of on the manufactured products? Tlie honourable gentleman said that four or five years would elapse before a return would be obtained in respect of some of these manufactured products. What farmer would be prepared to till his soil and waste his time for the sake of a prospective return so far ahead ? We should pay the former on his own work. He will grow the raw material, but in very few cases will will be -in the hands of other parries, upon whom he shall have to depend. work into the cultivation of one of these products, whilst the reward for his industry will depend on the treatment of what he produces by some one else. What guarantee will the farmer have that the raw material that he produces will be treated in such a way as to secure a return to him in the shape of a bounty ? Cocoa and rice are the only two raw products in respect of which bounties are to be paid, and we find that the bounties payable in respect of them are very small. bounties will be payable in respect of manufactured articles. require considerable treatment before the bonus on them can be paid. The farmer should be paid for what he grows and puts on his waggon for delivery to the person who is to treat it . To the farmers in the Minister's electorate, as well as in that which I represent, and also in. South Australia and Western Australia, these bounties will be practically valueless. Very few will be able to take advantage of them. Whilst in [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bounties Bill. themselves these bounties are good to a certain extent, do not let us delude the farmer into the belief that they are going to participate in their distribution, when the great bulk of them are not likely to do so. I believe, however, that these proposals will do good. The Government proposal, although not altogether on the lines that I favour, is in the right direction. In making this, our first attempt to encourage primary industries, we should fake care that we start on sound lines. Another point is fhat the B ill itself is a mere skeleton.

The honourable .gentleman says that he will invite the The farmer may put his best co-operation of the experimental farms, but he is to have supreme power, under this Bill. He is to prescribe who may be employed!, what wages shall be paid, what acreage is to be cultivated, and what bounties shall be paid, and he is also to fix the time that must elapse between the growth of the product and its manufacture in a form to warrant payment of"" the bounty. He is to have a stiU greater power-the power, at his own sweet will, to divert a bounty from In all other cases the one product to another. These powers are too great. I hold that the regulations under this Bill should be submitted"" to the House, and that the whole scheme should be subject to proper supervision. We have no indication, however, that that courseis to be followed. In the face of these drawbacks to what are otherwise good proposals, what farmer is going to risk his time and monev in seeking to earn the bounty? If bounties are to be given, let them be allocated between the various parties instrumental in placing these new products on the market. If that be not done, the whole scheme will fail.

If we hamper these proposals in such an arbitrary way, we shall probably deter people from embarking on these newindustries. striction laws should deal with theso matters, instead of their being dealt with in a measure for the advancement of the industrial welfare of Australia. yet to be shown whether white labour can successfully grow these products in the north, where many of them can be raised.

As the result of this encr'pachmeint the jrice-growers have been obliged to go to the uplands of Louisiana and Texas-no t California, as the Minister said-and to form artificial swamps there for their crops.

123,Mr Bamford,"I s there a split in theforward my proposals with all modesty and diffidence. I think there is a more excellent way in which money could be spent to assist the agricultural development of this country. The Minister sought to recommend the Bill by referring to a number of countries which give bounties. named. Hungary, Brazil, Chili, France, Portugal, and Russia. I do not think we should follow on the lines pursued by those countries, where labour receives the very lowest payment. They are not countries whose example we should follow ini trying to develop Australia. look to those parts of the world where agriculture has greatly progressed, and whose peoples are now in the front rank of the world's producers. We shall find that they do not give bonuses. I do not recommend that we should slavishly copy the example of any country; but we should carefully examine all successful attempts to assist agriculture, in order to see if we nected with plant and animal life and their cannot profit thereby. which have made the greatest agricultural progress are Germany and America. as the other two. France is a country of very small holdings, where assistance has been given to the small man; but the assistance proposed to be given by the Government -would not, I think, go to small men. One word alone will explain' the progress and development of the countries I have named, and that word is "" education."" They have educated their people by means of experimental investigations, having thus built up a sound and scientific method of agriculture. If we consider the work of Liebig, in Germany, in regard to the chemistrv of the soils, and the discovery wide investigations has been to put America of the fertilizers necessary to make them useful, and to restore the waste that is conand it has been brought about by the efforts tinually going on, we must recognise the jrreat utility of his labours, not only to Germanv, but also to the rest of the world. The first experimental station in Germany was started at Moeckern in 1851, and since that time practical experiments, coupled with chemical investigations, have enabled the country to progress by leaps and bounds. There are now seventv experimental stations in Germany, designed to assist the farmers of that country. Germany was the first country where an attempt was made to discover the true relations between chemistrv and agriculture. America has, followed suit, and is battering the instructrouble, by putting them on the right road, tion it has received. Washington himself saw clearly what the development of agriculture would mean to that country, and in 1796, in his address to Congress, saidIt will not be doubted, witb reference either to industrial or national welfare, that agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as He nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage.' Although America was slow to adopt these views, when it took the matter in hand it went ahead very fast. The first experiWe should rather mental station there was established in 1875. By 1886 twelve stations had been established, and now there are in the United States over sixty stations, with a staff of about 700 persons, nearLy all of whom are scientific teachers. At these stations every branch of agriculture receives attention, from the first operations in connection with' the treatment of the soil, to all details conThe countries diseases. Whereas in this country agriculture is. an industry conducted at random, the sport of season and circumstance, in America the work of the farmer is carried on in accordance with well-defined"" scientific principles. The investigations of the experimenting stations cover, amongst other things, the perfecting of machinery and implements, the fertilizing of the soil, the suitability of soils to crop, drainage, seepage, irrigation, methods of cultivation, rotation of crops, feeding and digestion experiments, and the value of different kinds of food for various kinds of stock, laboratory investigations of diseases of plants, the introduction of drought-resisting seeds and plants into arid areas, and the crossing of plants to secure stock which will suit special conditions. The effect of these in the front rank as an agricultural country, of far-seeing men, among whom is Justin S. Morrill, who, in 1862, had 11,000,000 acres set aside for experimental purposes. He was followed by W. H . Hatch, who brought in a Bill instituting experimental stations. Later on Morrill obtained a further grant, so that now each experimental station receives 25,000 dollars a year from Congress, while they are also assisted by the States. I visited one or two of them, and saw the work which they are doing. They have sent trained men all over America, who assist the agriculturists when in difficulty or",28,Thomson Condensed And Its Importation Was Valued At £108 147

The officials deal with the matters referred to in these letters, or remit them to experimental stations, from which experts are Sent to ascertain the cause of the trouble, and to put matters right again. The work of the experimental stations was crowned by the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture, which is what we require in Australia. That Department was established in 1862 ; but it did not attain its f u l l measure of usefulness until, in 1897, it was reorganized by Secretary Wilson, who had been Senator Wilson, of Ohio. I had the pleasure of meeting him a short time ago. such a pitch of perfection that now there is no institution of the kind elsewhere which equals it, or whose work will compare with that done by it . matter affecting agriculture with which it does not deal. .

The circumstances of Australia are similar to those of the United States. Although the area of the United States is so large, they are as hard pushed there to find land for the people as we are in Victoria. The good country lying to the eastward of the 96th meridian, which divides the humid from the arid area, is all taken up, while to the westward there is a tract over 500 miles wide by 1,100 miles long, with a rainfall declining from twenty inches to nothing. The problem of America, during the last seven or eight years""; has been how to get this arid country settled. Every effort has been made by the Central Department of Agriculture, and by the experimental stations, to obtain a solution of this problem, by discovering means whereby the land can be farmed with some certainty of a profitable return. The farmers there have been faught how to store the -moisture in the soil by proper cultivation, how to use the winter floods, how to bore for wells, and what are the best implements for deep cultivation. has been fourteen years at the Nebraska University, doing nothing else but investigate the problems raised by the dry area, with a view to ascertaining how best to keep moisture in the soil, what are the best means of cultivation, and how it can be used to most advantage. In 1899, they sent men all over the world to obtain drought-resisting seeds. These agents brought back with thefn from the plains of the Volga, from Siberia, Algiers, and other places, wheat, oats, maize, grass, sorghum, and various other seeds, which have been distributed throughout the droughty areas. As one consequence the wheat-producing area has, since the beginning of ihe century, been extended 200 miles further west, I saw beautiful crops being grown in country which enjoyed only a 12-inch rainfall.

Under ihe system of cultivation adopted in the Experiments have been United States, the ground is kept open and the moisture is able to find its wav well below the surface, and remain stored there for the use of the plants t ill they come to perfection. I am quoting these cases to show that it is desirable that we should educate our people as to the best method's of cultivation, and the proper crops to grow, rather ihan bring in proposals intended to encourage the cultivation of only a few products. I do not say that the Government proposals are wrong. They will probably be productive of much good, but I contend that under present circumstances, we should consider first measures that would be calculated to help the country further ahead. It is our first duty to assist those . who are occupying our dry areas, who are fighting against drought, and dust, and hot winds, and all the discomfort's that attach to life in the interior.

However, I hope that the surrender of private members' day will afford the Government I should have been loth a further opportunity of disposing of the remaining business of the session.

For the sake of accomplishing that object, I think that honourable members would be prepared to forego the consideration of their own private business for the remainder of the session. I wish to embrace this opportunity to again urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity for dealing with, the reports of the Tariff Commission as soon as possible. It seems to me a great anomaly that honourable members sitting behind the Government should daily devote hours outside of this House to emphasizing the necessity which exists for Tariff reform, and still be content to take no action in this Chamber, where some practical result might accrue frOm their efforts. present ? the consideration of the reports which are already to hand? There are three reports to which the members of the Tariff Commission have unanimously agreed. half-an-hour's work for the House. they-the reports dealing with spirits? tions which the honourable member for Bourke himself used last session, when he declared that men were being thrown out of employment as the result of the closing down of works?

I am prepared to support the motion of the Prime Minister, I am opposed to the idea that private members' day should be entirely dispensed with. I was very much surprised at the attitude taken up by' the honourable member for Echuca, especially in view <^f the fact that a few weeks ago he objected to postpone a motion which he had upon the business-paper to enable honourable members to witness a very important experiment in connection with the transmission of the first Marconi message to Tasmania. Upon that occasion he urged that his proposal was of such serious public import that it did not admit of any delay. I note that it is now set down for consideration upon 2nd August. If it were important previously it is equally important now, so that the honourable member, by making it appear that private members' business is of no consequence, has practically condemned his own proposal. I agree with the remarks which have been made regarding the wisdom of abolishing grievance day, because I hold that any important matter can and should be ventilated upon a motion for adjournment. think it goes without saying, that the motion will have the unanimous support of the House, since we shall have ample opportunity to discuss any grievances under which we labour.
