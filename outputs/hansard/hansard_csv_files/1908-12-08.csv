Division 46 (Central Administration), ^33,458will not be the same necessity to debate the Defence Estimates at length this year, because of the discussion that has taken place on the Defence Bill, but there are one or two matters that I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. I desire to call his attention to the fact that, in spite of an apparent desire to reduce the Estimates of the Department, he still retains positions for Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General, when it has been'declared by officials of his own Department that the money paid for those positions is to a great extent being wasted. In the Head-quarters Departments of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, salaries of £500-increase d this year in two cases to £525-ar e being paid to Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General. General Hoad in his report for 1907 statedSome months ago I recommended that the posts of General in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland be held by officers of the Citizen Forces, whose duties would be mainly in connection with Camps of Training, and that the routine work now carried out by the DeputyAssistant Quarter-Masters-General's Departments be distributed among the remaining Departments of the District Head-Quarters-the Senior Ordnance Officer and the District Paymaster. The three officers of the Administrative and Instructional Staff now holding appointments as Deputy-Assistant Quarter-MastersGeneral in these Districts could then give the whole of their time to instructional work, which would include forming and conducting Classes of Instruction to prepare Officers and Noncommissioned Officers for examination for promotion. I consider that the time of these three permanent officers is to a great extent . being wasted. He has called attention to that matter for two years, and yet these three salaries, ranging from ,£500 to £550, are repeated this year. Does the Minister intend to take any steps in the matter? Is he satisfied that ,£1,500 a year is being wasted on an 121. Inspector-General, or that over £1,500 a year is being spent in paying men whose time, according to the Inspector General, is to a great extent being wasted? I wish to draw attention also to the following paragraph which appeared in the Age of yesterday:An important addition has been made to the defence regulations, affecting the admission of militia officers to the permanent forces. A new regulation reading as follows has been approved by the Governor General and the Minister :"" Officers of the citizen forces may be transferred to the permanent forces subject to such conditions as may be approved by the Governor General, being certified by a medical board to be physically fit, and to passing the examination for the rank in the permanent forces to which they are to be transferred. Provided that the authorized examination for the ranks of colonel and lieutenant-colonel shall include those for lieutenant-colonel and major."" That is strange, when there have been at the head of the Department Ministers who are presumed to be democratic. I know that the honorary Minister who represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber really wants men who have been in the ranks to have a chance to rise. That has been the principle adopted by this Parliament for years, but now we are to have a series of transfers. I know that this is all 1 worked with one idea, and for one man. The permanent ranker has no chance of becoming a militia officer. Yet the. .militia Yet Inspectorofficer is to have the right to a permanent position, and to retain his rank should he pass certain examinations. So long as this regulation has effect, the permanent men Deputy-Assistant Quarter-Masterswho are rankers will have no chance of rising.",16,Public Service Temporary Employment
76,Mr Crouch (Corio) [3.6],"Ther etains a condition; an examination must lie .passed. 'to permanent men, too. If a militia officer .passes the examination, he can obtain an -appointment in the permanent force. At the present time there are nine applicants for positions on the Victorian Instructional and Administrative Staff, of whom five are not officers. If there were four vacancies, the four militia officers who are applicants, having passed an examination, would have a preferential right under this new regulation to transfer. I doubt whether the regulation is good. It seems to me -contrary to the provision of the Act that a man who has served three years in the ranks shall obtain a preference.

The Department was in a state of demoralization. plaint about it now. .practices complained of have been 'stopped. I gave certain instances of abuse, and a return presented last week, in response to questions by the honourable member for Brisbane, showed that my information was absolutely correct. Yet, subsequent to my speech, the ex-Minister of Defence, to whom I had made previous private,complaint, said that he had heard of these things happening, but, on making inquiries, was "" definitely informed that the statements were untrue."" However, the honourable members for Dalley and Brisbane insisted on a further inquiry. Colonel FOXTON I did not make a statement as to the facts; I merely commented upon the allegations. having been made, my statements were confirmed. The first case which I brought under notice was the effecting of repairs to an automatic gun. I find from the return presented that a man was engaged on the work for 76 hours, the cost of his time being £ 5 14s., without having regard to the value of material. Then, 100 hours were taken up in the making of candlesticks, at a cost of £ 6 17s. 6d. for time. The making of a trolley for private use took 29 hours, and forty-four hours, costing £ 3 os. 6d., were occupied in the construction of a bookcase and the repairing of a vyce. This instrument originally cost about 5s., and the time used to repair it was worth about 30s. Then 124 hours were taken up in making inkstands, at a cost of since January last, only fourteen hours have been used for private work, and that in future the practice of allowing private work to be done by the Department is to be entirely discontinued. But, in view of the accuracy of my statements, I have a The Department has right to complain that the Minister was told that they were untrue. I am certain that the honourable member for Richmond would not have said that he was definitely informed that they were untrue if that was On the 2nd not the case. The present Minister ought to ascertain who is responsible for having misled his predecessor. On a second inquiry being directed, Colonel Stanley, the Victorian Commandant, reported, without giving the list of cases which has now been forced from him, that full inquiry had been made, and it had been found that the no comstatements were "" to a certain extent correct.""

I come now to the proposal of the Minister of Defence to simplify the uniforms of officers. I certainly hope that the agitation now going on in the press in regard to this reform will be profitable to officers who cannot afford to spend much money on their uniforms, and I would appeal to the Minister of Defence to make the proposed alterations apply to new uniforms and not to those at present being, worn. Very often changes made with a view of effecting economies have the opposite effect so far as the officers themselvesare concerned. For instance, after the South African war it was determined that the stars or crowns and stars showing the rank of an officer should be worn no longer on the shoulder, but on the arm. As the cases had to be obtained. Later on it was determined that these badges, when wom on the arm, were not sufficiently conspicuous, and it was ordered that they should once more be worn on the shoulder. At that time khaki of the exact colour required topatch the sleeve of a tunic from which the badges had been removed was not available, and in many cases new tunics had once more to be obtained. In other cases an expenditure of 21s. 6d. was incurred in securing new adornments and in repairing the sleeves of tunics from which the old ones had been removed. these things are the men whom we trust todefend the country 1 swept aside when the time comes to defend' Australia. As Major-General Hoad has admitted, it will be the Militia Officers whowill have to lead the armies of the Commonwealth and not officers who devote their attention to matters of personal adornment. The Minister has promised to look into this question, and I hope that his representative in this House will impress upon him thedesirableness of making the proposed alteration apply to future uniforms and not to those at present in use. An attempt tosimplify the dress of our officers and so toeffect economies often means in reality additional expense. the dressing up and the dressing down to which the Minister has been subjected by the honourable member for Corio, he will beglad to learn that I have not much with which to trouble him. It may be remembered that I recently asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defencewhether it was intended to appoint permanent Adjutants to the Militia and Volunteerregiments for whom provision was made in the Estimates of 1907-8, and who up to the present had not been appointedIn reply to that question, I was informed that no provision for such appointments had beeni",18,Department Of Defence

Owing to this want of equipment our supposed field forces in Australia to-day could not take the field under some months of idle waiting. take months to provide ammunition waggons, and the whole of our operations would be brought to a standstill for want of them. And yet the Defence Department has not been in a position to take Parliament into its confidence in regard to its wants. always said that there was no money available. ought to be told at once by the Minister of Defence that the defences of the country are absolutely in danger, so that this House, responsible to the people of Australia, may have an opportunity to honour its trust. I have risen not so much to make a speech upon this subjectI am afraid that the state of my health to-day would not per mit me to do so-as to ask the Minister to regard the dignity of the House a little more than his predecessor has done in the way of giving the fullest information he can. The House cannot vote money in an intelligent way, unless we know what the money is for. I have given only one instance, but it is one which shows the absolute rottenness of our existing Forces. I always gainsaid by trie Department-but , speaking from memory, I ' think an English division has something like 186 ammunition waggons, whereas I believe in. Australia, if there is one, that is all, while in an English division there are some 19,000 men, as compared with about 20,000 in all Australia. armed with magnificent guns, but without ammunition waggons the guns cannot be used in any prolonged action; and the consequence is that our so-called field force no more represents a field force than do the be in a position to remedy the evil at the -earliest opportunity. directly but indirectly, by means of a study of the new defence scheme, that the existing head-quarters administration was to be more or less the same for some years to -come; but almost immediately the headquarters staff was increased by the addition of an officer.

It is quite true, as the honourable member for Wentworth has said, that nothing like proper provision has been made in the shape of ammunition waggons. This year, for special defence material, only £ 3 9 , 6 5 6 has , been provided, as compared with £ 1 0 4 , 0 5 0 last year; in fact, only enough money has been set dbwn on the Estimates, as they stand, to cover the liabilities incurred last year,. and not a single penny piece is set r down >for equipment, such as ammunition waggons.

In the present Minister will be found, not only an energetic, but a capable man, who will ask the Parliament to assist him in putting the Forces on a proper footing. Some two years ago I called attention to the fact that we had a valuable equipment lying in the Stores Department in South Australia, and that, apparently, it was ihe duty of no one to keep it in a. proper state of repair. is wrong there, I think. son was appointed to perform this duty; but provision for his salary was left off the may judge from the past-to which only Estimates by accident, and it is only by means of an extra grant that the necessary money will be found. I believe that this case is only a sample of what obtains throughout the Commonwealth. We have not enough instructors, and so forth; but the present Minister is doing everything he can to bring the Department to a state of efficiency. congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on having charge of these Estimates, and I assure him that, if he continues to speak with such vigour and decision, the votes of this Department will be put through much more rapidly than those of other Departments. We may be, to some extent, at a disadvantage, owing to the Minister of Defence being in another place, because replies given here can only be of a tentative character, or, at any rate, of a mild sort, indicating that inquiries will be made of the real political head of the Department. I do not use these words with any disrespect to the Honorary Minister, because it is only to be expected that some Department must be so represented in this Chamber, and, for the time being, it is the Department of Defence that must suffer, if there is any agreement as to the meaning of the word ""suffer"" in this relation. I have no desire to enter into details, as did the honourable member for Corio, who is alarmed at the amount of time which was occupied in considering the question of uniforms, only to have the decision arrived at altered almost immediately. With every slight change at head-quarters, some little newidea in the way of uniforms and accompanying paraphernalia may be looked' for; and the changes, though apparently slight, may cost a good deal of money. This, however, seems inseparable from the clothing of any force, even the police and. the Public Service, where uniforms of any description are used. But one alarming feature of the Defence Estimates is the increase in the cost of Defence, without any corresponding increase in efficiency. The Honorary Minister took an active interest in matters military for some years; and, if he could explain to me that, during thepast two or three years there has been, or that there will be during the current financial year, consequent on the proposed expenditure, any reasonable improvement in> equipment and efficiency, there will be I W necessity for further remarks. Buti f we we can appeal-w e shall have, with each succeeding Minister, new-broom-like promises; and the Estimates will continue toincrease, particularly in the cost of administration, without, as I say, any corresponding increase in the efficiency of the variousforces. I understand that the Honorary Minister holds his present position largely on account of his practical knowledge of military matters; and he should be prepared to make a clear statement as to what improvements we may expect during the next seven months. The Estimates for this year show a proposed increase of £64,000 over the expenditure .of last year. of only £10,734 over the appropriation forlast year. ber must not attempt to mislead me in that, way, as is apparently the object of the compilation prepared by the Minister of Defence, and put into our hands a few minutes after we began to discuss the Estimates of the Department. The Honorary Minister has not looked into the subject with that care which usually characterizes, all that he does in matters political. The increase he refers to is merely the increase on last year's appropriation, which is very different from the increase on last year's. expenditure.

It may be something entirely new with respect to the Estimates, and something which seemingly is not provided -by the other Departments, but there was a strong probability of the Defence Estimates coming before the Committee several days .ago, and if that had happened this paper would not have been before us. 18th November. -cise date on which the Minister approved -of it, but it has probably had to go through various routine channels, and arrives here, so to speak, just when the -enemy has beaten us.

Do the Government propose to refrain from making new appointments, or will --they curtail the expenditure on camps this year, as was attempted to be done last year? I should be prepared to assist in -voting more money if we had any guarantee -that it would improve the efficiency of the Forces, or place us in a better position -from a defensive point of view. But I look with some doubt upon the gradual increase of expenditure under the heading of "" Central Administration,"" from which the we are not likely to receive any commensurate benefit. Out of a total increased expenditure of £ 6 4 , 0 0 0 on defence purposes for the whole of Australia, there is, this year, an increase of practically £ 6 , 6 0 0 for the Central Administration alone. It is explained in the memorandum that there is an increase of £ 2 , 0 2 6 under the heading of "" Pay,"" due to the appointment of two additional members to the Military Boarda Board which was entirely ignored by the late Government in the preparation of the DefenceB ill provision for the Inspector of Ordnance Machinery and his clerk, salary of an I m perial officer, who is detailed for duty in a new position of Director of Training and Operations, in the Department of the Chief of Intelligence, and the appointment of two additional clerks. The Minister, in his reply, might tell the Committee what justification exists for the increase of £ 6 , 6 0 0 for the Central Administration. Why was the strength of the Military Board increased,, and what benefit is likely to result from, its additional strength? What work are they now doing that was not done before by officers in the Forces, or by those who were members of the Board, and to what extent were the members of the Board overworked?

If it had devolved upon me to address the House upon the Defence Bill, I should have liked to have the opinion of a few of the senior officers who were cruelly and specifically ignored by the ex-Minister of Defence-officer s whose experience and standing justified their being consulted on so important a question. The Board appears to have been increased by at least one member to suit the particular political fancies of the last Minister. In some moment, guarded or unguarded, the Deakin Government decided to introduce a Bill dealing with what they termed universal training. looked around, perhaps not knowing overmuch on the subject themselves, for somebody to guide them. failed to find among the senior and responsible officers any who would father the scheme, it looked further afield, and found a junior officer who, with a laudable desire to be brought prominently before the political and military world, and to obtain rapid the strength of the Military Board, and promotion, gave the assurance that he shared the sentiments of Ministers right down to the ground. Thereupon he was dragged from his junior obscurity, and given ber believe in having a Military Board? temporary promotion, carrying with it increased pay, and, at the same time, he was made a member of the Military Board. This action of the Government increased the expense of the central administration"" °y that sum is too much to pay to a member of such a body as the Military Board; I complain that a position on the Board was made for this officer. He proceeded to draft a Defence Bill, which was such an abject failure that Ministers did not dare to proceed with it. We have not had an opportunity to discuss the proposal ot the late Government. I am sure that Ministers would have met their Waterloo hacf they asked the House to divide on it. The late Minister of Defence told us, on one occasion, that if he could find a Napoleon he would make him Commander-in-Chier, and abolish the Military Board. He was not able to .find a Napoleon; but, at any rate, he made great efforts to obtain for one officer the reputation of that great soldier. In my opinion, his action tended to the subversion of the discipline and ihe proper working of the Military Force.*. For a dilettanti Minister of Defence, who> had given no indication of the possession of knowledge of military matters, and less of a desire to learn anything on the subject, to pick out a junior officer, and place him oirn a level with seniors who, for many years, had done yeoman service, so that hemight draft a Bill to provide for compulsory universal training, was an action which Parliament should unmistakably resent, so that nothing of the kind may-occur in the future. This officer was promoted, and I find, from looking through the papers, -and 1 by reading the newspapers, that he has. been deferred to on every occasion, and his opinion asked on every subject. Had' the late Minister had his way, our army would have become, before long, all "" Legge."" Whatever may be this officer's They immediately ability, it is not reasonable to suppose that he is an expert on every conceivable subject, and it is unfair that, having been apAs it pointed merely as a whim of the late Minister, (he should be pushed, forward to the disadvantage of the Forces; because it must be expected that senior officers will resent his promotion. I do not know whether the present Ministry is ready to reduce to thus curtail the cost of the Central Administration. cussing that question; but I may say that the Board, as constituted, is not likely to give the best results. In saying that, I have no wish to reflect upon any of its per annum. I do not say that members. A little while ago, I asked what are the special duties of the officer to whom I have referred, and was informed that he fills the entirely new position of Military Secretary to the Board. Previous to his promotion, the secretarial work of the Board had been done by the Chief Clerk. I cannot say whether the Chief Clerk was overworked, but there was no complaint in military circles about the manner in which he performed his duties. His salary is only £ 5 8 0 ; but the new Military Secretary, who is not also called upon to act as Chief Clerk to the Department, anrj has a secretary at £350 to assist him, gets £600. The late Minister enumerated his duties under thirteen distinct heads, of which the first was the control of the ""arrangemente in connection with the introduction of a system of universal training.""

That cannot occupy much of his time, because the work is really done by the Printing Office, from which the regulations are issued. might regard this officer as overworked and underpaid, but the duty just named is so slight that it might well have been left unnoticed, had it not been for the desire of the late Minister to make excuses for the appointment. This officer has also to deal with "" miscellaneous legal questions not involving discipline."" I do not know whether he is by training a member of the legal fraternity. In any case, he is confined to the giving of advice on questions which do not involve discipline, the AdjutantGeneral naturally resenting interference with what comes within his province. The Military Secretary is also called upon to consider ""patterns of dress and equipment,"" and to prepare "" dress and equipment regulations,"" though, prior to his advent, this work was being done reasonably well by other officers.

Once a scale is determined on, it will do service for all time, and careful ordnance officers have the scales which are in force hung in their offices for reference at any moment. The Military Secretary has also to do with the "" appropriation and occupation of military buildings and offices,"" and with "" barrack services,"" whatever that may mean. He controls, too, the "" mobilization of material and horses,"" the mobilization of men being left to another officer, so that, while the Forces may be moved in time from one position to another, the material which should accompany them may be put on the train too early or_too late, or may not arrive at all. The Military Secretary has also to do with "" transport, including technical instruction and duties of the Army Service Corps and Veterinary Department."" on every subject. The"" arrangements in connection with moves and routes"" are in his hands; I do not know if he had to do with ""the recent Ministerial move. Finally, he is concerned with "" postal services."" [107] late Minister was at almost infinite pains to furnish this list of duties for an officer who was appointed to a certain position really for a particular purpose which is now among the things of the past In the circumstances, I think that the Ministry might consider whether-unles s new duties are opening up-the y cannot reduce the Military Board by at least one member. When I said just now that the constitution An outsider of the Military Board is not such as to give the best result to the Forces, I had in mind the fact that there are on the Board two or three militia officers who are still acting as Commanding Officers. I may at least refer to one, who is the officer commanding the 10th Infantry Regiment. He is the officer commanding the South Australian Brigade, and is also a member of the Military Board. He thus occupies three positions. I have not a word to say against the officer himself; but it seems to me that it is impossible for him to do justice to all three positions. When subjects arise out of his command as officer in charge ot an infantry regiment, and later on have to be dealt with by the Board, he enjoys a distinct advantage over officers occupying similar regimental positions, but who have neither a voice nor a vote on the Board. I do not think that the honourable member for Brisbane is a member of the Military Board; but he is certainly an officer in command of the Field Forces in Queensland. We have an officer holding a precisely similar position in South Australia, and to that extent they are on the same, footing. But there come times when subjects in connection with their brigades have to go before the Military Board. At that point, my honourable friend has no more to do with them; but the officer in South Australia, as a member of the Military Board, can state his own case before it , and vote upon it. We can see at once the inequality and the unfairness of allowing an officer commanding a Field Forcei n one State to have such an advantage over an officer occupying a similar position in another State, p'rom my point of view, it is neither correct nor fair. Civilian officers in active command ought not to be on the Military Board, since membership of it gives them a most unfair influence over the States He seems to be an expert Commandants. The permanent officers ir. each State are dependent upon their positions for an actual living; a civilian officer is not. With him military matters are almost a hobby. He takes them up in an enThe tirely different sense from the way in which they are taken up by a permanent officer, and he has an influence and power over that of the State Commandant, who is really appointed to have charge of him. We have, as a matter of fact, the position of a junior being able to take his case over the State Commandant's head and to decide it ; and, in addition to that, we have a junior officer, so to speak, deciding the case of the State Commandant on very important matters. In such circumstances, it is only natural to suppose that permanent officers, having to depend on their position for a living, will at times defer to the militia officer who has a vote on the Military Board, whereas, if they were untrammelled, they might differ very materially from the stand taken by him. I hope that the Ministry will see fit to alter the constitution of rhe Board. I am not asking them at present to attempt any drastic changes; but I appeal to them to remove some of the present anomalies, so that the efficiency of the Forces may be improved. Particularly would I ask the Ministry to look more carefully than has been done in the past into the regular increase in the cost of our Defence Forces without, so far as any Minister has been able to show, any corresponding increase in the efficiency of the Forces, or in the provision of material essential to their work. Colonel member going to test the feeling of the Committee as to the increase in the number of members on the Board? tary of the Military Board is concerned, I am; the other matters to which I referred are scarcely to be tested on the passing of the Estimates. ment of Secretary to the Board will be annulled, and at no loss to the officer concerned, who will merely return to the duties that he was previously performing in New South Wales. I have no doubt that he was discharging those duties with credit to himself and all concerned; but he is not required in his present position, and he would be there, I think, under circumstances that are likely to interfere with the working and discipline of our forces. There is one other point to which I wish to refer. Quite recently I asked for information concerning the balances of corps funds held in hand by the various regiments of infantry, artillerv. and light horse. WhilstI knew that a fair amount of money was so held, I was astonished to find that these several regiments had in hand over £27,000-al l money that has been voted to them by different Parliaments, and which has not been expended in the direction intended by Parliament. Colonel FOXTON I think that that is capable of explanation. any particular regiment. So far as the artillery are concerned, I notice that the battery funds are reasonably low, and I presume, therefore, that they are able to find means of expending these amounts. Colonel FOXTON -Indeed they are. able member is an artillery officer. Colonel FOXTON I am. to vote a. little extra to the artillery, because they are few in number and have much to do with these grants, and a little less to some of the regiments of light horse and infantry, because, according to information given to me, some of them have a difficulty in finding a means of expending the monev voted to them. We vote each year to the light horse, the infantry, and the artillery £ 2 per head, not of their strength, but of their establishment. On 30th June last, for instance, the establishment' of the militia was 17,777, but their actual strength was 16,154 men, or, roughly, 1,500 less than the establishment. Yet we voted to so that, even had they expended £ 2 per head of their actual strength, they would have had some £ 3 , 0 0 0 to spare. In scarcely one case is the strength of a regiment up to its establishment. I should not offer any complaint if , notwithstanding that fact, the regiments were able to expend the I hope that the appointmoney so voted to them; but when we find that the 3rd Australian Infantry Regiment, for instance, has in hand no less than £ 2 , 6 8 0 I do not know what its actual strength is-w e must be satisfied that an accumulation of funds has been going on for vears. If I am correctlv informed, some regiments actuallv have public moneys invested for given periods. Colonel FOXTON -Wher e is the 3rd Regiment stationed? Then we find that the Western Australian Light Horse have £ 1 , 1 3 3 in hand; the ist Infantry Regiment, New South Wales, £ 1 , 1 6 0 ; the 4th Infantry Regiment, New South Wales, £ 1 , 9 1 4 ; the Australian Rifle Regiment, £ 1 , 4 0 0 ; the DerwentI n fantry Regiment, Tasmania, £ 1 , 3 2 7 ; the Tasmanian Rangers£ 1 , 4 6 2 ; and the New",24,Department Of Defence

It is possible that some of the officers may be saving up these funds for the purpose of providing their regiments with a new clothing outfit, but that does not touch the point that Parliament, every year, votes for a specific purpose or purposes, £ 2 per head of their establishment to these regiments; that all the money so voted has not been expended, and that if this saving up is for a purpose other than what was intended Colonel FOXTON -No. member say that the annual vote is not sufand, if I . may say so, much approval to ficient ?

145,Mr Roberts,"A t the present time,annum per capita; and the annual expenditure in a given year may be, perhaps, three times the amount allowed for that year. It is, therefore, necessary, so to speak, either to incur liabilities, and wipe these out by means of future annual allowances, or to practically starve the corps until there are funds to pay in cash. In either case, it will be seen that it is sometimes absolutely necessary for a commanding officer to accumulate a considerable sum of money, and, whichever course is adopted, he will find himself, during some given year, immediately prior to re-equipping the regiment, in possession of very considerable funds. The honourable member for Adelaide quoted some figures in regard to the brigade which I lately commanded, and showed that that brigade had only £ 4 8 . as the artillery is concerned, the position is entirely different. Colonel FOXTON how that is so. The Field Artillery is a popular arm of the service, and, when other arms are considerably depleted from one cause or another, the former keep up to their f u l l establishment, or, at any rate, something ""like 90 per cent, of it. This fact has a distinct bearing on what the honourable member for Adelaide said in reference to the method of making capitation allowances. A corps which is constantly up to its f u l l strength must necessarily become worse off financially than one which is only up to half its strength, and has, therefore, £ 4 per head or twice the amount of the per capita allowance to spend. premium on keeping a corps below its strength. Colonel FOXTON -But it must be remembered that the commanding officers have no personal interest in keeping a corps below its strength; on the other hand, they would much prefer to be at the head of a f u l l corps, than to have money in the bank. certained whether large funds were held year after year. Colonel FOXTON -There is another reason why the Field Artillery should receive a larger allowance than that given to the infantry. amount of equipment to look after; and, indeed, it is sometimes necessary for a commanding officer to contribute his private funds to that end. This should not be the case, considering that, taking all in all, artillery Commanding Officers are probably the hardest worked men in the service. I am surprised to learn that any regiment has such a sum as £ 2 , 6 0 0 to its credit, and the matter is certainly worth looking; into. It seems to me that the particular corps referred to must either have been, to a certain extent, starved-eve n making all allowance for what I have said-o r it must be, or have been, at a very low ebb in regard to numbers. I was a member of a Committee which, two or three years ago, I think, recommended that the system of giving allowances on the basis of establishment, rather than on the actual numbers in the corps, should be abandoned. In my own judgment, it would be far better to adopt the plan formerly carried out in Queensland, under which each man cost the Government only £ 1 2s. 6d., and found his own uniform, and kept it in repair; but this And I can show idea does not seem to find favour amongst those who have never actually seen it tried. I followed the honourable member for Corio ia regard to the charges against the management of the Ordnance Branch, in regard tc private work done for certain officers. Although there was a certain amount of work done in that way years ago, still it was very much less than we were led to expect. Most of the work seems to have been of a quasi public character, such as the mending of arms, trophies, and so forth, brought from South Africa. had been taken to South Africa, and used in the war ! not be permitted .for one moment at tlie Woolwich Arsenal. stands and musical boxes? Colonel FOXTON I am glad to learn that the practice has been entirely stopped and that the offences, if they may be so described, were of a very trifling nature. Turning to another matter, I have been It could easily be astold that a published article, for which the Military Secretary, a member of the Board, is responsible, has appeared regarding the intention of the Government, as to drastic and immediate changes in uniform.

151,Mr Crouch,"But what about umbrellataining all the evidence before he comes to a decision. Colonel FOXTON -There was some justification for the proposal for a drastic simplification of uniforms, so long as there was before Parliament a proposition fot universal compulsory service. But that tias ceased to be before Parliament as a practical proposition. Until it is adopted we must rely upon voluntary enlistment. If every man in the country is compelled to serve in the Defence Force, an absolutely free hand can be exercised in the direction of extreme simplicity of the uniform which he shall wear, because he is bound to serve and to wear the uniform that is given to him. enlistment is depended upon, there must be taken into consideration the feeling of pride which a man has in the uniform which he proposes to wear. think the uniform makes the soldier? Colonel FOXTON I do not, but it has a great deal to do with inducing him to join. I do not know the circumstances under which the honourable member enlisted. Colonel FOXTON I am sure that the uniform of the artillery corps into which the honourable member was going had something to do with his decision. a soldier. Colonel FOXTON -Underlyin g that was the feeling that he would like to wear the Queen's uniform. uniform. It is a question of plain as against fancy uniforms. Colonel FOXTON -Every time there has Ijeen a change it has meant further expense to those already in the service. make too much fuss even about the simplification of uniforms. Colonel FOXTON The honourable member for Adelaide has probably seen the amount of balance lying to the credit -of the Moreton regiment. ment, they have £529. Colonel FOXTON -The fact that they have a balance might be accounted for in other ways, but it is a fact that, after the change from the red full-dress uniform that they used to wear in the old Queensland days to plain khaki, the regiobment fell away considerably. The commandant complained constantly in his annual reports that the regiment was not up to anything like its strength. I do not think it was up to even half its strength. The red uniform was restored, and the regiment went up to its full strength once more. I do not say that the increase was entirely due to the reversion to the old uniform, but the facts are significant. If any change is contemplated, I hope it will not put men who have already spent considerable amounts, and given many years of good service to the Forces, to further expense in providing new uniforms. A sensible idea on this point would be to form local Boards, somewhat on the prinBut when voluntary ciple of those recently formed of militia officers to consider the best means of reducing clerical work in the Militia Force. Those local Boards met in each State, composed as they were of men who were deeply interested in the reduction of clerical work in the militia, and who had' had practical experience of what was required of them in the way of returns, and the keeping of unnecessary books and forms.

It may be good or bad, but the organization is there. It was on the question of equipment that the plea was put forward that we have always been in a state of transition. Thirty thousand is a very moderate estimate of those whom we could put into the field as trained men in a case of emergency.

Still, we are better off sat in this Parliament since the inception of Federation, with a growing feeling of disappointment at the unpractical and inept methods of parliamentary procedure and party Government. Amongst the many illustrations of this state of affairs, obvious toany one who has given the matter consideration, the most lamentable and striking is the condition of the Defence Department. During the past seven years, as many sets of Estimates have been introduced, framed on orthodox lines, and the usual grumbling and criticism has taken place in connection with them, with the result that the Defence Department is in a state of chaos, things being little better now than when we first entered upon our work.

168,Mr Fowler,"I 'am content with a-Federation, whose statements were echoed in the breasts of many of the people of Australia, who realized that there should be united action in this matter. Yet, today, those who have investigated the subject complain of chaos, lack of system, absence of equipment, and almost complete inability of the Forces to do the work expected of them. This is the position of affairs at a time when the Empire i§, not so much drifting into a. waT which I believe will be a world-wide disaster, but is marching steadily towards it, recognising it as inevitable. We, in Australia, know that this great, rich, undeveloped -continent will be considered a prize worth a special effort to obtain, yet our attitude resembles that of the Roman Emperor who amused himself by fiddling in his palace while his city was burning. Another striking commentary upon our methods of government is the thin attendance of honourable members. How many ex-Ministers of Defence are now present? ill. that, though I am afraid that neither Ministers nor members take the earnest interest in this matter which the situation -demands, and that the time is not far distant when condemnation will be heaped on -our heads for having played with this great question. How is it that revelations of ineffectiveness are always made by private members, not by responsible Ministers? A member has told us to-day that the Field Artillery is practically -useless for active service, because of the want of ammunition waggons. I have no -doubt that that is only one of many instances of serious lack in equipment; but I do not remember that any Minister has taken it upon himself to make a thorough and drastic inquiry as to our defects in this respect, and after doing so, has told Parliament what was required, stating his readiness,, as a means of calling the attention of the country to the situation, tp reshould, though the matter which I am dissign if the sum needed was not voted. We -continue on the old lines, and I am afraid that little will be changed until something like disaster overtakes us. I do not wish to accuse the present Minister of lacking -energy or earnestness. He has not yet had .an opportunity to show what he is as an .administrator. I ask him not to trouble :so much about the fripperies of costume -as to give earnest attention to important --matters of efficiency. I have denounced military millinery; but, though a great deal of mischief has been done by what has already been approved of, more may be done in undoing what I regard as a mistake. If we had a Minister strong enough to put aside precedent and formality, and, with a stroke of his pen, abolish the mere fripperies of uniform without interfering with proper military appearance and distinction, I should say let it be done; but, as any change must mean the issue of another set of elaborate regulations and the incurring of considerable expense, I say, "" Go on with things which are more important."" The Minister's first duty is to ascertain what is needed to make our Forces efficient for the field. He should obtain a fearless report on the subject, and let us know how we stand. Under the present system of collective Ministerial responsibility, we do not know what happens in Cabinet in regard to the financing of the Departments. The .Minister who is representing the Minister of Defence tells us, when confronted with the serious imperfections which exist, that money for necessary equipment cannot be obtained. Would it not be better if each Minister told us what amount he needed, leaving the Treasurer to reply, so that Parliament could decide exactly how the revenue of the Commonwealth should be expended? Under the present system, the Estimates go backward and forwards between Ministers and the Treasurer, until some compromise is arrived at, and the Government faces Parliament with the tacit understanding that not too much is to be made known as to how settlements were effected. In my opinion, each Minister should take Parliament into his confidence, and place on it the responsibility of saying what sum is needed for the administration of his Department. be in their places to hear the views of members ? cussing is of more importance.

That might cause some demoralization in certain quarters; but I really think it is the only satisfactory means of placing the defences on an altogether new basis. A few years ago the honourable member for Ballarat told us that there had been two or three stages of defence reorganization during his time in Federal politics, but that the Government with which he was connected would place the defences on a basis satisfactory, not only to the Government, but to the House and the country. However, the Defence Forces are as chaotic, if not more chaotic, than they were when the Department was taken over. honourable member for Ballarat covers the All I whole of the eight years, except, perhaps, eleven months, of the Commonwealth Parliament. and jealousy I never came across such a lot in my life as those who control the But the evidence Defence Forces!

The honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Adelaide, and' God help the defences of this the honourable member for Brisbane, havedealt with the general question of the M i l i tary Forces in a manner in which that question has seldom been dealt with in this House. We have this afternoon, in my opinion, had some of the best speeches, ever delivered here on the matters that are now before us. It is most peculiar that, if there is any saving, it is alwayson the Forces; and not on the administrative branch. This, I take it , is simply because those in the administrative branch look after themselves-the y are nearest the Minister, and are feathering their littlenests. If we are to have value for our money, let us have a Defence Force which, if small, is efficient. The honourable member for Brisbane tells us that, although we havetroops, we have no means of serving themwith ammunition, and under the circumstances we might as well, as the right honourable member for Swan said on one occasion, arm them with picks and"" pitchforks..",33,Foxton Is The ° Honourable Them £ 2 Per Head Of Their Establishment

As to the memorandum, the least the Government could have done was to place it in the hands of honourable members a week ago. Honourable members have a right to every particle of information that the Government can furnish, so that they may know what they are doing when they vote money. You, Mr Chairman, may be quicker than I am at taking a document in at a glance, but I do not think that even you could understand this memorandum, with all its figures and conundrums, in the few minutes that we have had to study it. I cannot understand why the Government issued it at the eleventh hour.

Every year I have asked for information in regard to military maps, and have always received evasive answers. Until eighteen months ago, there were no military maps of the Commonwealth in the possession of the Defence Department. That is a nice state of affairs. Before the Intelligence Branch was formed, there was no military map of any one of the States, to say nothing of Australia, available. Germans and Japanese have them. about France than the French did themselves. I ask the Minister now if the Department is yet in possession of military maps of the different States?

A number of professional men are giving tlieir time and brains to the service of the Commonwealth in that regard. With reference to making our own cartridges, honourable members know the trouble we had to get ammunition and small-arms factories established. We were told that it could not be done effectively, and that it would cost too much. We were supposed to be a young and growing nation, and yet we were not in a position to straighten a bent rifle-barrel. from every part of the House asked, times out of number, that the Government should start a factory of some description, so as to make a start, but nothing was done 'until last year the ex-Minister of Defence tabled a motion in favour of beginning those two factories, and the result was a unanimous vote from all sides of the House. I firmly believe that every honourable member would be only too glad to vote the necessary money if he thought we should get an effective force by means of it. The honourable member for Brisbane mentioned the trouble that we should have in taking ammunition to the front. A force without ammunition would be better out of the firing line altogether. At MajubaH ill , the only reason the Boers drove us off was that our ammunition was spent, and there was no more to take its place. I saw some of the Highlanders throwing the canteens off their backs at the Boers. The only way that we can prove whether our Forces are efficient or not is to mobilize them, and see what is in them, and in the officers. That should be done, even if it costs ,£20,000 or ,£30,000. The defects of the Defence Forces of different countries are found out in that way. They are discovered either in actual or in sham warfare, when the troops go through service conditions. If they have defects, those defects are shown even in a small line of march. If I were Minister of Defence, that would be one of my first acts. either our strength or our weakness. We should see at once by that means whether we had an effete force or a fighting force. Captain Collins appears in the administrative division at a salary of £900 a j'ear. I intend to try to transfer that item to the External Affairs Department. We should not have a Secretary in name only. I propose to move that the item be left out. External Affairs Department have beer* dealt with. provide for Captain Collins' salary by Supplementary Estimates, or in some other way. The salary of the Director of Stores comes under the same category. Why should the Defence Department be debited with those two salaries when the officers are in England? If they are doing administrative work for the External Affairs Department, let that Department, and not the Defence Honourable members Department, carry the baby. We are asked to vote their salaries as if they were here and doing their work, whereas other officers are doing their work for them, and should be paid for it. I wish to ask the Minister what has been done with regard to the eligibility of members of the Naval and Military Forces for appointment to positions in the Public Service. Why these men should be tabooed from appointments to positions* that they are the most competent to fill I do not know. In one case the position of senior boatman for the Trade and Customs Department was advertised. Some of the _ men at the Naval Depot at Williamstown applied. One of them, runs the launch for the Naval Depot.. That shows his competency, and yet the Public Service Commissioner said"" he could not take into account the fact that he had served the Commonwealth, and the State before the Commonwealth, faithfully for years. An outsider, who had not the same knowledge, or ability to manage theboat, was appointed. The other man was tabooed simply because he was a naval'i man. That is simply monstrous, and nohonorable member would sanction it for five minutes once it was known. On another occasion an officer in Brisbane, who had served in the Queensland DefenceForcefor a number of years, and who, I think, had been to South Africa, was doing certainwork in the ordnance store faithfully and' : well. Knowing the duties, he applied for I would show the position as soon as it was advertised, but because he was in the Military Forces he was passed over, and an outsider who-did not know anything about the business was given the appointment. The soonerthat state of affairs is altered, the better. The Acting Secretary for Defence tells methat the Public Service Commissioner says that he cannot do anything in the matter until the Public Service Act has been,, amended.",35,Foxton Is The ° Honourable Them £ 2 Per Head Of Their Establishment

Bill of one clause to amend it? would be a very serious measure to bring forward at this stage of the session. I do not think that honourable members are willing to consider, prior to the prorogation, more measures than are now on the business-paper. If we had a guarantee that they would remain here to pass a Bill to amend the Public Service Act, we would take the matter in hand, but we cannot do what is impossible. However, the subject will not be lost sight of, and will be dealt with at the earliest moment. With regard to the matters raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio, it is not intended that militia officers, in being appointed to the permanent force, shall have preference over the permanent men. The regulation to which he has. referred was introduced because of the motion carried at the instance of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who considered it unjust to militia officers not to give them the opportunity to be transferred to the permanent force, and unwise for the country to deprive itself of the services of men who might do valuable work on the permanent staff. Minister of Defence has done all that is possible, in the few* days in which he has been in office, to set his Department in order; but serious attention will be given to the honourable member's complaints. The honourable member for Adelaide made a very powerful speech. His statements will be carefully noted, and the valuable advice which he gave will be utilized. He asked for information as to the probable savings of the Department. Savings will be effected on a number of items appearing here and there throughout the Estimates. The officer in charge of the cordite factory is a State official, who is not likely to be relieved of his present duties until about July. Again, it is not likely that the naval officers for Western Australia and Tasmania, for whose salaries provision is made, will be appointed during the present year, and, in connection with other proposals for expenditure, it will not be possible, owing to the advanced period of the year in which the Appropriation Act will become law, that the sums appropriated will be spent. It is estimated that savings of something lite £20,000 will be effected. As to the Military Secretary, if the Minister finds that his full time cannot be occupied usefully with work connected with the Central Administration, the strength of the Military Board will be reduced; but if he is a useful officer, doing work hitherto not efficiently performed, he will be retained in his present position. There have not been two new appointments to the Military Board. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the cost of the Central Administration should not be increased without an increase in the efficiency of the Department generally, and should be required only by an increase in the number of men to be controlled. It is the intention of the Minister that the Central Administrative staff shall not be added to unnecessarily. The honourable member for Maranoa may rest assured that the Intelligence Corpsa new arm for the establishment of which the late Minister deserves credit-wil l do all that can be done in the preparation of accurate maps. Colonel McCay, who is at the head of the corps, will be assisted by the Minister as much aa possible. But the Forces cannot be made efficient unless the money necessary to make them so is appropriated by Parliament. It is my duty to acquaint honourable members with the true position. % I am satisfied that the present so? so. I have said that sufficient money is not provided on these Estimates to increase the efficiency of the Forces. Unfortunately, past Ministers have not always been as frank as they should have been, and Parliament has taken the view that savings can properly be effected by reducing the Military Estimates. and not expended so far as the Forces generally are concerned, every penny voted for the Central Administration is spent.",36,Foxton Is The ° Honourable Them £ 2 Per Head Of Their Establishment

240,Mr Archer,"The defence authoriof organization. stance, expect the gentleman who first mentioned this matter to me, Captain Richard, manager of the Mount Morgan mine, to initiate the movement. distinctly a matter for the Defence Department to take ini hand. we have heard, especially during this debate, it is ' clear, to my mind, that the time has not arrived to embark on the extensive scheme of universal training proposed by the late Government. which was really the Attorney-General in the present Administration. tleman made it his special hobby, and did great work in fostering the movement throughout the country. I have no quarrel with him on that account, for I consider that anything that will induce the people to realize the necessity for an adequate defence system is good work done for Australia. ing this debate lends force to the argument of those who, while not opposed to universal training, when it is necessary, object to its institution at the present time, when we are not prepared for it . The organization of our present Defence Force, which is a comparatively small one, is admittedly inefficient, and it would be absolutely useless to endeavour, as was proposed, to extend it into a system of universal training during the next year or would be but partially trained, and unfit. and use our present means of defence as to make efficient the force we already possess. It has always seemed to me that our crying want-and I speak with some diffidence on this subject, as I am new to the matter-is the appointment of one permanent head to control our Forces. The best man obtainable should be secured for the position. A t present we have too much control by Boards. I have nothing to say against the Inspector-General; I believe that he is a thoroughly good man, and I know that he is keenly interested in his work, but he has not the necessary authority. roughly efficient man at the head of our Forcesa mani who has had the experience necessary to enable him to grasp every detail of our service, and to deal with -it. He should be given power through the Minister or through Parliament to do so. I do not approve of the We could not, for insystem under which we have, controlling our Forces, various Boards, consisting of half-a-dozen men, either falling out with one another, anxious to placate each other, It is or it may be having amongst their number one strong man who is able to carry the From what rest with him. No one has heard of a business concern which was absolutely successful unless it was controlled, not by a Board, but by one strong and able man. Silting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. for dinner, I was urging that those who had gone into the matter must recognise that, having regard to the condition of our existing Forces, we do not seem to be prepared to launch upon an extensive scheme of universal training. I am sure that the late Ministry were sincere in their advocacy of the system; but I do not believe that the country is yet ready to endorse it. We But what has been said durought not at present to do more than extend the principle to our Cadet Force's, to compulsory Cadet training--and that is the one direction in which the scheme of the late Government fell short. They did not propose to apply the system thoroughly in a direction from which the very best results could be obtained, and which must be the basis of our defence. That, however, is a matter with which I shall be able to deal when the Defence Bill is again under consideration. I should two.

The proposal of the late Government is utterly foreign to what I believe to be the view of most honourable members, that these factories should be established within Federal territory. supposing that one penny will be spent this year in either direction. lieve that either the whole amount voted will be spent, or the Government will be involved in negotiations from which they will be unable to withdraw, except with considerable loss to the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, I believe that a site for the cordite factory has already been secured in Victoria. The decision of the late Government that the two factories should be established in different States is an extraordinary one. as far as possible, to keep both of them within a reasonable area. gether. orable member mean to say that the cordite factory, will be, so to speak, quarantinedthat no other building will be allowed to be erected within some distance of it. depend on the size of the factory. the storage of explosives are isolated, so a factory for the manufacture of cordite would not be surrounded by dwellings. But it is to be assumed that reasonable care will be exercised in working both these factories, whether they are established in State or in Federal territory, and that conpower to raise a fort. sequently a very large area will not have to be set apart for them. We may consider ourselves within reasonable distance of the establishment of a Federal city within Federal Territory; and the proper place for a factory of this description is within that territory. As to the small arms establishment at Lithgow, a most serious state Whilst of affairs is possible, though such an observation might lead to the accusation that the State of New South Wales is viewed as foreign and unfriendly. We never know, however, what may arise -in the future, and the attitude of certain State legislators at present might lead one to suppose that under certain circumstances, there might be direct opposition to the policy or proposals of the Federal authority. Any student of history, particularly of the history of the United States, knows that the bitterest opposition to the Central Government came from within the borders of the Union. ton was three times raided by the opposing States. more reasonable the proposal that the small arms factory should be within Federal Territory. within State Territory or Federal Territory, it is equally liable to seizure by a superior force. of the Federal Government would have to be defended.

The Honorary Minister evidently knows no reason why this officer should remain where he is. It is impossible for the Minister of Defence to say why he has been appointed. The late Minister of Defence supplied, in answer to a question, a statement of the officer's duties, which I read this afternoon. No man who has even a small knowleoge of military matters will assert that there is any necessity for him to remain in this position now that the universal training scheme has gone by the board.

Presumably, he was doing useful work in his former position, but that cannot be said of him now. A list of his duties, as enumembers, merated by the ex-Minister, is to be found on page 1826 of Hansard, and I have already detailed them again this afternoon. His primary duty, that of making arrangements for a system of compulsory military I urge upon the attentraining, has come to an end, since the Bill for bringing about the scheme of the late Government has practically been dropped. position has now been filled. the ordinary course. But Ave should not be expected to endorse an unjustifiable appointment, and the officer who succeeded him can go back to his former position. Attention has now been drawn to the fact that our military expenditure increases I have already yearly, the most notable increase being in connection with the Central Administration. Almost every penny voted for the Central Administration is spent, although large sums appropriated for the Forces gene-. rally remain unexpended. The increase in the cost of the Central Administration has not resulted in an increase in the efficiency of the Forces. While, a few years ago, a certain number of officers were able to handle our troops,, we now require more, although the Forces have not been increased, except in respect to cadets and the rifle clubs.

The penalties provided in the Bill were so ludicrous as to make it obvious that the measure was not put forward with any sincerity. For instance, it was proposed that youths of eighteen should be told that, unless they submitted to military training, they could not obtain old-age pensions when they attained the age of sixty-five. A youth of eighteen who is looking for an old-age pension is not fitted for the army, navy, or any other service. The other penalties were equally absurd. The duties enumerated by the late Minister as attaching to the office of Military Secretary must overlap those of other officers, who, so far as we know, are not overworked. unfortunate that we should have to deal with the Estimates in the absence, through illness, of the late Minister. I have sufficient confidence in the honourable gentleman to feel sure that he did not make the appointment of Military Secretary as an act of favouritism; he promoted this officer because he considered him a smart man, capable of doing useful and necessary work. In the past, it has been too much the custom to promote old officers. I said on a former occasion that it would be more profitable if we pensioned off some of the older men, to give an opportunity to energetic juniors. In my opinion, the present Minister, like his predecessor, will do what he considers right in the interests of Australia, and he should be given an opportunity to deal with this matter after he has made himself fully acquainted with the facts of the case. Sydney) [8.37] I have taken exception to the increase in the cost of the Administrative Staff without a corresponding increase in the Forces, and consequently am prepared to support an amendment to reduce the amount.

If he is a very strong advocate of that system, and is capable of. inspiring a Minister, I would ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defenceto request him to extend his studies to theworking of the territorial army and other schemes at Home. We were told recently, by the ex-Minister of Defence that theterritorial army scheme was a failure.

If they say it is part of their policy, as it was the policy of the last Ministry, to go on with the universal compulsory service scheme, there may be something to be said for the presence upon the Board of that officer, who is an ardent advocate, and, I believe, practically the author, of the scheme. Otherwise, I do not see what he is there for. How many officers of the permanent and instructional staff were passed over in order that he might be put upon the Board? he is a good man or not.

This indicates that he was put on the Board for a special purpose, and that, when his services in connection with it were at an end, he would revert to his original rank of major and his former position.

In Victoria there is what is known as the right 'wing of this particular regiment, which is stationed at Ballarat, and the left wing, stationed at Bendigo. I asked the iate Minister of Defence several questions in regard to this matter; because the left wing, which is drawn from some portions of my electorate, feel that they have been unfairly dealt with, the centralizing principle apparently being developed in Ballarat. in the left wing, who, by reason of seniority or otherwise, are entitled to commissions are not receiving what they -conceive to be their due; and there is a feeling of unrest. In matters military, a great essential is that every man should feel he is being rewarded and promoted according to his merits; and I should like some assurance from the Minister that whatever is done in regard to this particular regiment, shall be done in the interests, not only of those members of the force situated in Ballarat, but also in the interests of those who are in the left wing.

Defence make two regiments in this case? be no "" wing "" system in any part of Australia for the future. Bendigo and Ballarat are the only places where the system was adopted, and the whole question has been gone into by the Minister of Defence. this the only regiment that is to have an orderly-room clerk and an assistant adjutant? AlthoughI do not understand the term "" wing, "" this is not the only regiment in the Commonwealth similarly situated-that is, with one portion in one part of a town or State, and another portion in another; and it follows that there may be further requests for orderly-room clerks and assistant adjutants, though I never before heard of such an officer as the latter. there is no other regiment situated as is the 7th. may not be used; but there is no doubt that one portion of a regiment may be situated at Quorn and another at Balaclava in South Australia. We have in that State the 16th and 17th Regiments of Light Horse, one in the metropolitan area, and the other embracing the Several officers whole State, with hundreds of miles between the various squadrons. While the officer commanding a regiment may live in the south or north, the Adjutant is in Adelaide or some other central position, and they meet when they can. If the Minister. intends to permit the appointment of an assistant adjutant and orderly room clerk for this particular regiment, which will entail a certain amount of expense, solelv because, according to his statement, portions of the regiment are separated by considerable distances, he will have similar demands from every regiment in Australia similarly situated.

There is a full regiment at Bendigo and Ballarat combined. the officers commanding each wing were of equal rank, but the Ballarat officer has now been given a higher rank, with the result that the whole of the correspondence has to go through him. The ambition of those two great centres is to form separate regiments, to enrol their squadrons in the outlying districts, and to have tlieir respective commanding officers communicating direct with Head-Quarters. that this will cause a little expense, but either these mounted infantrv regiments are worthv of being maintained in each centre, or they should be abolished altogether.

Some of the clubs up there are in very sparsely-settled districts, and although there is an amplitude of Crown lands that might be selected for the purposes of rifle ranges they seem to experience great difficulty in obtaining one. That is not due to any obstacle being placed in the way of a selection by the State Government; by .whom the delay is occasioned I cannot I am constantly receiving letters and telegrams from secretaries of clubs asking me to expedite the arrangements for gazetting them, and granting them ranges. I must say that when I bring such requests before the Department every attention is given to them. But I should! The area so like to know why it is necessary for the secretaries of these clubs to have to invoke my assistance in their efforts to expedite these arrangements. In one case something like two years was spent in an effort to form a club, and to have it gazetted. Difficulty was experienced in obtaining the requisite information. When I brought the matter under the notice of the Department I was immediately supplied with copies of the rules and regula1 tions applying to the formation of rifle clubs, and soon after I forwarded them to the secretary the club was gazetted. The point that I wish to make is that the information I obtained at the headquarters, Melbourne, should have been supplied from the State head-quarters. Requests to be gazetted should be granted* immediately, for undoubtedly a great deal of enthusiasm is displayed in the rifle club movement by men in outlying parts of the Commonwealth. In some places rifle practice is their only recreation, and* they indulge in practice and in competitions on days that are not usually devoted to such work in other parts of the Commonwealth. The whole matter deserves the consideration of the Minister, and I I ask him to accept mv astrust that it will receive his attention. Applications of the kind to which I have referred ought to meet with the greatest encouragement at head-quarters. to know what provision has been made for the inspection of corps in the outlying parts of my electorate?

A few weeks ago an inspecting officer visited Roma, to put the Light Horse through their facings. The officer commanding the cadets there requested him to inspect them, but he replied that he could not do so. It would seem that the rule is that a special officer shall be sent from Brisbane to inspect the lads, and see what progress they are making. The inspecting officer, although on the spot, was afraid to comply with the request of the cadet officer because he feared that by doing so he would trench upon the work of another branch of the Department. The State Commandant was appealed to, but he said he did not think that the inspection of cadets catne within the pale of the officer. means a w i l f u l waste of public money -The honourable member for Maranoa is cadet officer finding that he had exhausted business-like method.

Apparently, according to the memorandum, there is a decrease in the provision, of £ 1 1 , 5 4 6, while there is a special provision of £ 1 5 , 0 0 0, which really means an extra provision of ,£3,500 for ammunition. posed to be war reserve gets below a certain standard, it must be brought up again. but is this £ 1 1 , 5 4 6 a decrease on the amount expended last year for ordinary ammunition? for new rifles, in addition to the ammunition required for war stores. general contingencies, on page 163, I find £ 1 , 2 5 0 for railway fares and freight. ,£500 for steamer and coach fares and freight, and £ 1 , 2 5 0 for ""other travelling expenses."" find, under ""contingencies,"" £ 1 , 1 5 0 for railway fares and freight, £ 5 0 for steamer and coach fares and freight, and £ 1 5 0 for "" other travelling expenses.""

He returns to Brisbane again, catches the night train, and leaves by the Bingera for Charters Towers. He returns to Brisbane once more, and after staying there leaves again for Thursday Island. Why is not the inspection made by going from Brisbane right up to Thursday Island, calling at the various places in their proper order ? It must necessarily involve a needless expenditure for the officer to return to Brisbane so frequently. a memorandum, and inquire why the practice described by the honourable member is followed. Air.

Division 189 (Central Staff), £11,437. a few statements to make with regard to country mail routes. Every session complaints are made with respect to mails in different parts of the country electorates. My experience is that the Department makes use of every chance to work the confidence trick on my electors living in the back parts of Queensland. The Department calls for applications from persons willing to undertake the running of mails. If the amount of a tender is over and above what the Department think is fair, it calls upon the residents living on the route to make up' the deficiency or be deprived of their mail servioe. In many parts of my constituency, and that of the honourable member for Kennedy, there are fortnightly services. The only means by which people living in the back blocks can know how the world is going on outside their particular sphere is through the instrumentality of the fortnightly mail. But, instead of the Department helping those people, and encouraging others to go on the land, they put every obstacle in the way of their enjoying mail facilities. I have been asked to mention one case in particular. I refer to the mail service from Muckadilla to Wemmles. I wish to enlist the sympathy of the whole of the representatives of country districts. Do honourable members think it fair, just, or reasonable that people who pioneer the country should be deprived of their weekly or fortnightly mail services when residents of Melbourne have three deliveries a day, and howl if they are not up to time? Onlv to-day the honourable member for North Sydney asked how many deliveries there were per day within a certain radius of Sydney. I did not notice the answer, but I know they have more than two. In those circumstances surely the representatives of metropolitan districts will not deprive us of [108]2 a fortnightly service. In many towns in my constituency and in many districts along the routes, the arrival of the coach is a red-letter day for the whole district. If the policy of this Government is to deprive the people in country districts of their mail services, the sooner I see them out of office the better I shall be pleased. We have had a succession of Ministries that do not care a jot about country districts. They are all alike, They think that the whole of the Commonwealth is centred round the particular localities which are fortunate enough to have a large population. But for these people going into the back-blocks and pioneering the country, there would be no need for three deliveries a day in the cities. In fact there would be no big cities. Those people pay the same postage .as every one else does, and yet the Department put a further tax on them, as has happened on the particular mail route that I have indicated. The following appeared in the Western Star, published at Roma on Wednesday, 25th November lastA meeting of the subscribers to the Muckadilla-The Wemmles mail service was held at "" Blairmack,"" the residence of Mr J. Grieve, on Thursday evening last, to protest against the demand of a subsidy of £11 for the carriage of mail matter once a week between the places mentioned. Mr P. Hoskin was elected chairman, and Mr A. Walker was appointed secretary, on the motion of Messrs. R. Grieve, senior, and John Grieve. It was announced that the lowest tender for the service was £37 per annum, of which the Government would pay £26 , and the subscribers were notified that, unless they were prepared to pay the balance of £11 for the coming year it would be discontinued. The burden falls on the shoulders of Messrs. _ P. Hoskin, O'Sullivan Bros., W. Munro, senior, W. Munro, junior, J. Grieve, R. Grieve, senior, and Adam Grieve, who, for their own convenience and that of their employees, last year had to pay a similar amount. This novel method of levying further taxation on settlers who have already a fair amount to meet, what with income tax, Divisional Board, Marsupial Board, and other rates, was considered grossly unjust, and it was pointed out that if the Commonwealth Government can afford to spend thousands of pounds on entertaining the American Fleet and distinguished visitors, it would surely not begrudge, on the principle that ""Charity begins at home,"" a paltry "" tenner"" for the convenience of a class of people it professes to be most anxious to serve. On the motion of Messrs. J. Grieve and R. Grieve, the secretary was requested to write to the Deputy Postmaster-General, through Mr J,'. Page, M.H.R., and to the Deputy Postmaster-General, through Mr J. M . Hunter, M.L.A., asking that the demand for further subscriptions towards the carriage of the mail in question be cancelled, and pointing out that, if inquiries are made, it will be found that the amount of subscriptions is nearly, if not",58,Brown Calare

As a member of the State Parliament prior to Federation, I often had occasion to interview officers in the Post and Telegraph Department of that State, and met there men of large experience, capable of rendering brilliant service.

In the old days, when I interviewed the Deputy Chief with a cheery smile, and were glad to see me in regard to any work that might be needed in my electorate. Now, however, they greet me with a look of blank despair. They are working under a system of administration under which, since the inception of Federation, they have been made mere machines and tools for Ministerial delay. The officers of the Department are made a means of deceiving, not only honourable members, but all their constituents.

The people cannot carrv on their businesses without up-to-date facilities. They are handicapped if they have not the facilities enjoyed by their competitors. When I remember the promises made to me by the late Postmaster-General, and find that the people have been disappointed, it is a matter of surprise to me that in Wollongong, Bowral, and such districts, indignation meetings have not been called to discuss the non-fulfilment of these promises. It may be out of consideration for me that they have not been called, but if I were the president of one of the shire councils cr the mayor of one of the important towns in my district, I should have called indignation meetings long ago to protest against the way in which the people have been disappointed.

I do not charge the present Postmaster-General, or his predecessor, with being responsible for th« causes which have given rise to so many complaints in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department. to discover the sources of those complaints we must go back to the beginning of Federation, and even to the administration of the Department under State control. I am free to admit also that whilst the public have just cause of complaint, they have received many concessions. They have been given increased postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities, and have had the advantage of reductions in the charges made for the services rendered. If a comparison be made between the condition of things in this Department under State control, and the conditions under Federal control, it must be admitted that much has been accomplished since the establishment of Federation. But while admitting that, t believe that a great deal more might have been done. out the length and breadth of the Commonwealth is that more should be done. IfI were asked to put my finger on the principal source of weakness in the administration of this Department. I should point to the fact that there is too much centralization. Under the system adopted, details with which they should never have been troubled have been dealt with by those in charge of the Central Office. Again, the reports plainly show that there has been friction between this Department and the Department of the Public Service Commissioner. That friction has arisen almost entirely because of the centralization in the administration. If the present Postmaster General wishes to secure greater efficiency in his Department, and to give greater satisfaction to the public in its administration, he must look for reform in the direction of decentralization. I make that suggestion as one well worthy of his consideration. There is a further number of grievances from which rural communities suffer, and which the Postmaster-General cannot meet unless Parliament is prepared to vote the necessary funds. The question mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa is one in respect of which all country members feel that they have a grievance to some extent. Whatever may be the losing part of the Department's operations, it certainly looks to it that the country districts shan not contribute very largely to that side of Mr Thomas Brown. the ledger. So every application for an extension of postal or telegraphic facilities is carefully scrutinized, and it is laid down as a principle that, unless it can show a reasonable paying margin, it shall not be granted, or, if granted, then on I recognise that the condition that the people who receive the direct benefit shall contribute to the deficiency incurred. Whilst it is very desirable that the Department should, as far as possible, be made a paying one, some consideration should be given to these out-posts of our advancing civilization. Something should be done to help them by bringing them into closer touch with the great centres of administration. If the 'paying basis is to be insisted upon, then the first area which should be brought within its scope should be the larger centres. I gather from the Postmaster-General's statement that it is the other way about, that the big losses of the Department are not to be accounted for in the outlying districts; but are to be found in the larger centres, and The demand throughprimarily in connection with telephonic operations. Whilst the telephone extensions in country districts are fairly meeting the interest on capital outlay and working expenses, that does not hold good with -respect to large cities, and a very big loss is incurred by the Department in connection* with city operations. If that be true, the remedy seems to lie in the direction of making the cities contribute a larger share towards the benefits which they receive. That might be brought into operation by speedily abolishing the flat-rate system, and substituting the toll-rate system, under which the user pays in proportion to the service rendered. It has been stated that even under the toll-rate system, the charges are not sufficiently high to cover the expenses. If that be true, the only alternative is to increase the charges; but I should be very loth to do so, unless it could be reasonably shown that it was necessary, in order to balance the accounts* Whilst the Department insists upon country districts paying for services which they receive, it ought equally to insist upon, city interests doing likewise. I do not wish to go into any details of grievances that obtain in country districts. But I should like to bring under the Minister's notice the fact that in country towns, on account of the large extent to which the telephone has become popularized, the offices have become so congested that it is impossible for the officers to do the work properly and satisfactorily without increasing the accommodation, particularly that which is assigned to telephonic purposes. I have forwarded to the Minister a newspaper extract pointing out the conditions -which obtain at Parkes, and how impossible it is to conduct the ordinary business in a satisfactory manner. The telephone exchange is alongside the telegraph office, and both are within the hearing of ithe public. The noise created is of such a character that it is impossible to properly conduct the business. The office accommodation is so congested that the officers cannot do justice to their work. whole system has got into a chaotic state, -despite the best efforts of those in charge of the administration. That applies not -only there, but practically to every post office in my electorate. phonic exchange is in the telegraph and sorting department, or, failing that, the business has greatly out-grown, as in the case .of Forbes, the allotted accommodation, ;and the officers are required to conduct their work under conditions which are no -credit to a Government Department. have written to the Department until I am tired of writing. -stereotyped reply "" The matter will be considered when funds are available."" I want -the new Postmaster-General and his leader -to see that whilst other parts of the governmental machine are not allowed to run dry, -particularly in view of the fact that they can find a large increase for the Defence Department, they will also think about pro-viding some funds to enable the Postal and 'Telegraphic parts of the Government machine to run smoothly. that every penny which can be saved will go to the Post and Telegraph Department. mates for the Department are most inadequate. .Recently, we passed an estimate 'for telephonic equipment. Last year we expended £83,176 in that connection, and still there was an outcry for more; the -demands were not nearly met. But this year we are appropriating only £49,101, that is £34,075 less than we actually expended last year. That shows that the operations of this Department are going to ' be curtailed to an enormous extent. If the Prime Minister intends to provide any money, how is it to be made available? .Are Additional Estimates to be brought down, or will the money be provided out of the Treasurer's Advance Account? No provision is made in these Estimates. On the contrary, they have been cut down by about one-half. The question of telephonic circuits has been raised, because it is found that the lines have become so anv gested that they cannot be operated with satisfaction. The line between Manildra and .Orange is conducted on the condenser system, and, when complaints were made, I communicated with the Department, and the following is an extract from the report of the Deputy Postmaster-GeneralThe The telephone service between Manildra and Orange is on the condenser system, and at times conversations are considerably interfered with by induction from railway circuits; this trouble can be overcome only by the erection of a metallic circuit trunk telephone line. Either the teleThe whole matter of the working of this circuit has been gone into previously, and on the 21st September last the Postmaster-General approved of the erection of a metallic circuit trunk line between Cudal and Manildra as a means of improving the service when circumstances permit. The work has been noted for the 1909-10 Estimates. I This is only a small work, involving a connection of 8 or 10 miles at the outside. I have received the Still, we find that, although last year, on this kind of work, there was an expenditure of £5,708, it is proposed to expend this year only £2,000, although there are many claims for additional facilities. The stereotyped reply is that, although the work is deemed to be necessary, the Postmaster General must await the provision of funds. Another matter to which I desire to refer has relation to the transmission of press telegrams. The congestion of the lines has led to a regulation that public telegrams shall take precedence qf press telegrams between 9 in the morning and 6 in the evening; and this places country newspapers at a great disadvantage. Up to 9 in the morning country newspapers can receive what is practically only the previous evening's news, and it must not be forgotten that even the great city dailies now bring out evening editions, which find their way into the country districts, and involve great competition with country publishers. I suggest that the Postmaster General make some arrangement by which country press telegrams may be transmitted, say, between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock. Such a concession would be very much to the interests of the country press. The present arrangement is wholly in the interests of the great city dailies, and I think that a concession of one hour in the",63,Postmaster General S Department

The honourable gentleman has done more than any other Minister whohas been at the head of the Department since I have been a member of this House. I give him credit for that. But I wish to show him where there is room for improvement, and for the exercise of a little more energy. I think that it ought to be unnecessary for honourable members to be continually pointing out the requirements of"" their electorates.

All the big concerns, such asbanks, are managed on that plan. We hear of no troubles of administration in connection with such institutions. They seem to be worked without friction.

But in this case the particulars for Queensland are different from those of South Australia -or Victoria. The information is worth no-thing.

At Brighton, If this is a sample of what South Australia, where 5,000 more letters are received from other sources, the expenditure is only £ 1 6 0 .

In Queensland, at When the Englesberg, 16,314 letter's were posted, and 16,806 received from other sources. The proportionate cost of the mails is not given in that case.

In Victoria the number of letters posted at Kangaroo Flat is given at 34,285.

If a. big Department like this cannot federate its work, how can we consider that we are federated at all? The fact that the calculations are made on a different basis explains how one man can get a concession where another cannot, because the Deputy Postmaster-General in each State has a different system, and probably in some cases the reports look better on paper than in others. have read, the Department is getting more work done at one place for £ 1 6 0 than-at another for £ 6 0 6 . wonder that complaints are made.

Let him move the first man who objects. This should be an object lesson for the Postmaster-General, who should demand a new system, to be conducted in the best manner possible. -The honourable member for Fremantle has asked what have been the results of Federation so far as the Post and Telegraph Department is concerned? have been the creation of widespread dissatisfaction and disgust. Government has succeeded Government, and the administration, instead of improving, has got worse, until now we have a state of chaos. The services have been starved in a manner which is disgraceful; the only reply to those who are asking for conveniences to relieve the monotony of their isolation being, "" There are not sufficient funds available."" These people have to pay through the nose for everything they buy. Our protective system taxes them heavily, and they should get some return for their expenditure. Not only are the services insufficient, and the postal premises inadequate for the requirements of the public, but the people in the country suffer greatly when they desire medical aid for themselves, their wives, or their children, and are unable to telephone for it. In my opinion, the maladministration which is so greatly complained of is due largely to the fact that the chief officers of the Department are too old, and that each Deputy Postmaster-General lives in his office like a hermit crab, knowing nothing of theI f the Postmaster-General needs of the country, and wholly dependent on his inspectors for information. That is not the position of those who control the affairs of the banks and of the big trading companies. Their directors travel about, and make themselves acquainted with the conditions with which tbey have to deal. We should bring younger men to> the front.

The newspaper report continuesWith the object of obtaining the fullest possible information, Mr Hesketh, who was accompanied by the local postmaster, met a number of representative citizens. I can vouch that they were representative citizens. The report continuesOne gentleman, who does a very extensive business there, went straight to the root of the matter by saying what fhey particularly wanted was a second telephone line to Newcastle. Mr refused by the Department. The mayor Hesketh had no idea of the trouble and inconvenience to which subscribers were subjected. Sometimes a line was quite useless owing to the long waits which they had to put up with. Yet, when I asked the Postmaster-General the other day whether it was not true that subscribers at West Maitland had to submit to long waits, he replied that practically they were subjected to very little waitingThe second telephone line to Newcastle was urgently required owing to the long waits they had to put up with. It was quite a usual thing to find six subscribers waiting for the use of tlie line. Another gentleman, who is a well known business man, said that the Postmaster General had informed Dr. Liddell recently that the matter would be attended to when funds were available. We find the same old phrase cropping up, where he made a memorable statement.

Touching upon the toll system, he said he did not think it was fair for a person using the trunk line and paying is. iod. to have that call included amongst the local calls. I think that that is an injustice, and the sooner such a system ceases, the better. East Maitland is a most important Government town, in which a number of subscribers connected with the West Maitland telephone exchange, 2 miles away, reside. It is in need of a local exchange, but a request for its establishment was curtly of East Maitland, referring to the position* of that town, said thatThey applied recently for the establishment of an exchange there, but failed to get it, it being pointed out that the subscribers were receiving the same advantages as at West Maitland. They expected that they would, but expla'ned that anybody outside the two-mile radius from West Maitland was charged for the additional distance. . . . If they could be placed in the same position as subscribers at West Maitland they would receive a good many more subscribers. This gentleman also pointed out that the Department was losing money, because of the absence of an up-to-date system. I come now to .the wants of a town that was visited by the ex-Postmaster-General, and return to the would be subscribers the money thus raised. Some of them, I unSir,-With reference to your communication of the 19th instant, relative to the desired establishment of a telephone exchange at Cessnock, New South Wales, & c , I have the honour to inform you that, as intimated in my letter to you of the 10th idem, inquiry was made as to whether this work could not be put in hand, but it was found to be impossible to db so unless special provision were made for it. Steps were, however, taken in order to obtain such special provision. On the 7th December, 1908, I received from Mr Scott, the Secretary to .the Central Administration, the following letter, and this correspondence will serve to show the delay that goes on in connection with the DepartmentThe telephone system It had Sir,-With reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the desired establishment Wales, I have the honour to inform you there is no information on the subject in this office, and the matter is, therefore, being ' referred to the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, for inquiry and report. You will be further advised in due course. Could anything be more disgusting than this treatment of honourable members who are doing their best for their constituents. Although the Postmaster-General himself had been interviewed by a deputation in regard to this matter, the Secretary writes me this letter, in which he states that the Department knows nothing about the matter. At the deputation, to which I have already referred, Mr Waddy brought under notice the requirements 'of the outlying coal districts, Cessnock in particularHe was intimately acquainted with the Cessnock district, inasmuch as they had a branch there, and business between that two branches was important, but in view of the condenser system which was in operation they had difficulty in making themselves heard, so much sp that he had discarded the use of the telephone and preferred the telegraph instead. The business people of Cessnock were promised an exchange, provided that there was a certain number of subscribers and that they paid for their instruments. The required number of subscribers was obtained, and the money paid some months ago, but nothing further has been done. A communication had since been received from the Secretary of the General Post Office, stating that they were not in a position to proceed with the establishment of the exchange and trunk line, because no money was available. The same old storyAnd vouchers were sent back for the storekeepers to sign and recall their money, but they declined to do soAnd they very properly declinedThe matter had been placed in the hands of Dr. Liddell, and there it rested. The blame was thrust upon me. I give another example of the way in which people are treated by this Department. One would think that when a young lad is taken into the service of such a Department, an effort would be made to find employment for him in the neighbourhood of his home. I can mention the case of a lad who is the son of a widow residing in East Maitland. He has been taken into the service of the Department, and has been sent to Deniliquin, nearly 700 miles away from his home and his mother. I got a letter from the mother, asking"" me to use my influence with the Department to have the lad appointed to an office nearer his home. I made a representation in connection with the matter, and this is the reply I receivedI have the honour to inform you that inquiry has been made into the matter, and the Deputy^ Postmaster-General, Sydney, has submitted a report to. the effect that there are at present no vacancies at Maitland or Newcastle to which Mr Gardiner could be transferred, but that the latter's name has been noted for consideration in the event of a vacancy arising. I hope the Postmaster-General will give some attention to this matter. are made to find employment for these boys near their home where that is possible. men will, I am sure, admit that it is rather hard that a young lad should be sent so far from home. A friend of mine at one time tried' to build a motor car. He was very successful, but when he hadfinishedit he found he could not get it out of the door of the building in which he had constructed it. I am sorry to say that he is at present in a lunatic asylum. This story has its parallel in the administrat on of the : Postal Department. An application was made from Toronto, a small town on Lake Macquarie, for a silence telephone cabinet. After a long delay it arrived, and it was found that it could not be got in through the door of the post-office. In connection with this matter, I received a notification from the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, to this effectRe Toronto cabinet, Postmaster, Newcastle, wired on the ist October that the cabinet was in position inside the office and would be inspected by his supervisor as soon as possible. In a further wire on the Sth October, the Postmaster, Newcastle, advised he was arranging to remove the instrument into the cabinet the following day. The cabinet remained outside the office for some days prior to the ist October, awaiting acceptance of the contractor's offer to re-erect it within the office. Owing to an error in the letter of instructions the cabinet was not delivered in sections, and had to be altered before it could be placed in the building. The cabinet has been in use since the gth October. , I come now to a very serious matter indeed. It will be remembered that at the beginning of the session attention was called to the fact that the Postmaster General intended to reduce the postal services in the country districts. That naturally gave rise to considerable alarm. A circular letter was sent to various municipal councils in connection with the matter, and a letter was addressed to me by the secretary of the Settlers and Farmers' Association, at a place called Underbank.

522,Dr. Liddell,"The honourable gentleremind honourable members that the ex-Treasurer, in his Budget statement, said that the fear expressed by the honourable member for Riverina that it was intended to drastically cut down the rural mail services was quite unfounded. Here is the reply which I received from Mr Scott to the letter from the secretary to the Underbank Settlers and Farmers' Association, which I had sent on to himWith reference to the letter recently forwarded by you from Mr James R. Fulton, honorary secretary to the Farmers and Settlers' Association, TJnderbank, New South Wales, protesting against any reduction of the mail services in country districts, I have the honour, by direction, When persons go to get their mail, they lo inform you the circular on the subject which ippears to have been sent by Mr John Fitzpatrick, "" E r in Vale,"" Junee, to shire councils, the office. They particularly wish that they &c, has been issued under an entire misapprehension of the facts. The Postmaster-General has no intention of generally limiting or reducing the inland mail services, especially those already established, but, on the contrary, is fully seized of the importance of such services in country districts, and is disposed to grant all the facilities that the money placed at his disposal will permit. 2. The return called for by the Royal Commission on Postal services to show the f u l l particulars of paying and non-paying services has evidently led to the misconception in connection with the matteT. we provided this year £16,000 more than was provided last year. shows a profit of over £300,000, much more consideration should be shown for the country districts. The following letter will show that efforts are being made to do away with postal facilitiesI have the honour to intimate that Mr S. H . Davey, mail porter, Branch River to Booial mail line, has applied for an increase in his allowance, from £1 5 12s. to ^22 per annum. The increase desired, together with the extra expense involved in converting the Receiving Office at the Branch into a non-official post-office (to which it is entitled), would result in a loss of about £12 per annum. In view of this, the increase desired by the mail porter cannot be granted, and if no arrangements can be made for the continuation of the service after the 31st tention of the Postmaster-General, whom prox. (when the present conditions cease) it may Be necessary to temporarily suspend the service and close the receiving office. Vou know, sir, what an awful thing it is in a country place for persons to be suddenly deprived of postal facilities to which they have been accustomed. Here is an example of the Department doing away graduallv with postal facilities. It shows that information to this effect was entirely correct, and that the reply which the exTieasurer made in his speech was entirely wrong. In my electorate, there is a town called Kurri Kurri, which is inhabited by some of the finest of our citizens-coal miners. The ex-Postmaster-General told mc that he was particularly struck with the class of buildings he saw there, and that he was certain that theresidents must be a superior class. They are particularly anxious to be supplied with a telephone exchange; but although I understand that one has been promised, still they are being treated in the same way as are the people at Cessnock. The post-office is altogether inadequate to the wants of the district. have to crush and crowd for an hour or more at a time before they can get into may be supplied with a second letter delivery, because they believe that the present delivery is altogether inadequate. In order to show the class of letter that breaks one's heart, I have preserved one of a number which I have received from the Secretary of the Department. It reads as followsWith reference to previous correspondence, relative to the desired establishment of telephonic communication with Girvan, New South Wales, in connection with which you presented letters from Messrs. H . and W. Flannery, Heatherdean, Booral, I have the honour, by direction, to inform you inquiry has been made into the matter, and the Postmaster-General has approved of the work in question being carried outImagine, sir, the delight of these people when they received a letter to the effect that the Minister had approved of the work. They were perfectly satisfied when the Postmaster-General said that it would be carried out; but he added, the words "" when circumstances will permit."" The same old tale istold day after day. There is another place in my district to which I wish to call attention. It is absolutely necessary that letters should be quoted here, because I am tired of writing to the Department. I desire to call the at1 am glad to see in his place at the table again, to the absolute necessity that exists for some kind of telephonic communication in connection with the Allynbrook and Eccleston districts. When his predecessor was in Maitland, he very courteously received a deputation of representative men who had travelled a considerable distance I suppose about 40 or 50 miles by road -to see him. He said: "" I shall look into the matter. It will be all r i g h t "" ; and they went away satisfied. These per-",71,Postmaster General S Department

524,Dr. Liddell,"When the Departmentsons produce a large quantity of milk and butter, and it is very necessary that they should have some means of carrying on their business. They also feel acutely the fact that they are cut off from getting medical assistance in times of sickness. During the lifetime of this Parliament, the people of Lostock, Nicholson, and Allynbrook, thriving districts, have been asking i'os telephonic facilities. They have offered to supply the poles, and to keep the lines in repair. They have done all they could to meet the Department half way, and yet they are constantly met with the same old tale-that the work cannot be undertaken because no funds are available. I am sorry that the demands of nature obliged the Postmaster-General to leave the Chamber to get some supper, because I should have liked him to hear a great deal which I am afraid he will not become aware of. From the Secretary of the Progress Association at Aiiynbrook I have received the following letterI have been instructed by my association to write to you regarding the practice of the Federal Government in connection with the establishment of country telephones,. residents asked for telephone communication with Aiiynbrook. In common with the rest of Australia's citizens they bear their share of taxationWhy should not these pioneers who bear their share of the taxation get their share of postal facilities? But whilst residents in towns can get this convenience with a minimum of trouble the people here, who have a great deal more need -of it, are asked practically to construct it out -of their own pockets. The same applies to the Lostock proposed line. The association trusted you would see the injustice of such a practice and utilize every opportunity to condemn it. In Eccleston's case, rather than do without the line, the residents have offered to find all poles. And yet the Postmaster-General turns a deaf ear to these people. master-General recognised the necessity to which I have drawn attention; but nothing has been done. Here is another letter from Mr Scott, the Secretary to the Post and Telegraph DepartmentWith reference to your letter of the 22nd -ultimo, further respecting the desire of the -Aiiynbrook District Progress Association, Aiiynbrook, New South Wales, for the establishment -of telephonic communication between Aiiynbrook and Lostock, I have the honour to inform you it is regretted that existing conditions will not permit of the construction of the desired line being undertaken during this ""financial year. The residents, however, can take steps to erect the line themselves, if they so desire, under the provisions of Part XVIII . of the telephone regulations (copy attached). This is a matter which concerns, not only my own electorate, but the electorates of other honourable members in the neighbourhood of Sydney. ThenI have a letter from Mr James D. Dight, who was at one time a representative in the New South Wales Parliament, of the Singleton constituency. In that letter, it is statedI approach you as the representative of the Hunter Valley in the Commonwealth Parliament with a view of asking you to interview the Postmaster-General, and put before him a matter which needs some alteration at his hands. It is with reference to the despatch of mail matter from Sydney to the different towns along the Hunter Valley, or I may say as far as Murrurundi. At present there are three mail trains leaving Sydney in the afternoons, namely, the North-West, leaving at 3 p.m.: the Brisbane, leaving at 5.10 p.m.; and the Glen Innes, leaving at 7.15 p.m. All communications for the towns up the Hunter Valley must be-posted in time for despatch by the North-West mail, otherwise are detained till the next day, as I am informed no mails are made up for despatch to the towns of the Hunter Valley by either the Brisbane or the Glen Innes mail'trains, although they pass through these towns. WhatI wish to ask of you is, would you interview the Postmaster-General and endeavour to persuade him to allow postal matter for the Hunter townships The Eccleston that may be late posted for the North-West mail to be despatched by the Glen Innes mail? It would be greatly appreciated by all residents in these towns and the district surrounding. The ex-Postmaster-General objected to anything ih the form of sweating. But I can say that for the last two years and a half, a poor lad in the employment of the Department has been sweated and driven in a way that would not have been tolerated in the old slave days in the Southern States of America. Not only has this boy been overworked, but the horse on which he rides has been overdriven. He is, according to my information, employed las a telegraph messenger at Boolaroo, in New South Wales, and he has to carry the mailThe ex-Postbags from the Post Office to Cockle Creek, half-a-mile distant, five times a day, and from Cockle Creek station to the Post Office four times a day. Besides this, he has to act as letter-carrier in the mornings, delivering letters around Boolaroo, Spiers Point, which is half-a-mile distant; Argent's Hill, which is one mile distant, and Cockle Creek. . In addition, a letter-box is cleared at Spiers Point twice daily-onc e while the boy is delivering letters-a t Argenfs Hill once daily, and Cockle Creek four times daily. Then he has to deliver telegrams, necessitating travelling on an average ten miles daily. I am informed that he has been employed for a period of two years and five months, and, during that time, he has had five horses, four of which have broken down owing to too much work, while the one he is using at present is nearly knocked up. It might be well to provide this lad with a bicycle in order that he might do his work satisfactorily. I regret very much to have detained the Committee, but really my patience is absolutely exhausted with making complaints to the Minister. I trust that the present Postmaster-General will give these matters his serious attention. vernment will not bottle up their finances and reserve too much money for other purposes, but will recognise that the Department must be properly reorganized. If that is not done, there will be such an outcry throughout the length and breadth of the land that I doubt whether any of us will come back to Parliament after the next election. The Post Office is probably the most important Department under the management of the Commonwealth, because it affects every man and woman and every boy and girl in the country. I shall not refer to any of the questions that have come under my notice as a member of the Royal Commission that is now sitting. I must, however, allude to a remark made by the honourable member for Illawarra, who said that the Commission was simply appointed to whitewash the former Government. I do not think that it can be said that I have sought to whitewash any one since I have been in Parliament, nor do I believe that the wash any one. sary for the honourable member to make such a remark, because we are all supposed to be honourable men, and he might have trusted the members of the Commission to do their duty. The cause of a great deal of the trouble in the Post and Telegraph Department is that the various States lost large sums of money in consequence of Federation, and the Commonwealth Government has been anxious to return to them as much revenue as it could possibly afford. Since Federation, more than £6,000,000 has been returned to the States over and above that to which they were entitled. Much of that money might have been usefully spent on improving the postal service. But on account of the necessities of the States the Commonwealth returned it to them. T think that the right policy was followed,, because taxation is grievous to bear, and sometimes it is better to put up with a certain amount of inconvenience than to get into debt. Before we complain of the Post Office it is just as well to look intothe facts. The Commonwealth, like private individuals, has to consult its pocket before it incurs expenditure. Take for instance the complaints made with referenceto the telephone service. A former Minister reduced telephone charges, with theconsequence that there was a loss of revenue I hope that the Goand a great increase in the demand for instruments. Last year, 9,000 new telephones were erected in the Commonwealth, whereas in the previous seven years the rate of increase was only 3,000 per annum. Of course there was some delay, because it is. impossible to find at the corner of every,street men who are capable of putting uptelephones. The work is not as easy asdigging post-holes. Technical skill is required. Moreover, it would not have beenright to employ alarge number of additional hands to do this work, and to thenthrow them out of employment when therush was over. All men of business know that rushes will come in all departments of"" industry. There is no serious cause of complaint with reference to the telephones. A table has been laid before honorable members showing receipts and expenditure in connection with post offices throughout Australia. To my astonishment, when I went through the document to ascertain particulars regarding my own State, I found that the revenue for the capital, was not put down. Neither is there a reCommission intends to whiteturn of the revenue for the other capitalsIt was not necesof the States. Seeing that the figures are two years old the officers might have completed them, and surely should have recognised that the information would not have been complete or satisfactory without full particulars relative to the capitals. I am glad that the Postmaster-General hasstarted the system of supplying this information, and hope that it will be kept up. The stock in hand should be valued, and' we should have a complete balance-sheet. We have heard a great deal lately about the large amount of money lost on services in the outlying districts. This return givesfigures relative to three post offices in theneighbourhood of Hobart. There is a loss of £800 on the three. That is very serious.

Postmaster-General necessary reforms until the work of the Commission is completed. thought a little indelicate to forestall their suggestions, but the first consideration should be the public interest, and the sooner the administration of the Department is on a proper footing, the better it will be for the country and for the credit of Parliament. I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to complaints which have been made because of the enforcement of the regulation that youths under eighteen years of age are not to be employed in connection with the carriage of mails. In many instances this causes hardship to small contractors. Until lately the employment of boys has been winked at. The contractor for the mail service between Mount Victoria and Hartley Vale, or some township in the Macquarie electorate, has been employing a lad of fifteen to go to the railway station at Mount Victoria for the mail arriving by train about midday. . This contractor gets only £ 5 0 or £ 6 0 a year for the whole service, and if he had to employ a man to do this part of the work-becaus e a boy over eighteen years of age demands a man's wages-it would cost him £ 1 a week. tions when he signed the contract. years during the existence of his previous until half past eight at night, takings contract the regulation was not enforced. his He thought that the postmaster at Mount Formerly the Department used to send: Victoria had a spite against him, but the up a relieving officer from Sydney,, enforcement of the regulation has been inbut that practice has been discontinued,, sisted on since a new postmaster came and the postmaster has been instructed to there.

The other matter and has offered the Government the free use of its telephone poles, but the Department says that it has no money for the work. Another complaint which I wish to voice is that of guarantors for telephone services. When the Department accepts a guarantee for the installation of telephone exchanges, it should put the money to a trust account, and commence I hope that the the work without delay. Nothing is more will not postpone irritating than for those who have subscribed such a guarantee to find that nothing is to It may be be done, and that their money will not be returned to them until it has been voted by Parliament. I had intended to speak in regard to retiring allowances, but as the hour is so late, 1 shall not do so. The practice of the Department in paying the Raiilways Commissioners for work done by their employees is not satisfactory to the latter. The Railways Commissioners say that the postal duties of their employees-, are taken into consideration in the fixing of salaries; but the stationmasters who dopostal work feel that they get nothing for their extra duty.

534,Mr Bowden,"Then the Departmentto which I desire to refer, is the need for establishing additional trunk telephone lines from Homebush to Sydney. there are only eleven of these lines in existence-seve n from Homebush to Sydney, and four from Sydney to Homebush. There are more than 300 subscribers on the exchange, and the facilities provided for them are utterly inadequate. One firmI refer to Arnott's biscuit factory-whic h is connected with the Homebush exchange, has eight or nine telephones in use-mor e telephones than there are trunk lines between Homebush and Sydney. ought to be not merely direct communication with Sydney, but additional junction lines to Parramatta, Strathfield, Burwood, Ashfield, and other exchanges which would relieve the central exchange of a good deal of the work which now passes through it . I trust that the Postmaster General will not regard these matters as of trivial importance, because of the hasty way in which I am dealing with them. Not long -ago I received a letter from a friend at Grafton, calling attention to the condition of the telephone exchange there. The telegraph boys have to sleep in an old building which was formerly used as a stable. allow the representative of any particular district to voice the complaints of that district. ber for Richmond is not present Mr' JOHN THOMSON -But able member for Cowper is. orable member's electorate.

That seems to me to be an unfair arrangement. They should be paid at Sunday rates for the time they work on Sundays. the cleaning staff in the General Post Office, Sydney, is a matter which I commend to the earnest attention of the Postmaster-General. pride in. the cleanliness of our post-office, but at present we are rather ashamed of its condition. I understand that dirt accumulates in the building, simply because the cleaning staff has been reduced, and. A t present is not adequate to keep it clean. During, the plague scare a good many rumourswere afloat regarding the presence of plague-stricken rats in the building. We do not want statements of that sort to beput into circulation. Isi t any use asking the Postmaster-General what he intends to do in reference to main trunk lines? I am almost afraid to visit some portions of my constituency, because of the way in which they have been treated by the DeThere partment. I trust that something will be done to improve the western line, and also the Gosford line, which is almost unworkable. The latter is conducted upon the condenser system, and it is nearly impossible to speak over it from Sydney. Solong as these lines pay we ought to find the money with which to keep them in repair, even if we have to borrow. I dohope that the Postmaster-General, with that enthusiasm which has always characterized him, will bring all his energies to bear upon the solution of these problems which are vexing the Commonwealth so much at the present time. There is one very disappointing feature in» connection with this debate. Some time ago, at the instance of the honourable member for Gwydir, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the working of. the Postal Department. Every honourable member, therefore, expected that that honourable member would have had something the honorto say regarding the work of that body. But up to the present time he has remained silent. The Chairman of the Commission is absent, but I notice that the Deputy Chairman is present, and I think Although the 'telephone assisthat before these Estimates have been dealt with, he ought to make some statement regarding the progress which the But, although they work Commission, has made. Surely a body which has been in existence for six months has something to communicate to honourable members. Steps should certainly be taken to compel it to submit a progress report before the prorogation of Parliament. I desire to bring under the notice of the The reduction of Ministry the position of the letter carriers, who, in my opinion, do not receive adequate remuneration for their labours. I know that the late Administration haveWe used to take a made provision for a slight increase in their salaries, but their case is worthy of special consideration.

538,Mr Coon (Batman) [2.23 A.m.],"involving much responsibility, but, in my opinion, these men are called upon to discharge very important duties, and should not be overlooked. We find that a number of them are receiving £126 per annum, and many others only £110 per annum. Some of them will have been thirty-one years in the service before they secure the maximum salary. Under the present system men who have already been seventeen years in the service will have to serve practically another seventeeen years before they -can reach the maximum pay of their class, and lads who enter the service as office boys must serve seventeen years before they can secure the maximum pay of their division. Surely there should be introduced a system under which these men will be -able to receive the remuneration to which they are justly entitled without having to serve for so long a period. Our letter carriers receive very small wages as compared with the remuneration received by men discharging similar duties in other countries. Let me call attention to the remuneration received by letter carriers in the United States, and in passing I may say that it is doubtless due to the fiscal policy in operation there that so high a level is reached. The scale of pay there is as follows: grade, $600 per annum; 2nd grade, $800; 3rd grade, $900; 4th grade, $1,000; 5th grade, $1,100; and 6th grade, $1,200 per annum. In other words, they receive from £125 to ,£250 per annum. In New Zealand, those in the first grade receive from £180 .to £200, those ""in the second, from £150 to £170, and those in the third, from £110 to £140 per annum. Thousands of letter carriers in the Commonwealth are not being adequately remunerated. I believe that the present Postmaster-General, like his predecessor, is in full sympathy with these men who are on the lower rungs of the ladder, and I hope he will look into this question. Surely a man twenty-five years of age is worth more than £110 or £125 a year, and it ought not to be necessary for him to remain in the service until he is forty-five years of age in order to secure the maximum salary of his class. -carriers have very onerous duties to perform. They have to work in all sorts of weather, setting out very often early in the morning, and being unable to reach their homes until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. Then, again, their work, to a large extent, is not under direct supervision. They have to be trusted to properly discharge very responMr Coon. sible duties, and from time to time have to bear the brunt of public criticism, and are often wrongly blamed for the non-delivery of letters. The Committee of the Cabinet appointed by the late Government to inquire into tfie management of the Department, submitted a. progress report, in an appendix to which examples are given of where on inquiry it was found that (he Department was not to blame. The following cases, amongst others, are cited3. Complaint of non-delivery of letter which was subsequently found in the pocket of a lady to whom it was intrusted to post, and who failed to do so. 4. A firm in Queensland reported as follows : -As the result of a search, they had found 109 stamped letters which had never been posted but hidden away behind a case, and 120 unstamped letters secreted' elsewhere. Letters and cheques were also discovered in various places on their premises. 12. Non-delivery of a letter. Inquiry showed that it had not been posted, it having subsequently been found under a table cover. Surely these men, who have to stand the brunt of public criticism, are entitled to some consideration, and should receive extra remuneration ? The Postmaster-General will probably say that the proposals of the Public Service Commissioner will lead rst to an increase in their salaries. secure the full amount of the increase recommended by the Public Service Commissioner, they must serve a further term of fourteen years. If the Commissioner believes that in ten or eleven years' time they should receive a certain salary for doing the work which they now perform, they should be given that salary now. No plea that funds are not available should be allowed to stand in the way, when we have recently increased the salaries of some of the more highly-paid officials. I suppose that nothing can 'be done in the matter in dealing with these Estimates, but, in framing the next Estimates, I trust the Postmaster-General will take into consideration the position of the letter carriers and line repairers. These latter have to perform very important and dangerous work, and Letter they also are entitled to consideration.

In my judgment, that reply is in itself a condemnation of the administration of this Department. It may be true that in the past the Department has been starved in order to return money to the States, but that does not exonerate those who have been responsible for its administration, and for providing the necessary funds. Every one knows that it is unreasonable to expect that a' vast business with such ramifications as the Post and Telegraph Department can be carried on without loan monev. I do not know who is responsible for the failure to provide funds, which has resulted in the existing condition of affairs, but I understand that a previous Government did submit a proposal to raise money by loan to meet the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department, and this House refused to ratify it. The responsibility must rest upon the Government in power for the time being to provide the funds necessary for carrying on the work of this Department effectively. They would be absolutely justified in borrowing monev to carry out permanent works, extending the payment of interest and principal over a period of years. we should have every rotten proposal described as i \ permanent work. ber means to suggest that we must expect to have absolutely incapable men in chargeof Commonwealth affairs who would permit ordinary subsidies for mail contracts in the Commission, will to be charged to loan account, the outlook for Australia is not a very hopeful one. borrowing policy, it would not be confinedto the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department. thing to do with the matter in hand. Theargument which the honourable memberuses that money which was borrowed for the purpose of the post, telegraph, and"" telephone service would be used for a I dozen other purposes is a very poor one. I Surely those who control the Department would see that borrowed money was used' for only permanent work, or work the use of which would extend over a period of years. The people will have a very just cause of complaint if ordinary services, especially in country districts, are constantly refused or cut down simply on the ground-' in every way reasonable, that there is a want of funds. It is thecannot be granted until Parbusiness of the Government to find the has provided the necessary money with which to give the people an efficient service.

The whole of thepostal services must be taken as one service. The fact that some country services are run at a loss is surely no argument for discontinuing them. It is absolutely necessary that the people of the country districtsshould have their postal services. It is a portion of our policy for developing and"" settling the country. Apart from the ordinary troubles regarding country services, we in Queensland, so far as I know, have not very much to growl about. The Department has met my requests for my constituency in every way in which it fairly could, considering the lack of finances. The ex Postmaster General did his best, and I am happy to say that, after a great deal of fighting, I succeeded in getting him to approve of most of the largeworks which I wanted, and which could' If we started that policy, justly be claimed to be necessary.

There is only one matter of a specific natuie I wish to mention, and that is the trunk line between Maryborough .and Bundaberg, which is' urgently re-quired. It has been approved, arid I only hope that the Government will carry it out as soon as possible. I have no doubt but that the Prime Minister will do .all he can in that direction. I congratulate the Minister upon his good fortune or good tactics in having reached his Estimates at an hour when we are all tired and anxious to curtail our speeches as much as possible. After having heard the wail of woe from representatives of New South Wales and Victoria, I begin to think that we in Queensland are in a happy position. We have been met by the officials in the States, in fact, by the Department generally, in a reasonable way, so far as funds would permit. Evidently, things are in a ba'd state in New South Wales and Victoria. A letter, which was plainly addressed to me at Parliament House, Melbourne, was returned' to Queensland with the words, ""Post Office not known,"" written in red ink across the envelope. It shows that the sorting of letters is not carefully done somewhere in Melbourne. I feel sure that the Postmaster-General will do all he can to push on with works so far as money is available. But I trust that he will prevail upon the Government to allow him a great deal more money than his predecessor had in order to carry out reproductive works. In my division various trunk lines are hung up for the want of funds. For some time, we have been agitating for further trunk lines between Ipswich and been the residents of Ipswich that they cannot be connected with Brisbane. Sometimes they have to wait for hours before they can get a connection. This very short line, if constructed, would pay. It is only a matter of finding the wire and fixing it. Then, a trunk line to Esk was promised eighteen months ago. The same condition of affairs prevails there as at Ipswich. Persons coming from the country, perhaps a d i c e of several miles, in order to stan communicate with 2 particular centre, have to wait for hours before they can do so, and sometimes they are obliged to go home without having been connected. The Beaudesert line is in a similar position. The Government need have no hesitation in erecting these lines, because they would pay from the start. In 1908, £3,500 was voted for the purchase of telephone instruments for Queensland, and £6,904 was spent, but -this year the Government have only asked for a sum of £.'?-5oo, although quite a number of exchanges has been hung up from the want of telephone instruments. That reminds me of the fact that a number of second-hand instruments, which are now being set aside as useless, might be used in some places until they could be replaced with new ones. It does not appear to me to be common sense or business like, when people cannot be supplied with telephonic communication quickly enough, that instruments should be thrown on the scrap heap. I am given to understand that hundreds of instruments are lying idle while hundreds of applications are refused connection on the ground that there is a lack of instruments. Although not so ornamental as the newer article, the old instruments would suit country purposes very well; and the Postmaster-General would do a good sendee if he installed them in some of the outlying exchanges. would turn round and complain. honourable members would object. Doubtless, in a large city, subscribers might question the use of such appliances, but I am sure that the people in the country towns would be very glad to have instruments of. any kind; and, in my opinion, the present system is extravagant. There has been a change in the political head of the Department recently, and I trust he will take into consideration a suggestion which I made to his predecessor in regard' to a Brisbane. There has continuous telephone service in country disa constant complaint from tricts. According to a return which was prepared, covering a period of, I believe, four months, there was only one call throughout the whole of Queensland between midnight and the usual opening hour in the morning. At present, if we ask for an extension of the telephone services in the country towns, we must be able to show that there is a revenue of £150 per annum. In many of such towns, a service from 6 in the morning until 10 at night is all that. is asked for, but, according to some regulation, there must be either an eight-hour service or a twenty-four-hour service.

Seeing that only one subscriber availed himself of the all night service, I do not see any necessity for going to the enormous expense of employing officers who must sleep on the exchange premises. The question of the inland mail service has been pretty exhaustively dealt with by the honourable member for Maranoa. I see, however, that in Queensland last year £55,628 was spent for the conveyance of country mails, and that, for the same service this year £55,679 is provided. We have been hammering awa.y at the Department for an extension of the country services; and, in many cases, the reply to our request has been unsatisfactory, to the effect that the lines suggested would not pay their way.' Very often I ha.ve been told that, because cream carts pass the residences, there was no necessity for the Postal Department to do anything. All the same, it is necessary to the development of Australia that the people of the back-blocks should have means of communication; and I hope the Postmaster General, with his usual commohsense, will see that the struggling settler is not neglected in this respect. £^520 is provided in Queensland for temporary assistance in the Department. ""If there is a question which requires looking into, it is that of temporary employment; we cannot say that there are rushes in the postal work which call for any such arrangement. work will always be expanding, but temporary employment is a source of dissatisfaction to those employed; and I think that, in Queensland, at' any rate, a number might be put on the permanent staff and made to feel that they are a part of the Public Service. The honourable member for Nepean referred to the amounts paid to the. Railway Departments of the States for services rendered by railway officials as postmasters. opinion, the system of paying a lump sum is very unsatisfactory; and the sooner the Department gets into direct touch with the officials who do the work, the better it will be for the public and the officials themselves. Commissioners would not, for one moment, allow one of their subordinates to be paid by another authority. tive is, where possible, to do away with the assistance of the Railway Department. the Department. stationmaster in Queensland who is now paid! £185 as postmaster, he having previously undertaken the railway and postal work for a' similar sum. The railway officialslook on the postal work as a secondary consideration. I know a gatekeeper who receives from the Railway Department the magnificent salary of £ 3 6 per annum, while the Railway Department is paid £ 3 5 . per annum for the postal work done by that woman, who refused to sell stamps on the ground that she is not paid for doing so, although the Railways Commissioners are paid by the Post and Telegraph Department for her services. There isa great deal of dissatisfaction in regards to this system of dealing with the Railway Departments, and if there is any way of improving it, I should be pleased to see a new method adopted. I notice an item of £1,140 to be paid to the Pacific CableBoard for services, rendered in connection with land line work at Southport. I should 1 like the Postmaster-General to explain why this item appears upon the Estimates, and why the Department has to pay the Pacific Cable Board this money. Another subiect which has attracted my notice is that of the defalcations of the postmaster at Toowong. I should like to know whether officers occupying responsible positions have to Postal provide a fidelity guarantee bond or whether the Department itself guarantees them? There is room for improvement, if there is no guarantee. Personally, I have very little complaint to make against the Department, though I hope that the Postmaster-General will ""get a bit of a move on,"" and if his officers tell him that there are no funds will insist on money being found for necessary works. debate has lasted about five hours. I shalf not prolong it for more than five minutes. I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the regulation dealing with penny postage in country towns.

He has exhibited a fine sense of self-control, and it is only fair to say that he has given careful consideration to the troubles that honourable members have gentleman is evidently disposed to accept suggestions regarding matters that may have come under the observation of honourable members affecting the working of his great Department. I do not propose to occupy much time by bringing under the Postmaster-General's attention particuThe Department, in its lar grievances which exist in my electorate. I regret that there are many services which require to be completed, but they are mostly of a character which can be threshed out between the Department and myself ; and so long as I receive that fair play which other honourable members experience, I shall be satisfied. The matter which 1 specially desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General, relates This,' however, is not a to the regulations affecting tendering for public works. The Department allows contractors to put in tenders without any deposit, with the result that after a tender is opened andconsidered, if a contractor I see no reason why this finds that his tender is lower than that of I have received from the another, he refuses to sign a contract. The consequence is that higher tenders have to be accepted and Government works are much more expensive than they ought to be. It would be in the interests of the Department to require every tender for the erection of telephone or telegraph lines to be accompanied by a deposit as a guarantee of good faith. In two or three instances in I my electorate tenderers, finding that their 3,000 prices were much lower than those of others, have not signed the contract, thus occasioning considerable delay, the calling of fresh tenders, and greater expense to the Department. There is a clause in mail contracts allowing the Department, if the service is increased from, say, two to three days per week, to compel the contractor to carry out the additional service for a proportionate increase in the payment. That appears fair on the face of it, but in many cases a contractor, in providing extra plant, horses, stables, and grooms, is put to an expense out of proportion to the additional pay. He should be asked first to state the price at which he is prepared to do the extra work. If that were considered too high, the Department could give the work under my notice a man who was already losing money on a contract was compelled to provide an additional service, and was involved in an even greater loss. Up to recently country postmasters could not have minor repairs effected to buildings without sending in a requisition form that had to",81,Postmaster General S Department
554,Mr John,"go through all the circumlocution of a Government Department, a n d . getting a voucher. Some improvement has been effected by allowing repairs up to £ 5 worth to be made at once, but urgent cases occur occasionally in country districts where it is necessary for alterations costing more than £ 5 to be made immediately, owing to Orders from the civic authorities or others. A discretionary power should be given to country postmasters to have those works Carried out. to conduct a business with a turnOver of several thousand pounds, we Can surely trust them with those little matters. These questions could be easily attended to by regulation, and the Department, instead of losing, would probably gain considerably. I would call the attention of the) Postmaster-General to a number of cases where the erection of telephone lines^ and the construction of exchanges have been undertaken at considerable expense, but insufficient work to bring them into operation has been performed, and consequently no revenue is obtained. I know instances where telephone lines have been brought up to a post-office, but no connection has been made. in those cases through not spending a little more. cause if the work was warranted at all, it certainly should be finished. There is a considerable amount of unfairness in the arrangements as regards country telephone exchanges. small exchange with not more than fifty people to talk to, has to pay £ 4 ios. a year, whereas -a man in, Melbourne, with thousands of subscribers to talk to, pays only £ 5 . TKat is an instance where country people are not treated as fairly as are those in the larger centres. such cases a policy of decentralization might well be applied. made worse by the fact that in country exchanges only residents within a radius of two miles from the post-office can be connected for £ 4 1 os., whereas in Sydney any person in the area between Parramatta and Manly, a distance of about 1.0 or 11 miles, has to pay a subscription of only £ 5 . The discrepancy in that instance between a small country exchange and a big city exchange is too great. I suggest that in exchanges, with a limited number of subscribers, the radius should be considerably increased. tional expense to the Department while it would add to the number of subscribers. There has been a number of complaints as to the congestion of business along the different lines. This has been caused by an increase in the business, without any morefacilities being provided to cope with it . To remedy the pressure, the Department sometimes erects an additional line, but, especially in timbered country, the whole of' the lines are often fouled by falling trees. The Postmaster-General might cause a mapI f we can trust them showing existing lines to be prepared, with a view to seeing if the existing lines could not be linked up. This would providealternative circuits, and avoid delays. It would cost no more money than it does to put up additional lines, which give relief only while they hold good. I also suggest the more frequent installation of duplex and quadruplex instrumentsin busy centres. Honourable members are, ne, doubt, aware that a duplex instrument enables the capacity of a line to be doubled, because one operator can receive and another send at the same time. These instruments, I understand, are not very expensive, and their use would relieve the present congestion at less cost than the erection of new additional wires on the preThe Department is losing money sent poles. It is in the public interest, and in that of the telegraph operators, that That is not desirable, be the congestion should be removed. Anoperator in charge of a country office cannot leave until he gets permission from the head office, and may often have to wait a long while to get rid of business taking, A subscriber to a only a few minutes to transmit. For these detentions the Department has to pay overtime. The manner in which alterations tobuildings are effected is a long wav fromsatisfactory, there being too much circumlocution. I referred to the matter when the Works and Buildings Estimates were beIn fore us, and I suggest to the new Ministerthat, where small works, at any rate, are The position is concerned, his Department should take all' responsibility. A t present, the carrying out of a small work, such as the construction of a silence cabinet, necessitates the same routine as a work involving large expen-' diture. I regret to say, too, that manv of the premises in my district are inadenuate. The Grafton Post-office, for example, is a long way from being satisfactory, the lads employed there on night duty in connection with the telephone exchange having to> sleep in a stable. The conditions under which telephone communication is estabThis would involve no addilished in country districts are not satisfactory. We have been given to understand! that the Departmental terms are most easy, and that there is no investigation to determine the probable receipts and expenditure. I apply for as many telephone connexions as does any honourable member, and have never had an application granted until the local people have guaranteed the Department against loss. I do not know how the Departmental Estimates of receipts and revenue are made up, or what check is made on them; but I feel sure that, in many instances, fair consideration is not given to all the circumstances. Iluka, on the Clarence River, there is a watering place where the people of Grafton and other towns hire cottages and take rooms for the summer months. They wish to communicate direct with their business premises and their homes; but, on a request being made for the installation of an exchange, the departmental officer made an estimate of the probable revenue which must have been based on the number ""of permanent residents,, most of whom are fishermen, or boardinghousekeepers. It is, however, from the tourists that most of the revenue would come. The Department covers the probable cost of a service .by asking for a guarantee of io per cent, on the probable outlay. It is true that it allows 5 per cent, for maintenance, but that is not a concession; it is a further contribution from the residents, is worth more than £300 annually, because lines cannot be maintained for so little. I do not say that the Department should not ask for guarantees, but a return of 5, 6, or 7 per cent, on its outlay ( would be ample. say something about public works, but I shall take the opportunity of an interview which the Minister is prepared to give me to speak fully in regard to these and the other matters which I have mentioned in detail. In quite a number of country allowance offices the person in charge is paid as little as £1 per annum. In very many instances they receive only £^5 a year. Now, the public require just as much attention from an officer who is in receipt of only £5 a year as they do from .an officer who draws a salary of £500 a year. In my opinion, the Department should grant increases to the persons in charge of allowance offices, whenever the volume of business transacted warrants their payment. I know of several cases in which old persons are in charge of allowance offices. In order to meet the mail coach, they have to rise at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. all the year round, and for their Mr John Thomson. services they receive a very small sum indeed. When an application is made for the establishment of an office under the allowance system, the Department is accustomed to make some estimateof the probable revenue that would be derived from it, and upon that revenue the amount of the remuneration paid to the person in charge is based. That remuneration may be only JQJ. or £ 5 a year. The Department takes no steps to ascertain whether the person who is put in charge ought At not to receive a larger sum. When an individual accepts the responsibility of conducting such an office, he does so, not because of the allowance made to him, but as an inducement to the Government to grant postal facilities to the district in which he is located. Consequently, I maintain that as soon as these offices become self-supporting, the Department should increase the allowances to a fair amount. Next to allowance offices, upon an ascending scale, are the semi-official offices. In the conduct of these, quite a number of evils have crept in, which do not contribute to their successful working. In the first place, the receipts from a semi-official office must aggregate £ 3 ° ° a year. Unless an office will show a revenue of £400 a year it cannot be classed as an official office. But any office, the business of which has a chance of having a MoTse instrument installed in it. Now, whilst it looks as if a semi-official office, in which a Morse instrument has been inI had intended to stalled, will serve the public just as well as does an official office, experience is in the opposite direction. There are quite a number of semi-official offices, with a revenue of £300 a year, which would be better conducted if a junior classified officer, in receipt of £140 , 01 even £ 1 2 0 , a year, were put in charge of them. He would be under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and the adoption of the system which I have suggested would provide an opening for young men who are anxious to secure the management of offices. I would, therefore, urge the Minister to reduce the minimum revenue exacted from an official office from £40 0 to J £ 3 per annum. At present, too, a 0 0 postmaster who is in receipt of £ 1 50 a year has no chance of securing promotion unless his office can be classified in a higher grade. Even then many cases might be cited in which offices, as the result of the hard work of the officials in charge of them, have been placed in higher grades and have merely provided openings for other individuals. up to £ 1 0 a year upon the ground of their efficiency alone. That being so, efficiency should also count in the case of postmasters, who have often to act as accountants, electoral officers, and bank managers, besides performing quite a number of other functions. In the grading of these officers sufficient consideration is not given to the question of efficiency, and too much to the amount of revenue which is derived from the offices which they control. This difficulty might be overcome by providing that after twenty years' service these men after proving their efficiency should be granted increments, even if their offices do not produce the larger revenue necessary to secure their grading in a higher division. It is not fair to prevent their advance simply because their offices do not show a sufficient profit to the Department. I find, too, that in many country offices no allowance is made to the postmaster for cleaning. Consequently, a number of these places are in -a rather uninviting condition. It is not fair to ask the postmaster who receives only a small salary to himself undertake the work of cleaning, and I am convinced that if the Department were to make a small allowance under this heading its property would be much better cared for. -whilst the comfort of its patrons would be increased. It may be urged that the Department relies upon its inspectors to report on these matters-that its Permanent Head has no way of learning the conditions which obtain in country offices except through these officials. I admit that the inspectors exhibit a tremendous amount of -interest in their work and do their utmost for the public and the Department. But they are asked to do too much. The districts which they are required to traverse are altogether too large, and the result is that their vists to country offices are not nearly as frequent as they ought to be. Seeing that the Permanent Head of the ascertaining the way in which country offices are being conducted except through the inspectors, I would suggest that their visits of inspection should be more frequent. tained only by increasing the number of inspectors. spectors were appointed in New South Wales a much better state of affairs would be brought into existence there. Sof a r as I have been able to ascertain, the inspecTelegraphists can be graded tors, having regard to the number of offices they have to visit, cannot do more than audit the accounts. I am given to understand that they have been instructed to do nothing more than inspect the clerical work of these offices, and not to inquire into such questions as the way in which an office is conducted, whether the instruments and lines used are in good order, or whether the postmaster is using or abusing the premises. They are the only representatives of the Department who visit the rural districts, and that being so, greater facilities should be given to them. I would also suggest that inspectors from the mechanical branch of the Department should visit country offices. I have been living in the electorate which I represent during all my life, but have never heard of an inspector from the mechanical branch visiting it with a view of determining whether the mechanical appliances in the various offices are in good condition or up-to-date. The Department trusts to the local line repairer, and while, no doubt, he does all that he can, he cannot be expected to be an expert in all these matters. The lines are not what they ought to be. Any reports that the local line repairer may make as to necessary improvements are not endorsed as they ought to be by an inspector. Periodical visits of inspection to country offices should be made by representatives of the mechanical branch of the Department, and the lines and instruments, as well as the accounts, examined. I trust that I have not wearied the Committee in my effort to bring before the Minister some proposals, the adoption of which, I feel assured, will assist him in mastering the details of this great Department.

It is due rather to the fact that there has been in power a Government-and I see no difference now-that has readily shut its eyes to the constant growth of the Department, and has deemed it to be its duty at a time of tremendous expansion to withhold from it the capital necessary to enable it to meet its demands. two ways to meet the difficulty, unless some sort of loan expenditure is to be incurred : either the general revenue must furnish the necessary funds, or the Department must be permitted to do what any other business controlled by private enterprise would do: to provide for its own wants by increasing its charges for services rendered.

The Postmaster-General continues to give honourable members the stereotyped reply, and we are informed that all our complaints will be attended to as soon as funds permit.

569,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am glad tofshould operate from 1 mile to 2 miles. On the face of it that would appear to be a concession, but here begins the penalizing process to all who may live at a greater distance from the centre of population. Whilst the cost of a telephone is £ 5 per annum within the two-mile radius, a subscriber living over the line, is charged ros. for every quarter of a mile beyond the two-mile radius. cause the charge used fo be £ 1 for every -mile, or fraction of a mile, beyond the radius. -is now £ 2 for a mile beyond the radius.

I am afraid that the local officer has been interpreting the regulations incorrectly. is a matter of interpretation. I complain that subscribers living beyond the two-mile radius are not even given the benefit of the -direct measurement up to the radial limit. In their case the measurement is exactly as the line runs all the way from the exchange. length of wire is measured from the limit -of the radius. -object if that were done. But that is not the interpretation put upon the regulation. The distance to plaoes beyond the radius is measured as the road runs from the exchange. I direct attention now to a postal anomaly. I speak of matters arising in the place where I live, because I suppose they are typical of what takes place all over Australia, and because I can speak of them from actual personal experience. I live at a place where, according to the latest returns published, 400 people use the post office. As a matter of fact, I believe that the number is more than 400, because there are 500 names on the electoral roll. I find that there is a rule applying to these small places, to t h effect that there shall e be no distribution of letters unless the office earns £200 per annum, and unless there are 100 letters for each delivery. According to the report, 23,000 letters were received there two' years ago, and, of course, the number is much larger now. That averages a good many more than the minimum required for a delivery; but, inasmuch as the other requirement regarding the earning of the office is not met, therefore there can be no delivery. I live halfa-mile from the post office, and I have to get my letters as best I can. There is no delivery, although there are 500 residents. thing like 100 letters per day. would need to be 30,000 letters in order to average 100 per day. MT. JOSEPH COOK -The Department admits that we have more than the minimum number of letters, and there is no doubt that it is a fact; but inasmuch as the post-office does not earn the stipulated revenue a delivery cannot be granted. Let me state why the revenue is not earned. I , for instance, procure my postal requirements as I pass through Parramatta,, which is three miles _ distant, because it is more convenient for me to do that than to walk half-a-mile to the local post-office. Other persons who live a mile from the post office are in a similar position. It is a suburban centre, and necessarily a great deal of the business is done in other places. It goes to swell the revenue of Parramatta, Sydney, and other places. The revenue is being earned at this place, only it is being accounted for in other offices. some limit before we can deliver letters ? that the test is the work being done. If the letters are being posted and received, is not that the best test that the Department is being paid for them somewhere?

583,Mr Joseph Cook,"I should thinkadvantages to which they are entitled, is an absurdly unjust rule to apply to such places. It is the same with a great many of the suburbs I represent near to Sydney. The residents go to business every day in Sydney and buy their pSstal requirements there, but their letters are all sent to their private addresses. So that while the work is being done at this posl office there is not the money there to show that it is being done because it is being spent at other offices. should be met in a reasonable way, instead of being frustrated by absurd rules which seem to have been framed for the express purpose of preventing persons from getting facilities to which they are entitled. * sons are treated at country offices is very much worse. that it is, as we have no delivery and no money orders are obtainable. It seems to me, as I told the officials, a matter of interpreting the rules. Surely there ought to be an authoritative interpretation of them, have been a stoppage in the construction and the officers' should not be left to act as they like. My own opinion is that the rules are not so much at fault as the interpretation of them, but, somehow or other, the officials never make the mistake of interpreting a rule in favour of a man who wants a telephone. It is not honest for the Department to pretend that it is giving to the people this or that concession with the right hand and taking it away with the other by means of absurd regulations. That is not an honest and above board way of doing business. If the Department wishes to give cheap telephones let it do so, but do not let it take back any concession in a surreptitious way. Regarding trunk telephones, I think that in view of what is proceeding the honourable member for Illawarra made a justifiable protest. 1 have a multitude of them in my electorate. After having promised that all these lines shall be undertaken the Department suddenly turns round and says that it cannot be done. The question is, how long will the people have to wait ? There is no promise that next year will bring any relief. though. honourable friend must not imagine, because there is going to be more revenue in the Consolidated Fund at the disposal of the Government that, therefore, this Department will get it. All these good years, in which it is supposed to have done exceedingly well, have been the years in which these services have been starved, and no expansion seems to be possible. The trouble is that the Department is not on a business footing. If it were able to control its own finances there might be some relief, but no matter what it may earn in a year it is only permitted to have what the Treasurer likes to give, and what he The requirements of the place can afford to give depends not upon the requirements of the Department, but upon the requirements of the Budget. That is an anomaly. that three principal trunk lines which were struck off the list were required in constituencies represented by Opposition members. spoken of by the honourable member for Illawarra would pay handsomely from the start; but, contrary to the enterprise in other parts of the world, there seems to of long-distance telephones in Australia. And these lines would appear to be in the constituencies of members of the direct Opposition. able. dence, I suppose. With regard to Gosford, the present line is utterly inadequate. The fee, I think, is io£d. for a conversation with Sydney; and it is better to save one's money, because an effort to communicate only ends in disappointment. Ever since the Department was transferred, we have heard only one tune, namely, that of concessions to users of the Post Office, and not a thought of efficiency or increased resources. In any ordinary business undertaking, if a forward departure were in view, care would be taken to have adequate reserves to meet any emergency. To-day, however, in consequence of the policy followed, the service is disorganized and demoralized. vertisement for Socialism. ThoughI do not know that it is so much due to any fault in the Socialistic system as to the 'fact that the Government has some bee in its bonnet.

The Department chooses to erect arbitrary exchanges where they ought not to be, and makes the unsuspecting subscribers pay for them. A sensible rule was in existence at one time, which saved the Department money, presented unnecessary outlay on the construction of exchanges, and was capable .of expansion, no matter how congested the population might be.

I hope that they will be successful. They have my best wishes.. They have a tough job before them. But if we are to wait until the skein is unravelled by the Commission the interests of Australia will be held up for a considerable time. The trouble is that the' Department is not itself able to assess the value of the sendees which it renders to the public. .1 defy the ex-Postmaster-General or the ' present Postmaster-General to divide accurately the various revenues at present earned by the Department. There is not a system of accountancy worthy of the name. The most urgent need of the moment is such a system of accounts as is to be found in the best private .businesses. Far more difficult things than are dealt with by the Post and .Telegraph Department are handled by private firms. We shall not make much headway until those responsible for the administration master the elements of a sound system of accountancy. I make no reflection upon the officers. They have been working under a system that has been long in operation. But something more is needed; and one of the most urgent needs is one that, will enable the Govefnment to value the services rendered to the public. Who is to know what value should be put upon those Under the prudent arrangement I services at present in their various proportions and relations?

For the last two or three years an effort has been made to steady up and get back to a business basis. I have no word to say against the ex-Postmaster-General. Much has to be said in praise of his efforts to get back to some decent sort of efficiency in administration. The whole service was demoralized during the first five or six years. The sooner we return to the point that the Department should be treated as a business concern and not as a political engine used for placating members of this House the better. The very worse thing that can' be done with a great business of this kind is to use it for political purposes. The result must be that in the end we get less concessions in reality than would be the case if the Department were kept steadily and strictly upon business lines. I throw out these hints in the hope that my honourable friend who is now in charge will do more than simply remove the anomalies that are now causing so much dissatisfaction throughout the country. I hope the Postal Commission will untie some of the knots that now hamper the Department, and so allow it to go freely on its career of increasing prosperity, knowing, as we do, of what infinite use it can be made in the development of the resources of Australia and the facilitation of the business of the Commonwealth. General) [4.36 a.m.] -Honorabl e members will not expect me to reply to their remarks in detail at this hour, but I intend to read in H\ansard all that has been said. I shall take a great deal of notice of it, because I have been thankful for many of the suggestions that have been made. Of course, I. could not promise to carry them all out. No one has greater sympathy than I have with the people in the back country in the matter of mail routes. I represent a back country constituency myself. The question appeals to me so strongly that I would rather cease to be Postmaster-General than agree in future to any Estimates cutting down back country mail routes. But, whilst I have all possible sympathy with facilitating the carriage of mails in remote parts, it is absolutely impossible to carry letters to every person in Australia. There must be some limit. It is only within the last two or three years that it has been found possible to deliver letters to every place in the United Kingdom, so it would be absolutely impossible for us to do so in Australia. Some of the complaints that honourable members have brought before the Committee are, I know, justified. I sympathize a great deal with them, but we cannot carry these works out unless we have money. It is all very well to say that we give the stereotyped reply that there are not sufficient funds. If the funds are not there, the works cannot be done. a financial scheme to provide money to carry them out? Government will_ have to submit to Parliament a scheme to provide money to carry out these works in the Post and Telegraph Department. Whether the money comes from revenue, or by borrowing, or by extra taxation, is a matter of policy for the Government to decide, but no Government should be permitted to live unless they deal with that question. The honourable member for Batman referred to the wages of letter carriers, but they are outside the province of the Department, being controlled by the Public Service Commissioner. If the Department feels that those men are. not being .paid sufficiently, I take it that it will be our duty to recommend to the Public Service Commissioner that their pay should be raised, but at the same time the final issue rests absolutely with him. I am sure that it will be to the advantage of the Department to adopt some of the suggestions that have been made during this debate. Proposed vote agreed to.

I therefore know from the honourable member himself that he has been elected to the office of leader of the Opposition. The reason why I did not see him just now was not because of the absence of any such announcement, but because before he rose I had called upon the honourable member for Hume. There is, therefore, no ground upon which .any complaint can be urged. I desire to addI overlooked the -fact when I spoke just, now-that the honourable member for Parramatta remarked that cn a previous occasion the late leader of the Opposition had been similarly overlooked by me. That state-' ment is not correct, because what took place upon the occasion to which he refers was that the late Prime Minister rose and made' a statement to the House. When he had completed his statement, it was proper for 1 the leader of the Opposition to have risen had he so pleased, and it would have been only in accordance-no t with .any rule, but with the common courtesy which is extended to the leader of the Opposition-for me to have called upon him had he so risen.

On that occasion, I failed in no courtesy to the leader of the Opposition. I did-my duty in calling on the honourable member who first caught my eye, namely, the honourable member for Wide Bay. Later in the day the ex-leader of the Op-, position asked me how it was that I failed, to see him rise after the Prime Minister had qoncluded his statement. . JL then told him what I have already told the House, and the honourable member for Illawarra and certain other honourable members know perfectly well that after I had put the. points to the honourable member for East Sydney he was amply content, and informed me that he would withdraw from the newspapers certain complaints regarding my action which he had sent to them earlier. assurance of the ex-leader of the Opposition that the step which I took upon fhe occasion in question was one against which he did not complain after I had explained the sequence of events to him. Tonight the honourable member for Parramatta is equally without any ground of ccmplaint.

The leader of the Opposition holds a high position in this House, but he does not overshadow everybody else, and I very much resent the attitude which he has assumed upon the present occasion. [5.6 a.m.] I suppose that I have to submit to be chastised in this way as the result of addressing you, sir. I want to say that I was on my feet as soon as was the honourable member for Hume. If you, sir, did not see me, it was most unfortunate I accept your assurance that you did not' see me, but I still say that I was on my feet in ample time to catch your ""eye. Therefore, I have the absolute this difficulty has arisen. I can only say that I have allowed honourable members more latitude than usual, but I , on a per-. sonal matter .of this kind, did not desire to escape any remarks which the leader of the Opposition might wish to make.

Minister did, but if the Prime Minister refuses to give this information he must take the consequences. I am not begging for the information, and shall not persist further with the matter. [5.9 a.m.] -The position we take up is that the Government are responsible for carrying on to the best of their ability the business of the country, and tendering the best possible advice to the representative of the Crown. It may be necessary to call Parliament together at a very early date. As the honourable member knows, circumstances may arise to render such a course necessary, but r may say that in any case it is the intention of the Government to meet Parliament before the end of the present financial year. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. Ordered That Mr 'Fisher and Mr Batchelor do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. a first and second time. In Committee :Clause1 (Short title)[5.11 a.m.] -In response to a second request by me for information regarding the duration of the approaching recess, the Prime Minister has seen fit to return precisely the same answer that he gave to my first inquiry on the subject. I take it to be his final answer, but I should like to say that, in my judgment, it is not a fair one. Every one knows that next year will be the last of the present Parliament, and that as the general election has been put back, it will be possible for us to remain in session later than October or November next. That means that in the remote States, and particularly in that from which the Prime Minister himself comes, it would be impossible to do any campaigning during the rainy season, so that honourable members will need not. He reto be away from this House as early as usual. Buti f we are not going to meet until late in the year there will be very little chance of our doing any work of a practical character. I do not know whether these considerations have occurred to the honourable gentleman, but they seem to me to make it all the more reasonable to expect from him a slightly more definite answer than he has given to my question. However, I have no right to pursue the matter further. I should like to point out that many honourable members who come from the distant States are entitled to some consideration. We have been sitting here continuously since the House first met, and I for one certainly desire to see my constituents during the recess. The beginning of the year is a most inconvenient time, owing to the hot weather and the wet season, to select for a visit to our constituencies. If we have a very short recess it will be impossible for most honourable members coming from Queensland to do so. same in regard to the representatives from Western Australia. representatives of all the distant States. We certainly ought to have some opportunity to visit our electorates. Clause agreed to. Clauses2 and 3 agreed to. Schedule agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

I was not aware that that statement had been made. I gave instructions on leaving for London for the prosecution of a certain firm. The information placed before me at the time was of a very serious character. From the representations made to me, I had no doubt whatever that the case was similar to one which had just been dealt with. It appears that the prosecution in this case was proceeded with. I do not know why or how it was arranged, but the two principals of the firm were allowed to plead guilty, and they received practically no punishment at ail. I feel very much dissatisfied with the result of the case. No blame can be attached to the Minister as the case had gone out of his hands. Prosecutions were continued against the clerks of the firm, but, so far as I can gather, nothing further was done to the principals.

As my attention has been directed to tlie matter I desire now to correct in part the statement. I made. I said that the members of this firm had not been prosecuted. I did not think that they had. I had not heard anything of their prosecution. This was due, apparently, to the fact that they were allowed to plead guilty, and a light fine was imposed. before the'Court? ence to the other case, I do not know what has been done, but I can inform honourable members that an application was made to me to agree to settle the matter by accepting the payment of a nominal sum. the Court now. application made to me.

However, at this hour of the morning I do not desire to detain honourable members. a.m.] I wish to bring before the Prime Minister a matter which I think most honourable members would like him to consider. As ""the slaughter of the innocents "" is likely to occur this week, can he see his way clear, sir, with your permission, to allow a division to be taken, without debate, on all motions standing on the notice-paper, so that honourable members in whose names they appear might consider in the recess whether it would be worthwhile to submit them again next session ? My reason for making the request is that this is the second session in which thetime allotted to private members has been sacrificed in the interests of the country. Some of these motions are of great importance to private members, and if some means could be devised for taking a division on each one without debate they could all be . . settled in an hour. done, without a debate. quite possible to institute such a thing as a division night, .when an honourable member could ascertain the opinion of the House on a question just as directly as the honourable member will give a reply to a question on the hustings, because a division could be taken in a few minutes. [5.28 a.m.] I have been glancing over the motions standing in the names of private members, and I do not think that the honourable member for Melbourne could is before the find a more important, set of motions if he looked through any notice-paper. I feel that some of them have not been sufficiently considered to be taken without debate; but so far as I am able I shall afford every possible opportunity for private business to be brought on.
