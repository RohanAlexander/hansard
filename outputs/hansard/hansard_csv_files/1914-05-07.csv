BEEF TRUST. sire to move the adjournment of the House to disguss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" the operations of the American Beef Trust in Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. on this side may congratulate themselves on having awakened the Government to the significance of the operations of the American Beef Trust in Australia. There is no doubt that the criticisms uttered from this side had something to do with directber said that the trust is not responsibleing the Government's attention to the matter, and evoking the intimation from the Minister of Trade and Customs of what the Government policy is to be. orable members opposite could never doin the case of their own Government! man's Government is our "" own Government "" at the present time, and it is his duty, and that of his colleagues, to look after the public interests. The public press has left us in no doubt as to theserious position in which our meat supply is placed by this trust. Irrespective of whatour opponents may say, we are more than satisfied that the Beef Trust is here, and is operating extensively, and that, in consequence, the people are paying a high price for their meat to-day. This trust will visit every house in the Commonwealth and extort tribute from the-tables of the people; and there is no doubt that it is its intention to batten on Australia as it has on other countries of thcthe Minister of Trade and Customs, even something in the interests of the people. Although the suggested Royal Commission is not very likely to be of much benefit at the present time, we have, at least,, a guarantee that the Government propose legislation of some description. Whether or not that legislation will prove effective it is, of course, very hard to say; but, at any rate, it will show the public that this Parliament, on whom the responsibility in such matters rests, is determined to stop these predatory operations. Therois no doubt that, owing to the Beef Trust, the Aberdeen works, in New South Wales, which have been in existence for a great number of years, and which depended, to a large extent, on Queensland for the supply of cattle, have been closed down. Be that as it may, Mr White, the Minister of Agriculture in Queensland,has been telling the people of thenorthern portion of that State that he is highly delighted with the operations of the trust there-that he is pleased to know that the price of meat as going up. orable member for Maranoa say? for the high price of meat, but I hope to-",15,Elector Al Rolls

82,,"Mr SHARPE -That honourable membe able to prove tliat it is AVhen we find a State Government, as represented by their Minister, applauding the operations of the trust, and offering it every assistance in driving out competition, we may imagine that those who for m the trust are looking forward to a f a i r l y rosy time. When We have the Ministerf o r Agriculture in Queensland saying that he w ill be delighted to know that the price of meat in Australia w ill be higher than now, we can imagine that before long the Commonwealth w ill be visited by an overplus of unemployment and poverty. I oan quote an authority in each capital of the Commonwealth as to the cause of the increase of prices. Mr Walker, of the Sutton Forest Butchering Company, Sydney, says that the high prices realized at Homebush are due to the. fact that no cattle are coining forward from Queensland, which in tlie past has practically been responsible for the supply of half the meat slaughtered in Australia. It is on account of the shortage in cattle coming south that the. people in the southern States are paying so much for their meat to-day. Mr Walker, who is one of the most reputable butchers in the Commonwealth, says that he has to pay £ 1 5 and £ 1 6 per head for cattle which he was buying three or four months ago for £ 1 0 and £ 1 2 . Our opponents tell us that the high prices realized for cattle are due to the increased wages paid to slaughtermen, but Mr Walker says that these have not interfered ^with the trade in any way. Mr Angliss, of -Melbourne, gives a similar opinion. He says that it is impossible to continue the export trade on account of the high price of cattle in Australia and the low price of meat on the London7 market. I shall be able to prove that the American Beef Trust controls the London meat market as well as the American markets. It controls two-thirds of the meat sent to the London market, and therefore is in a position to control and regulate the prices. for freezing in Australia that always ends in June? panies operate all the year round. Angliss and Company do so as a rule, but now they say that it is impossible to operate -on account of the high price of cattle here and the low price on the London market. We have a similar opinion from Mr Either, of Adelaide, who has heen in the business a great many years. When these men say that it is absolutely i m possible to continue the export trade, and that the tra'de is practically ruined, we must come to the conclusion that it is due to the presence of the Beef Trust. not say so. not sufficient time to read the quotations showing MrE t h e r ' s opinion, but he says it is because no cattle are coming from the sister States that the people of Adelaide are paying such high prices for their meat, and we know that the greater portion of the cattle passing through the South Australian cattle yards come from Queensland. Agents tells us that prices are likely to go still higher because there are not sufficient cattle coming forward. They tell us also that the prices are likely to be reduced in the spring, but, in my opinion, instead of the prices beuig reduced, they arc likely to increase, because the Beef Trust, if they have not already bought four of the meat works in Queensland, have made sufficient arrangements to have their cattle treated when they come into the slaughter yards; in the same way that the arrangement was made by the South Australian Government to oblige Armour and Company. The honourable member for Werriwa, in trying to make a case for the Beef Trust, and justify their presence in Australia, showed that the number"" of cattle in America had fallen very considerably. He quoted from a publication issued by the Agriculture Bureaui n Washington, and he showed that the cattle of the United States had fallen to the extent of about 13,000,000 head in four years; but the same publication shows that dairy cattle have maintained tlieir numbers, also that there is sufiicient land i u the United States to supply cattle to meet the requirements of the whole of the United States aud England, provided ""the stock-raiser can get a ready market for his cattle. Our opponents tell us that cattle are bringing excellent prices in the United States, but I can quote figures to show that the price of cattle is not as high as is obtained in Australia, while the price of meat wholesale is about double what it is in Australia.

Having regard to the prices that the We are told that the trust w ill have no chance of successfully opposing the trust. Swift and Company have on most up-to-date works in the world, and, according"" to the manager, will be able to of sheep a day. It is rumoured that works near Townsville, and the Lakes Creek works near Rockhampton. It is said, too, that they have secured the adjoining property, which was owned by Messrs. J . and R. Scott, and have thus 1000 miles of what is admitted to be the finest cattle country in the CommonIt is wealth. I am not in a position to say positively that these rumours are true, but, judging by the tactics adopted by Australia, the trust, I conclude that they have some exporters interest in the works I have named. They have also secured the Alligator Creek they works and the Biboohra works. It is admitted by every one in the north, although denied by the Biboohra shareholders, that the Beef Trust has not secured these works. The people in the northern parts of Queensland are not prepared to believe that the trust has not some interest in , and will not have cont r o l over, these works. The Burketown boiling-down works have recently been taken over and renovated by some one, a great deal of money having been spent on them; and it is concluded that the Meat Trust-o r some one connected with it , probably some of our young law clerks in Brisbane-ha s allowed capital to d r if t up there to re-establish these works. are also ready to think that the trust has more than a controlling interest in the operations of the Union Cold Storage Company thattis about to open works in the Northern Territory. Word was received from Brisbane yeserday that the trust has bought the business of Messrs. Baynes Bros., the biggest butchers in Queensland, who do a wholesale and retail trade. Mr Baynes has told me on several occasions that he would rather sell to the trust than engage i u competition with it . Everything points to Swift and Company having acquired these works. Messrs. Armour and Company had control of the Rosewarnes Meat Works, on the Brisbane River, for a considerable time, and every ounce of meat that left those works bore their brand. arranged with B i r t and Company, on the Brisbane River, to treat cattle whenever they were overstocked at Rosewarnes. That has been admitted by the manager of the works. There is only one works on the Brisbane River which they have not secured. In Sydney, the Colonial Meat Export Company is operating very extensively, and it is the opinion of every person in the meat trade of New South Wales that the American Beef Trust has control of that company. We are told that a firm at Geelong is operating very extensively in live* stock, and exporting every ounce of meat that it can lay hands on. It is the idea of many in the trade that our little legal friends in Brisbane have distributed capital in Victoria, and have given people here 'carte blanche to act in connection with shipments of meat. Thus Queensland is well represented by the trust, as is also New South Wales, and we have the South Australian Government acting for it on every conceiv[29] able occasion, treating cattle for Armour and Company whenever that is necessary or desirable. We have ample evidence that the trust is operating in Australia. Nofc withstanding all our opponents may say, there has been a great deal of forward buying. The trust has secured the whole of the cattle that it is possible to get, and that is why we are paying such high prices for meat. It is preventing stock from travelling to the southern States, which cannot export if they cannot get Queensland cattle. During 1912 Queensland possessed 180,000 more beef cattle than all the other States put together: It had a surplus of 137,000 over 1911, We but the Commonwealth showed a reduction during the year of 251,000. The figures show that we have gone back, and that the Government should take into consideration the desirability of maintaining our cattle statistics; otherwise, in a year or two no other companies than tlie Meat Trust will ba able to export, and we shall not be growing enough,, meat for our own people. If the Government is anxious to take action, I would point out that one thing to be done is to preserve the young stock of the dairy farmers, which is now slaughtered. It is useless to tackle this matter unless it is intended to handle it in a practical and thorough manner. I had many figures to submit, but time w ill not per' mit me to say more. I hope that the They Minister of Trade and Customs w ill consider the facts that I have laid before h i m , and w ill take steps to prevent the people of Australia from suffering. If the trust is allowed to remain in Australia, it w ill fatten on the tables of the people, and bring about here poverty similar lo that which it has caused in America. -Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [3.35] I desire to say only a few words on this matter, with a view to shortening the debate, so that we may get on with the business of the country. important business than this. not an extraordinary thing that we have> been discussing this business for -threeweeks ? misdeeds in connection with the Teesdale Smith contract.",17,Adjournment Formal

I will put it in this way: Not one line of any kind can be found in those papers which 'will show my honourable friend's disapproval of anything that has been done.

The nature of those proposals will be made known in a few days. In the meantime, we propose to appoint a Royal Commission, a Commission of onea Judge, if we can get one. the facts concerning the operations of this company; .to find out if there is a trust in Australia that is operating in a way which is harmful""to the consumers of meat in Australia.

No matter what it may cost to do that, the Government will do it, if it be humanly possible.

I didto the point which we reached in 1910. the danger to Australia from this great trust, and they will shortly havs to admit their utter lack of power to deal with it. It is something' that they should have admitted what they have. The rest will inevitably follow. they denied that there was any danger. The Prime Minister went through the last campaign denouncing the perfervid imaginations of the Fisher Government, and more particularly my own, in regard to these trusts, which he elegantly described as "" Billy's bogies."" declared thab they really did not exist. They were nothing, or if they were anything at all they were not only harmless, but beneficial. But the honourable gentleman now lashes himself up to fever heat, and would have us believe that he is not only alive to the danger but that he proposes to do all that a man can do to deal with it . I intend to show what he can do, now that he is alive to the fact that this great trust is in operation here. He is very much like a man who, having allowed some dreadful calamity to approach within striking distance of him, having all along stoutly declared that there was no such thing, suddenly realizes its existence, and says, "" I see it now, and I shall do all that is humanly possible to avert it , "" bub knows at the same time that he is than he is able to stop the earth going round the sun. ister says he proposes to do all that is humanly possible! the Constitution is amended-nothin g ! It is just as certain that this trust will do what it wishes, so far as we can prevent it, as it is that night shall follow day. How may we deal with this trust? I speak now, not of a hypothetical thing, or of trusts in general, but of a trust which the Minister admits is here, and which every member of the Ministry says must be dealt with. But how to deal with it: that is the question! and Customs"" has his eye on it,"" and one of the coruscations from his eye has materialized on the business paper. tralian Industries Preservation Act. Mr Hughes. But though he should amend every StaI n other words, they now admit tute, he would be just as powerless as he is to-day. There is no means by which this Parliament can deal with this trust, unless the Constitution be first amended. I propose to prove that. The Government tell us that they intend to deal with the trust in two ways. The first of these is by an amendment of the Until quite recently Australian Industries Preservation Act,, with the exact nature of which we are not yet familiar. The other is by the appointment of a Royal Commission. Let me deal with these two proposals in turn. For what purpose do they, propose a Royal Commission? To inquire whether He the Beef Trust is a menace to civilization and to the producers and consumers of Australia? Surely that is not necessary? It is no more necessary than it would be to appoint a Royal Commission to ascertain whether fire burns, or water, in sufiicient quantities, drowns. It is as certain as anything in this world can be that the Beef Trust is here, not for the benefit of the Australian consumer or producer, but for the benefit of the Beef Trust. A Royal Commission is not Shortly put, he can do nothing. necessary to inquire into that. If , however, the object of the Government is, by means of such a Commission, to get evidence to prosecute the Beef Trust, then I can only say that the Royal Commissions Act is just about as effective for getting evidence as would be the attempt to gather the constellation Hercules into a butterfly net! The Royal Commissions Act, even before the decision of the Privy no more able to avert it Council in the Sugar Company's case, proved to be a miserable failure The The Prime MinSugar Commission was told everything that we knew already, and all that there And that is-unti l was no difficulty in finding out in other ways. But directly it began to ask questions necessary to ascertain material facts upon which to base a prosecution under the Act, or further legislation which would incriminate the Sugar Company, the witnesses declined to answer. Proceedings were then taken in the * High Court, and an injunction was granted restraining the Commission from ' putting those questions. In the Colonial Sugar Refining Company The Minister of Trade and Others v. The Attorney-General and Others, as reported in the Argus Law Reports, Vol. 18, 1912, page 435, the High Court decided that a Royal Commission He proposes to amend the Ausmay ask no questions on the internal management of the affairs of a company; on the operations of a company outside the Commonwealth; as to the operations of the company as a corporation formed under the State laws, and lawfully exercising its corporate functions within the Commonwealth; relating to the value of particular parts of the property of the company, except such parts as are actually and directly employed-in this particular casein the production and manufacture of sugar within tlie Commonwealth; and as to the details of salaries paid to officers except so far as these are relevant to the actual cost of such production and manufacture. That is to say that no answers to questions going to the root of monopoly or attempted monopoly by any company of the manufacture or sale of any commodity could be enforced. That -was the position before the Privy Council delivered its judgment in the same case. The Privy Council judgment, reported in the British Law Reports, Part 1, 14th March, page 327, held that the Royal Commissions Acts of 1902-12 were ultra vires so far as they purport to enable a Royal Commission to compel answers to questions, or order the production of documents, or otherwise compel compliance by members of the public with its requisition. Their Lordships, in delivering judgment, said, as reported on page 257Without re-drafting the Royal Commissions Acts and altering them into a measure with a different purpose, it is, in their Lordships' opinion, impossible to use them as a justification for the steps which tbe Royal Commission ou the Sugar Industry contemplates in order to make its inquiry effective. They think that these Acts were ultra vires, and void so far as they purported to enable a Royal Commission to compel answers generally to questions, or to order the production of documents, or, othersome other place where translated poliwise, to enforce compliance by the members of the public with its requisition. That is the position to-day. No answers can bo enforced to material questions under that judgment; and, in any case, the Acts themselves are declared to be xiltra vires, and beyond the ""power of the Commonwealth to have passed. So much for the Royal Commissions Acts. There remains now the question of amending the Australian Industries Preservation Act. went to the country, the Labour party were asked why they had never used the 1910 Act; and that silly question was asked again last night by persons who ought to have more sense and knowledge of the law than to put it . We did not use the 1910 Act to prosecute the Coal Trust for the simple reason that it is not usual under British law to try people under an Act when the offence has been committed before the passing of .the Act. I never in my life heard of that being done; and it would be such a startling and monstrous perversion of the customary procedure under British law that the very suggestion would create a revolution. The reason we did not prosecute under the 1910 Act was that the offence was committed before that Act was passed. But, in the light of the High Court judgment in the Vend case, I say deliberately that the 1910 Act would not have secured a conviction in that case, and cannot help the Government in this present difficulty. I say, too, that no amendment of the Act could in any way assist the Government to deal with this trust. Of course, if the Government propose to impose an export duty, that is another matter; but to that end an amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act is not needed. The Government have only to bring down a Bill imposing an export duty, and there would be an end of the matter-and of them. I should like to see the faces of the primary producers, who have spent their money to place the present Government inoffice, if an export duty on their produce were proposed. When the Government muster up enough courage to take such a step, they will not be on the Treasury bench, but in heaven, or ticians go. But they will not impose an export duty on produce, and we may put that remedy aside. What remains? As I have said, no amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act would enable the Government to deal with this trust; and when the Prime Minister says they will do all that men may humanly do, he simply says that they will do nothing. Yet something ought to be done, something, indeed, must be done. The When we matter is one of extreme urgency, and the one straightforward plan would be to lay on the table of the House such amendments of the Constitution as are absolutely necessary to enable effective legislation to be passed. all these shams-thes e test measuresand references to gentlemen having their eye on the matter, and keeping it under consideration; come to the bed-rock and amend the Constitution, and then this great trust w ill disappear, so f a r as being a menace to the country is concerned.

What-the honourable gentleman said was that in July, 1912, the then Minister of Trade and Customs, and later the then Attorney-General, knew of the possibility of the Meat Trust coming into Australia. The honourable member for Oxley, from the day he entered the House, has drawn attention to the fact. He has told us that everybody knows that this is a Beef Trust, in which we find that Swift and Company are supposed to be also associated.

It was a base and unworthy imputation that should not have been made. The present Minister of Trade and Customs tried to defend that sort of thing, and immediately advised honourable members to treat the matter in a philosophical Deakin. He had another method of dealway.

Who were those loudest in their protests against amending the Constitution when we asked for the necessary power to deal with these trusts? Honourable members opposite. Did we not hear them from one end of the country to the other saying that there was no trust in Australia; the Attorney-General said that the only trust about which there was any evidence was one in relation to confectionery; but now honourable members opposite are beginning to realize that there is something in the trust business of which they should take notice. Now that the matter is one which is affecting the peomanding that something should be done, the Government turn round, and they are going to give us an inquiry, just like the late leader of the party oppositeMr ing with matters; he used to write a memorandum, and that was all we heard about any matter.

But what good would that do to my friend? It would not mean that we were sitting illegally, but that Mr Speaker had not taken the chair at the right time.

However, the point is an interesting one. With regard to the first contention of the honourable member for Brisbane, the House undoubtedly intended, and by special order directed, that on this Thursday the hour of meeting should be half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I take that to be the general decision of honourable members, as it was come to by the passing of a special motion moved by the Prime Minister, and, therefore, it became a special direction of the House. The resolution passed later, creating a sessional order, was intended, I take it , to deal with, not today's sitting, but all subsequent sittings for the remainder of the session.

As to the second contention, the House yesterday directed that Government business should take precedence of ail other business, and in pursuance of that resolution Government business has been placed first on the notice-paper for to-day. I would remind honourable members that no provision has yet been made for private members' business , and there is nothing in the Standing Orders making it obligatory to have private members' business considered on Thursdays.

The intention of the Attorney-General is clear, and he has never hesitated to place his views on this matter plainly before the country. He is associated with the Prime Minister, who, a l l his life, whether mistakenly, because his judgment Was wrong, or because he was misled, has adopted a view directly opposite from that embodied in the proposal before us. But now, as head of the Government, he proposes to do what he declared to be Wrong, unjust, and bad, in the earlier days of his political career. No one has a right to reflect on another for any change of opinion, provided that there has been a change Of opinion; but the point of we have no evidence that there has been such a change in the case of the PrimeI s the honourable Minister.

What is the difference between the hypocrisy of the Government and our proposal? We said that unionists, as an organized party, with set condiabling them to employ all the casuals tions of employment that are fair and reasonable, with 'remuneration that is sufficient to enable a man to keep himself, his wife, and family in that reasonable comfort which civilized beings ought to have, should be entitled to preference in Government employment.

Pharisee, I should think. interjected very kindly, in that gentle tone of his-so judicial in terms, and, I suppose, specially selected for the occasion. I repeat again that, reviewing my twenty-eight years connection with the Labour movement in Australia, the work accomplished in that movement will bear favorable comparison with anything done by any other organization. The Labour party have done more, in Parliament and out of Parliament, to ameliorate the hard conditions of the toilers, and to do justice to one and all, than all other parties together. Liberals say, "" We did this, and we did that."" things the Liberals say they did were never heard of until the Labour party came into Parliament; or, if they were heard of, they were only placards to catch a few fleeting votes. But the Liberals became very agile after the years 1891-2-3. mental agility that was unknown previously, and social legislation came to pass. However, I do not want to go into that matter now. I oppose the proposal before the House, and I shall oppose the Bill. The Bill itself cannot be discussed now, although we know what its contents are. This motion means just'what I said it means. It is, in my opinion, a placard for a purpose other than it purports to serve, but underneath it is the deliberate intention of the Government to get a political advantage for themselves by enfrom, not among the unionists, but from amongst the non-unionists. In reply to an interjector, I have nothing to say against Mr Packer, or any other man. We have our principles of unionism to uphold, and we shall uphold them despite all the Packers that ever came into existence. But when we see the Prime Minister and other Ministers conciliating and consulting Mr Packer and his friends, we know that is only an additional instance of the desire of the Government to break up the real unions which have done so much for the country, and it is evidence, if it is not proof, of. their determination to discriminate against the real unionists, and not against the bogus unionists. The Prime Minister knows that better than I can tell him. I orjpose this motion, and I hope that the Bill, if it reaches the House, will not pass. I fought my last election everywhere in favour of preference to unionists as a just, sound, honourable and straightforward principle of organized society. Civilized Democracy cannot exist without it , and the man who does not know that is ignorant of the first rudiments of democratic government. Organize, organize; organize. Aa the honourable member for Bendigo pointed out, we do not believe in preference to only unions of employees, but also to unions of employers. The employers, as well as the employees, are mentioned in the Act, and we want all to be treated alike. I have always said that preference should be given to the employers as well as to the employees. Many of the Mr W. H . IBVINE "" All things being equal "" ; do not forget that. ference to me.

The Labour party were polling then nearly 43 per cent, of the votes recorded, and yet we had not a single representative in that House. about justice, and freedom, and their treatment of unionists. So far as they are concerned, justice and freedom have nob begun yet. The influences behind bhe Government have driven them to take this action, which I believe to be wrong, with the object of hitting at the unionists, and not with a. view of bringing about impartiality in Government employment. There are some people who think that this proposal will affect the employees under tlie Public Service Act. I do not think so. Tliere are certain casual employees whom it will affect. But the opportunity which it will alford the Government to give patronage bo their own friends and supporters will make it difficult for any unionist to be employed by the Government, although Ministers may not say so. I stand by tlie policy that the Labour party have adopted, and I am willing to accept the challenge of the Government to fight them on their own ground, and to consult, the people on this measure. * session I have to protest against the introduction of this Bill. reasons for protesting against it , and I am quite opposed to giving bhe Attorney General leave to introduce a measure of this character.

The Attorney-General's horizon is limited to Victoria, which has been very good to him. I do not think he spends much time in the other States of this great Commonwealth.

I do not see anything in the measure providing penalties for the punishment of any official or other person who refuses to carry out the law. Is it proposed to provide penalties, and, if so, what are they to be? I ask honourable members now to listen to the answer given by this idol of the society classes in VictoriaI do not intend to answer questions relating to measures which are before the House. To answer questions as to what is meant by or intended in regard to the legislation actually before Parliament would turn question time into an opportunity for debating at almost interminable length business which ought not to be discussed until called on in the ordinary course.

Does the Attorney-General expect to inflame the minds of those ladies, and other supporters of the Liberal cause, by a proposal which w ill "" do its business "" as di d his CoercionB ill ?

If you remember, sir, I only said that we might imagine it at some period in this session when our imaginations might be worked up to a fever heat by the happenings in the Chamber. The Attorney-General may pass away, and another Attorney-General may be there who may be of a more severe disposition, and may drive a nail into the ear of an unfortunate civil servant who offends in this respect. I do not derive very much inspiration from contemplating the Postmaster-General. I am not able to get a lead from contemplating his countenance, because I know that he cannot have sympathy with the introduction of a Bill of this kind. The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters was formed sixty years ago, when men were receiving, in some cases, 4s. 6d. a day for goodness knows how many hours' work, and the carpenters decided that, in the interests of themselves and their families, they should unite and form a union, paying 6d._ or is. a week into funds to provide against unemployment, ill-health, and accidents. This union has paid out more than £3,500,000 sterling in these directions, and I am sure the Postmaster-General recognises that a member of that body should have preference over one who will* not join the union, and will not pay 6d. a week towards these funds. When the Commonwealth has some casual work to offer for a few days here and a few days there, and two men, both equally good workmen, come seeking employment, the one a member of this union and the other one who says he will not join it , in fairan acrobat or one of those gentlemen who ness, I am sure, the Postmaster-General would give the job to the unionist. The Minister sees the justice of giving preference to the man who belongs to a union. If any one is under the impression that there is a huge obstacle in the way of a man joining a union, let me disabuse his mind of it . I think that a man can join the Carpenters Union for 5s. bourers Union a man has to pay £ 5 . not join the Wharf Labourers Union in New South Wales no matter what you offered. of that. served his time, and knows his trade, and possesses 5s., can join the Carpenters Union. I think that the subscriptions for the Builders' Labourers Union, the Australian Workers Union, and similar organization, are about £ 1 per annum. one union get a paper for that money. get'fifty-two issues of a very good paper. No one seriously believes that the payment of an entrance fee of 5s. or £ 1 is an obstacle to any one joining a union, and when men can join these unions and get all the privileges embodied in the term ""preference to unionists"" why should they not join in the interests of civilization? Under the Arbitration Act we have provided that the Judge acting according to good conscience and equity can give preference, other things being equal. I believe that the honourable member for Kooyong, ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, and ex-Minister of a lot of other things, voted for that provision. surrounded by a vast number of safeguards, all of which your party swept away. supported that provision, and so did several other honourable members who were then followers of Mr Deakin. Are they now going to reverse their form and follow the example of the present Prime Minister, who has reversed his form on so many occasions, and is more agile than loop the loop ? Do the honourable member for Kooyong and the Postmaster-General think it is fair to push through the House a Bill which excludes from its operation lawyers, and the medical profession and architects ?

I never utter threats, and I do not say it as a threat, but on every possible occasion I shall oppose any attempt at class legislation. The unfortunate man who has to work with bowyangs has as much right to justice at the hands of the Commonwealth as the Attorney-General, who goes into Court with his wig and gown.

Whether the Attorney-General will succeed in his desire to mislead the people of the Commonwealth, even with the aid of the Argits, is problematical. I am not going to give him a chance, if I can avoid it , of getting his so-called test dissolution. That brings me to another point. I wish to know whether the honourable member who comes from the Richmond River, possessing the confidence of the Ministry, was accurately reported when he said that it was the intention of the Government, the moment they took office, to force a double dissolution. ing that speech at Murwillumbah, but I never made any speech there, and I have never said any such thing. diction. hope you will accept the assurance of the honourable member. ing OrdersI must. put in, because he has admitted that he said almost the same thing in another place.

I w ill admit that that is a big thing to say, The because, in all our legislative efforts, we must always consider human nature,'and the characteristics of humanity; but I am prepared to say that compulsory unionism These canwould be a solution of many of our present industrial troubles.

346,Mr Dankel,"W h e n we rose forto and to put nothing less than threepence in the plate every Sunday. There is however, no such law; and with compulsory unionism unionists would not be compelled by other than moral suasion to contribute to any political organization. The Australian Workers Union, for instance, w ill , in course of time, consist of half-a-million members; and, with compulsory unionism, a ballot could be taken to ascertain how many were willing to contribute towards, say, the Liberal party's organization. Of course,, we may take it that the great majority would declare for the Labour party, but matters could be arranged so that everybody would feel absolutely certain that not a penny of his money would go towards any political object of which he did not approve. In the present condition of affairs, I say unhesitatingly that it is absolutely essential that preference should be given to unionists, fbr without preference they would suffer even more than they have in the past. We know that even in Australia, where we are 'all supposed to be free, victimization goes on where there are no strong unions. I have always set my face againsb any attempt on the part of the workers to retaliate by means of victimization of employers. Some time ago, at a meeting in a country district of South Australia, some turbulent spirits advocated that a local tradesman, who was against the Labour party, should not have the custom of his political opponents, but I there and then urged that two wrongs did not make a right, and that the proper method was to show the tradesman that he was taking up a wrong position. If that plan were adopted more generally, victimization of the workers would not be in evidence, very long. There is, however, as I say, victimization going on; and I remember that at a meeting I held in a country place many workers were absolutely afraid to attend to listen to what a Labour man had to say. It is true that bhey listened, but it was from outside the building ; they contented themselves by peeping in at the door like rabbits looking out of a burrow. was found in the fact that some of the employers had made it their business to attend the gathering. When I was about to depart by train next morning, a friend of mine said that it was a pity I had not which they themselves belongheld an out-door meeting, because he had noticed about 150 men who had not had the pluck to enter the hall. He then explained that several of the large employers of the district had been at the meeting, and that this had had the effect of keeping the men outside. I pointed out that if the men had been afraid to attend the indoor meeting, they would have been equally afraid to attend the outdoor meeting; but my friend said, "" No t at a l l ; you have a powerful voice, and, as it was a dark night, these men would have listened to you from shady nooks and corners."" my electorate. come under the notice of the honourable .member as they do under the notice of the Labour member. People, under present circumstances, have to lower themselves in their own self-esteem in order to escape victimization. Of course, if the workers were all of one mind, and boldly demanded their rights, the victimization would cease at once; but, as I say, as things are now, victimization goes on, especially in country districts. I have often noticed that direct victimization of the individual is indulged in . The other day, when I was travelling to Adelaide by train, a contractor in a large way of business, who was in the same carriage, was speaking on the subject of unionism. I know that this gentleman treats his workmen very f a i r l y from a monetary point of view, and does not impose on them any very great tasks; but what was the attitude of even this well-intentioned person? He told me that when he has a big job on, he makes it his business to go round at the dinner hour; and if he sees one of the men reading a newspaper and explaining the article to his fellows, he calls his ganger and orders that the man shall be got r i d of at once. He said to me, "" If people once start, thinking, you never, know where it is going to stop.

348,Mr Dankel,"Thes e matters do notown, but through misfortune, were benighted in their views, and unable to help themselves. It is only common sense that people in that position should be shown a better way of living. I am a believer in the divine gospel of discontent, because contentment never made for progress. I do not, of course, favour discontent unsupported by common sense; but it is the duty of every lover of humanity to show the ignorant that there is something more worth living for than their present miserable existence. people are quite happy in what appears to us to be their degradation. seen people going into the coal mines in Russia with a carrot and a piece of dry bread for dinner; and it is no wonder, when they leave the mines, that, in their misery, they rush to the nearest vodkashop, for that is about the only recreation that they had when I was there, or, so far as I know, that they have now. These people are really children from a social point of view, and should be treated as such. Just as we should call our children from playing in the mud, and point out how much happier they would be on the lawn, so we have to show those people, who have not the common sense and intelligence to see for themselves, how to better their condition without bringing about industrial strife and turmoil. I have for long advocated compulsory unionism-indeed , I believe I am the only one who has done so-as a great step towards the gradual improvement of our present industrial and social conditions. Labourers Union is charging new memWe compel people to bear arms. Every law on the statute-book tells people to do, or not to do, something. United' Kiugdom, and on the Continent of Europe, there is compulsory industrial insurance against unemployment and all kinds of things. Even women assistants in households must bear their share of it , and if it is right to compel people to insure, it is equally right and just to compel every wage-eamer to belong to a union, by reason of the fact that he or she is a wage-earner. Compulsory unionism would not only have undoubted advantages for the workers, but it would also be to the welfare and general well-being of the community. For instance, the cost of unionism would be much less. If there are 5,000 workers in a certain industry, and half of them, as they may Mr Dankel. do under the present non-compulsory unionism, decline to belong to the union embracing the other half of those engaged in the industry, it not only brings about' discontent, but it makes the union dues fall more heavily on the individuals comprising the union. Subscriptions to unions' funds would not be, under compulsory unionism, a tenth part of the money necessary to be subscribed under the existing conditions, because there would only be secretaries to pay, and It may be that those there would not be the need to employ the hosts of other officials that, unfortuI have nately, the unions are now compelled to have in order to get members and keep going. Our friends opposite object to the organizers employed by unions, and contend that men should be left alone, and allowed to please themselves about joining a union; but as there can be no progress without organizing, necessarily the unions must employ these men, even though it ruus away with a certain amount of money. All this expense would be a thing of the past with compulsory unionism, and on that score the dues to be paid by. the workers would be infinitesimal in comparison with what they are now. The objection is raised that some unions make it next to impossible for new members to join by making the entrance fees too high. I do not know whether there is any truth in the assertion, but I was told that one union charged new members £20. I was also told the other day by a man in the train that the Townsville Wharf bers £50, making it manifestly impossible for any working man to enter that union. In the I have not ascertained whether that statement is correct, but if it is true, these heavy entrance fees are imposed in order to protect the unions from a financial point of view. It must be remembered that these organizations commenced operations many years ago, and their older members have paid large sums to Bring them to their present financial position. The members of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Union have, for many years past, regularly contributed to the union through weekly payments, and levies, and special calls on the death of members. Some members of this organization, which is now fairly wealthy as unions go, have paid in hundreds of pounds, and naturally they contend, as the older members of a lodge would contend, that a lieavy entrance fee should be charged to those who wish to partake of all the benefits the union can give them. wrong if they did not act in such a way. That is the explanation of some of the high dues which may be demanded by unions in Australia, but all that sort of thing would absolutely disappear with compulsory unionism. Here in Australia where we have a compact continent, populated by the same class of people, to all intents and purposes, it would be, comparatively speaking, easy to bring about compulsory unionism, whereas in other parts of the world the task would be much more difficult. Of course, in unions there are at times some bellicose spirits, but for man, not an organizer, hut one interested the most part their members are people of peace, who do not desire strife, turmoil, and anarchism. The Labour party stand for industrial peace. They are the only party in Australia standing for industrial peace, and anxious to do away with strife and strikes. It is our opponents who are the anarchists of Australia, because by preventing the workers having their legitimate demands seen to they bring about a spirit of antagonism and class hatred such as is in evidence even in this House. for that. There will be none of it if the unions are years ago it was as much as a man's given the opportunity of having their grievances redressed before a properly constituted tribunal. cannot be settled for, perhaps, three years, the other day, those dreadful instruments as is the case with the Tramway Unions. The bootmakers had to spend three or four, thousand pounds before getting a verdict. Would not the honourable member for Echuca get sick of the delays of the law if over a case of his he were kept dillydallying for three years? Would not the honourable member far rather choose to use his own strength instead of obeying the law of the land? The people are beginning to see this now, and I feel sure that the next time the referendum is put to them it will be carried. The abolition of preference to unionists in the Government service would bring about a bad feeling among the workers employed by the Commonwealth. Those not belonging to unions might be taunted hy those belonging to unions, or the non-unionists might boast about being free and independent persons, and thus make the unionists feel not too kindly disposed towards them. HowI n fact, they would be doing ever, I am afraid that while the Conservatives are in power there will be no preference to unionists-it will be preference to non-unionists such as many private employers impose in those avocations where there is little unionism. In the case of warehouse employees and clerks, among whom unionism is not so fully developed as I am sure it will be in the course of time, the employers practically tyrannize the employees, and the man who belongs to a union, or intends to belong to one, is dismissed. The other day a in unionism, went into an office in Adelaide and spoke to the girl typist, eighteen years of age. One of the girl's employers heard this man asking her whether she had any intention of belonging to a union, and, calling her to him afterwards, he told her that if she joined a union she would have to go out of the office. That sort of thing can take place under the present system. It is compulsory nonunionism, and is a great deal worse than having a law to compel people to belong to a union would be. Civilization is so complex now that we must have complex laws. In past centuries the people did not understand enough to feel the need for legislation in this respect. Less than 100 liberty was worth to try to form a trade union. People were deported to New At present a case South Wales and Tasmania, where I saw, of torture used in the early days in connection with convicts. They were deported for terras of not less than seven years for trying to help themselves and their fellows by improving their social and industrial conditions. That took place even during the reign of the late Queen Victoria. In those days people thought that if the workers had any education it would he a bad thing. The statement was-it was not an argumentthat if the workers had too much education no one would do the dirty work. The absence of universal education brings about the idea of there being degradation in doing any kind of manual labour.

They are not trumpery from the Government point of view, but in the eyes of Labour members and of the Labour press of Australia, which, unfortunately, is not yet very strong, although it will, in the days to come, be of dominating power. The Melbourne Punch, which is a long way from being a Labour organ, has ridiculed the idea of it being possible to sethat for personal reasons I do not desire cure a double dissolution by means of these so-called test measures. two, the Bill to prohibit preference to unionists is .the more important. As to the postal voting, the difference of opinion between the two parties is so trifling as to have no weight at all. The Liberal party sets great store by the mea.31st May last. sure which it is now sought to introduce. Members opposite think that the Bill may bring about a double dissolution, and that if it does it will provide them with a ripping good cry for the election. it would do so. Mr J. H . CATTS -Used by a good liar! would not be told. The Bill affects very few persons, but the attempt will be made to persuade the people that a grand principle is involved. To bring a great principle into issue, members opposite should declare against all preference to unionists, whether in the Courts of Law or elsewhere. No doubt, if the Liberals were in a majority, there would be no preference to unionists; it would everywhere be a thing of the past. But what would be the consequence? The honourable member for Wakefield on one occasion told the people of South Australia that if the referendum were carried, and the Labour party got into power, Australia would see a time like that of the French Revolution, and blood would flow Tempora mutantur down the gutters of Adelaide. That would not have happened; but something like it might easily happen if the party As the Attorneyin power repealed the portion of beneficent industrial legislation that the people now enjoy. That would create widespread discontent, so that the organI must not touch on the preizer would have a good soil to work upon, and it would be easy to work up a revolutionary spirit. I ask our friends opposite to be wise in their day and generation, and to provide against that. Our mission, above all things, is to provide for peaceful evolution and progress, so that the generations to come may have better and more equal opportunities, and may lead a life worth living, which many persons cannot do now. It is our duty to prepare the way for the Australia that is to be. We all say that we do not care whether there is to be a dissolution or not; but I do not mind admitting a dissolution. I am afraid, too, that Of the another election would not be a solution of our trouble, except if the party on this side gets back into power, and Australia would again have the progressive and common-sense administration which she enjoyed during the three years prior to question under consideration is of such importance that I must attempt to apply myself to it in a humble way, though I Used by a skilful rhetorician shall not waste the time of the House with any extended utterance. When the Minister in chaTge of the Bill has explained its provisions in his second-reading speech, I hope to be able to make a reply from the stand-point of a working man's advocate. Why preference prohibition ? Does the Leader of the House recognise that preference is given at all times to those who are organized and stand shoulder to shoulder, upholding law and order.

We must not alone do that; we must also educate, educate, and educate. vice is organization, yet honourable gentlemen opposite desire that a section of it shall not be organized in the way that we wish. vice are organized and under the control of the Public Service Commissioner; but when we ask that preference be given to organized men who wish to join the Service, honourable members opposite say that it should not be given. Every man in the Public Service to-day is getting preference because of some qualification he possesses that makes him better fitted for his work than those outside. We say that every unionist belonging to an organized trade or industry is more closely related to that trade and industry than a man who is a'non-unionist, and that it is to the advantage of the community to give such men the preference as against the non-unionists who are disorganized, undisciplined, and not associated with their fellows. ral desire to have under his control unorganized individuals, so that he or his officers may do with them as he pleases, as he did with another set of men some years ago in Victoria? object to preference to men who are organized and prepared to observe law and order? order, and so are we in this immediate issue. Y e t he has the audacity to say to those who are combined in the field of unionism that they shall not have preference as against disorganized men. W ill it not conduce to the well-being of the community if those who are organized are given the preference that we ask for? Some years ago, when leader of the State House, the Attorney-General stated that men could not be allowed to stop the wheels of progress. when the railway strike was on. We remember how effectively he dealt with the situation which occurred then. Now he is seeking to stop the wheels of progress in connection with our industrial development. He cannot do it . He may do it if he carries his B ill through, but he will not carry it without a fight from one end of Australia to the other. If the honourable member places his B ill on the table in order to frighten us, we will kick it under his feet, and fight him for all he is worth. We are ready to take up his challenge. I am sorry I have to disagree with The essence of our Public Serthe honourable member for Boothby in regard to compulsory unionism. I am prepared to see compulsion in connection with unionism, just as we have compulA l l those in the Public Sersioni n every phase of our social l if e ; but the honourable member is mistaken when he says that compulsion means industrial peace. I want peace if I can get it ; but t I want industrial organization and compulsory unionism that will bring our people so closely together that we will be ready for political warfare whenever it arises. I am not so much concerned about peace; there is no possibility of peace while there is wrong in the world. As a Labour party, we are here to rectify wrongs, and if we cannot rectify them, we have no right to be here. Therefore, I differ from the honourable member for Boothby when he says we are here to obtain industrial peace by compulsory unionism. No man desires more than I do peace and agreement in regard to our industrial difficulties; but I am not here Does the Attorney-Geneto make peace at any price. I am here to fight, if fight be necessary, and I will not stand by the honourable member in saying that compulsory unionism will bring us peace. If we can obtain peace, Why should he well and good, but if we cannot, I w ill take compulsory unionism as a means of consolidating the industrial forces, in He is a pleader for law and order to fight those who sit on the Government side. That is plain t a l k ; it is what I mean, and what I hope my fellow members on this side of the House mean. What have the Government done in regard to preference to unionists? Have they not done already what they desire to do ? They have, by administrative action, rescinded all that the Labour Government did by administrative action.

CATTS (Cook) [8.45] The Attorney-General has moved for leave to introduce a Bill entitled "" The Government Preference Prohibition Bill,"" and although it has not yet been placed in the hands of honourable members, we know perfectly well that it is the selfsame measure that was before the House last session. This Bill, on the face of it, is a fraud and a sham. of such an expression has already been ruled out of order several times. fraud, is certainly a delusion. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is a delusion and a snare. It purports to do something which those who are putting it forward know perfectly well it does not do. They know f u l l well that everything that it could do has already been done. They tell us that they desire to go on with the business of the country; yet they put before us a Bill which is designed to bring about a dissolution, and so to prevent business being done in this Housea Bill which seeks to have business done in some House other than that at present constituted. That being so, the introduction of this Bill is an indication that the Governpeople were told also that the sanctity of ment have no desire to do the business for which the country is calling. The Government are not anxious to advance the business of the country one iota, and are really extending to us an invitation to take up time in discussing this measure. The only object they have in view is to secure the immediate dissolution of both Houses. If we on this side are not agreeable to that-if , iu other words, we do not desire immediately to send to the country the members of the Senate, where we haye twenty-nine, as against seven on the Liberal side-the n we have in the proposal now before us an invitation to adopt any tactics that will delay business. If the Government had brought forward business that the country desires That is the should be transacted-if , for instance, they had submitted a scheme for some developmental work in which both parties would have been a whole-souled effort made on this side to have it passed. But when the Government refuse to do anything of the kind, when they simply come down to the House with a proposal to dissolve the Parliament, we can come to no other conclusion than that they have no wish to transact any business of national importance. Their desire really is to transact business of party importance^-busines s which will give their political party some advantage. They do not wish to advance the interests of the nation. This Bill is also designed to supply them with an election cry which will enable them to misrepresent their opponents, and to create in the minds of the people a belief that there is some danger to be feared which does not actually exist. The Bill, in short, is something like the scarecrow which the farmer places over his crop. The Ministerial party are notorious for their scarecrows. At an election held some time ago, when they saw that the party opposed to them was growing in numbers and increasing in influence they put up the scarecrow of Socialism. Sir George -the n Mr Reid toured the country with the scarecrow of Socialism at the end of a stick. Every one was told to beware of it . Mothers were warned that with this Socialism they might have their children taken from them, whilst the the marriage tie was to be ignored. We faced that scarcecrow fairly and squarely and succeeded in laying it in the dust. Then they came along with scarecrows of other kinds. To-day they tell us that they are seeking a dissolution so that they may go to the constituencies, and, at the same time, they are seeking for something by which they can misrepresent the situation to the people and put up yet another scarecrow. The public mind is such that, where the citizens do not thoroughly grasp the situation, they are influenced by these scarecrows, and by the time they see",48,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill
359,Mr Speaker,Order! The use,49,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill
360,Mr Higgs,"The Bill, if it is not athrough one, yet another is invented. In this respect the Government are resorting to the same old dodge which the farmer plays on the parrots that hover over his orchard. In the first place, the farmer puts up a stick with a cross piece on which he hangs a coat. birds that are after his cherries fly over it a few times and, having looked at it carefully, conclude that it is only a scarecrow and come down and have their feed of f r u it . Then the farmer says, "" I must change my scarecrow, I must make it resemble a man -"" Taking some straw from his stack he makes up the figure of a man, paints a face on it , and surmounts it with a hat, and, fastening it to a pole, sets it up. The same old birds which had dropped to his device of a few days before are thus scared off once more. They perch on the trees near by and finally come to the conclusion that this is only another scarecrow. The farmer, however, has only to resort two or three times to this dodge and he has his crop garnered. And so with our opponents. They put up a scarecrow and the public at the beginning are fooled by it . Before they can see through the device the election is over and the scarecrow has served its purpose. When the next election comes along up goes another scarecrow. . The people who do not understand the situation are afraid of it , and it serves its purpose. That is what the Government are doing in this case. Before the Prime Minister came into this House-whe n he was pursuing his candidature in the country-h e misrepresented the position, and it is being misrepresented to-day. sented a few days ago by the Minister of Trade and Customsi n the local press, and it has been misrepresented to-night by the honourable member for Wannon. I propose to quote from the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister, Mr Joseph Cook. MrJ . H . CATTS livered by Mr Joseph Cook at Parramatta and reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4th A p r i l , 1913. It was supposed to be a policy speech made by him on behalf of the party he was leading. Service Appointments"" there is in it this statementLiberalism arrays itself against the principle obtaining to-day in Government employment by means of which the citizens of Australia are classified, and political opponents declared ineligible for Government employment because of their political creed. That is a misrepresentation. The only preference that was given was in conThe nexion with what is known as the day labour system. It was given in connection with temporary employees and applied only to those employed on what are known as public works in the Department of Home Affairs, on the railways, and i u connection with the building of the Federal Capital. Outside of that, there was no suggestion of any interference with employment; and yet Mr. Joseph Cook was leading his hearers to believe that this preference affected the whole Public Service. The Minister of Trade and Customs, Mr Groom, did the same thing the other day. He led the people to believe that it affected the Public Service as a whole, and the honourable member for Wannon, by interjection tonight, has suggested that this preference was an interference with the Public Service generally. Before the Labour party entered the political arena, what was the position? Liberals kept their seats in Parliament because of the number of jobs they were able to find for their political supporters. Labour had no representation in Parliament. We were dependent upon the Conservative party, then divided into Free Traders and Protectionists, when we made the demand that appointments to the Public Service should be by public examination, and that fitness, and not social influence, should be the only test. that? MrJ . H . CATTS -That does not' matter. WhatI say is perfectly true. I remember it well, although I have not the exact date at hand. was in our party then, was he not ?

369,Mr Kelly,"It is no longer a fact.I do not fear the issue of preference to unionists, but I do fear the misrepresentations of the party opposite. The Liberal party have tremendous funds at their disposal, with Liberal organizers at every door, and millions of newspapers to carry their misrepresentations throughout Australia ; and these facts do give me some ground for fear. There can, however, be no denial of the facts I have stated. The honourable member for Wannoni n terjected to-night to the effect that this B ill is intended to stop honourable members on this side "" from manipulating the Public Service"" ; but the honourable member knows perfectly well in his heart that it is nothing of the kind, for everything that the B ill can do has already been done.

Mr P. P. ABBOTT I shall give the honourable member the phrase-rip e legislation. ' MrJ . H . CATTS bursting, and the smell of it can be detected from one end of Australia to the other. There is another aspect of the matter that is worthy of consideration. If the Government, for instance, in the construction of the transcontinental line, found that certain work could be performed only by rhaking terms with a union which included preference to members of that organization, it would be in the public interest that they should be able to do so. Yet they introduce this B ill to tie their own hands, and prevent them entering into an agreement with an organization, when probably circumstances might render it absolutely necessary. in which this B ill can have any operation 1 whatever is such as I have cited; and, as a matter of fact, I think a situation of the kind has already arisen. In the South Australian Herald of the 24th A p r i l this year, there appears the following:-Mr P. W. Lundie, secretary of the South Australian Branch of the A.W.U., has received the agreement which has been entered into between the branch and the Home Affairs Department of the Commonwealth Government regarding the wages to be paid to the men constructing the Transcontinental Railway. The rates of pay will govern those working from the 50-nule peg to and including Tarcoola yards. The agreement will be binding only as regards members of the union and the classes of work organized by that organization, and it shall only apply on work done by the Department itself, and not to any contract work. It shall come into force immediately, and shall be retrospective as from 1st April Then follow the rates of pay. I have made inquiries, and I have word from the secretary that the agreement referred to has been signed on behalf of the Commonwealth, and is now in active operation. Now, if this B ill be carried, the Government w ill not be able to enter On the other hand, if they into such an agreement, although they may believe it to be necessary. The rate of pay is attached to the agreement, but I have not quoted it , because it is not so much to the point. We have here preFrom every point ference to unionists of the most extreme type I have ever seen, and I have been connected w it h unions for a number of years. The rate of wages set down is not to be paid to any but members of the union. If a non-unionist goes there to work he is not entitled to that rate, and if he gets it it is not because of the agreement, but as a matter of grace. This is It is over-ripe to preference to unionists and compulsory unionism combined. graph again if I were the honourable member! Mr J. H .

I have no doubt that the paragraph w ill beread a good many times before the campaign is over, but as the HonoraryM in ister desires, I do not see why I should not repeat it now. The only case ber has already read the paragraph, and he would not be in order in reading it again.",51,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill

A t any rate, it is a piece of news which brands this legislation for what it really isa piece of political make-believe and political buffoonery. I sliould now like to say a word or two as to the attitude of the Prime Minister himself in regard to preference to unionists. when the matter was under consideration, I quoted from .a speech by the Prime Minister, made in 'the New South Wales Parliament, on ,2nd August, 1900, just before he became a member of this House. more effective speech in defence of the great principle of preference to unionists than that made by Mr Joseph Cook on the 2nd August, 1900. Even the bril liant ex-Attorney-General has not made -a stronger speech upon this great principle. this time the honourable gentleman had deserted the Labour party who put hi m into Parliament, and had already been a Ministeri n a Liberal Administration, and he was giving his opinion on preference to unionists as a Liberal. could be nothing more emphatic. was in 1900. We had another speech on the same subject from the honourable gentleman in 1904. He is reported on page 7846 of the Commonwealth Hansardf o r 1904 to have said in this ChamberThe honourable member for Newcastle referred to me as an old-time secretary of a trade union. The honourable member is quite right. When I was secretary to a union we always insisted on preference to unionists, and in a very summary fashion. Union. We had no difficulty in doing that; and I am free to tell the honourable member that if I were in the same position to-day I should do the same again. Theni n answer to a question as to how long he was secretary of this union, he said-For some years. If I were in that position again I should adopt the same attitude. I have no sort of sympathy with the man who will work alongside another man and see that other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights and to maintain his position whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefits for which the other is paying and working. I have no sort of sympathy with that kind of thing. [30]z I am sorry that That is how in 1904 the present Prime Minister described non-unionists. He described them as a lot of skulkers. And it seems quite appropriate that the honourable gentleman, who has espoused every political cause that has ever been before the public, should now wheel right round to the opposite position and lead the forces of anti-unionism, forces that are being directed, and whose funds are provided, by the employers' organizations in an effort to strangle the prin .Last session, ciple of preference to unionists.

CATTS -If that is an unThere has never been a parliamentary expression, I withdraw it . I shall call the B ill an unsubstantial thing, an unreal thing, a mythical measure. We know what Ministers would do if they could, because in their policy statement in the Governor General's Speech of July, 1913, they saidI t has to be remembered that at It is proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of whose funds are directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes; and also to restore the exemption of rural workers from There the operation of the Act, believing that the That conditions of their employment ought to be left to the States. That is what they would do if they had the courage to do it , but they have not the courage, and they have gone back on what they said they would do, and come along with this mythical measure by which they w ill lead the people to believe that they have done the other thing, and will misrepresent the qualifications for entrance to the Public Service. I have no doubt that if this kind of political pea-and-thimble rigging has the desired result, and Ministers come back w it h a 1 sufiicient* majority to give effect to what they desire to do, there w ill be a general attack on the organized workers of Australia. They talk about the unions using funds for political purposes. Is there anything in the objects of any union which is not the subject of political intervention?

The present Prime Minister has been driven from one point to the other on this question« of preference to unionists, and when he is bailed up in the corner, what does he say ? He does not say that he has gone back on his opinions. 12th June, 1912, at Lithgow, the town which gave him political birth-and this brings me a littl e furthe r up-to-datehe is reported to have saidHe believed in having his own opinion, and would not allow any caucus to think for him or come between him and his constituents.' He had not altered his position; the others had done the jumping round, and now imagined he had. It must be remembered that he was speaking at Lithgow, in the midst of a great industrial district, a great union and he was explaining to this which had put him in Parliament at the very beginning, taken him from the coal pit and given him political birth, that he had never done any jumping round, but still held to his opinions, and that others had done the jumping. asked how he justified his attitude in reference to preference to unionists, and as to why he believed unionists formerly, and was now taking steps against it, he explained-I the reference with me-that of to-day was different from the unionism with which he was engaged when enforced preference to unionists; that the unions of to-day had political objects, and used some of their funds in those political objects, whereas in the days to which he referred Mr J. H. Catts. purely industrial, and compelled preference to unionists in a purely industrial way. During the recess I have been looking up a littl e more of the history of the Prime Minister, and now I am in a position to show that the preference to unionists he sought for was preference to Labour bodies taking an active part in politics. In Lithgowi t was Mr Joseph Cook who went to the unions and invited If they seek conthem to come together for the purpose of electing a member of Parliament and baking political action. The following letter, which was written by him, I wish bo have placed in the pages of Hansard, where the public can have access to it . It is as follows: Having regard to a communication which recently appeared in the daily press purporting to have been written by the secretary of the Drivers' and Firemen's Association to the Trades and Labour Council, suggesting the fusion of the Labour forces of the district, with a view to returning a representative to Parliament whose sympathies should be entirely with the worker, I am directed by my delegate board to submit for your consideration the following Speaking on the proposition :-That two (2) representatives from each Labour organization of the Hartley district meet, at a time and place to be hereafter arranged, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps for the return of a Labour candidate at the next general election. The need for this has been emphasized by the unsympathetic, and actively hostile attitude assumed, by our present member throughout the long and wasting strike, in the midst of which our own organization is plunged at the present time. During the present criBis, Mr Hurley has not failed whenever the opportunity presented itself to declaim against the tyranny and unrighteousness of the methods of our prodistrict, cedure, as well as having gone out of his way to be brutally offensive towards those members district, upon whom only we can rely to furnish us with the means of voicing our complaints in the which had practically Parliament of the country. Not only so, but very recently Mr Hurley gave expression to words in the House which can only be construed as containing a direct challenge to the Labour organizations of this district. Furthermore, since the commencement of the present Later on, when he was struggle Mr Hurley has never evinced the slightest desire to help in any way those of his constituents and supporters whose fortunes have been so adversely affected by the in preference to continuance of the strike, and, indeed, has shown in every possible way and manner the strong sympathy with those who in this have not struggle must be regarded as the' opponents r.f the unionism trade unionism. In view, therefore, of the unquestionable attitude taken up by Mr they Hurley with respect to the progressive developments of the Labour forces of this colony, my Board is anxious to express its cordial agreement with the action taken by the Drivers and advancing Firemen's Association, and urge the earnest consideration of the above proposition as the best means of giving effect to that sympathy the unions were which exists amongst the various workers of the Colony, and which can only find fitting expression in that unity of action which shall secure to us direct representation in the Parliament of this Colony. Hoping you will give the'matter your best attention, and do me the favour of an early reply. (Sgd.) Jos. COOK, Miners' General Secretary. This shows Mr Joseph Cook as the very gentleman who, at the time when the unions were not taking part in the politics of the country, urged them to do the very thing for doing which he now seeks to penalize them, and yet he says it is honourable members of the Opposition who have done the jumping round, and that he has not altered his Opinions from the time he was taken from the coal p it and put into Parliament. He is like the man who goes about and says that everybody else is mad, and he is the only sane man. We generally take such a man to the reception house, and have him examined at once. I have shown these statements of the Prime Minister from the time he first entered the New South Wales Parliament, in 1890, to 1900, when he gave forth his f a it h in regard to preference to unionists in as strong a speech as could be produced on a floor of a Parliament, and had the proofs of the report presented to him the next day, and went over them with a pen to see that they were correctly registered, in the imperishable records of the country, his opinion on this great question. In 1904, as a member of this House, he advocated preference to unionists; and in 1912 he went back to his old district, and told the people there that others had jumped round, but that he had not, his beliefs being the same as they had always beeu. sage into the Speech of the Governor General which shows that he would, if he could, annihilate the unions of Australia, so far as this vital principle is concerned; and again now he is engaged in this unworthy attempt, although it is attempted iu an indirect and stealthy way. The Prime Minister, in the speech over Australia. They say, "" We must band from which I have quoted, recogourselves together in bigger battalions, nised the need for preference to so that we may be able to face the opposunionists, and stated what is known ing armies of workers."" Realizing that to be a fact by all connected w it h unionism is a menace to their profits, industrial organizations, that the alterthey naturally do what they can to disnative to preference to unionists is prefercourage it by giving employment to those ence to non-unionists, the encouragement who are not unionists'. They are even of those who w ill not join organizations, whom he has characterized as the "" skulkers of society."" The employers are in business for the purpose of making money, and the unionists, by banding together, lessen profits. By concerted action, they compel employers to pay more than they would ""pay to individual workers, bargaining each for himself. The employers know that they cannot deal w i th an organized body of 1,000 or 5,000 men as they could w it h an individual who did not belong to a union. When the individual who is not in a union asks an employer for work, the employer says, "" How much do you want?"" One man replies "" £ 2 a. week,"" another "" 35s.,"" and a t h i r d , perhaps, "" 30s.""; and the employer takes the cheapest. These figures w ill serve to illustrate the practice. Y o u can read in the newspapers every day advertisements asking applicants for positions to state the wages required. When men are disorganized, out of work, hungry, with the cupboard at home bare, they w ill cut each other's throats to get work. I do not blame the employers altogether; they are not in business for benevolent reasons. They are not in business to give the highest wages they can. Their object is to obtain a competency for themselves; and, consequently, when of two applicants one offers his services for 10s. a week less than the other, he is taken on if he can do the work required to he done. But employees who are members of unions cannot be dealt w i th individually. These combinations of workers say, "" We need so much a week to pay our rent and to keep our wives and families,"" and they But a year later he put a pasfix a minimum wage, and will not accept anything less for their services. Naturally, the employers as a body seek to discourage the organization of workmen who are banded together to secure the advantages of collective bargaining. For this reason, employers give preference to non-unionists, that being the only alternative to preference to unionists. The employers are now organizing all creating organizations to do this. There is in Victoria a Liberal Workers Club, or Independent Workers Federation.. The honourable member for Ballarat produced a letter from the secretary of that organization, written to the Tramway Company of Ballarat, in which it was stated that he had workmen prepared to accept lowerrates than were being demanded by the union workmen. This organization bas been proved to be a union-smashing organization, subsidized by the employers; and the other day fhe Prime Minister, having a few words to address to the country, attended one of its meetings, and to give his blessing on its uniondissolution on the rejection of a measure smashing business. The desire of the employers to oppose unionism has crystallized into this union-smashing movement. There are, of course, employers who say, '.' The most competent men are unionists, and we shall avoid trouble by applying, to union secretaries for the workers weneed."" They find that they get on most comfortably in that way. But, generally, there is a movement among employers to oppose collective, bargaining,, and to get back to the old days of so called freedom, of contract, under which system the employer had the individual worker at his mercy. It appears to be the intention of the Government to assist this movement. That is indicated by the Bill.. As my time has nearly expired, I shall have to avail myself of further opportunities to deal with a number of matters on which. I wished to speak. It is not the intention of the Ministry to advance any real, public interest by introducing the proposed Bill. The measure is not one to sanction the construction of any public work. It has no constructive use. member not to discuss the Bill, the motion being for leave to bring in a Bill. Mr J. H . CATTS -Although the Bill has not been brought in, we know its purpose. We knpw that it is sought to be introduced to serve the party needs of honourable members opposite. They wish to bring about another election, and intend then to misrepresent the aims and hopes of their opponents, with a view to getting back to Parliament in larger numbers than at present. The proposed Bill is to be brought forward to provide the so-called Liberal party with a policy of misrepresentation and abuse. rise to enter my emphatic protest against the method and manner in which the Government is trying to put before the House what Ministers allege to be a measure of some practical use. It is intended to introduce two such measures, but that which forms the subject of the motion under discussion is regarded as the more important. It is, however, merely an imitation of a measure, a mere myth. It has no substance, and its object is merely to delude the people, and to obtain a double dissolution. I could understand the demand for a double that was a reality and not a sham. What is the purpose of the proposed Bill? The abolition of preference to unionists. Preference to whom ? To those who already enjoy it ? No. To those in the Public Service? No. To the casual employees of the Government? No. To whom, then? To no one. The Minister of Home Affairs in the Labour Administration gave preference to unionists, believing that that was in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Every contractor who desires to get the best results from the labour which he pays, employs unionists. As a toiler, and as an employer, I know from experience that the unionist is the better worker. Every employer who wishes to get work done with profit to himself, and with peace and contentment, engages unionists. The unionist presents a certificate guaranteeing that he understands the work he is about to be engaged upon. Twenty contractors out of twenty-one, nay, ninety-nine out of one hundred decent contractors or employers of labour, will tell you that in the interests of peaceful working, and for the sake of the best results both for the employer and the employee, they would not hesitate for a moment about giving preference to men who had proved themselves, by their membership of a union to be capable of carrying out work satisfactorily. Here we find a. Government supposed to be possessed of more brains than the average Administration, and capable not only of directing the destiny of the country, but also of restoring what they call responsible government, and clean and pure administration in the affairs of the Commonwealth:-me n who claim that all the virtues which attach to a political pai'ty",53,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill

375,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [9.41],"Ior political principle lie within the grasp of their ambition or within the power of their consummation, and yet out of that mighty intellect, what have they produced ? They have produced a pure myth, something that has not substance or anything else in it, and they ask us to agree to measures which mean nothing, apply to nothing, and effect nothing, so that they may bring about a conflict between the two Houses, and subsequently ask for a double dissolution. I have no hesitation in saying that a Government who seek a double dissolution on those two measures are not only treating the public as if they were absolutely children in their which it was thought it would be when the comprehension of the affairs of their nation, hut are treating members on this side as if they had no recognition of their responsibility or of the obligation cast upon them as representatives of the people. An Honorable MEMBER -""Why abuse the measures at such length if they can effect nothipg ? in Parliament as a public representative and allow the Government to make a farce of Parliament honourable member to withdraw that remark. word farce, because evidently it is unparliamentary to use that term, but I say that a Government who are prepared to delude Parliament and the people hy such confidence tricks as are embodied in these measures deserve no other fate than to be hurled from the Treasury bench, and even from the Parliament of the country, as being men who do not realize their responsibilities to the people. We are asked as a party, sent here -by our constituents, the people of Australia, to assist the Government to deceive the people. T have been in the Labour movement from its inception, and so far as my knowledge goes, we have never tried to put before the people that which the people could not clearly understand. This measure that the Government seek to introduce to-night is capable of endless misrepresentation when placed before the ordinary public, who are not seized with the machinations of a Government of this kind. It is characteristic of the men who are fathering this measure to bring forward something which has no reality in it in order that they may not be tied down to anything definite at the elections, and in order that they may secure a double dissolution. For what? This House was elected only a few months ago. The people of Australia spoke, and with such effect that they returned to this House a majority on the Liberal side> a majority that sits in the chair to-night; hut in another place they sent such a majority as has converted the Senate into a citadel of Labour, instead of the harbour for worked-out politicians and derelicts, Constitution was. framed. The people of Australia, voting on the same franchise, manhood and womanhood suffrage, returned to Parliament an overwhelming majority of Labour senators. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -With less votes. The Government are in office with less votes of the people behind them than the v Opposition have. They have a freak majority of one, in spite of the fact that they have a minority of the people behind them. The honourable member for New England is continually interjecting. Why does he not rise in his place, and address himself to this question] The electors of New England want to know what he thinks about thismyth. They have had their attention drawn 'to his precocioUsness in this Chamber, and they are expecting something more from him. This honourable member, who is supposed to be a student of law, supposed to have passed an examination in the mysteries of the law, and to know something about constitutional questions, sits in his place, and does nothing but yap, yap, yap, like a little pup barking at a mastiff. And this is the sort of man who constitutes the party which is to bring about purity in politics, and a restoration of responsible government. This measure which we have before us was introduced last session, and, by unfortunate circumstances, over which we on this side had no control, it was bludgeoned through this House. The Government got their Bill through this Chamber, not by legitimate debate and discussion, not by allowing members to fulfil the functions they are supposed to fulfil, namely, of expressing their views on legislation proposed here, but by the same tactics as a man who takes a watch",56,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill

The Government pursued those he will shake you up. Government .want him to be stirred up again. The last time he rose his speech cost them dear. It is quite fair to judge this measure by the source from which it has come. There are some men from whom one can always accept things knowing that they are offered in a wise and generous spirit; but when a measure of this kind is put forward by a gentleman of the calibre of the Attorney-General, we have every right to scrutinize it , to doubt it , and to suspect it . If it emanated from When the another man who had nob his unsavoury political reputation we should not be so suspicious of it ; but we know from his past history that the Attorney-General is capable of tryin g to take away, not only preference bo unionists, but every other vibal principle that has been fought for during the last twenty or t h i r t y years by the workers of this and other countries. as he has tried before. It is reasonable to judge the motives of the measure by its sponsor, and its sponsor by his record. I ask the honourable He stopped all the increases to the Public He servants while he was a Minisberi n Victoria, and if he would do that, how do we know that if he gets this mythical measure through he will not use the platform I am to tell the rural workers, the women's leagues, and all those infamous' organizers who go round the country propagating his doctrines, that it abolishes preference not merely to 2,000 men in tlie Public Service of the whole Commonwealth, but to the whole of the industrial army, of Australia?

If so, it has taken a long time to hatch, but he has brought it forth at last, and expects to breathe into it some kind of life if we on this side of the House are suicidal enough to allow him to do so. It was the Attorney-General who told us that this was a harmless little measure to deal only with employees within the Public Service of the Oommonwealth. He knows that *they have already been dealt with by regulation-that the Government, by regulation, have already cancelled the preference granted by their predecessors in office. That being so, the Bill is a sheer mockery, possessing no substance whatever. There is nothing in it, and the Speaker should rule it out of order. It can serve no' object. It is of no use to any one save political manoeuvrers, and those who have not the courage to put their real views before the people. It is of use only to those men who, if they dared, would abolish not only preference to unionists in the Commonwealth service, but preference to unionists throughout the whole industrial would do that if he dared. When he was in the Victorian Parliament he induced the Governor to grant him a dissolution because of a blank created in a Bill-it If he has done it , was just as big a blank as this Bill isand on it he carried the House to the country.

The Attorney-General swept away factory The leopard cannot change his legislation in Victoria. It is to such men In days gone by he that we are to entrust the destinies of this country. When they had power in this State they swept away factory legislation. That meant that many workers in factories were deprived of those safeguards to life and limb, and of the conditions of employment, and everything else they had won by tlieir exertions and self-sacrifice. The Attorney-General The honorrobbed them of those rights when he was in power in the State Parliament, and today he is trying to rob the people of this I have no doubt he had. Percountry of the right to enjoy the result of the last election. He is trying to break down the power of another place, where the Labour party is entrenched, and where, if we have any sense, we shall remain entrenched until the Senate is sent to the country in a legitimate manner in the days to come. Mr P. P.

Men were advised to join unions so that they might speak through their officers to the Court, as against the employers, and thus bring about a peaceful and equitable solution of the questions at issue. Y e t the Ministry are endeavouring by this th in end of the wedge to undermine that unionism, which is the basis of our Conciliation and A r b i tration Acts. Without unionism arbitration would be impossible; for, unless there be combination, there can be no systematic and intelligent representation of the cases to the Court. Years ago the workers were advised to take political action, because the community was tired of strikes; and that advice was taken with such good effect that there have been evolved the arbitration laws of the Although our arbitration laws have not done all that was expected of them, they have greatly minimized the troubles that arose from the adoption of the old barbarous system of the strike. torney-General desires now to undermine the principle which makes arbitration possible. By proposing to prohibit preference to unionists, he is endeavouring to undermine unionism. If a man finds that -he can secure employment as readily if he is a non-unionist as if he is a unionist, he will not take out a union ticket, or, if he is a member of a union, he may "" scab "" upon his union as some do under an incentive of this kind. The honourable gentleman would bring us back to the barbarous conditions which in the past devastated the homes of our people, The honourable gentleman also broke the hearts of our women, and starved our children. We have to look below the surface in dealing with meaI think sures of this kind. We cannot take them at. their face value.. The man who was prepared in the Victorian Parliament to prohibit the organization of the public servants is to-day pursuing bhe same course by saying that if a man belongs to a union, no matter how good a tradesI f ib means, anybbing, it man he may be, he shall be given no preference over a man who has not got a employment by union ticket.

TheB ill would not be such a mockery as it really is if it applied to any section of tlie community. The Attorney-General knows that it w ill not apply to any one, but he seeks to steal a march upon the people. He hopes bo be able to induce the electors to rescind the votes they gave on the 31st May last, and by which they returned to the Senate eleven Labour senators as against seven of the other side. The honourable gentleman would undo the work which we have been doing f b r nearly twenty years to safeguard the liberties, rights, and freedom of the workers of this country. Years ago we took the advice of those who were opposed to the Labour party. They told us to organize, and asked us not to resort' to strikes, but to political action, to redress the wrongs of the people. From that time we have worked consistently forward with our legislation. There is not one part of State and the Commonwealth. the legislation which the Labour party has been successful in placing on the statute-book that bhe presenb Government have bhe courage to touch.

410,Mr Webster,"We shall see wheService. when I was a boy sixteen and a half years of age, and took part in the first strike that I ever had experience of. I know the obstacles that the workers had to face in the Old Country in those days. They were not united, because the people had not free education, and the masses were unable to comprehend their power as they do in these later days. helplessness of the men who at that time fought against oppression. used the only weapon which they could use in order to demand their right, their children had to go without food, the mothers were unable to give sustenance to their offspring, and the fathers were not only unable to provide food for their families, but suffered great privations themselves. other side have steadily opposed the arbitration laws which the Labour party have desired to enact. New South Wales Parliament where such laws were first introduced. us later in this Parliament, and I remember the bitterness with which they carried on the fight. To-day, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, the party opposite have been returned with a majority of one in this House. Hitherto the Conservatives have not had even a decent minority in this House, though they have sometimes been in office as the result of combinations and fusion. I ask honourable members what the Government, with a bare majority, are prepared to do? They are prepared to restore the evil conditions that prevailed years ago. They are prepared not only to prohibit preference to unionists in the Public Service, but, if they dared, to take away preference from every unionist in this country. must bear in mind when we are considering this make-believe measure; this preposterous imposition, submitted, I will not say by an .imposter. gentleman believes it is right to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service, then, in the name of all that is holy, why is it not right to abolish had he not got on the backs of the workers the principle anywhere? Is he going to apply one law to the Public Service, and another law to men who are outside that Service? Is this the type of government that we are to get from this reformer, whose history is blackened practically with his efforts in the days gone by? Is Mr Webster. I can look back to the time he game, I ask, to do the right thing to carry out his principles to their logical issue? Instead of him bringing in a make-believe of this kind, let him go out and advocate the abolition of preference to unionists throughout the industries of this country. No, he is not built on those lines. He is hiding the dagger till a more opportune time. I remember the arises. Why is he not prepared to carry out a principle to its logical issue? He When they knows that if he would throw down the gauntlet as he should do, and say, "" I want to abolish preference to unionists altogether,"" it would be of no use to him to cry out for a double dissolution, for every union man would be not only a voter but an anxious and bitter worker I know that the men on the against him. Therefore, he is trying to deceive these men by this pretentious measure. He thinks that he will delude them They fought us in the because he does not affect them personally. He thinks that they will not realize They fought that their turn will come next. They will be up and doing .to fight for the liberties they have already won by the sacrifice of labour, money, and in cases, life. The honourable member hides himself in a coward's castle. He shelters himself behind a. make-believe measure, when he ought to come forward if he is a man at all. He was never known to have any courage except when he got full power. It would not be a Bill to abolish preference to unionists in the Public Service that he would submit if a double dissolution occurred, and by a great miracle the Liberal party were returned to power in both Houses. Then we would see what his game was. Then we would be able to form our opinions and realize that this man has not only been a deceiver in That is what we the past, but also a destroyer. When I think of the manner in which the Prime Minister can, with brazen effrontery, face a question of this kind, I am reminded If this of an old trade unionist whose reputation was built up whilst he was fighting for the principle of preference to unionists. He would never have heen in public life and made them believe that he was going to retain their rights and privileges. He. would never have seen public life at all had he not taken that course in the early nineties, as we know he did. When I think of the Prime Minister in the days gone by he is. to be spelt another way. spelt Jeremiah judging by this speech. the electors.of Henty have an opportunity of reviewing the marvellous services rendered by the honourable member they will be likely to ask him what his name is and what he calls himself. my lamentations. the honourable member to lament over a matter of this kind. He has been a noted strike-breaker in his time. He has gone out to break down the worker,. and to break up his union. the question before the House? do with the honourable member's observation. It well becomes a man who is supporting a Bill to take away preference -to unionists when we realize that he is hound to support even more dastardly measures -the honourable member for Indi need not grin, because he is not game to get up to speak. The people of Indi wonder what he is doing here. in order, sir, in casting a reflection upon honourable members on this side by saying that they are supporting dastardly measures, that they can only vote for the Bills because they are forced to do so? honourable member is not in order in making these reflections, but they are to some extent provoked by the interjections from the opposite side. I have to request forbearance from all sides of the Housei n order that the rules may be observed. only anxious, but really interested, sir, in leave to introduce the measure. complying with the mandate of the Chair, still I am only human, and cannot at all times allow a man to put interjections into my speech without me putting the acid on them, so that people may see both sides. The honourable member has indeed something to talk about when he talks about preference to unionists. The company, the unionists employed by which were broken by his efforts, has never returned a dividend since then. never been able to return a dividend since then, because it has not been worked by men who understood their business. However,let that pass. dangerous subject. introduced last session was designed to take away from members of the Public Service the right of preference, irrespective of whether or not they were members of political or labour unions. I was wondering whether the Bill which the Government now wish to bring forward will apply to Packer's Independent Workers Union. able member's time has expired. I have no desire to appear to "" stonewall "" this motion. Indeed, I am anxious that the proposals of the Government should be tabled so that we may know exactly where we stand. If honourable members opposite will follow me, I will tell them what they agreed to last year. It was then stated in the Governor General's Speech, at the opening of ParliamentIt is proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of -whose funds are directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes. The Bill which the Government submitted in redemption of that promise was one of two clauses. The first clause was the title of the measure, and the second declared that no ' preference or discrimination should be made against any person honourable member not to discuss the details of the Bill. The motion is one for was introduced last session in no sense proposed to prohibit the granting of preference to unionists.

431,Mr Speaker,Order! I ask the,63,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill
432,Mr Finlayson,"The Bill whichlines, because ib is being submitted for a specific purpose. My aubhority for thab statement is contained in paragraph 3 of the Governor General's Speech at the opening of this session. That paragraph readsDuring the first session of this Parliament, my Ministers, for reasons whioh they advise me were beyond their control, were unable to pass legislation on many subjects outlined in their policy statement presented to you on 12th August last. Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favouritism in Government employment, and the restoration of the electoral provisions for voting by post. Then paragraph 4 readsThese measures failed to pass, and it is intended to make a further effort to pass tbem in the short session now commencing. There caii be no doubt, therefore, that the B ill which the Government propose to in troduce is identical with the B ill of last session. I say unhesitatingly that that measure should not be allowed to see the light of day again in this Parliament. It means nothing, because-as has been pointed out over and over again-it cannot effect what it proposes to effect for the simple reason that its aim has already been accomplished. To introduce a B ill to accomplish something which has already been accomplished is asking us to degrade our intelligence, and for that reason alone ib ought not to be submitted. honourable member stumbles over problem number five, because he will be completely befogged by the time. I reach objection number fifteen. Had the Government in troduced a B ill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act by abolishing the right of the Court to grant preference to unionists, honourable members upon this side of the Chamber could not but have accepted their challenge, because a measure of that description would have meant everything. We are prepared to stand or fal l by the principle of preference to unionists. If the B ill proposed to do anything in the direction I have suggested, we should not object to its introduction. think that bhe B ill of lasb session is not quite the hollow sham which some honourable members appear to think it is. able member must not designate the B ill a hollow sham. that it is not quite what ib prebends to be. The Government are undoubtedly, striking at the principle of preference tounionists. TheB ill presenbed last session, was evidently meant to challenge the Labour party on the question of preference to unionists. But it did not do it . If the B ill which the Government now seek bo introduce means nothing, or if it . means everything, it stands condemned,, and ought not to be presented. MrJ . H . CATTS I showed to-night, that the Government are granting preference to unionists on the transcontinental' railway. the honourable member for reminding me that the Government have decided togrant preference of a most decided character' to the members of a certain union -no t only preference in regard to employment, but also in regard to the conditions of-labour. No non-unionist is guaranteed by the Government the preferencewhich they are extending to the unionist. orable member referring? honourable member for Cook, in the presence of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, read a statement which showed that the Government had entered into an agreement with the Australian Workers Unioni n regard to certain railway conI am sorry if the struction in South Australia. Under that agreement, employment is not only guaranteed to the members of that union, but wages and hours are guaranteed to them as a preference. The PrimeM in isber w ill find bhe facbs recorded in the speech delivered by the honourable member for Cook. The Assisbant Minister of Home Affairs was asked to deny the truth of the honourable member's statement, and he could not do so. When this Parliament was summoned last year, we were told bhat cerbain acbion was to be taken in regard to preference, to unionists. That action was not taken. AB ill that d i d not come up to the protestations of the Government was introduced, and failed I am somewhat inclined to bo pass. What hope has the PrimeM in ister of getting his Bill passed on thi» occasion ? He knows that the measure will not pass. Therefore, I ask honourable members and the public to take notice of a Government deliberately asking for leave to introduce a B ill which they know",63,Government Preference Prohibiti On Bill

439,Mr Finlayson,"To-night , the very well will not pass. Yet they talk about wasting time and delaying public business, about the parliamentary machine beng defunct, and about there being a dead-lock in legislation. If bringing down a measure which Ministers know will not pass is not an effectual way of delaying public business, what other way could be adopted ? Leave to introduce this B ill should not be granted, because the measure will not accomplish what it suggests. promise the Ministry made last year when they first met Parliament, and it will not affect the question of preference to unionists, as they then sought to deal with it . If Ministers would at this late hour undertake to bring in a B ill , as they promised to do last year, to take away from the Arbitration Court the power to grant' preference to unionists, honourable members on this side would immediately grant the necessary permission to introduce it , so that the matter might be fought out. A t this stage, little need be said in regard to the general question of preference to unionists. present themselves of going exhaustively into a discussion of the whole question. If the G-overnment, and particularly the Prime Minister, are in a decent humour, we may have opportunity to discuss the merits of the matter on the second-reading stage. However, I wish to call attention to one or two things. When the preference to unionists administrative order was issued by the Fisher Government, there was a meeting held in the Melbourne TownH a l l . by the Free Workers Association, and the Lord Mayor presided. According to the newspaper report, the hall was well filled. This was the motion that was proposed by That this meeting of Commonwealth citizens enters its strong and emphatic protest against the action of the Federal Government in declaring its intention to adopt the rigid policy of giving _"" absolute preference. to unionists "" in connection with the engaging of all temporary and casual employees required by the Commonwealth service; and, further, as Australian citizens, we strongly protest against the partisan use of public money, and uphold on the principle of justice and fair play, the right to work for all workers, whether unionist or non-unionist, in either private or public employ. The remarkable thing in regard to most of those gentlemen who talk so glibly about the right of non-unionists to work, and the right of unionists to let them do so, who talk so freely about the freedom of all, is the commendable way in which they talk about unionism. According to the newspaper report of this meeting, Mr Varley saidHe had not one word to say against unionism. No one had a stronger admiration than he had for genuine unionism. It had saved the Empire sixty years ago from revolution. Mr Varley proceeded to eulogize the services the early unionists had rendered to the workers, and the fight for the women and children in cotton factories and mines. It does |not carry out the There had' been expressions used recently which would be a disgrace to brigands or Turkish soldiers. Whether the Stead interview were true or not, that Government stood for the weakening of the ties which bound us to the Mother> land. HaveI leave to continue m y remarks tomorrow ? end of this argument. You are not tired of the "" s to n e w a l l"" yet, are you? a "" stone-wall."" Other opportunities w ill solid b it of concrete. how sweetly these gentlemen refer to unionism, and express their appreciation of it . History, proves that it was because of the action of the ancestors of the Tory party in politics that unionism became necessary. It was that action that compelled our ancestors to form trade unions; that compelled the action It was organized of industrial associations; that brought about the improvement in the position of the workers throughout the world. It is the continued action of the same Tory party that has driven the workers int o political unionism. years have you been in a trade union ? in a trade union. to form a trade union? ter is easily explained.
