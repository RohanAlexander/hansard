That remark sounded somewhat irreverent, but I did. not mean it in that way. I thought it was unfortunate that we, who considered ourselves white outside, although we were not always, perhaps, white inside, should look down upon coloured men. The question of labour, white or coloured, does not come into the matter to-day. Queensland have accepted the White Australia policy, and have no desire to go back to the old order of coloured labour. I believe there is less talk about coloured labour in Queensland than in any other State, .and no man there would think of suggesting that it should again be employed; but all those in the industry expect some finality with regard to legislation.

I hope he and his colleagues will see their way clear to appoint a Commission, to inquire into the position of affairs generally. been settled on by small farmers, who are The Excise and bounty should be equalized, so as to encourage the further employment of white people, particularly in the tropical portions of Queensland. The Queensland Government have already advanced large sums of money for the erection of central sugar mills'. There are many more districts that require mills, and the industry will not be a complete success until those are erected; but the Queensland Government will not advance any more money for the purpose under the present condition of things. In the Brisbane newspapers of Saturday last it is distinctly stated that the question whether the Queensland Government will grant money for the establishment of additional central sugar mills depends on the passing of the Bill. Honourable members will therefore see the importance of passing the measure with as little delay as possible, because we are told that the idea of advancing more money cannot be entertained until that is done. I ask honourable members to keep The sugar planters of in view the importance of the industry, not only to the northern portion of New South Wales and to Queensland, but to the Commonwealth at large; and I hope there will be no difficulty in putting the measure through both Houses. -It is fitting, perhaps, that I should say a word or two as one who was the Minister responsible in the last Government for the administration of the Act. I desire that I hope the Government the subject should be approached with a wide outlook. I am not disposed to regard it simply as a question of the sugar industry of Queensland, but rather as an important factor in the consideration of the much greater problem of the settlement and development of tropical Australia. From that stand-point we must be prepared to grant this industry most generous consideration. The industry has already been established; some millions of money are invested in it, and about 40,000 persons are already engaged in it. This in itself is an earnest of the stability of the industry. The old plantation conditions have passed away, under which it was customary for a proprietor to own vast plantations, and, with a mill of his own, be prepared to work it for his own individual interests quite irrespective of the interests of those immediately employed by or associated with' him.

37,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [3.39].,"Queensland. we must have the most generous and mindful regard, not only to the interests of those who have capital invested, but also to the interests of other persons connected with the industry. It is with some degree of disappointment that I find that the Ministers who succeeded us cannot see their way to continue the policy initiated by the late Government. This question is full of difficulties and complexities; it has to be considered, not only from the stand-point of those immediately interested, whether capitalists or employees, but also from the stand-point of the consumers. After having given a considerable amount of attention to the subject, I felt, when Minister, that I was not competent, and that this Parliament was not competent, to fully and effectively deal with it without further insatisfy the people of Australia, who have formation, having regard to the special complexities of the position., Under the circumstances, the late Government determined on the appointment of a Royal Commission, consisting of a Judge of a Supreme Court as chairman, with two experts, men of great experience, associated with him. We laid down three basic principles, the first of which was that the policy of a White Australia should be regarded as completely accepted by the Commonwealth, and tliat it was generally considered that it should not be assailed or weakened in any shape or form. We recognised that the community, at the instance of former Liberal Governments, had shown clearly their objection to the presence here of a servile race; and that the result, by a process of Excise and bounty, had been the substitution of white for black labour. I am satisfied that that policy has been completely established; and I am further satisfied as to its future success, having regard to the likelihood of developments in modern machinery and the further introduction of scientific methods in the industry. The second basic principle was that the industry sliould provide employment at a fair and reasonable living wage; and the third, that due .regard should be paid to the interests of the consumer. Having laid down those three basic principles, we delegated to the Royal Commission the duty of considering the industry in all its bearings, and, after investigation, making recommendations to Parliament, with the object of its permanent establishment on a more satisfactory basis. That policy, I submit, is the true policy to be purUnder the circumstances, sued, in the interests of the industry. While I intend giving full support to the Bill, I venture to say to the Minister of Customs that the measure is simply evading the whole question. It should be a more comprehensive measure, based on the result of inquiry. I am supporting the Bill because, with others, I desire to give the fullest assurance to the people of Queensland that we are determined that the industry shall be permanently established, and that we recognise it as a great factor in the prosperity of Australia. I desire the fullest encouragement to be given to those in the industry, and that effect should be given to the intention of Parliament to treat the industry with the most generous consideration. But this Bill will not satisfy the industry itself, nor will it a right to see it placed on a better and more scientific basis. Therefore, I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs is prepared to give the House an assurance that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the appointment of a RoyaJ Commission. Nothing short of that will satisfy Parliament. After looking into the question, the Minister will, I think, be one of the first to admit that we cannot permit the industry to remain on its present basis -that more is required to be known concerning it, witli the object of dealing with' it more effectively. It was my duty, with the right honourable member for Swan, to visit Northern Queensland, and make close investigation on the spot; and I came away, as he did, fully impressed with' the idea that there was a strong feeling that' the interests of the industry would be fully served by proper protection at the ports, coupled with the establishment of Wages Boards in connection with the industry., The system of bounty and Excise has, no doubt, proved useful, resulting, as I have said, in the substitution of white for working of the coloured labour. member visit Northern Queensland? years ago, I think. Since then the matter has on several occasions been mentioned by those interested in the industry-no t by any particular class of people, but by growers and others. Speaking broadly, we found no large exception taken to effective protection at the ports. I do not regard £ 6 a ton as an excessively high protective rate. It was stated, some little time ago, by a gentleman identified with the industryI",19,Sugar Bounty Bill No 2 Second Reading
38,Mr Tudor,When did the honourable,20,Sugar Bounty Bill No 2 Second Reading
39,Sir Robert Best,"About three£ 5 a ton would be enough if the Kanaka were abolished; while, on the other hand, it has been said that, allowing coloured service, the protection could be reduced to £i. maintain the White Australia policy, it is -useless to consider the conditions under which sugar might be produced with black labour. . As I am of opinion that ,£5 may not be sumcient, I shall support a duty of £ 6 a ton. The object of the protective policy is to make Australia self-contained, and the encouragement of the sugar industry will greatly help to settle and develop tropical Australia. The local consumption of sugar is something like 210,000 tons a year; and the supply is not yet equal to the demand, though I think that it soon will be. Having regard to the competition of the sugar produced in Java, Fiji, Mauritius, and other places where cheap coloured labour is used, we may have difficulty in establishing an export trade; but the supply of the home market must mean a big business. I hope that the Minister will not be satisfied with ever produced before, the production this the passing of this measure, which is an earnest of the Parliament's generous goodwill towards the industry, but will give us was only 98,795 tons. I hope that the and the country the assurance that the policy of the last Government will be continued. I cordially support the proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia for the creation of a Royal Commission to investigate tlie whole matter. -We are indebted to Queensland representatives, and especially to the honourable members for Capricornia, Herbert, and Brisbane, for the valuable information which they have given to us, enabling us to deal witli this important question. In my opinion, it would be a mistake to reduce the duty on sugar. We should build up an industry strong enough, not only to supply our own wants, but also to export. At the present time, we are sending sugar to South Africa; but that may be done merely as one of the means of the Sugar Combine to keep up local prices. I think, too, that we are justified in retaining the Excise We must have reThe monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Revenue, and this is one of the means by which we can get it. If we returned £ 4 to the grower, it is doubtful whether the money would really .reach him; probably, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would reap the whole benefit. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will give earnest consideration to the question of wages. I understand that now about 22s. 6d. a week and rations is the average remuneration. tribunals to which labourers can appeal, However, if we are determined to the fixing of wages not being left to the Minister. hear that, because the rates now paid are altogether too low, considering the conditions under which labour has to be performed in northern Queensland. At least Ss. a day should be paid for all harvesting, whether in the cane-field, the wheat-field, or in any other industry. I congratulate some of die honourable members opposite on their conversion to the White Australia policy. On one occasion, the honourable member for Oxley said that if coloured labour were abolished, green grass would be seen growing in the streets of Brisbane. WereI in order, I should like to contrast the predictions of some of those who opposed the White Australia legislation with the actual conditions of the present day. We now produce more sugar than we have year being over 200,000 tons, while in 1902, when there was coloured labour, it time will come when I shall be able to congratulate the present opponents of the land tax on a similar conversion. White Australia legislation. the honourable member has done much for Australia; no one who has heard of the Coolgardie water supply would deny that. In my opinion, the honourable member for Franklin is wrong in thinking that the fruit-growers of Tasmania would get more were the price of sugar reduced. The honourable member for Moreton has shown that 2 tons of jam worth £ 5 4 can be made with a ton of fruit costing £ \ , and a ton of sugar costing £ 2 2 , leaving a margin of £2% to cover the cost of manufacture.

Would he buy out the Colonial Sugar Refining Company? opinion that the company should be bought out. I would place State refineries alongside its refineries. No doubt we could buy the company's business at a much reduced figure if we threatened to erect State refineries. Assuredly the only way to deal with combines and trusts is to enter into competition with them, and when we secure the increased power that we hope shortly to obtain, I trust that we shall be able to deal with this important question of sugar production in Queensland. I understand that in the southern States of Victoria and Tasmania a great impetus has been given to the growth of beet for the manufacture of sugar. If the Bill is successful in that respect alone the Government will have done a good work for Australia. As local production increases prices must be decreased, and if we can keep this commodity beyond the control of one company the position will be all the better for the people of the Commonwealth. I am deeply indebted to the honourable members to whom I have referred for the information they have given, and which will enable me to cast a straight-out vote in support of this Bill. [3.57] -The more I hear this question debated the more I am convinced tliat the House needs an independent, expert investigation to place further information before it. at the present time this is primarily a political question. Only in a secondary sense is it a commercial and industrial one, and I feel that in dealing with many big Australian subjects the political element is allowed to predominate to a far greater extent than is desirable in the interests of the general taxpayers. The honourable member for Oxley asked the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon to definitely inform him whether the Government proposed to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of the sugar industry, and the reply he received was that they were going first of all lo secure this legislation. What does that answer mean? If we are to legislate so as to make permanent the concessions that have already been granted, would it not be better from every point of view to have a Commission appointed prior to such a determination being arrived at? Honourable members would then know on what ground the concessions were to be made. In the interests of the sugarI f it would not sell at a fair price, growers, and particularly of those people whose capital is invested in the industry, it would be infinitely better for Parliament to insist upon an investigation being made before any legislation dealing with the question takes place. The Australian Sugar Journal, in which the well-being of the industry, I assume, is dealt with from an impartial point of view, holds that, before any legislation is passed, a thorough and independent investigation should be made. It advocates such an inquiry in the interests of the permanent well-being of the industry. A previous Government did the right thing when it determined that an independent Commission, presided over by a Justice of a Supreme Court, and comprising a representative of the growers and a representative of the general public, should be appointed. An impartial consideration of the whole questiona review of the history of sugar production in Australia without any political bias-woul d thus have been placed before honourable members. In that way not only would honourable members have had an opportunity to deal equitably with the industry:, but the people of Australia whose general interests are particularly affected would have been' satisfied. As it is, they are by no means satisfied to-day. The honourable member for Denison sought to raise the question of coloured labour as against a White Australia. That question, however, cannot be appropriately raised to-day. In the deterI am also satisfied that mination of this legislation it is not at issue, and it is idle to raise an issue that' does not apply in any sense of the tern*. It is, however, of supreme importance that the people of Australia should know how far the encouragement given to sugar growing in Australia has been justified. I do not think lhat any honourable member desires to injure the industry. On the contrary, I am satisfied that honourable members on all sides of the House wish to see sugar growing in Australia made, if possible, an unqualified success. We desire, however, to satisfy the people of",21,Sugar Bounty Bill No 2 Second Reading

50,Mr Rtchard Foster (Wakefield),"Australia that what has been done up to date has been amply justified, and that the prospects are sufficiently bright to encourage a continuance of the policy laid down by a previous Parliament. The most ardent advocate of the extension of the bounty system must admit that the growing of sugar in Australia so far has not been an unqualified success, although the decline has. not been so great as to discourage a desire on the part of this Parliament to tackle the question fairly and squarely, and to place the future of sugar growing in Queensland and other semi-tropical parts of Australia on a sound, solid and permanent basis. growers, above all things, desire to know whether they are to be subjected to a policy of uncertainty. IfI thought that the Government of the day were determined, after securing this legislation, to refrain from any further investigation of the subject, I should resist this Bill to the utmost of my ability. I wish to warn them that they have to satisfy, not only honourable members, but the people of Australia, and that the latter are by no means satisfied to-day. The Australian Sugar Journal is issued in the interests of the industry in Queensland, and I take it that in advocating as strenuously as possible an impartial and thorough investigation, it knows what it is doing. It is to be assumed that those whom it represents are satisfied that a thorough investigation instead of imperilling the industry would tend really to benefit it. I should therefore like to have from the Government a more definite assurance than has been given that when this Bill is passed, they will make the investigation which was promised by a previous Administration. I wish to have a promise that with the passing of this Bill the matter is not to be dropped altogether. Failing such an assurance, I must inferenfially believe that the Government are going to deceive Parliament into passing this measure, and, having secured all that they hope to accomplish, are not going to take any further risk by providing for such an investigation as ought to take place. During this debate, statements have been made that the local production of sugar is decreasing rather than increasing. Doubtless the decrease may be explained. Last year there was a very considerable falling of f , but it is confidently anticipated the people of Australia require, and have that a better crop this year will bring the production back to high water mark. The decrease may be accounted for by a comMr Richard Foster. parative failure in some districts of the sugar crop. Sugar-cane, like all other crops in Australia, is subject to variations, and the fluctuations here are probably greater than they are in other countries. The right honourable member for Swan made a comparison of the results of black as against white labour, when he read to the House a quotation showing that white men had been producing 4J tons as against a production of 7 tons by coloured men. I have no information to guide me in accepting or rejecting that statement, but the right honourable member, who has held office as Treasurer, made the statement in The Queensland sugarQueensland some time ago, and, so far as I know, it has not been contradicted.. I should like to know whether it is correct. honourable member advocate a return to black labour conditions? I should not advocate the permanence of a policy which means that Australia has to give 30s. in order to receive 20s. I recognise that many of these new industries are surrounded with difficulties, most of which I hope will be of only a temporary character, and I am prepared as readily as is any honourable member to vote money to assist an industry where an immediate return is not secured, but rather an immediate loss, if ultimately its successful establishment is to be brought about. In other circumstances, I should not do so. If there is to be a permanent concession, and a permanent loss on the lines hitherto made manifest, it would be better for us not to introduce coloured labour, but to let our sugar be grown by some other country which can cultivate it more effectively than we can, and apply the energies of our own people, now devoted to an industry which is not productive in the truest sense, to some other occupation that would be productive and better serve the interests of the Commonwealth. dustry at present pay more in Excise than it receives in bounty? doubtedly j but the points I raise are points on which I want information, and on which a right to get, information.

I have had a seat in this House. When big questions of this kind are under consideration, any information in the hands of the Government, or that may be secured by the Government for the benefit of honourable members, ought to be readily placed at their disposal. dark. legislating in the dark, and upon principles which do not commend themselves to those who know how business of this nature should be undertaken. This kind of legislation cannot continue, and this kind of policy does not commend itself to the people of Australia, who have a right to know, through this House, as we have a right to know first hand, what has been done on all the points mentioned. The Acting Treasurer has raised the question whether the people are paying the Excise. It is freely stated in the House that they are not, and that the Excise, so far as it operates, together with the bounty, does not involve the people of the Commonwealth in any extra taxation. That is perfectly true directly, but is by no means true broadly, and I decline to accept the statement as a general principle. Directly and immediately there is not an extra burden of taxation put upon the people of the Commonwealth to pay the tax, but I do say that it would never do, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to continue the principle indefinitely, because the people are penalized continuously in the excessive price they have to pay for sugar. I know that the price of sugar in the Commonwealth is determined, not by local conditions, but by the world's markets; but, while that is so, I do say that in our internal system, by which sugar is manufactured, refined, and distributed, and its production encouraged by the Excise -and bounty, it ought to be possible to distribute it among the people at a lower price the developments of recent times, and, in than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are able to extract from them to-day. I do not blame the company. They are a commercial concern, and not an institution run on benevolent lines. The company, with their shareholders behind them, naturally expect the largest price for their commo1 dity that the competition of the world's markets will allow them to get. They get that, and nothing more. As one who, in business for the last twenty or thirty years, has known a great deal about the distribution of this commodity, 1 admit that, while the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in the discharge of their business are as honourable and high-minded as any other company, and in some respects lean to the side of generosity, they get as much as the world's markets will allow them to get, and there are 'very few other companies in the world, and none in Australia, making such enormous profits as they are. The company have so grown in affluence, and have such far-reaching interests, that it is impossible to locate where their enormous annual profits are actually made, or ascertain how far they are made out of handling the immediate products of Queensland and New South Wales, and how far from the interests of that big concern outside the six States of the Commonwealth. I am, however, convinced that such a good thing is made by the company in immediately handling the products of the Commonwealth that, if some pressure were brought to bear in the form of a healthy and proper competitive rivalry, it ought to bring down the price of sugar distributed within the limits ot the Commonwealth, apart from the world's markets altogether, by at least £ 2 a ton. member suggest that the Government should do that? ing to that point. wealth refinery? orable member for Denison has suggested the nationalization of the sugar industry. I do not believe, and believe less every day I live, in nationalizing any industry. Where private enterprise with healthy individual competition can be brought into play in the development of Australian industries, I say, "" Keep the Government out of it every time."" There are times when the Government have to come in, but fact, right up to date, ought to be as a red flag warning the people of Australia against undertaking too much nationalization of big industries.

The question of the sugar supply of the Commonwealth is altogether too big to be in the hands of one company, whether that company be absolutely independent of restrictions or not. to see an independent, expert, non-political Commission appointed to obtain information and make recommendations as to the conduct of the industry in the future in the interests of the sugar growers themselves and the great body of consumers. tion the sugar growers of Queensland and other parts of Australia can be assisted to thoroughly establish their industry, and to deal with the product without being at the mercy of one big combine or company, we ought to know it, and I for one would cheerfully assist to pass a very substantial vote, if we had proper authoritative information and advice on the point. question of jams and preserves, the manufacture of which requires such enormous quantities of sugar, is also affected. It has been stated by two or three honourable members that if sugar were produced at a lower rate it would not benefit the jam factories, because they would not accept a less price for the jams that are distributed throughout the Commonwealth. It is merely an assertion, of which no .proof is offered. I am prepared, from my knowledge of the business, to believe otherwise. From every point of view it is more likely that the jam manufactories of Australia would secure a larger distribution, to the almost entire exclusion of jams or preserves from outside countries. I believe the jam-making industry of the Commonwealth is sufficiently well established and in a sufficiently good condition, generally speaking, to hold its own against all comers. I do not so much desire distribution in Australia to be increased as I desire to see a big export trade. I believe that, practically, we have the monopoly of the distribution in Australia, excepting"" as regards a few of the finer and more expensive sorts. use our. sugar! manians, I am afraid, are a very slow people, but I think they are improving, and are likely to still further improve.

I hope the position will be urged on the Government incessantly and unweariedly until they promise the House and the people to have an investigation entirely free from political influence.

120,Mr Bamfokd,"There is nothing to>gesting that this might be a solution of the difficulty; but I would sooner see a Commission consisting of reliable and independent experts appointed to thoroughly investigate the whole question. The debate has clearly shown that the House is in full sympathy with the industry. No honourable member has suggested that he would like to hack and slash at it, and in order that we may do the right thing I think it highly desirable that experts should be appointed to give us full and necessary information for our guidance. who have listened to Ihis debate must have come to the conclusion that the late Administration were proceeding on right lines in proposing to appoint a Royal Commission free from political influence, and with a Justice of a Supreme Court as its president, to inquire fully into the industry. great importance to the Commonwealth for various reasons, the most important of all being that if encouraged it must tend more than any other to people the tropical portions of Australia. It is most important for the adequate defence of Australia that this Parliament should do its utmost to settle people with success in the tropical regions of the continent, and the sugar industry, of all which we have considered, seems most likely to help us in that direction. early days of the Federation I was as sympathetic as I am now towards the industry. I shall do nothing likely to bring disaster upon it, or to lead to a state of affairs in tropical Australia different from that which I have just urged as being highly desirable. is' designed to continue the condi: tions laid down in the Act of 1905. The provisions of that measure would have -expired in 1913, and I take it that the object of the Minister is to continue them. 'We have had experience of the industry under Commonwealth legislation for eight -or nine years now, and there must be a vast ambunt of information floating about somewhere which the Minister ought to have had ready to place before this House before he asked us to endorse the legislation that he has laid on the table. I have found the greatest difficulty in getting definite infora big decrease, notwithstanding our legismation, ancl for that reason, when a member of the previous Government, I strongly endorsed the action of my colleagues in appointing a Royal Commission. The present Government would be very wise if they took the same course. It must be evident that very mixed ideas are prevalent amongst honourable members with regard to the position of the industry. The Minister submitted figures relating to production, employment, and so forth, but they have been seriously questioned, particularly by the honourable meinber for Franklin, who has gone specially into the matter on account of the large jam making industry of Tasmania. The honourable member for North Sydney also questioned them, and I freely confess that I do not know where I stand with regard to the contentions of those honourable members and the figures laid on the table of the House by the Minister. The Minister certainly gave us no information at all to induce us to support the legislation which he has introduced, l t was a pity that he did not take a little more trouble to place before the House information which would guide honourable I recognise that the industry is of members to a correct conclusion on the subject. We are told that the legislation already passed by this Parliament has failed in three important particulars-first , to produce sufficient sugar for the requirements of Australia; secondly,, to produce sugar at a cost which will not inflict an injustice upon manufacturers and consumers generally; and, thirdly,-to people the tropical portions, of Queensland to the extent reasonably anticipated by those who passed it. We must' always bear in mind that it is not only the That being . so, in the growers of sugar for whom we are concerned. That may be the special interest of honourable members representing the districts in which sugar is grown, but those of us in whose constituencies the industry is not established ought to be specially careful of the interests of those who use The Bill now before us the sugar as the raw product of their manufactories, and also of the great consuming public, who we are told are such large consumers of sugar as compared with the rest of the world. I have herefigureswith regard to the effect of our legislation on cul-' tivation. I shall not quote the experience of New South Wales, because a large proportion of the sugar lands in that State have been turned into dairy farms, as that industry has been found much more profitable. In Queensland, in 1906, there were 134,134 acres, and in 1909 only 125,023 acres, under sugar cultivation.

123,Mr Higgs,"Does not the honorabledeal to do with it. Other reasons advanced are the exhaustion of the soil and adverse climatic conditions, such as frosts, in recent years. Thefiguressubmitted to the House with regard to employment have been declared by honourable members who have gone into the matter to be absurdly wrong,. but the Minister has given us no explanation. The policy of the Government may be well described as a policy of drift. From the statements of honourable members, and the information which we are able to collect, it is my belief that the working people of Australia are to-day being unduly taxed to support the sugar industry, and the only thing that could possibly reduce the price of sugar to those who use it would be the reduction of the import duty. We were told by the honourable member for North Sydney that the extra price paid by the consumers may be estimated at £1,269,288, being £ 6 per ton on 211,548 tons. The same honourable member quoted the latest figures to show that, after dedusting ^355> 48, the amount that reaches the I 1'reasury, the amount which the people have to pay in excess of the world's price, is £914,000, calculating again at the rate of £ 6 per ton on the sugar used. Whether thosefiguresare correct or not I am sure I do not know, but they do not at all correspond with information supplied to me by a gentleman who has taken a lifelong interest in the matter. His figures shpw that we are not paying anything like that amount, and the difference between the two statements is another strong reason for a full and independent inquiry into the whole industry. The statement supplied to me is as followsAND BRITISH AND BEET SUCARS LANDED I N £ s. d. C.S.R. Co.'s 1A sugar ... Less5 per cent, discount Tate's granulated, net export (London) value ...

Australian sugar. That quotation illustrates the wide difference between the various statements that we have to guide us. Everything points to the necessity, before we agree to the extension of this legislation, which has already failed in three specified directions, for the appointment of an independent Royal Commission. I hope the Ministry will consent to that course, so that, instead of honourable members voting in the dark, with no reliable information before them, the fullest investigation may be made, and we may know exactly what we are doing.

125,Mr John Thomson (Cowper),"northern parts of the Continent was so suitable for it that the industry would help to solve the question of populating our tropical and sub-tropical regions. One of our troubles in developing those parts of Australia is to discover industries which can be carried on successfully under the difficult conditions obtaining . there, and bring the lands, which are there in abundance, under cultivation to the same extent as lands in other parts of Australia are used, for growing wheat. At the time of Federation, nothing had been done further than to try to establish the industry by protective duties; and, though the efforts had largely succeeded, it has fallen to the lot of the Commonwealth Government to encourage its development under white labour conditions. To this end, Acts were passed levying an Excise, and at the same time giving a bounty on sugar grown by white labour. With a Customs duty of £ 6 per ton, there was an Excise of £ 4 ; while a bounty was given on white-grown sugar of £ 3 per ton. This arrangement may be confusing to the average person who does not closely study the question; but the Bill on which we are now engaged has for its object the amending of the Sugar Bounty Act of 1905. Section6 of that Act providesThe rates of bounty payable under' this Act shall be as follows :(a) In the case of sugar-cane-si x shillings per ton calculated on cane giving ten per centum of sugar, to be increased cr decreased proportionately according to any variation from this standard; and \ i ) in the case of beet-sixt y shillings per ton on the actual sugar-givin g contents of the beet. Provided that the rates payable on all such cane or beet delivered during the years 1911 and 1912 shall be respectively two-thirds and one-third of the aforesaid rates. The amending Bill seeks to strike out that section,, in so far as it is restricted to the years 1911-12, thus providing that the Excise and bounty shall continue at the same rates as hitherto. As I have mentioned, the object is to increase the quantity of sugar grown by white labour; and the figures available show that the results of the Acts already passed have been exceedingly satisfactory. There is opposition in some quarters to these measures, on the ground that they tend to increase the price -of sugar, not only to the ordinary user, but to those who require it as a raw product, particularly jam manufacturers. During the year 1909-10., the Excise collected^ [i55] amounted to £548,923 on 137,231 tons of sugar. This Excise, as honourable members are aware, is collected from tbe growers, every one of whom contributes. amount is paid on the sugar manufactured, and the amount I have stated has been contributed by the growers. In the same year, growers of white sugar received as bounty £407,779, and the expense of collection was £5,648. These figures show that the bounty received by the growers of sugar did not reach the amount they contributed in Excise by £135,291 ; and this is a matter really closely associated with the growers, and not so much with the consumers. During the year, the Government made a profit, as I have said, of £135,291. ment which happened to be in power. the honourable member is now referring to the distribution of revenue between the States and the Commonwealth; but that is a matter which can hardly be debated now; and, at any rate, the arrangement referred to by the honourable member does not prevail now. During 1909-10, the sugar imported-and this, perhaps, more * concerns the consumer-wa s 78,957 tons, and the duty collected, at £ 6 per ton, was £473,745The honourable member for Swan can, if he choose, say that this was paid by the consumers within the Commonwealth; but, as a Protectionist, he, I should rather expect, will say the opposite. The Customs revenue and balance of Excise show that the total revenue received was something over ,£600,000; so that if we desire to see what the cost to the consumer is we have to take the difference between the two, namely, £338,454. The figures I have quoted show, I think, that, while the Excise and bounty have resulted in white-grown sugar, they have, at any rate, been self-supporting. Several statements have been made as to the effect these measures have had on the industry, and figures have been quoted witii a view to showing that the production of sugar has not increased. The fairer point of view would be that of the acres under cultivation; and I find that, while in 1901-2 there were 132,840 acres, there were, last year, 143,115 acres. In the latter year there was produced 1,294,570 tons of cane, or an average of",31,Australia

The Minister, by reason of of should be able to offer a more comprehensive and lucid statement than c m be made by any private member; and it is puzzling that he should hesitate about doing so. What has any one to fear from an investigation ? Ever since the establishment of this Parliament there has been a strong desire for the development of every Australian industry, and particularly of all branches of agriculture, with a view to increasing the settlement of the country as speedily and profitably as possible. our eyes open, we have been making large sacrifices for the sugar industry, in the hope of settling a white population in the northern parts of the continent; and there is no diminution of sentiment regarding the need for this. Representatives of the most important"" and prolific sugar districts in Australia are among those who press for inquiry ; they have no apprehension that investigation can be injurious to their constituents. Others who contend that in the south there is a possibility of producing beet sugar also court inquiry. One searches in vain for the grounds of the apparent reluctance to sanction the fair, open, and searching investigation which all parties demand. Furthermore, the sugar industry has been associated with our White Australia policy. The non-occupation of great stretches of territory in the north creates a danger which increases every month and almost every week, and among the means for lessening it the employment of white labour in tropical agriculture is most important. The sugar industry is of vast importance, having regard to the value of its production, but that is as nothing compared with the opportunities which it offers for proving the possibilities of employing white labour in the tropics without danger to health. pioneer object-lesson."" medical science advances, the more certain it becomes that most ailments from which white races suffer in the tropics are due to the reckless neglect of the necessary processes of adaptation, and not to inherent disabilities. tropics depends on diet, proper clothing, housing [ i 5 5 ] -2 most, though only of late years properly appreciated. information now to his hand, whisky now and again. popular though it has been, has proved one of the most dangerous. Temperance has won no greater victory than in the torrid zone. Despite the prophecies made when, ten years ago, we gallantly undertook to grow sugar by white labour, we have been more than justified by a success which should encourage us to go further and faster, and to seek by means of other tropical industries the further development With of northern Australia. Many problems connected with sugar production need investigation. The grower, besides dealing with the difficulties of culture, is not certain that his cane realizes the prices which should be paid for it. Many other parties connected with the industry press for an inquiry. A wider investigation is also desired by other districts in which sugar is never likely to be produced, either from cane or from beet. The whole Commonwealth has the larger interest in our subtropical area to which I have referred, and the inquiry should be made as searching as possible. The key by which the door which seemed to close so great a portion of the continent against men and women of our race can be opened is to be found in tropical industries. which is desired be obtained from departmental officers? have to be taken, and it will be necessary to know whether they agree in their reading of the present conditions. taken by a Commission. to be backed up by the necessary data, attested, and sifted in the ordinary .way, shall have done it once and for all. think that a Commission would settle the matter ? many difficult questions relating to the sugar industry about which tlie most conHealthy existence in the flicting statements obtain.

The Government desired that this legislation should be got out of the way before any announcement was made with respect to the projected inquiry. I do not think that the Ministry are averse to an inquiry, but we certainly thought that this legislation should, first of all, be disposed of ; otherwise if an inquiry were proposed, it might be held that this measure should remain in abeyance until the investigation had taken place. is one of the reasons for the reticence of Ministers, it is very curious.

It has been held by some that we should not enforce the Excise against the white grower.

The intention was to allow the £ 3 per ton bounty and the £ 4 per ton Excise to continue. proposal. think it is a Conservative proposal in the direction that some gentlemen would desire. These Bills were introduced simply to allow the existing legislation to remain in operasame challenge to him to debate the question, with some limitations relating to wages tion, as he took up the same ground and conditions of employment. I trust the honourable member will not press the amendment, or, if he does, that it will be defeated. The right honourable member for Swan asked, Why not reduce the Excise and reduce the bounty, too? duce the Excise, and make them equal ? orable member for Moreton would agree to that proposal. I prefer to see the existing legislation remain, without the sliding scale. abolish the sliding scale, but to keep the Excise and bounty. provision that is made in the Tariff, without any date being fixed for their termination. sugar grower has been deluded by the Sugar Journal and by certain honourable members, of whom the honourable member for Moreton is one, into the belief that he is paying Excise to the extent of £ 4 per ton on sugar, or a relative price on the cane, getting only £ 3 per ton back in the shape of bounty, and, therefore, being mulcted to the extent of £ 1 per ton. I have always taken up the opposite contention, although I represent a sugar-growing district with the largest output in Australia. That view contains an economic fallacy. sumer is the person who pays the Excise, as he pays every tax. The secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, who represents a large body of the larger planters, from whom this movement has really emanated, took up the view put forward by the honourable member for that wanted the extra £ 1 ! Moreton, and was at one time to have been my opponent at the last election. Knowing that the main feature of his policy was to be the contention that the farmer was being robbed to the extent of at least £ 1 per ton on his sugar, when I went north last May twelve months to get ready for the election, and, as it were,"" to get a blow in first, I challenged him, the biggest man I could find in the industry, to debate the matter with me on the public platform. He declined to do it. Another sugar grower was selected to contest the electorate a few months ago, in the belief that he, being a practical sugar grower, had a better chance than one who was only a theoretical grower. I issued the as the honourable member for Moreton. I said, "" If you refuse, then, if there are any smaller fry who choose to come along and tackle the subject, I am perfectly willing to meet them."" But they never had the courage of their Why not reconvictions; and it is an absurd contention that any producer pays the Excise. Has any one heard of the tobacco-grower complaining that he pays the Excise? Some time ago an argument was advanced, but dropped, to the effect that, because the The object of the Bill was to whole of the sugar was grown in Queensland and New South Wales, these two States contributed the whole of the Excise, and, consequently, that the whole of the revenue from this source should be returned to them. The Treasurer of Queensland, at that time, was Mr Robert Philp, a business man of considerable experience, followed by Mr Kidston, while in New South Wales there were Sir John See, Sir Joseph Carruthers, and Mr Waddell; and vetnot one of those ever put forward such a claim. It might naturally be supposed lhat, as I represent many sugar-growers, and as I obtained a majority in five sugar growing centres, an equal vote in a sixth, and was beaten by only a small majority in a seventh, I should be in favour of the contention now. put forward by the honourable member for Moreton. But I never heard any grower ask for such a concesThe consion.

If the amendment goes to a division I shall certainly vote against it. Siiting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. [8.0] I followed very closely the statement of the honourable member for Herbert, and I quite agree with him that it is an economic fallacy to suppose that the sugar growers provide their own bounty. I do not intend to traverse the question, to whicli millers. I referred during the second-reading debate ; but the discussion simply emphasizes the necessity, urged again and again, for a thorough review of the whole position. Nothing supports that view more strongly than the statement made by the honourable member for Herbert as to how the alterations in these measures were brought about. I do not wish to do the honourable member an injustice, but if I understood him correctly, he said that, when a previous alteranot satisfied, however, that the sugar fartion was made, it could hardly be held to be the result of any very general request from the sugar-growers themselves. At all events, in the most populous, and certainly the biggest producing district, there was no request; and that confirms my opinion that the question is very much more political than otherwise. political in the sense that, in certain districts, there are votes and interests to be conciliated; and that is bad for the people, though it may be good for'individuals; at any rate, it is not as it should be. dictment of the honourable member's leader ! think that any honourable member on this side depends on sugar-growers for his return, though the Prime Minister might possibly be said to be 011 thin ice. the Prime Minister's district are a comparatively small consideration.

I hope, however, that this question will be put above party consideration, and that we shall arrive at a solution, in the interests of die growers and in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. I am sorry that I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Moreton; and I cannot help thinking that he himself fancies he is conducting a forlorn hope, such, indeed, as I hope it may prove to be. sorry I cannot support the amendment. I dare say it is not the right Way to raise revenue by taxing consumers in the way we are doing; but I am satisfied that if we pay £4. instead of £ 3 , the extra £ 1 will find its way into the pockets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Prior to Federation, the sugar farmers were getting a certain price for their cane, in some cases 7s. 6d. per ton; and when die bounty and Excise legislation was passed the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers endeavoured to get a portion of the bounty, succeeding so well that the Government found it necessary to provide that only to the farmers direct should the money be paid, and only by them could a receipt be given.

I do not think that the request of the honourable member for Moreton arises out of any general demand by the growers; as a matter of fact, the Bundaberg sugar farmers refused to join in the demand for the extra £ 1 . Until we have some method of compelling the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers in to pay the farmers a fair price for the cane I must object to the Commonwealth increasing the bounty.

The term is very vague. that it is possible to ascertain the sugar contents of the cane, and from that to arrive at what is a fair price. It is, no doubt, somewhat dimcult to ascertain what is a fair price. paid for on its saccharine density? Mr 'HIGGS -The farmers claim that it should be paid for in accordance with its sugar contents, and Parliament should be able to determine what is a fair price for this, as well as for other commodities. Of course, the yield varies a good deal, crops sometimes being abundant, and at other times being very poor because of droughts or frosts. But, as we can declare that a sovereign shall be always worth 20s., we should be able to say what is a fair price for a ton of cane, or a ton of sugar. Even the value of a sovereign varies. Sometimes one can purchase eight bushels of corn for a sovereign, and at other times only four. I am sorry that I cannot support the amendment; but, as the honourable member for Denison says, we should not kill the goose that lays tbe golden eggs; and there may be a danger of doing that, although the Committee is almost unanimous in its support of this legislation. I should like to provide that the millers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company must pay a fair price to the farmers for cane, but I do not see how it is to be done. The real remedy seems to be for the State Governments, or the Commonwealth Government, to establish sugar refineries. the present time the cane-grower pays £ 4 a ton in Excise, and gets a rebate of £ 3 , the intention of the honourable member for More ton being to abolish the Excise altogether. While I am sympathetic with the sugar industry, I cannot see my way to support that proposal. The Government, in introducing a Bill to extend the operation of the bounty, which would otherwise expire in a little over two years, are treating the industry generously, and it is not opportune now to go further. If the growers are only just struggling, the effect of giving them another £ 1 in bounty might be to deprive them of any incentive to make the most of their opportunities. If they are only just managing to live now, they might be content to remain as they are if they receive another £ 1 for their cane, whereas it might really be better for them to turn their attention to some other crop. crop that can be grown at present. Government have gone far enough in extending the operation of the bounty. From the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia and others, the cane-grower would seem to be in a very bad position. I am glad to hear that the industry has such good prospects. honourable member for Capricornia, who represents a district in which cane is grown, says that the Bundaberg farmers have refused to join in the demand for an extra £ 1 of bounty which was made by the deputation referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa. The honourable member for Capricornia has also told us that he has been unable to obtain from the farmers a satisfactory reply to' his question: What is a fair price for cane? According to him, we shall have ultimately to fix the price of a number of commodities. In the dairying industry it was at one time the practice to pay for milk received according to quantity; but experience suggested a more scientific basis, ancl we now pay for quality. The honourable member for Hindmarsh suggests that cane might similarly be paid for on its saccharine contents. That seems a better arrangement than the present one. But everything points to the need for the fullest inquiry. The farmers, who in this and every other industry of the kind have all the hard work, should be properly remunerated. Dairymen are now getting what is due to them, and I hope that cane-growers will soon be in the same position. But, in view of the statements which we have heard, and particularly of : that of the honourable member for Maranoa, that the industry is a most profitable one. I cannot vote for the amendment.

That is very objectionable.

If the employer on the big plantation is permitted to charge whatever he likes for the rations, honourable members will see what a very easy method he has at his disposal to further reduce the wages of the employees. The clause in the agreement, which refers to how the employee shall spend his money, is as followsThe employers may discharge the labourer if he be found drunk, or if he brings to or has about his camp any intoxicating liquor or otherwise misbehaves himself or if he does not work in all respects to the satisfaction of the employers or their representatives, or if he williament should abolish the weekly rate of fully disobeys or disregards any orders or instructions of' the employers or their representative, or if he commits any breach of any provision contained in this agreement, in which event he shall forfeit all right or claim to the amounts retained under clause 6 hereof. No one would object nowadays to an employee being penalized because he gets drunk. workers employed on the sugar plantations in Queensland to this day take more drink than is good for them, but this clause seems to go further than it ought to go, and really interferes with the liberty of the subject, who cannot object, because he stands a chance of being discharged, and losing the £ 5 which has been deducted from his wages. agreement up .there between employees and employers ? agreement, of which clause 19 is as followsI f from any cause the employers shall at any time deem it advisable to suspend or .reduce delivery of cane to the said mill the labourer -shall if and when required by the employers cease work, under this agreement, for such period as the employers shall direct, and shall resume work when directed by the employers, and the labourer shall not be entitled to any compensation from the employers from any loss he may suffer in consequence thereof.

He says that the men do not average more than from 12s. to 15s. per week during the off season, and the more rain that falls over the cane area the better for the farmer and planter and the worse for the toiler. It is a sinUnfortunately, some of the gular fact that when rain, which is of such great benefit to the farmer, falls, the labourer has to cease work, and under this agreement gets nothing. If honourable members who boast about our great Empire cast their eyes over a portion of it they would find that a great many people in it are being very badly treated. able member to confine his remarks to the question. help Mr Hall and the members of the union in this Bill to a greater extent than the Minister proposes. Until we get larger powers from the people of Australia by an amendment of the Constitution, the Minister is doing all that is possible by making arrangements by which he may withhold the bounty if the rates of wages and conditions of labour are not deemed to be fair. I hesitate to speak about another matter, because I am not in a position of my own knowledge to say whether it is true.

He is a'reputable citizen, and has done a great deal of unselfish and devoted work in the interests of the cane labourers whom he represents. I do not know how we can prevent the evil by means of this measure, but there is no doubt mat some parents are so blind to their duty as to compel their children at a tender age to undertake, very laborious work. We have only to read the reports of school inspectors throughout Australia to see that on many dairy farms children are employed at a very tender age. know what they are talking about when they say that! case, but many. should go to the dairying districts, and see for himself ! moment suggest that dairy farmers, as a class, are guilty of such conduct. generalize. but, no doubt, there are instances. It is impossible for the Federal Parliament to deal with such a"" matter; but the electors ought to see that the State Parliaments do their duty. Perhaps it is the duty of the school inspectors themselves, if there are such cases, to see that the children are sent to school instead of working in the cane-fields. All these statements show the necessity for an inquiry; and I hope that this legislation will be followed by the oppointment of a Royal Commission. I am satisfied that the Minister is trying to find some satisfactory solution of a diffition, and fixed the rates; and, though there culty which presents itself in administration; at the same time, I think that, in the proposal he has now made, there will not be found a summary means of assessing the rate of wages, but that he is opening the way to much delay if the parties concerned choose to take advantage of it. According to the present administrative practice, and, indeed, the law, it is competent for the Minister to withhold the bounty if he is satisfied that the standard rate of wage has not been paid. That necessarily created some anxiety on the part of the growers in regard to what the standard was to be, and, in order to meet the difficulty, a sort of tariff was formulated by the DepartI do not ment. There was, to begin with, much difficulty in fixing the rate, but, once fixed, it had the ettect of giving a feeling of certainty to the growers, and assuring the labourers of a reasonable rate under the circumstances. In actual administration, this practice has been found very useful, though I admit it was surrounded with difficulty, and was subject to much legal exception. Instead of that practice, which afforded the Minister much discretion, it is proposed that the rate of wages prescribed by any State industrial tribunal shall be accepted, or, if it is not accepted, a most not elaborate machinery shall be resorted to, which may involve the parties in litigation, and ultimately bring them to the High Court. In any case, this elaborate machinery will have the effect of creating an undue amount of uncertainty and delay. In the past, the Minister, no doubt, has been guided by any Wages Board or other industrial authority, but in their absence be fixed the rate himself. That discretion it is proposed to practically take away; do and, in my opinion, that is a mistake. It is most desirable to give every encouragement to the creation of Wages Boards in this industry; but if there does not happen to be a Wages Board, and if the wages are below the standard rates payable in the locality, I suggest that the Minister should have proper legal authority to fix what he thinks is a reasonable rate after full inquiry. practically give the Minister all the power that he now has under section 9 of the Act? therein lies the mistake. My predecessor in office and my successor acted on that secwas no legal power to do so, the practice proved very useful; and I now suggest that the Minister should take legal power to act in the same way, having behind him the lever to withhold the bounty. As a matter of fact, sub-clause b takes us no further than does section 9; and, as I have already suggested, the Minister should now take the necessary legal power to act. Such a provision would prove infinitely more summary and be more certain than the clause now proposed. Sub-clause c provides such an elaborate piece of machinery",44,Foster I T Affords A So That When We Have Done The Work We

276,Sir Robert Best,"It does, and that if it were resorted to it would cause most serious delay, uncertainty, and injury to ""the industry itself. It is essential that the means of ascertaining the rate of wages should be of a summary character j and nothing can be more summary than the discretion of the Minister. Under sub-clause c, however, the Minister has to go to the Arbitration Court, the President of which has power to appoint assessors, one representing the employers and the other representing the employees. It is probable that constitutional objections would be taken to the exercise of the power, and the case would ultimately find its way to the High Court. Eveni f the case did not get so far, tlie President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court would seldom find himself in the northern portions of Queensland. It is true that the power may be delegated lo a Judge of the Supreme Court, but a Judge may visit Cairns or Townsville four times in the year at most; and thus the expense and delay would place it outside the power of the parties to obtain the benefit of the bounty. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, like the King, is supposed to be present always in every part of his dominion. that is the fiction. This elaborate machinery, by reason of the delay and expense involved, may result in the bounty being sacrificed. I speak with experience as an ex-Minister, and I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to consider the advisableness of amending the Act so as to fix the rate of wage by regulation. The growers and others concerned could then work their plantations free from fears and risks that the rates paid might subsequently be held inadequate. The only other point is in reference to the introduction of the doubtful words "" conditions of employment."" I confess I do not know what they mean, but they may prove a source of considerable embarrassment. ber think that we should provide only for rates of wages? will tell us what "" conditions of employment "" mean, I might meet his argument from his point of view. known in our Conciliation and Arbitration Courts in reference to certain holidays, hours of work, and so forth? known within a metropolitan district, but in an industry like that now under consideration, which has its own special conditions, that common meaning may not have application. causes of discontent is the stoppage of pay during wet weather. various employers have different agreements with their men. Does my honourable friend wish to be supplied with copies of all these agreements ? by a local Act. vision is unnecessary. words which the honourable member wishes to insert would have no meaning. If the agreements are governed by the law of Queensland, it would be a mistake to insert here words whose meaning is doubtful. Local Wages Boards would deal, not only with wages, but also with hours and conditions of labour. Instead of striking out section 9, the Minister would do better to amend it, to obtain power to prescribe rates by regulations embodying the current rates as ascertained by him. am glad that the Minister is attempting to see that those employed in cane-growing are paid fair wages, and worked under proper conditions. All honourable members are ready to maintain the Australian record for fairness in this particular, those on this side differing from Ministerialists, not in regard to objects,but iii regard to the methods to be employed to effect those objects. The words "" conditions of employment "" may be hard to define, but with discretion can be applied satisfactorily. Conditions which were fair in one districf might have to be varied in another, and I see nothing in the provision under discussion to prevent a sensible man from using his discretion in this matter. Some trouble may be caused if conditions running counter to the existing contracts are insisted on. A little while ago .the honourable member for Capricornia read some of the clauses of existing agreements between employers and employees, which seem to place the latter in an unfavorable position.

I should like to have it enacted that reasonable rates of wages shall be not less than a certain specified sum. sent rate of 22s. 6d. is altogether too low.

They do not ask for carpeted rooms and fireplaces, but they desire accommodation suitable for If the right persons are chosen the climate, and no doubt the Committee is willing that they should be properly All the amendment provides is that the awards of the local authorities regarding proper accommodation shall be observed by those who claim bounty. The same thing may be said in regard to food. Millers and others have repeatedly claimed that it costs them from gs. to ios. per man per week to feed their employees, but they will not give that sum to the men so that these may "" find "" themselves, although the men say that they could obtain better food for less money. They do not ask for threecourse dinners or high teas, but as they are expected to do good work, they should be well fed. I do not say that they are badly fed, but the food could be greatly improved. There is no complaint regarding the accommodation or the food supplied by the small farmers. Too much cannot be said against the practice of some planters who call on their men to cease work directly rain falls, and pay them only for the few liours that they have actually laboured.

290,Mr Finlayson,"That is all that i<=of employment are not satisfactory the Minister may be able to take action, and I am strongly of opinion that this provision, while being of much advantage to the employees, will not operate disadvantageously to the employers. Many employers in the sugar industry in Queensland are treating their men in a fair and reasonable manner, and all that we ask is that that treatment shall be continued. We do not wish to see one employer disadvantaged because he treats his men well, whilst another is placed at an advantage because he is able to impose conditions which leave employees entirely at his mercy. -Honorabl e members seem to overlook the fact that it is only because the Commonwealth has granted a bounty to growers of sugar-cane by white labour that the Minister has any power to interfere in the quesquestions of this kind. I agree with the tion of wages or conditions of employment. The control of industries is not vested in this Parliament, and there is no reason why we should elaborate a system of control that is really foreign to our powers. The provision in the principal Act with regard to the payment of a standard minimum wage was introduced to remove uncertainty with respect to payment of the bounty. It has been stated several times during this debate that one reason why the industry has not progressed in the way that was anticipated is the uncertainty as to the continuance of the bounty under the Act which we are now amending. If that is so, will not hampering conditions respecting the payment of the bounty be likely to do more injury than good ? The system now in force, and which we propose to continue, has existed for some years. I think that it was in 1905 that the standard minimum wage was fixed, and I have not been told by the Minister that in administering the bounty any difficulty has been experienced in regard to the payment of wages. factory. office as Treasurer I did not hear of any serious complaints. There might have been internal complaints in the Department, but I was not informed of them, and I fail to see why we should anticipate that complaints will be more frequent than they have been. We must not forget the existence of a State Parliament in which the cane-growers and the workers in the industry are represented. One would expect t'S6] them to be complaining to their representatives in that Parliament if they were not being properly treated. appealing to ""members of the local Parliament tbey are appealing to those who are capable of redressing their grievances. We have no power to redress them, except by bringing about a state of uncertainty as to whether the bounty should be paid or not. than to remedy. friend seems to assume that we are the sole authority-that there is no other Legislature-to look after the interests of those concerned in the industry. He seems to forget the existence of the local Parliament, which has full power to deal with honourable member for Kooyong, that an appeal to the High Court in matters of this kind seems a cumberous procedure, but the proposal to 'give local Boards power to settle these matters meets with my approval. They are in a better position than is the Minister to judge of the surrounding circumstances. That being so, I take no exception to these provisions. I think it unwise to administer the industry from Melbourne, which is so far removed from the field of operations, and I am loth to place upon the Minister the obligation of looking after the labour conditions of any enterprise. I do not know why the sugar industry should be treated differently from any other, save for the fact that we' give a bounty to the grower. Apart from that, I do not think it desirable that the Executive should be mixed up with an industry in any part of the Commonwealth. I do not know where we shall end if we have the Commonwealth or even State Executives controlling the wages and conditions of labour all over Australia, and that seems the direc : tion in which some honourable members would lead us. We should leave these matters to the local tribunals, but the proposed reference to the High Court is not quite practical. resort. I prefer it to a system under which this duty is thrust upon the Minister. It throws the responsibility where it ought to be placed, and does not mix up the Executive of the Commonwealth with questions",47,Foster I T Affords A So That When We Have Done The Work We

I do not know that the land devoted to sugar cultivation is so sacred that we should be called upon to remove our shoes before we tread upon it. desire to interfere with it in a way in which a Commonwealth or State industrial au-we do not interfere with any other industry? The local authority that controls all other industries may fairly control this. Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts control industries all over Ausof which we are at present aware, for the tralia, and I fail to see why such tribunals should not control the wages and conditions in the sugar industry in Queensland. WhilstI express no opiniori as to the amendment before us, I certainly prefer the provisions of paragraphs a and -b to the procedure now in force. I was Acting Prime Minister when the standard wages were fixed. We had a good deal of trouble in arriving. at a minimum, but a minimum was fixed so as to remove the -uncertainty that existed as to whether the bounty should be paid or not. Together -with the honourable member for Kooyong, I -visited northern Queensland for the special purpose of obtaining local knowledge, and was surprised that the wages, which seemed to me to be very moderate, having regard to the climate, and the work to be performed, were objected to in some places as being too high. In one case a deputation, which complained that the wages Were too high, was accompanied by the member for the district. I thought they were very moderate, having regard to the work to be done, and the conditions of labour, and upon our return we promulgated them as the minimum rate. I suppose that many pay higher, but none can pay lower, wages and obtain the bounty. The industry has gone on fairly well, but I prefer that the wages should be fixed by local tribunals-by Wages Boards, or, in the case of disputes, by the Arbitration Court-rathe r than that they should be arbitrarily determined from time to time by the Minister. I wish to express my entire sympathy and concurrence with the Bill in continuing the tion of the rate. I want to know which bounty rates instead of gradually tapering authority is to prevail. Would the Ministhem off and abolishing them. same time, I think it is the right and duty trial authority in Victoria to determine the of Parliament, in continuing the bounties rates of wages to be paid in Victoria to to the sugar industry, to insist upon condiearn the bounty? tions for the protection of the workers who engage in the production of the raw material for those who receive the bounty. Objection has been taken to the three alternative methods of determining the rates of wages and labour conditions. I see no objection to conditions a and b. Condition Why should there be such a strong a provides for the rates to be prescribed by thority. The phrase "" Commonwealth authority "" is somewhat vague. It is hard to conceive how a Commonwealth authority can be called into existence under any law detennination of rates of wages in any particular district. A State industrial authority would be more applicable, and would be useful for the purpose. Attention, however, ought to be drawn to the fact that this is a bounty applicable not merely to Queensland, but to all parts of the Commonwealth, including Victoria. Probably honourable members will be glad to be reminded of the fact that the beet sugar industry is being started in Victoria. Under the provisions of the principal Act, the growers of beet in Victoria will be entitled to share in the bounty so long as they comply with the conditions demanded by law. Therefore when the expression, "" State industrial authority "" is referred to, it is to be understood that it is not only a State industrial authority within Queensland, either in existence or in fuiuro, but that it is intended to mean a State industrial authority in any district or locality or Slate, in which the raw material is grown, and the bounty is claimed. Is that understood by the Minister? say what State authority is to be taken. ter might insist upon the award of a State industrial authority in Victoria regulating the rates to be paid in Queensland, or vice versa. that in most cases, as the honourable member for Swan has just said, the wages paid have been too low.

There are quite 50,000 coloured persons in the Commonwealth, and it is difficult to understand why a coloured man should not be as suitable for work in northern Queensland as he is in the gardens in and around the cities of Australia? We were always given to understand that honourable members opposite were a humanitarian party; but I do not see much humanitarianism in a party which seems unwilling to allow a man to earn his living in a country in which he is legally entitled to reside. Queensland are manured with Kanakas' bodies. that that has anything to do with the question. tarianism the honourable member's party goes in for. member has no justification for associating me with those who may be cruel or even unkind to either black people or white people. Why is there this great objection to a coloured man earning a living in the tropics of Queensland, while there seems to be no objection to his earning a living elsewhere in Australia? Probably, if we look deep enough, we shall find there is some political reason, as there generally is. This make-believe "" humanitarianism "" is very often a cloak for political humbug. I can see no teason why this, or any other Government should, for a longer period than is absolutely necessary, continue the present cumbrous method when the sugar industry can be protected equally with other industries by an import duty. I have an objection to this coddling of any industry. It seems to me that those employed in the sugar business are prejudiced so long as there is any uncertainty as to Ihe reward for their labour; and there is uncertainty when it is in the power of a Minister to put difficulties in the way of the payment the emof the bonus. Of course, my remarks have no personal application to the present Minister. is now a proposal to take the power out of the hands of the Minister. that any one in authority should be able to do as he likes in regard to the rewards of industry. This Bill is being passed now by force of numbers; but, if I had the power, I should reject it, and allow the import duty to be the protection of the industry.
