[10.41] I take this opportunity to congratulate the new Ministers on their accession to office. Among them are one or two men whose services to the party to which they have belonged for many years, and to which, I presume, they still belong, notwithstanding the recent expulsions, entitle them to the recognition that they have now received. I am glad that they have at last been given the reward that they have earned. I particularly desire to congratulate the Minister for Home Affairs, who is one of the oldest members associated with the Labour party, and whose services I thought would have been recognised long ere this by the gift of a Ministerial portfolio. I congratulate the Treasurer on having made some attempt during the short time that he has been in office to recast the finances of the country on a basis of greater economy. But his financial statement, as a whole, is by no means satisfactory to me. There is room for a much greater revision of the finances, with a view to lessening the load of taxation, and to decreasing expenditure. Much of the present expenditure is, in my opinion, unnecessary and without justification in this time of war. I think that the sources of revenue are being overburdened' to meet ordinary expenditure at a time when money is urgently needed for the prosecution of the war to a successful issue. A great deal of money, which in normal times might justifiably be spent on railways and other extrapublic services of the country, should now be diverted wholly to war purposes. We. are constructing a large number of costly public works which, in their very nature, are unprofitable. This involves the expenditure of'millions of pounds. No attempt seems to have been made to curtail this expenditure, which is not needed at the present time. It should have been curtailed at the beginning of the war, and if it had been suspended, the community would have avoided enormous unnecessary taxation. ture on the Federal Capital? has been a. lot of wasteful expenditure there. According to a report which wa3 made by the ex-Minister for Home Affairs, the honourable member for Darwin, considerably more than £500,000 has been expended there uselessly, and in a perfectly unjustifiable way. But I do not wish to trespass upon matters which are at present the subject of an investigation, and I shall wait until the report of the Commissioner who is inquiring into the expenditure upon the Federal Capital is tabled. member heen agitating for a long time that the work of the Federal Capital should be pushed on? hut in a legitimate way, so that the permanent expenditure will be justified by results which will serve the purpose for which the Federal Capital is intended. But I do not think that it would be proper for me to go into details with regard to the expenditure on the Federal Capital, for the reason that I have already stated. There is expenditure in other directions-on the transcontinental railways, for instance-whic h certainly should be deferred until a more convenient period, and until we once more get back to normal times. Millions of pounds are being spent on these railways; yet, as every one knows, they will be unproductive, if not for all time, at any rate'for many years, and the burden of providing revenue for the purpose of carrying on these works is very severe on the whole community.

24,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Yes,Tegard to the entertainments tax. The primary purpose of such a tax is to raise revenue, and on that ground its imposition is justifiable; but under the proposal previously submitted there was a danger that the source of the anticipated revenue would be dried up altogether by the tax operating-in addition to the various State taxes already in operation-in the -direction of entirely dislocating that branch of industry and closing up many places of amusement. The result would probably have heen that the actual revenue would fall very far short of what the Treasurer anticipated receiving, from that source. The proposed wealth tax and the income tax are imposts which are very popular with a certain section of the oommunity, and when extra revenue is required for the purpose of carrying on a war special levies of taxation are justified, and no one can take exception to -extra taxation for war purposes; but, at the same time, we should endeavour to see that such taxation is levied equitably. have already the State income tax and Federal income tax, while in New South Wales, in addition to.the ordinary income tax, there is a supertax amounting to a very considerable sum, and the Commonwealth Treasurer proposes another supertax to the Federal income tax to the -extent of an additional 25 per cent. This additional impost will fall very heavily .and unfairly upon those of the community who are already paying income tax. Instead of levying a tax of 1-J per cent, on the wealth of the community, as the previous Treasurer proposeda proposal which the present Treasurer does not at present purpose disturbing, except in regard to the mode -and time of paymentI suggest that we -should tap another source of revenue, and put a tax on the capital unimproved value of land for the special purpose of the Repatriation Fund. I am not speaking in .any way for any other honourable member. These are my own views. Probably what I suggest will'not be too popular among some honourable members sitting on both sides of the House. It is a very unwise thing to put a tax upon capital. A tax of l £ per cent, on capital will mean the curtailment, to some extent, of the sources of revenue. The taxation of the capital from which profits and incomes are derived is an entirely different thing from the taxation of incomes and profits derived from the investment of capital; the one reduces capital, the other only reduces profits on income from capital The taxation of capital to any appreciable degree must eventually defeat its own object by curtailing the source of revenue, thus placing the Estimates of the Treasurer on a wrong basis by depriving him of the benefits which he expects to derive from the tax. The previous Treasurer anticipated that a. tax of 1^ per cent, on wealth, spread over a period of three years, would yield £3,333,000 per annum, or a total of £10,000,000 in three years. mate was excessive. bably it may have been excessive; but I am not dealing with that point. The present Treasurer proposes to retain the tax of 1\ per cent, on wealth, but to We have to remember that we spread it over a period of five years, collecting one-fifth of the total amount each year. ber will see by the footnote, it may be possible to reduce the amount payable in the' earlier years. There is no doubt that there will be a reduction in the earlier years. cording to the Treasurer's figures, it is anticipated that, by spreading the payments over five years £1,835,000 will be derived each year. Instead of levying such a tax in this v^ay, if the Treasurer were to levy a tax of l i per cent, on land values, what would be the result? According to the tabulated war census card returns, the capital value of unimproved freehold estates in Australia amounted at the time the cards were filled in to £421,000,000. As to the cards remaining to be tabulated it was estimated that they represented the value of £25,000,000, bringing the total capital unimproved value of freehold estates in Australia to £446,000,000. A tax of 3d. in the £1, which is l i per cent., on that total capital unimproved value would yield a very considerable amount.",6,Supply Interim Financial Statement Minis Terial Policy

Instead of levying 1 \ per cent, on wealth, if we were to levy 3d. in the £ 1 , or 1 \ per cent., on the total unimproved capital value of freehold lands in Australia it would bring in a revenue of £5,575,000 per annum, whereas, by his tax of 1 \ per cent, on wealth, the Treasurer anticipates receiving £1,835,000 per annum. From a tax of I d . in the £ 1 on capital unimproved land values the Treasurer would get £1,858,000 per annum, or an excess of £23,000 per annum over the revenue expected to be derived by imposing a tax of l i per cent, on wealth, spread over five years. serious consideration of the Treasurer as -an alternative to that which he set out in his financial statement. holders bear the whole burden of repatriation 1 MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -Be cause the scheme of repatriation -should be based upon the values which the whole community creates. By a tax on unimproved land values, imposed for that purpose, the whole .community would be required to bear its proper burden. Unim proved values are not the creation of any individual. They are not the result of industry or the expenditure of capital, but are rather the result of the presence, needs, and activities of the people as a whole, and the expenditure of public funds upon public utilities, such as railways, roads, bridges, and other public undertakings, differentiate between unimproved values and improved values.

Some people speak of land as if it were something in the Instead of being an additional country. They forget that the most valuable lands are city areas, such as those on which this building is erected. Some of my 'honourable friends are afraid that under this scheme the poor farmer would suffer. As a matter of fact, under it the farmer could be relieved of many of his already burdensome taxes. We could, for instance, afford, if such a scheme were in operation, to remove many of the i m posts on agricultural implements that he has to pay. . orable member give him while he was -clearing his land and earning nothing? MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -He is called upon 'to pay various taxes at the present time, regardless of whether he is earning or not. It is only when we propose to tax the primary source of all wealth that we hear this plea for the poor I commend this scheme to the farmer and the poor widow. Under this scheme we should be able to remit burdensome taxation which the farmer already has to pay, whether he likes it or not, and concerning which there is noshould landprotest from either side. There is no consideration for the poor farmer when he has to pay heavy imposts on all the implements an'd machinery that he needs for productive purposes. It is only when we propose to remit those taxes, and to substitute another tax which would fall upon him more lightly, that we hear this outcry. Let us see how this tax would f a l l . There are 669,474 holdings of freehold land in Australia, and of that number 534,000 are .holdings of less than £600 in value. The great bulk of these holdings, therefore, are under £600 in value. A tax of I d . in the £ 1 on estates valued at £600 would amount to only £ 2 10s. per annum.

I submit this proposal to the Treasurer as being far more equitable than his per cent, wealth taxa tax which was really proposed by his predecessor in office. I pass on now to the question of the referendum. I believe that the referendum was a very grave mistake, and I have held that view from the time that it was first announced. I felt from the first that the question of reinforcements for our troops -should not be made the subject of a referendum-that the Government of the -day-whateve r party might be in power--should take upon their own shoulders the f u l l responsibility for the conduct of the war. I regarded the refusal of the present Prime Minister to accept that responsibility, and his action in shifting it on to the hacks of the people, as a lamentable confession of weakness. There was no one in. Australia in so good a position as the Prime Minister to know the real requirements of the war. He had come fresh from the inner councils of the Allies, with all the information necessary to enable him to form an opinion as to what was required. He had information which no other honorahle member possessed, ancl which cerfainlv no member of the general public could have. I thought from the first that it was most unfair to -submit to the decision of the people a quesone moment admitted that the matter was tion concerning which they were not. and -could not. in the very nature of things, be permitted to be acquainted with the full facts. The people were largely asked to vote in the dark upon the question. The pay Prime Minister should have taken the full responsibility for any action ncessary ta maintain the strength of our Australian forces at the front and supplying at the time they were required the necessary On reinforcements. It was also foolish for him to issue, just as the referendum was to be taken, a proclamation calling upon all men between twenty-one' and thirty-five years of age to go into training without any regard whatever for the convenience or the requirements of the industrial, commercial, and business community. These men were called up indiscriminately, and business, trade, and industry were dislocated on every hand. In this way, the Prime Minister raised a formidable wall of antagonism which, from the very jump, threatened to wreck his scheme. The right honourable gentleman himself was primarily responsible for the disastrous result of the appeal to the people. It was due to his bad generalship and the faulty tactics which he displayed. These men ought not to have been called upon until the result of the referendum had been made known. The excuse made for calling them up was that time was the essence of the contract. But we have not one of those men in camp to-day, so that evidently it would have heen sufficient to call them up after the referendum had been taken, especially as most of their actual training would, in any case, have to be done on English soil. As it was, men were called up against their will, and nearly every man so called up could be, relied upon tovote ""No."" I am speaking now, of course, of the unwilling recruits. Another point is that business men who were deprived of the services of employees were also extremely irritated by this dislocation of their industry. I know that employers of labour, in very largenumbers, also voted "" No,"" because they did not wish to be suddenly deprived of the services of men in their employment. As to those who call themselves "" anti-conscriptionists,"" I have never for < one of conscription versus anti-conscription, for we already had conscription under the Defence Act.

39,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Yes;whether the men who could be conscripted under the Defence Act for service within the Oommonwealth, should be sent beyond Commonwealth Territory., That was the sole question involved. I have reason to helieve that a very considerable portion of the funds, which those who opposed the proposals, received for conducting the campaign, came from business men in the city, whose businesses had been interfered with by the precipitate action of tlie Prime Minister in issuing that proclamation at the time. As a reason for taking that action the Prime Minister stated that the voluntary system had absolutely failed; but he now proposes to again have recourse to the same system. of those who were engaged on the "" No"" side in the recent campaign, were not only against the Minister's proposals, but were against recruiting of any kind, voluntary or otherwise. I have reason for saying this, because I had occasion to listen to a number of speeches in opposition to the proposals; and the purpose of those speeches could have been nothing else than to do everything possible to prevent reinforcements being sent to the front by any means whatever. I do not say that that is true of all who were on the "" No"" side, but Ido say that in a great many instances which came under my personal notice I could come to no other conclusion than that the campaign was undertaken by some for the purpose of stopping recruiting of any kind. In my opinion, however, voluntary recruiting did not really have a fair trial. It failed for many reasons, and amongst the contributing causes of failure were, first and foremost, in my opinion, breach of faith on the part of the Government towards returned soldiers in not giving them that preference for employ-* ment in the Government service which Mr Fisher, when Prime Minister, promised on the floor of this House, without any reservation whatever. A great many men went to the front accepting in good faith that statement of the ex-Prime Minister, but when they came back, expecting the promise to be redeemed, they found themselves Hocked at every turn unless they first joined unions. They found that preference to returned soldiers was not offered, but that preference to unionMr W. Elliot Johnson. ists was still to prevail in the Public Service. I myself saw notices posted in the Home Affairs Department referring all applicants for employment to the Trades Hall. I am not speaking of this Ministry only, hut particularly the former Ministry, because they were primarily ressponsible, and tried to shirk their responsibility by a mere quibble. It was urged by the Government that they had issued no instructions that certain questions were to be put to these men; but what they did was to refer the men to a tribunal, before which they knew those questions would be asked, and by which there was no possible chance of being recommended for employment unless the applicants I am afraid that some were, or became, unionists and Labour supporters. The real question was whether an applicant belonged to a union or not; and returned soldiers by the score have complained most bitterly to me of the breach of faith on the part of the Government in dishonouring the ex-Prime Minister's promise for preference shoidd any man desire to enter into casual service with the Commonwealth. When men presented themselves as applicants for employment they were met with an intimation that they must go first to the Trades Hall people, and, when they did so, they had to answer to the satisfaction of the secretary of the unions concerned, whether or not they were members. If they were not members they were advised to become so as* soon as possible, as it was no use applying until they were. Many of the men refused to do anything of the kind; and we have seen letters in the newspapers from such men complaining of their treatment. From that moment recruiting began to fall off. These men got among their friends in the community, and made known the treachery of the Government in dishonouring the promise of preferential employment in the Public Service. Another contributing factor to the failure of the voluntary recruiting system was the indiscriminate employment of returned soldiers as recruiting agents. tact at"" all. most tactless speeches were made in many cases, though some of the men spoke exceedingly well in making good patriotie appeals.

Elliot Johnson,"Th eings myself along with returned soldiers, who had been sent out to assist, and, there has certainly caused a great amount of fore can speak with experience of what took place. Federal and State members of Parliament were asked to lend active assistance in this way, and, in conformity with that request, I and others took our share of the work. As. a matter of fact, in some cases, I had with me returned soldiers whose speeches absolutely nullified the effect of anything that might have been done in the way of recruiting. They depicted all the horrors of war; they gave their own personal experiences, and presented the most gruesome and harrowing side of the picture, contrasting it with the part of the world. Anything in the easy, lazy life led by the young men remaining in Australia, who had a good time going out with their girls to picture shows and other entertainments, and generally enjoying themselves young men to whom we were appealing were, many of them, without any responsibilities, and, having no deep-rooted sense of patriotism, hut an inherent love of ease, born of long experience of exist«nce in Australia, were quite untouched. No appeal was made by these soldier speakers to the patriotism of these young men, or to the necessities of the Empire; it was never urged that they were required to fight for the maintenance of the very conditions they now enjoyed. I made representations to the recruiting committee in Sydney to the effect that some little care should be exercised in selecting heen properly appreciated by the military the returned men sent out to assist in the recruiting, hut I am afraid very little notice was taken of this suggestion. Under the circumstances, it was not surprising to me that there was sometimes not a single recruit obtained at the meetings themselves, whatever the young men may have done afterwards. Another factor which contributed to the failure of the recruiting system was the' reports which appeared in the newspapers, in the form of letters by soldiers to their relatives and friends and members of Parliament, describing the treatment they were receiving from certain officers in command over them. There were stories of -grave injustices, tyranny-of autocratic and overbearing conduct-o n the part of -officers who had been sent out with the original contingents and reinforcements; and such stories are still rife. All this dissatisfaction on the part of a number of As will be remembered, men, and their feelings are expressed in their letters to their friends. It is a great pity, I think, that greater discrimination is not exercised in the choice of men to whom responsible positions are given in the command of men, especially of Australians. We have to remember that Australians are brought up in an atmosphere different from that in which the people of the Old Country live-that they have been reared in an atmosphere of independence and freedom, which, to a large extent, is unknown in any other nature of discipline is, in itself, irksome enough, and when it is accompanied by, arrogance and overbearing and unjust conduct on the part of some of those in authority, a spirit of revolt is apt to maniThose fest itself amongst men who have heen brought up under Australian conditions. I only mention these as some of the contributing causes to the failure of the voluntary recruiting system in the past. However, these are defects which can be 'remedied; and I sincerely hope that the embargo on returned men obtaining employment unless they become union members will be speedily removed by those who have control of the government of the country. I should now like to say a word or two in regard to rifle clubs. Here is an arm of the service-which I do not think has ever authorities; and it is ahout time that some recognition of its value was made. There are in the Commonwealth no fewer than 1,546 rifle clubs, with a membership of 104,000, of which some 20,000 have enlisted for active service at the front. I know that the rifle clubs complain very bitterly of the cavalier treatment they have received at the hands of the Defence Department. The clubs have not heen acknowledged as a useful arm of the military service; yet I am sure that, if they were properly taken in hand and given that recognition which is their due, every rifleman would become a valuable recruiting agent in himself. If the large membership of the clubs were utilized in this way for the purpose of recruiting, it would not only considerably augment the number of recruits from the rifle clubs and fro m the general community, hut would popularize those clubs as an institution, and induce many to join them. When a young man joins a rifle club, and becomes interested in shooting, he speedily becomes interested in military matters. Asi t is, however, many who have joined the clubs have left them in sheer disgust at the utter neglect of the authorities. I sincerely hope that the Gevernment w ill do something in the direction of giving proper recognition to the clubs, and of utilizing iheir services to the fullest ex-, tent in the recruiting movement about to be launched. I have offered these few remarks in regard to the finances for the consideration of the Treasurer, and, in regard to recruiting, for the consideration of the Ministerf o r Defence and the Prime Minister; and I trust that we may see some action taken in the' directions I have indicated. I risefcosupport the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia to reduce the SupplyB ill by £1,000,000, my only objection .to it being its extreme modesty. I am ready to vote for any proposal ta reduce supply to the utmost ; limit , because,, having no confidence in the Government, I am prepared to refuse them supply for even an hour. Th© only reason I have for supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia is that at present it is the lowest amount o n which I have the opportunity to vote. stand the attitude of honourable members who profess to have no confidence in the Government and yet are willing to give them supply to carry on the services of the 'country.

That Board was established for the primary purpose' of securing to the cane-grower a satisfactory price for his product, the complaint being that the grower was doing the heavy work and the taianuf acturer and the refiner were getting the profits. The Board commenced with the miller, discovering first of all the expense of milling sugar, and the price which the miller obtained from the refiner. Having secured to the miller a fair proportion of profit, the Board said that the grower might take the balance. I contend that the wrong method was afdopted. The Board should have started first of all with the grower, guaranteeing to him a fair price for his cane and a reasonable return for his energy, something which would insure that his work on the land would he adequately rewarded. Then the Board should have settled with the miller and the refiner prices that would ultimately give to the consumer sugar at a reasonable figure. No matter what the prices may he to the consumer finally, the first requirement of the fixation pf prices is to ascertain what it costs to produce an article so that the producer may be assured of a fair return ties presented by good and bad seasons? ter for scientific adjustment. You cannot base the cost of the production of sugar or the returns to the grower on an abnormal year of excessive or reduced crops.

You can only strike a reasonable average, and if a man is so incompetent in farming or in anything else as to be unable to come up to the average, that man is in a ""wrong place. He was not meant to be a farmer. The Prime Minister, when making his Ministerial statement on the 14th September last, saidThere must be, as far as humanly possible, equality of sacrifice. Wealth has its duties f it owes all it has to the State, and must be prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice that all to the State. Many wealthy men have responded"" nobly to the call of duty; others have not. But they cannot be allowed thus to evade their responsibilities. All other considerations must be swept aside; one great principle must now govern our every action. Whatever is necessary for. the salvation of the country must be done; and since we are calling upon men to sacrifice their lives, we ought not, and shall not, hesitate to compel men to sacrifice their wealth. With those sentiments I entirely agree. The sacrifice of wealth ought not to depend in any way on the sacrifice of life. What is called conscription of wealth should not be contingent upon conscription of life. We should take whatever wealth is necessary to carry on the war and the government of the country. Those who have should pay, both in times of war and in times of peace. Those who have not are not ahle to pay. decided that compulsion shall not be applied to military service oversea. Last September I said that a referendum should not be taken on the subject, and that the Prime Minister, if he felt that conscription was necessary, should announce it as his policy, and let those follow him who would. ber cheer Mr Fisher when he spoke of giving the last man and the last shilling? ber still believe in doing that? Fisher then, and later, expressed his opposition to conscription. His statement cannot be twisted into a proposal for conscription. As to the wealth tax, I think that the Treasurer should walk delicately. I do not quite understand the phrase "" conscription of wealth."" If it means taking men by the throat and relieving them of their money, as it was proposed to take men hy the neck and push them into the firing line, I am opposed to it. able member agree with the honourable member for Hunter?",13,Supply Interim Financial Statement Minis Terial Policy

The Australian working man does work equal to, if not better than, that done in any other part of the world. There is no one who does not admit the superiority of the Australian worker. We have a right to expect this superiority, because we have always contended that good conditions would give good results. We have proved that that is so by the way in which our soldiers have acted. whom we complain, hut the system which controls them. system of which we ought to get rid is that which makes men work for wages instead of being offered the incentive of the good of the country. Men are compelled to work for the means to live and to get shelter. While that prevails you will not get the best results. Justice is a thing that is sold and has to be bought.

I have no doubt that honourable members who belong to the Liberal party are quite consistent in their attitude. Their objection to industrial unions is that they are political.. The fact that they are political is not their fault; it has been forced on them, because they found that until they gained political control in some form or other they were unable to secure protecr tion in their employment. I have no desire Just now to go into industrial history, but every one knows, that until the men formed themselves into industrial unions they were unable to secure benefits, and that until they were formed into political unions for the purpose of securing political power, they were unable to secure of the benefits that they had obtained by means of their industrial unions. If industrialists have formed themselves into political associations it is because those who held the political power endeavoured by every possible means to prevent them from reaping the rewards secured by their industrial organization.

The idea that honourable members should be given an opportunity of a £15 trip at periodical intervals in order to become more closely acquainted with our sister Dominion, with which we should cultivate continually increasing friendly relations, and with which it is to our interest, as to theirs, to get into the closest possible touch, seems to be something that has alarmed those who are interested in financial economy in this country. I understand that the Prime Minister's trip to Great Britain cost this country about £1,600. Every honourable member in both Houses could have a trip to New Zealand for the sum that was paid to enable the Prime Minister to visit Great Britain.

Men should go to other places and enlarge their minds, and increase their store of knowledge, and when they come back they will be better men and better fitted for taking part in the affairs of the nation. I believe that the time has come when this country could well afford to spend £20,000 per annum in order to send, every year, representative men and women to other countries of the world in order to join with them in considering the problems that are common to all of us. afford to spend £20,000 in that direction, and so cultivate friendly relations, a year in fighting other people.

I am sorry that the Sermon on the Mount has been suspended during the war. If the people of Germany had an opportunity like that afforded the people of Australia, to say whether they were in favour of compulsory military service a majority would vote against it. Things will be different in Germany after the war. The people of Germany, France, and Great Britain also will demand a bigger voice in the government of the country after the war is over. it ends. with those who believe that we ought to do our utmost to bring the war to a successful conclusion. I have no doubt as to our duty in regard to it. It is our duty to make every effort that we possibly can to bring the war to a successful issue. I have no doubt as to the final We could better result, and the sooner we reach it the better. If , as one result of the war, the people of the various countries enthan spend £50,000,000 gaged in it have opportunities of government such as we have in Australia-if they have government by the people on the basis of adult suffrage-it will go a long way to eliminate the possibility of further wars between the peoples.

That is why I have always done what I could, both on the platform and in private, to advocate the putting forth of our utmost possible efforts, both financially and otherwise, to win this war. cause I hold that view I should be willing to force men to go to the front. It is there that we part company in the most decisive fashion. I suggest to the Treasurer that he might well consider how it would be possible, not only to save, but to spend money wisely. After all, economy consists not so much in how little you spend as in how wisely you spend. Extrava*gance does not consist so much in spending enormous sums of money as in the spending of money uselessly and foolishly. Economy is a matter of quality, not of amount.

When the Prime Minister returned to this country the people, as a whole, were looking for conscription, and ready to accept it at his hand, and it was a .responsibility which he, as the head of the Government, ought to have shouldered. done so, he would not have dragged the name and reputation of Australia in the mire, as, unfortunately, he has done.

However, the right honourable gentleman went Home, and, on the strength of a number of speeches made there, he came back to us a statesman, and I suppose he felt that to introduce conscription by means of a proclamation under the War Precautions Act was far too commonplace a course to follow. He had swept through Great Britain and electrified the community with his eloquence. do the same thing in Australia. He would, carry the country by means of such speeches as had worked such astounding results in Great Britain. was a disaster to Australia that the Prime Minister went to Great Britain, and came back with such a halo round his head as the people at Home had given him. I have no desire to speak in a personal way, and I make my remarks without the slightest scrap of malice, but I wish to observe that the Prime Minister, in conducting the T&ferendum, committed almost every mistake it was possible to make, and but for those mistakes I believe that we would have had a chance of a "" Yes"" majority. after the event. to profit by the mistakes of the past, to see how they could have been avoided, and how they can best be repaired. I do not believe in going back into the past. The honourable member for Gippsland is very good at that sort of thing. He very seldom rises in the Chamber without ^having a dig into the pages of Hansard of years and years ago If he had in order to discover some inconsistency on' the part of some unfortunate honourable member.

The first mistake was the calling. up of the men for home service. I do not know for what reason that step was? taken. It brought men into military camps who would never have been called up under a straight-out form of conscription, and in that way the disadvantages the country would suffer under conscription were quite unnecessarily emphasized. Then we had ever so many exemptions, many of them with no justification whatever. In Western Australia there was* He would not much opposition to the conscription proposals, and almost the only taunt I got in the course ""of my campaign was, "" Why do you people exempt members of It Parliament?""

Then, in regard to. the inquisition at the polling booths, I am surprised that, any Democrat who regards the secrecy of the ballot as sacred would have made a suggestion of that kind. member vote on that point last week t vote on that point. I gave my vote on a greater matter, and I am not going to have the greater matter overshadowed by the trifle that was suggested by the honourable member fbr Yarra. So far as the statesmanship of the Prime Minister in Australia is concerned, we have seen none of it, but rather the opposite, and I am bound to say that, to those who know him intimately, it is almost commonplace to suggest that,, while he has any amount of picturesque abilities, he. is not preeminent so far as useful horse-sense is concerned.. I do not know, that any honourable member in this chamber, if he owned a fried fish shop, would give the Prime Minister the. running of it , The right honourable gentleman could make a magnificent speech on the subject of fried fish shops, he could dilate splendidly on the iridescent beauty of his stock-intrade, he could assure us of the succulent qualities of the goods, he could give us brilliant flashes of wit regarding fishiness, flabbiness, and so on, he could wind up with a magnificent peroration proving the absolute necessity to the country of fried fish shops. But if any one were soimpertinent as to ask him how a fried fish shop could be run at a profit, he would have as blank a look as when he is favoured with"" other awkward questions from this corner of the chamber. While the Prime Minister has brilliant qualities, he bas not, in the matter of judgment, anything to recommend him as the controller of the affairs of Australia at the present critical juncture. Holding such an opinion of him-a n opinion which is shared, I believe, by every honourable member who knows him I may be asked why I tolerate this gentleman' as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I give the right honourable gentleman only a qualified support. remember that the members of his present Ministry were not members of the Administration which was guilty 'of all the blunders I baree just enumerated-. I yield to no one inmy admiration of those gentlemen. I yield to no one in my admiration of the magnificent stand those honourable members have taken in the country against the Labour organization, on the question of conscription, which they regarded as vital to the interests of Australia and of the whole Empire. They have made sacrifices of no ordinary character. They have shown a strength of mind that every one must honour, and have, therefore, a perfect right to be in the position that-they, with the Prime -iiunister,. now occupy together, for one reason, and one reason alone,, and that is to make good in regard to the prosecution of the war. The Prime Minister, especially,, is in that position. He chose to appeal to the Governor General when he disbanded his previous Administration, andasked leave to form a second Government. I am as yet entirely in the dark as to why the Governor General gave him a commission to do that. The right honourable gentleman could not assure the Governor General that he had a majority behind him. Be that as it may, I say, in all seriousness, that when the conscription proposals were turned down by the people it was the duty of William Morris Hughes to have resigned, from the Prime Ministership. Failing that, he, should have got into communication with the Leader of the Opposition. tunately for Australia, and unfortunately for the Prime Minister's personal position in this matter, throughout the referendum campaign, and until a dav or two before he met this House, he ignored the Opposition and its Leader as if there were no such party in existence. now. no credit for any gracious attitude that he may now adopt towards us. Having formed a new Ministry entirely from his own immediate following, the Prime Minister and his' party remain on the Treasury bench only to make *good in connection with the war.

259,Mr Fowler,"Sometimes. Wewith a laugh of contempt. Many honourable members regard it as absurd and impossible. I want tb show them the reality of it. Remember for a minute the position of Australia. Here is a country occupied by a handful of white people, who are intruders upon an area which, geographically, belongs naturally to the yellow and black races. There are around our northern shores countless millions of those races who regard with ill-concealed hatred the attitude we have taken up towards them. It is an arrogant attitude, as they regard it and naturally so, to exright to monopolize this great continentclude them from a part of the world belonging hy right to those races, and not to us. must know that Japan has saved us. policy is a standing insult to those coloured races. It is a standing insult to our great ally, Japan. I do not wish to discuss our position in regard to Japan. Too much has been said already about it . I desire to enter my protest, however, against the alarmist suggestions that have emanated from various quarters during the last few months. suggestions are dastardly and uncalled for. I am not in the least afraid of any warlike aggression on Australia by Japan, / which has always been an honourable and / chivalrous nation. Japan has stood loyally by the Allies in this war, and will continue to do so until the bitter end. But there are other dangers besides war, and one danger now threatens Australia by reason of the fact that we have turned down conscription. We all admit that we do not hold Australia by our own strength. Do we hold it entirely by reason of our association with the British Empire-by the strength of the British Navy? No, we do not. Great Britain has been able to maintain our attitude because we had the moral support and sympathy of the white races of the rest of the world. Have we got that support and sympathy to-day ? Look to America. Not very long ago an American newspaper headed, in scorn and contempt, an article in regard to Australia, "" Australia quits."" We all know . that there is a slang word in use in America, a ""quitter""a word of the strongest contempt that can possibly be applied .to a craven, worthless individual. That term is hurled at us from America to-day, and we can look for no sympathy, in this attitude of ours towards the war, from that country. in the war ? do with what I am arguing. As I have already said, we are not in danger of war-, like aggression; but, after the war is over, there are going to be very many adjust1 ments of the world's affairs. Supposing it is suggested, on behalf of those yellow races, that this craven handful of white people in Australia have no longer a what then ? Supposei t is suggested that effective occupation in international law is something that we in Australia ought to be no longer allowed to ignore-that those yellow races have a right to come into Australia, and to take up at least those parts we are not using for ourselves? Supposing the spokesmen of Asia make that suggestion on behalf of those millions of Asiatics, who, as I say, regard our attitude towards them as one continual insult? Supposing the suggestion is made to Great Britain, how will Great Britain be able to regard it ? And that the suggestion will be made is as sure as the sun These will rise to-morrow; and when it is made, and Great Britain is confronted with the situation, what can she do ? The matter will not rest there. Supposing Japan asks Russia what she thinks of this handful of degenerate white people monopolizing this country any longer, what will Russia say -Jtussia, whose millions, it has been suggested, should go to the front in order to save Australians, and because the Russians are cheaper, as if the son of a Russion mother was of less account to her than is the son of a mother in Australia ? These things have been noted in . Russia, make no mistake. And when Russia is asked what about the White Australia policy, can we doubt what Russia's answer will be? If France is asked her opinion about this handful of degenerate white men, who keep out the Japanese and other yellow races, and yet refuse to do their own share in the war, what will France say ? France is going to say, "" We have no time for such people; let them go; let them suffer the fate they deserve."" not say so. will not be asked what he thinks about it ; it is the French people who will have the",29,Foster Th E British Ments Tax I Believe In The Principle Of

After think -to be speech. was a bad speech; the honourable member for Darwin misses the point. The honourable member for Perth has, in my judgment, delivered a speech which contains the gravest criticism of the actions of the Prime Minister throughout the recent campaign. I deplore the fact that so many attempts are made to fasten on honourable members on one side or the other responsibility for the attitude of extremists who opposed the proposition placed before the people. Personally, and for the party to which I belong, I disown any connection with that section of the community to which reference has been made. Further, it is beside the issue, and unfair, to be told that it was the vote of the Industrial Workers of the Worldi n this country that brought about the rejection of the referendum. Are we to believe that the majorities in all the farming electorates of New South Wales and South Australia are associated with that organization? The fact is that the Prime Minister, when he returned to Australia, did not, as he ought to have done, appeal to the people to continue their recruiting efforts, which they had not failed to make before. The figures showed. that for the previous fourteen months the voluntary recruiting has total enlistments had been 114,000; and if fche Prime Minister desired to keep up the strength to the extent he had promised, he ought to have taken the people into his confidence, and asked whether they were prepared to supply the numbers. Instead of that, however, he placed the referendum proposal before us, although Australia had, up to that time, done as much as the rest of the Dominions put toI f we can wipe out the gether. We were asked to take the exby another treme step, although the people had up to then acted most willingly.

But what happened in connection w it h the Forces sent into camp under the proclamation ? People on that occasion had a dose of what they are likely to get under a system of conscription. who had willingly yielded their sons were further bled, and -those who had escaped in the first place escaped again. In this State, as in every other State, the people with influence had their sons exempted on all sorts of flimsy pretexts. Only sons were not required to go into camp at all, even for home service. The conscription law was not a measure to recruit those who attended race-courses and picture shows, as had been said, but to make further demands on those who Had already given all they could afford of their manhood. W h y were only sons exempted? Wasi t fair to widows who had previously surrendered their only sons . that others who had made no such sacrifices should be screened by the proposed compulsory law ? In the main those people who have only one son belong to the wealthy and idle classes, and the son, as a general rule, is a waster to whom military training would do much good. If conscription was to produce the recruits which were necessary because of the Empire's dire straits, why should anybody be allowed to have a conscience in regard to compulsory service? Why was that conscience clause inserted ?

Yet we hear cheap taunts hurled at the workers. porting the Industrial Workers of the World1 in that strike were not Industrial Workers of the World. In the Defence Department to-day there are a number of men who have been wearing khaki ever since the war began. They hold various ranks, from lieutenant down to private, and are receiving as much as 26s. a day from the' taxpayers. But they show no desire to go to the war. Why does not the Defence Department organize internally, and ask these men why, if they intend to remain in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, they do not go to the front. a Labour Minister. party's Minister at the present time.

I am of opinion that by this time there are sufficient returned soldiers, with experience of modern warfare, to carry out all the work of the Defence Department. WhilstI conscientiously believe that the responsibility for the unsatisfactory recruiting toby a German victory than Australia has, day lies at the doors of those who divided the people on the conscription issue, I do not agree with those who say they will not engage in the recruiting campaign. From the beginning I have held that this was a just war, as much the fight of Australia as of Great Britain and her Allies, and although I differed from the methods proposed by other honourable members who advocated conscription, that will not prevent me, and should not prevent other honourable members, from endeavouring to fulfil the promises we have made, and meet our obligations until the war is over. I firmly believe that if Australia is appealed to in the proper way we shall get the recruits required from time to time. way? not been appealed to, but insulted. I have no wish to make comparisons for the sake of making it appear that Australia has done better than any other country, but I remember the Leader of the Liberal party stating some time ago that Canada should be our example, and that the Dominion at that time had 300,000 men at the front. Canada recently I made inquiries of Sir George Foster, a member of the Dominion Cabinet, and he stated that 300,000 men had been recruited, but that only 150,000 were at the fron t and i Great Britain. A t that time Australia had 200,000 men at the front and in Great Britain. costs Canada only £ 4 per head to send troops to Europe, as against £ 1 4 per head from Australia, it will be seen that if Canada had three times as many men at the fron t as Australia had, Canada would not be doing more than the Commonwealth. in the manufacture of munitions ? munition factories there, and I say, to they have made hundreds of thousands of pounds out of this war, whereas Australia's participation in it has been a dead loss. making money out of it , too. because it is protected by the Monroe doctrine. the Canadian people doing their duty to the Empire?

I have-only referred to Canada's contribution because of the fact that the Dominion's example was held up to Australia as one to be followed. If we had taken Canada as an example, as the Leader of the Liberal party suggested, instead of increasing our contributions we should have decreased them.

Furthermore, no sooner had munition making started than the order came to stop everything. Over £500,000was thus wasted. The Government were in possession of knowledge regarding the making of shells, and yet the military people engineered a Commission to visit India to report on the subject, and I challenge Ministers to say that that report gave any more information than we had already. It was unfair to those connected with engineering to get them to spend money as they did. They were going to give the shells to the Government at their bare cost. Persons who wished ' to help their country in this great struggle were thus penalized. In conclusion, I deprecate the bickering that has occurred during the debate, and throughout the whole of the present unfortunate business. We are still in the war, and we must fulfil our promise to see it brought to a successful conclusion. I sometimes feel that we are fiddling while Rome is burning.

I re-echo the concluding words of the honourable member for Newcastle, and express deep regret that at a time like this honourable members consider it either necessary or expedient to continue personal hostilities, which might well be suspended during tlie present great national crisis. As I am one of the oldest members of the House, I trust that honourable members generally will not consider that I am unduly lecturing them. It is because I earnestly desire that the people of Australia, and its Parliament especially, shall give the best and immediate attention to the part that we ought to play in this great contest that I advocate the cessation of personal interchanges which, although they may sometimes relieve the monotony of public life, might well be relegated to obscurity at the present time. I give all honourable members credit for desiring the successful termination of the' war, but I put it to the Committee in the strongest terms that we are not all doing all that lies in our power to insure that. Honourable members are not exercising that mutual forbearance and self-sacrifice which they ask others to exercise if they will not abate one jot or tittle of what they consider to be their personal rights. I regard the financial statement of the Treasurer as one of the It marks an epoch in our financial history which I venture to say will often be ' referred to by those who come after us. During the past three years there has been what the Treasurer Ihas called a financial revel, but what I call a financial debauch, such as the country has never previously experienced. Extravagance has not been limited to Parliaments, it has been indulged in by the people themplete failure to realize the source whence our money is derived, and the inevitable results of dissipating it in the manner which is being followed. The statement of the Treasurer discloses in lurid fashion the absolute necessity for, not only national, but also personal economy. The State Governments as well as the Comfor unwarrantable extravagance. But the people themselves are materially hastening the advent of the evil day. A t this period of the year it has been the custom of people to spend money extravangantly to outvie their neighbours during the great racing carnival, and when the weather has been inclement the newspapers have been filled with complaints about the loss of business experienced by drapers and clothiers generally.

I challenge any one to say that the Industrial Workers of the World we have German spies in our midst; but we do not say that the people are in sympathy with them. When we discover a German spy, we intern him. I accuse the head of this Government, however, of having allowed rich Germans to go free, although tbey have not been naturalized, while he has caused the arrest of poor Germans who have married Australian women and have boys and girls born in Australia. To say that the Labour party is in association with the Industrial Workers of the World is to display a want of common sense. It would he just as reasonable for me to accuse all members of the Liberal party of believing in reducing the pay of old-age pensioners because the honourable member for Flinders, when Premier of Victoria, robbed the old men and women. member must withdraw that remark. honourable member is certainly not a robber, and I will withdraw the expression. When he was Premier of Victoria, he reduced the old-age pensioners' allowance. They were receiving only 5s., 6s., or 7s. a week, and their children were required to go into the witness-box in order that it might be ascertained whether they could not contribute Is. or Is. 6d. a week towards their support. As I have said before, I would die like a dog in the gutter rather than see my boy or girl placed in the witness-box for such a purpose. The Victorian old-age pension system was costing £238,000 a year, and the honourable member for Flinders, who was then Premier of this State, thought that was too much to spend on feeding the aged-poor. He, therefore, reduced the amount to £150,000 a year, thus taking the bread out of the mouths of the old-age pensioners. But because he did that, would it be fair for me to accuse every member of fche Liberal party of being in sympathy with such action ? By the way, where are the members of the Liberal party ? The honourable member for Lang, with whose speech this morning I was more in sympathy than was any other honourable member on this side of the House, is the only representative of that party now present. It would be just as fair to accuse every member of the Liberal party of being prepared to grind down the old-age pensioners because of the action of the honourable member for Flinders as it is to accuse us of adopting the tactics of the Industrial Workers of the World. I might just as well accuse the Liberal party of believing in perjury and conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice because of what happened in connection with the Ronald-Harper case. Practically every witness against fche Rev. J. B. Ronald was gaoled for conspiracy or perjury. Yet Mr Robert Harper, against whom he proceeded, still goes upon the platform in support of conscription. Three Judges of this State -to their honour be it said-urge d that the law ought to be amended so as .to enable justice to be done to Mr Ronald. I do not accuse the Liberal party of having any sympathy with the injustice that was done to Mr Ronald, but I do condemn fche Liberals in fche State Parliament for failing to amend the law which three Justices of the Supreme Court said should be altered so that an unfortunate minister of rehgion might obtain justice The from Mr Harper. Mr Harper supports conscription. But would it not be unfair for me to accuse those who supported fche ""Yes"" campaign, and who are never tired of hurling at us insinuations with regard to the Industrial Workers of the World, of being fit companions of those who commit perjury and engage in conspiracies ? Some people say that we should speak only good of the dead. I believe the Almighty would say, "" Speak of the dead, if you will, but speak the truth."" I challenged a Victorian Ministry which sat in this very House with having allowed the late Silas Harding to escape imprisonment. The Attorney-General of that day had to own that he had been found guilty of perjury right up to the Supreme Court, but he did not die in gaol. He was not sent to gaol. He was a rich man. Would it be fair fco sayfchafcfcheLiberals, who kept that man out of gaol, all approved of perjury ? No. It would be just as unfair as it is for the Liberals to accuse the official Labour party of being the allies of the Industrial Workers of the World. I do not wish to hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Balaclava, since the honourable member for Capricornia has already been severe, and justly severe, in his criticism of him. The honourable member, who was for many years Premier of Victoria, deprived 100,000 men and women in this State of their right to vote. The Minister for the Navy did good work in Tasmania when he held ofiice for a few days in a State Administration. Aged men and women, and poor, unfortunate children there, have cause fco",36,Maloney Th E Patient Is The Monwealth Government Are Blameworthy

Mr Prendergast, when holding the office of Chief Secretary for a few brief days in this State, wrote a seized the mines, It would have been far minute to the effect that the name of every man and woman who was entitled to be on the rolls should be at once enrolled. miners desired to have an eight-hours That minute resulted in Victoria having 100,000 additional voters. It increased by 1,000 the number of electors in the Flemington and Essendon electorate who had been deprived of their vote. The honourable member for Capricornia will be glad to learn that that, possibly, was renot compel them to open their mines, or sponsible for Mr Watt leaving that electorate and going to Balaclava. The honourable member who preceded me could have told us, had he chosen, of a very interesting episode that is well known in Masonic circles. I shall leave it for him to put before the Committee on some other occasion. Then, again, the right honourable member for Swan was responsible for the most iniquitous law ever passed in Australiaa law under which the age of consent was reduced from fourteen years to twelve years. It would be just as reasoncreated riots he would shoot them down able for members of the Labour party to accuse the Liberal party of approving of that amendment of the law because it was brought in by the right honourable member for Swan as it is for them to accuse us of being in alliance with the Industrial Workers of the World. A child of twelve would not know how to' give consent, yet the right honourable member, when Premier of Western Australia, brought in that infamous amendment of the law. If there is going to be any mud-slinging, I shall refer to Hansard for records of those gentlemen who are always yelping about the Industrial Workers' of the World. I am sorry that the honourable members to whom I refer are absent, but I would say the same thing in their presence. I was very glad to hear from the Government that the wheels of industry will soon be in motion again. ""If they are not, I shall appeal to the citizens of Australia as to whether it is not time we took over the industry from the "" coal barons."" In the past the barons, with their armed retainers, could rob every passer-by, and the coal barons are quite as bad. It is preposterous that we should have to wait until 1916 before these miners should have the right of an eighthours day. Anybody who knows about mining would rather accept half the pay on the surface than go below, and the danger commences directly the cage begins to go down. If the Government had gone a little further than they did, and better for the country. A t one time in Victoria, when the Ballarat and Bendigo day, and the mine-owners refused, Mr Francis Longmore, who was a State Minister at the time, was asked to grant an exemption of the working conditions of the leases. The reply of Mr Longmore to the owners was that, though he could to give the men an eight-hour day, he could, and would, compel them to keep the labour conditions, or forfeit the leases. This, of course, finished the strike, and the men got what they desired. In Germany, when there was a strike for a ten-hours day and 18s. a week, the Emperor, after there had been some little disturbances, owing to the masters' refusal to meet the men, told the latter that if they kept the peace he would see justice done, while if they like dogs. On the other hand, he told the owners that if they did not appoint representatives to meet the men within twenty-four hours, he would do it for them. The result was that the representatives were appointed, and in forty-eight hours the strike was decided in favour of the men. Further, these German mines were nationalized, and there has never been any industrial trouble there since. Another instance was afforded when Mr Roosevelt, as President, told the mine owners that if they did not keep the mines going, he himself would work them at their risk; and there is a still further example in the more recent action of President Wilson, which undoubtedly caused his re-election. Before concluding, I should like to say a word about the case of Gunner Perry, that poor wretched soldier who volunteered and suffered so much subsequently. Honourable members will be glad to know that that man has received an honourable discharge, and not only a pension for himself, but one for his wife. If the then Government had acceded to the request of the Leader of the Opposition, and sent one of the three Ministers to see this man, the country would have been saved £2,000, the cost of the inquiry. I accuse Senator Pearce of having involved the country in that amount in trying to rob this man of his pension, although that man was ,one of five brothers who had all volunteered. I may say that two of the brothers have been killed, one severely wounded, and. another missing, leaving only Gunner Perry with his honourable discharge and pension. I do not know what the sensations of the doctors must be who gave evidence that this man was a malingerer. I do know, however, that Dr. Cuscaden is the least qualified of any medical man who is under him in the Army, and I dare him to say that, at the Melbourne Hospital or the Alfred Hospital, he would be allowed to practise either a3 an in-patient or an out-patient surgeon. that Dr. Cuscaden is a woman's doctor, and it is ""an a'bsurdity to have him in his present position. We all remember how it was sworn by Senator Pearoe, at the Perry inquiry, that the fence was over 7 feet high, and how that statement was afterwards disproved, the fence, as a matter of fact, being only 4 ft. 6 in. I asked Senator Pearce to nominate any two men of the Labour party, in order that there might be a proper investigation of the facts connected with this case, but he refused; and we know how he dragged the honest name of Mr Pisher into the case. If there is any more of this Industrial Workers of the World business, unless it is given by the Book, I shall quote more of these cases, not only here, but outside. If the members of the Industrial Workers of the World have committed arson, that is a crime sufficiently serious to judge them on without the Prime Minister and his satellites yelling out about them while they were on their trial. The1 men have been tried by a Judge. If he gave a wrong decision, it is a question between him, his conscience, and his Creator, and his conscience will never let him rest. If he gave a just decision, and the men were guilty of trying to burn down buildings with danger to human life, there is not one man in our party who would deny that the sentence"" was deserved. I am about full up of this Industrial Workers of the World business. The Prime Minister is the leader of what will be known as the ""Devil's Ministry,"" because there are only thirteen in the party, and no Whip ever had as easy a time as the present Whip has in looking after three men. If the Prime Minister wants to earn the respect he has Dr. lost among those who knew him best, he can do good now by seizing and nationalizing the coal mines, instead of letting the coal lords run them. Also, is he man enough to let us know how the soldiers voted at the front? Is he man enough to lay the papers pertaining to the purchase of the Commonwealth steamers on the table? Will he state if any commission was given, and, if so, to whom? I do not accuse the Prime Minister himself of being concerned, but he is in such a terribly suspicious position Uiat it is time 'the public knew the facts. 1 would urge him for his own sake to give up that superlative cunning which he has The fact is been showing. Every body of men, from his Cabinet and his Caucus down, tu whom he told all these secrets, turned him down, and if the public outside had. Only known the truth, and been given fair play, they would have turned him down even more severely than they did. If the soldiers had given a thumping majority for the slavery of conscription the fact would have been heralded throughout the land. The Prime Minister refused to let us have scrutineers to check the vote. When I asked him if he would cable to the Labour party in England to appoint scrutineers to act for our Labour party in England, and where possible, at the front, he was not ""taking any."" I am informed < that the executive of the Labour party here tried to cable the request at their own expense, but that the cable was not allowed to go. That is fishy and suspicious. If the Prime Minister wants to save the remnants of his political honour he must let us know how the troops voted. Are they degraded beings fit only to be put in gaol that he will not. allow the people to know how they voted ? I accuse the Prime Minister of suppressing the truth in that case. With all his tricks, he is after all in the position of the iox in the fable, which, lacking the one trick of the cat that could climb a tree, fell a victim to the dogs. Amendment negatived.
